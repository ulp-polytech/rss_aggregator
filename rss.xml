In dc&#8211;dc converters, electrolytic capacitors (ECs) are often used as smoothening filters, despite their vulnerability and unreliable operation. Also, the multipeak PV characteristic caused by PSCs is one of the prime challenges in efficient solar PV integration. To avoid these issues, an isolated EC-less dual half-active bridge resonant converter (DHABRC) is proposed and integrated with solar panels using a PSO-based MPPT algorithm for efficient power transfer under PSCs. The DHABRC utilizes two half-active bridges to reduce the switch count and replaces the ECs with film capacitors (FCs). So the converter becomes simple, easy to control, reliable, and economical. For soft-switching and steady-state analysis of the DHABRC, fundamental approximation analysis is used. For the validation of the proof of concept, a 500-W scaled-down laboratory prototype is developed and tested under steady-state and PSCs using shading patterns (SPs) of different voltage and power ratings. Also, the feasibility of using FCs is proved using different tests like startup transient, load dynamics, and changes in SPs.</description></item><item><title>Unified One-Cycle Control for Fully Digitalized ZVS Four-Switch Buck&#8211;Boost Converter During Bidirectional Power Flow Transition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10538435</link><description>A unified one-cycle control is presented to achieve bidirectional power flow operation for a four-switch buck&#8211;boost converter employing fully digitalized control. There is no need for analog comparators or digital-to-analog converters. Based on the new definition of operating modes, modulation can be unified in both the directional operations. One-cycle bidirectional power transition with fully zero-voltage switching (ZVS) can be achieved under various voltage conversion gains. A modified control curve of inductor current is proposed to eliminate the power oscillation during operation, and ZVS can be ensured during the transition. A 450-W prototype using the proposed fully digital control under bidirectional power flow operation is verified successfully.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Matrix Based Network for Multi-Module Parallel Megahertz Inverter System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10540377</link><description>As key subsystem of the semiconductor etching system, the multimodule megahertz inverter needs to modulate power through load differences efficiently and accurately, however, losses of resonant inverter modules are reduced only within narrow load range. The existing inverters often fail to mathematically resolve the conflict between power range and efficiency range. This article proposes a method that balances efficiencies and power range for multimodule parallel systems. The essence lies in mathematically designing load trajectories for each module that covers wide power range within efficiency boundaries through a three-matrix passive network. A two-inverters paralleled system is designed with load-sensitive class D inverter modules as an example. Through passive network, the ideal load trajectory is guaranteed. Two 40&#8201;V input, 13.56&#8201;MHz prototypes are built and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method offers various way of designing network, and both networks are able to control the effective impedance trajectory of modules within the desired range. Therefore, the inverter operates with efficiencies above 60% with power varying from 10&#8201;W to 100&#8201;W.</description></item><item><title>A Systematic Method for Studying the Use of DC/DC Converters With Three Discontinuous Conduction Modes as Automatic PFCs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10540317</link><description>This article describes a general method for studying the behavior of converters with three discontinuous conduction modes as automatic power factor correctors (PFCs). Some converters with a single discontinuous conduction mode (such as Buck-Boost, Flyback, SEPIC, &#262;uk, and Zeta converters) can behave as automatic PFCs when operating in that discontinuous conduction mode, with a nearly constant duty cycle during each cycle of the line voltage. There are also dc/dc converters that, due to multiple diodes and inductors, can operate in different discontinuous conduction modes. A systematic method for studying these three discontinuous conduction modes was recently presented. This article extends that method to using the aforementioned dc/dc converters as part of an ac/dc converter with low harmonic injection in the line, identifying when the converters behave as &#8220;ideal automatic resistor emulators&#8221; (i.e., configuring ideal automatic PFCs) and when they behave as &#8220;quasi-ideal automatic resistor emulators&#8221; (i.e., as quasi-ideal automatic PFCs). As an example, the article examines a SEPIC converter used as a resistor emulator. In this case, three discontinuous conduction modes are possible, if the inductance of the input inductor is low enough to allow the input bridge rectifier diodes to stop conducting when the transistor is off. The study allows us to determine of the line current waveform when the converter operates in any of the possible discontinuous conduction modes. The results show that quasi-ideal automatic PFC behavior can be achieved in discontinuous conduction modes with low inductance values. Moreover, the results for the SEPIC can be easily extended to the &#262;uk converter operating in the same manner. Finally, the theoretical predictions for the line current from the proposed study were verified through simulation using PSIM (in the case of both the SEPIC and &#262;uk topologies), and through experimentation (in the case of SEPIC).</description></item><item><title>A 1500-A/48-V-to-1-V Switching Bus Converter for Next-Generation Ultra-High-Power Processors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10559753</link><description>This article proposes an ultra-high-current 48-V-to-1-V hybrid switched-capacitor (SC) voltage regulator, named the switching bus converter, with a single-stage vertical power delivery architecture for next-generation ultra-high-power processors (e.g., graphics processing units, central processing units, application-specific integrated circuits, etc.). The proposed topology consists of two 2-to-1 SC front-ends and four 10-branch series-capacitor-buck modules, merged through four switching buses. Compared to the existing dc-bus-based architecture, the proposed switching-bus-based architecture eliminates the need for dc bus capacitors, reduces the switch count, and guarantees complete soft-charging operation. Through a topological comparison, this article reveals that the proposed topology achieves the lowest normalized switch stress and the smallest normalized passive component volume among existing 48-V-to-1-V hybrid SC demonstrations, showing great potential for both higher efficiency and higher power density than prior hybrid SC solutions. A hardware prototype was designed and built with custom four-phase coupled inductors and gate drive daughterboards to validate the functionality and performance of the proposed switching bus converter. It was tested up to 1500-A output current and achieved 92.7% peak system efficiency, 85.7% full-load system efficiency (including gate drive loss), and 759 W/in$^{3}$ power density (by box volume), pushing the performance limit of the state-of-the-art 48-V-to-1-V solutions toward higher efficiency and higher power density.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Comparison of Integrated Planar Transformers for 22-kW On-Board Chargers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10551535</link><description>The surge in electric vehicle technology has brought attention to the manufacturing and design of 22-kW on-board chargers using printed circuit boards (PCBs), owing to their manufacturability and compact nature. However, designing transformers for these applications is challenging due to the demands of higher power and a smaller profile. The challenges include achieving optimal current distribution in parallel windings and easier transformer structure with better thermal performance. In addition, the integration of resonant inductance is crucial for regulatory functions and higher power densities. The integration with parallel windings also impacts the overall transformer performance, which needs to be analyzed. This article presents a detailed analysis and design approach for a 22-kW PCB-based transformer with good current sharing, controllable leakage inductance, and a simplified core structure. The study also includes an in-depth analysis of the transformer's flux distribution to minimize core loss. A 22-kW CLLC resonant converter is developed to validate the proposed transformer using PCB-packaged devices. With its modified flux distribution and good current sharing, the integrated transformer enables the converter to achieve a power density of 11.6 kW/L and a peak efficiency of 98.5%.</description></item><item><title>Dual Discontinuous PWM-Based Power Distribution Control of Multisource Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10535742</link><description>The multisource inverter (MSI) is a promising topology for hybrid electric vehicles due to its advanced merits of single-stage power conversion from each source to the motor without dc&#8211;dc converters. However, it is challenging to design a modulation scheme for the MSI since it not only determines the output voltage on the ac side, but also the power distribution between the sources on the dc side. Furthermore, the computation burden for the MSI is heavy due to its unsymmetrical distributed voltage vectors. Given this, this article proposes a dual discontinuous pulsewidth modulation (D$^{2}$PWM) scheme to simultaneously realize power distribution and motor drive control for the MSI. In the proposed D$^{2}$PWM, the MSI is decomposed into two independent subinverters, and modulation schemes of each subinverter can be implemented in symmetric space-vector diagrams, which avoids heavy computational burden under the unsymmetrical voltage vector diagram. Besides, the total switching times of 3 in the proposed D$^{2}$PWM are realized by assigning the desired voltage vector for one of the subinverters aligned with the basic voltage vectors, which reduces the switching losses in this decomposed model and improves the current quality of the MSI. Comparative experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed D$^{2}$PWM.</description></item><item><title>Boost-Based Active Power Decoupling Converter With Voltage Complementary for Electrolytic Capacitor-Less PMSM Drive System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10552370</link><description>A new boost-based active power decoupling circuit (APDC) with voltage complementary is proposed for electrolytic capacitor-less (ECL) permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive systems. To increase the dc-link voltage level of the drive system, the decoupling capacitor of the APDC and the output capacitor of a boost converter are connected in series. Then, the decoupling capacitor and the boost output capacitor are complementarily controlled by the APDC to suppress the dc-link voltage ripple effectively. The capacitance and operation voltage of the two capacitors are diverse, improving the drive system's robustness to capacitance. By using this APDC, the speed range of ECL drive systems can be increased and good performance of PMSMs under stable and dynamic operation conditions can be implemented due to small dc-link voltage ripple. Finally, the experiments with the ECL drive system are accomplished to verify the feasibility.</description></item><item><title>Fast Efficiency Optimization Control Based on Orthogonal Current Phasor Model for Linear Oscillatory Motor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10554285</link><description>As the key power part of the linear compressor, the linear oscillatory motor (LOM) has been paid more attention by both academia and industry recently for its compact size, high efficiency, low vibration, etc. In practice, the efficiency of LOM is significantly impacted by the changes in load parameters, of which the best working point can be tracked by the resonant frequency tracking control (RFTC). However, the traditional RFTC with the idea of stroke-current phase suffers some problems, such as slow tracking speed, low accuracy, fluctuate amplitude of piston, and so on. In this article, a novel fast efficiency optimization control algorithm based on the orthogonal current phasor model is proposed for LOM. This new model can achieve the decoupling of current components that act on piston stroke and system efficiency, respectively. Moreover, the driving frequency can be adjusted by current decoupling control with a designed phase-locked loop. Based on the aforementioned, the decoupling control of the LOM drive system can be achieved, which can simultaneously improve the system response speed and the output efficiency. Comprehensive simulation and experimental results have fully demonstrated the advantages of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Minimal Power Loss Control for Doubly Salient Electromagnetic Machine Based on Optimal Currents Distribution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10566038</link><description>The traditional doubly salient electromagnetic machine (DSEM) system sets the field current to the rated value regardless of speed or load torque conditions, bringing in large power losses, especially under less rated power conditions. To overcome this shortcoming, this article proposes a minimal power loss control for DSEM based on optimal current distribution. First, based on the power loss calculation model, the quantified relationships between the power loss and field current are obtained under certain speed and load torque conditions. Then, to minimize the power loss, a distribution strategy of field current and armature current is put forward, the command value of field current is achieved according to system operating conditions, and an easy-implemented torque observer with high accuracy is designed for identifying the load torque, in which the magnetic saturation is taken into consideration. Further, to obtain the optimal field current value more easily rather than looking up the large memory-consumed 3-D table or directly solving the sixth-order equation, the current distribution strategies based on an ergodic algorithm and a back propagation (BP) neural network algorithm are proposed, which achieve online calculation of the optimal current and their performances are comparatively explored. With the decreased field current, less power loss as well as smaller cogging torque ripples are desired to be achieved. The simulation and experiments verify the correctness and feasibility of the proposed strategies under multiple operating conditions.</description></item><item><title>Design Optimization of Dual Active Bridge Converter for Supercapacitor Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10530382</link><description>Supercapacitor (SC) is an energy storage suitable for meeting short-term requirements in power conversion systems. However, the low and variable terminal voltage of SC-based energy storage poses challenges to the design of its power electronic interface (PEI) to achieve a high round-trip efficiency and a rapid response of the energy storage system. The PEI design methodologies existing in the literature do not clearly tackle the mitigation of switching and conduction losses over the entire operating range of the SC. This article proposes a design strategy for an SC-interface dual active bridge (DAB) converter. The terminal characteristics of the SC are incorporated into an analytical design formulation aiming to maximize the DAB efficiency over the SC discharging cycle. The resulting optimization problem, addressing both conduction and switching losses, is solved numerically to obtain the optimal circuit parameters. The realization of the design objectives and the obtained efficiency is validated in circuit simulation and experiments on a 250 W laboratory prototype with a 125 V dc bus and a nominal SC voltage of 37.5 V, illustrating the improvement achieved over the conventional design approach.</description></item><item><title>Suppression of AC Coupling Effects on HVdc Transmission System Based on MMC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10538426</link><description>As the number of dc transmission systems increases, more dc lines are constructed in close proximity to existing ac transmission lines.

By applying the proposed controller, the MMC-HVdc system can operate without any interference from the ac coupling effect. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated through both full-scale simulation and scaled experimental studies.</description></item><item><title>Double Normalization Fault Diagnosis Method for Open-Circuit Faults of PMSM Drives</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10538057</link><description>In this article, a double normalization fault diagnosis (DNFD) method is proposed to cope with open-circuit faults of permanent magnet synchronous motor drives. The proposed DNFD method consists of a current normalizer, a time-domain fault variable determinator, a time-domain to angle-domain converter, an angle normalizer, and a fault identification encoder. The affections of the variable torque can be eliminated by the current normalizer, whereas the affections of the variable speed can be eliminated by the angle normalizer, which is the main contribution of this article. To reduce the affections of the following factors, i.e., the calculation error of the time-domain to angle-domain converter, the measurement noises of current sensors, the performance of the analog-to-digital converter, the sampling frequency, and the electromagnetic interference of the system, the hysteresis comparator is employed, in which two fault thresholds are required. Compared with the conventional single normalization fault diagnosis method, the DNFD method has better robustness. The effectiveness of the proposed DNFD method is verified by the experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Parameter Design for Suppressing Current Distortion Caused by DC Bias in Dual-Active-Bridge Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10547319</link><description>The dual-active-bridge (DAB) converter has been widely used, but the current distortion caused by dc bias has not been well addressed due to the high/medium switching frequency. A conventional DAB converter utilizes an auxiliary inductor to enhance efficiency in normal operation, with the auxiliary inductor typically connected to the primary side of the DAB transformer. However, replacing the original auxiliary inductor with distributed auxiliary inductors, one connected to the primary side and the other connected to the secondary side, can help alleviate current distortion when the magnetic core is saturated without influence on the DAB converter during normal operation. In this article, a numerical calculation method is introduced to simultaneously calculate both the induced voltage and the excitation current of the DAB converter under dc bias. Based on the calculation results, a data fitting-based formula for optimizing the inductance distribution is proposed. The rationale behind the proposed formula is elucidated using mathematical methods. The accuracy of the numerical calculation process is verified by simulation results. The effectiveness of the proposed formula is validated through numerical, simulation, and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Challenges and Implementation of Online In Situ RDSON Measurement in a Three-Phase Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10551638</link><description>This article addresses the critical issue of real-time monitoring of on-state resistance (RDSON) of all power semiconductor devices within a three-phase inverter.

This article presents an on-chip condition monitoring (CM) approach addressing these challenges by seamlessly integrating device aging prognosis and dielectric failure detection into a unified circuit platform. Specifically, leveraging the device turn-on transient time (ton) as a reliable aging precursor, we propose a closed-loop ton sensing scheme with self-regulated sampling to enhance precursor readout accuracy while mitigating sensing delays. Furthermore, we improve CM accuracy through junction temperature (TJ) calibration, effectively eliminating temperature-induced effects on precursor measurements. Concurrently, we develop a gate leakage current (IGSS) based sensing scheme for dielectric failure detection, sharing the same circuitry of TJ calibration. Leveraging a proposed reconfigurable tri-mode gate driver, this CM approach minimizes impact on normal system operation. A power IC prototype was implemented on a 180-nm BCD process. Demonstrated on a GaN half-bridge power converter, the proposed CM exhibits the precise detection of both device aging and dielectric failure.</description></item><item><title>The Effect of Bearing Impedance on Online Condition Monitoring for Rotor Winding Insulation of Doubly-Fed Induction Generator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10561613</link><description>Doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs) play a vital role in wind power generation, yet their rotor winding insulation is susceptible to failure due to high dv/dt voltage from rotor-side converters and mechanical stress under varying operating conditions. While existing methods primarily focus on fault diagnosis, capable of detecting short-circuit faults but lacking in prognostic capabilities, this article delves into the development of an online condition monitoring method based on common-mode leakage current measurement. The study begins with an introduction to the model and measurement technique for winding insulation, followed by an analysis of capacitive coupling, which gives a path for high-frequency leakage current in DFIG systems. Furthermore, the article examines the impact of bearing impedance on rotor-side monitoring outcomes through theoretical analysis and simulation. Finally, the proposed method is validated through online experimentation, demonstrating its efficacy in providing real-time condition monitoring not only for rotor winding insulation but also for the state of shaft grounding devices in wind power generation systems.</description></item><item><title>Rotating Restart Method for TPFS Inverter-Fed Sensorless PMSM Drive System Based on Dual Effective Voltage Vectors Injection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10564192</link><description>This article proposes a solution to the challenge of achieving a reliable restart in sensorless permanent magnet synchronous motors transitioning from a three-phase six-switch inverter to a three-phase four-switch (TPFS) inverter due to faults. The proposed rotating restart method employs the injection of dual effective voltage vectors to synthesize the equivalent zero-voltage vector, under unbalanced capacitor voltage conditions in the TPFS inverter. This synthesis is achieved by incorporating the capacitor voltage offset into the duration calculation of the dual effective voltage vectors. Once the main power supply is restored, the dual effective voltage vectors are injected into the motor windings through the TPFS inverter, producing the short-circuit current influenced by the back electromotive force. The method utilizes the accumulated short-circuit current values to estimate the initial rotor position and speed, enabling a smooth and efficient rotating restart. This innovative method enhances the accuracy of rotor position and speed detection, reduces impulse current, and ensures the fault-tolerant operation of the system. The theoretical analysis is validated through experimental results, demonstrating the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Modeling Method for the Real-Time Simulation of Bridge-Based High-Switching-Frequency Power Electronic Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10533852</link><description>The $R_{\text{on}}/R_{\text{off}}$ model provides high accuracy in the real-time simulation of high-switching-frequency power electronic converters. However, the iterative operations limit the application of the $R_{\text{on}}/R_{\text{off}}$ model in high-switching-frequency domains. This article presents a novel noniterative method for determining the switch statuses of half-bridge arms. By predicting the state variables and correcting the switch status combinations in the natural commutation process with the status switching principle, the accurate switch status can be obtained. Besides, this method adopts the backward Euler method to ensure the system stability and realizes the decoupling among the half-bridge arms, which greatly reduces the modeling complexity and calculation amount when judging the switch status. Finally, an ac&#8211;dc&#8211;ac topology with 100-kHz switching frequency and an $LLC$ resonant converter with 250-kHz switching frequency are implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The parallel solving architecture enables simulation time step as low as 25 ns. The results derived from the real-time simulation and hardware experiment corroborate low FPGA resource consumption and high precision of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>An Improved Coordination Control for Enhancing Photovoltaic Power Imbalance Tolerant Capability of MMC-Based Photovoltaic System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10538210</link><description>The internal reactive power compensation strategy (IRPCS) and harmonic compensation strategy (HCS) can be used in modular multilevel converter&#8211;based photovoltaic systems (MMC-PVSs) for PV power imbalance, but have requirements of extending tolerant capability and degrading internal reactive power at severe imbalance, and have the problem of overmodulation occurring on normal submodules (SMs). This article first merges IRPCS and HCS (IRPCS-HCS) to, to some extent, extend the tolerant capability and reduce the internal reactive power. Subsequently, a dual loop control and a reactive power distribution method are proposed for further optimization. The outer loop eliminates overmodulation on normal SMs via regulating the modulation index upper boundary to realize normal SM full compensation of injected harmonics of overmodulation SMs. To further expand the tolerant capability with the least amount of internal reactive power, the inner loop makes the SM maximum modulation index closely track the upper boundary to prevent overcompensation of internal reactive power, and the reactive power distribution method optimally allocates the reactive power to SMs. Finally, simulation and experimental results are illustrated to verify the feasibility of the proposed control.</description></item><item><title>Mechanism Analysis and Elimination of Multiple Pulse Phenomenon of Active Rectifier in Wireless Power Transfer Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10533858</link><description>Active rectifier is widely used in wireless power transfer systems. On/off delay-compensation technique is commonly used to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of rectifier. However, it also introduces multiple pulse (MP) problem, which could greatly reduce the efficiency and significantly impacts the reliability of system. In this work, the mechanism of MP is comprehensively analyzed and two elimination methods are indicated and compared. The critical circuit parameter is analyzed. To implement the method, an active rectifier with dual-edge D-latch (DEDL) is proposed. The advantage of the DEDL is that the output of comparator can be latched up to achieve an adjustable delay time at both rising and falling edges. As the result, the MP at the output of the comparator will not affect the gate of the power metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor. The rectifier is fabricated with a standard 0.18 &#956;m complementary metal oxide semiconductor process. The core area of chip is 0.268 mm2. The maximum output power of rectifier is 40 mW. The PCE is higher than 90% when Vac = 2 V and 51 &#937;&lt;300 &#937;. The peak PCE is 93.3% when Vac = 2 V and RL = 100 &#937;. Measurement results show the effectiveness of the proposed elimination method, and also prove that the theoretical analysis of MP is correct.</description></item><item><title>Optimizing Power Transfer Efficiency in Biomedical Implants: A Comparative Analysis of SS and SP Inductive Link Topologies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10533450</link><description>Inductive link intended to deliver energy to implantable devices is recently becoming a popular method. To improve link efficiency, the compensated capacitors are adopted to resonate at the same frequency with the power transfer frequency on both sides. However, there is limited research on link efficiency and output power concerning quality factors, the selection between serial&#8211;parallel (SP) and serial&#8211;serial (SS) topologies, as well as coil design. This study delves into the efficiency of SP and SS topologies using rigorous mathematical derivations with reflected impedance models in terms of quality factors. It introduces a selection factor to help choose topology based on link efficiency. Results show that SS is better when the load quality factor ($Q_{L}$) is lower than the selection factor, and vice versa. The study also examines the performance limits of both topologies concerning frequency, inductance, and load impedance. It proposes a specific $Q_{L}$ for maximum efficiency and a coil design procedure considering specific absorption rate limitations. By leveraging simulations and the design procedure, the study manufactures a pair of flexible coils for biomedical use. The designed link achieves a 62.99% efficiency under a 500 $\Omega$ load, with an overall efficiency of 46.96% including a passive rectifier.</description></item><item><title>Selected-Interharmonic-Injected Pulse Density Modulation for One-to-Many WPT Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10533863</link><description>Multifrequency one-to-many wireless power transfer (O2M-WPT) is advantageous for charging various medium- and small-power loads, offering cost-effectiveness, simplicity, and minimal cross-coupling effects. However, inevitable hard switching caused by the multifrequency modulation method may lead to significant switching losses. To reduce the switching losses, a novel selected-interharmonic-injected pulse density modulation (SI2PDM) method for simultaneous O2M-WPT systems is proposed in this article. SI2PDM actively injects the selected interharmonics into the primary coil for multifrequency modulation. Besides, SI2PDM artfully regulates the interharmonic by choosing the optimal sequence from the sequences with the same pulse density to achieve independent power allocation. Most importantly, the switching frequency is reduced below the maximum operating frequency, which is beneficial for reducing switching losses and improving efficiency. Comparative experimental results between SI2PDM and an existing method reveal a remarkable 18.58% to 82.83% reduction in inverter power losses and a substantial 1.23% to 20.27% improvement in dc-to-load efficiency. These results affirm the feasibility and effectiveness of SI2PDM in achieving independent power allocation and enhancing efficiency in simultaneous O2M-WPT systems.</description></item><item><title>A Family of Self-Adaptive Interoperable Receivers Based on Multiple Decoupled Receiving Poles for Electric Vehicle Wireless Charging Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10538429</link><description>In electric vehicle wireless power transfer (EVWPT) systems, unipolar (UP), bipolar, and multipolar coils produced by different manufacturers are not well compatible with each other, resulting in the interoperability issues. In order to solve this contradiction, a family of self-adaptive interoperable receivers based on multiple decoupled receiving poles is proposed. Based on the two decoupled poles as the receiving coil, the proposed self-adaptive two-pole interoperable receiver can tolerate both the UP transmitting coil and the bipolar (BP) transmitting coil along one direction. On this basis, it is extended to a self-adaptive four-pole interoperable receiver. The four poles are coplanar and decoupled by using four externally decoupling windings. This self-adaptive four-pole receiver can tolerate the UP transmitting coil, the BP transmitting coil along two directions, and the quadrupole (QP) transmitting coil by forming effective equivalent mutual inductances with them, thus achieving interoperability. Moreover, misalignment tolerance is also realized. The experimental results of the two-pole and four-pole proposals show that efficient power transmission can be achieved with various transmitting coils including the UP, BP, and QP transmitting coils, realizing interoperability and misalignment tolerance.</description></item><item><title>Three-Phase Electrolytic-Capacitor-Less LCC-S WPT System With Wide Operation Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10538428</link><description>In order to improve the integration and life time of ac voltage input wireless power transfer (WPT) system, a topology based on electrolytic-capacitor-less matrix converter with inductor-capacitor-capacitor-series (LCC-S) resonant network is proposed.

To mitigate reactive power and achieve higher efficiency, the proposed OMC method incorporates dual-side hybrid modulation and primary-side switch-controlled-capacitor (SCC) tuning into the triple-phase-shift (TPS) control. First, the impact of hybrid modulation and SCC tuning on the system characteristics is investigated. The inverter and rectifier zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) conditions are then analyzed to achieve dual-side ZVS with minimal reactive power. Furthermore, a multivariable optimization problem is established based on the power loss analysis. The solution to this problem provides optimal control variables that minimize the overall system loss. Through collaborative modulation and control of the inverter, rectifier, and SCC, the proposed method reduces the rms values of the currents and lowers the turn-off currents for the converters. As a result, this approach improves efficiency in both light- and heavy-load conditions, enabling wide output regulation and full-range efficiency optimization simultaneously. Finally, the proposed method is benchmarked with the existing TPS method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher dc-to-dc efficiency in the power range of 0.2&#8211;2.2 kW, with a maximum efficiency improvement of up to 6.3%.</description></item><item><title>A High-Efficiency IPT System With Series-Capacitor Full-Bridge Configuration and Inverse Coupled Current Doubler Rectifier for High-Input, Low-Voltage, and High Output Current Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10557712</link><description>Different from the widely used high-voltage (HV) inductive power transfer (IPT) systems, the low-voltage IPT systems with HV input suffer from the following challenges: the high output current brings high conduction losses in the secondary side, especially at the receiver coil; and the HV conversion ratio, such as 400 V input and 24 V output, results in the difficulties in designing the compensation parameters and loosely coupled transformer. To overcome these issues, a novel IPT topology is proposed in this article by incorporating the series-capacitor full-bridge (SCFB) inverter and inverse coupled current doubler rectifier. Thus, the following three improvements are achieved: first, the voltage stress of three primary switches is reduced to half of the input voltage because of the special series capacitor structure. Second, the inherent one-fourth voltage conversion ratio is achieved and reduced greatly the difficulties in designing the compensation parameters. Third, the current flowing through rectifier circuit is reduced to half of conventional full-bridge rectifier. Furthermore, the LC-LCC compensation is employed for matching the proposed SCFB topology while a novel parameter optimization method is proposed to improve the conversion efficiency. To demonstrate the claimed features of the proposed solution, a 1.2 kW IPT prototype with 400 V input, constant voltage 24 V output is built and tested. The measured efficiency curve indicates that the efficiency from 8 to 50 A load keeps above 94.5% and peaks at 96.63%.</description></item><item><title>Identification and Control of LCC-S WPT Systems Using a Linear Parameter Varying Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10559452</link><description>In this article, the problem of modeling and control of an LCC-S wireless power transfer (WPT) system in the presence of rectifier discontinuous conduction and load variation is considered. The diode bridge in an LCC-S WPT system often enters the discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), due to its unidirectional conductivity property. To better handle this type of nonlinearity, a linear parameter varying (LPV) model, which allows the model parameters to change with respect to a set of chosen dependence variables, is suggested to describe the dynamic behavior of the system. Based on this LPV model, a modified two degrees of freedom internal model control structure is proposed. The proposed control structure can switch between open loop and closed loop: when the system is in DCM, the system is configured as open loop because the load voltage or current is uncontrollable from the primary side, where any control action may impair the control system performance; otherwise, the system is operated in closed loop. Experimental results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling and control method.</description></item><item><title>Precise Modeling of Inductive Wireless Power Transfer With Lossy Magnetic Sheets</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10564574</link><description>Accurately analyzing power losses in inductive wireless power transfer (WPT) including lossy magnetic sheet is challenging, as coils have mutual influences on each other's power dissipation. This article proposes a precise analytic model for inductive WPT with lossy magnetic sheets. Combining a partial element equivalent circuit (PEEC) with a two&#8211;port network, both self&#8211; and mutual-impedances of coupled coils are accurately calculated considering eddy current effects. Furthermore, the proposed PEEC&#8211;based model incorporates the complex permeabilities of lossy magnetic sheets, thus addressing a critical gap in previous studies that have not considered magnetic sheets with losses in their analysis. The suggested model is verified with finite element method (FEM) simulations and measurements. Compared with an FEM simulator, the proposed model calculates impedances about 31 times faster, substantially reducing the number of meshes. Finally, the ohmic and magnetic losses in coil windings and magnetic sheets are investigated with the proposed model, demonstrating that the phase adjustment of currents using the compensation capacitor is effective to reduce the losses caused by eddy currents and lossy magnetic sheets. The proposed model offers more detailed and accurate loss analysis, compared to conventional methods based on circuit analysis.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Misalignment Tolerance in Hybrid Wireless Power Transfer System With Integrated Coupler via Frequency Tuning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10566036</link><description>To enhance the misalignment tolerance and system integration of the wireless power transfer (WPT) system, an integrated coupler consisting of capacitors and coils overlapped coaxially is proposed in this article and integrated into the hybrid WPT (HWPT) system without extra compensation components. The system utilizes the complementary characteristics of different transmission channels to realize the synergistic transfer of different coupled powers under a wide coupling range. Based on the mutual influence between capacitors and coils in terms of electrical parameters in a limited axial projection area and the zero-phase-angle condition considering the mutual capacitance obtained by the fundamental harmonics approximation method, the method of regulating the transfer ratio of the two types of coupled powers is mastered. A method to realize the HWPT with high misalignment tolerance characteristics by frequency tracking is proposed to solve the problem of the system's resonant state being disrupted when the position of the integrated coupler is misaligned. The field-circuit coupling model verifies the feasibility of the analysis and transfer method. Finally, an experimental verification platform for 500 W is built to achieve 82.7% power transfer in the WPT system with 40% unidirectional misalignment.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Electromagnetic Performance Optimization of Double-Layer Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10500893</link><description>Permanent magnet (PM) machines garner significant attention due to their high-power density and high efficiency. As research progresses, high-end motor applications are placing higher and more comprehensive performance demands on PM machines, driving the need for multifaceted and synergistic motor design optimization. In response to this demand, this article proposes a multi-objective optimization design process aimed at improving the overall electromagnetic performance of PM machines.

The optimization process utilizes a meta-model fitted to the numerical model solved by the finite element method, leading to a substantial acceleration of the overall optimization process. Furthermore, an optimization approach is employed to optimize several key structural parameters of a double layer interior PM machine using an evolutionary algorithm. The resulting optimized motor is fabricated and tested, and both numerical simulations and experiments validate that the optimized motor exhibits enhanced torque, low torque ripple, and avoids resonance vibration noise near the rated speed. This comprehensive validation confirms the effectiveness of the structural design and the optimization process.</description></item><item><title>Development of a Compact and Contactless Stage Capable of Levitating/Rotating Wafer Functioning as an Ultrasonically Virtual Hand</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472714</link><description>This article presents a compact and contactless stage capable of levitating/rotating the wafer via hybrid excitation of standing waves (SWs) and traveling waves (TWs). The stage incorporates two concentrically- arranged irradiators, where the inner one sends out powerful SW to accomplish the levitation while the outer one generates the TW whose intensity and direction are modulatable to achieve the rotation. Interestingly, the stage is regarded as an ultrasonically virtual hand with the holding and plucking functions. Initially, the SW- and TW- irradiators&#8217; configurations are designed to tune the resonance frequency of each component and enhance the air pressure. Subsequently, through acousto-structural analysis, the levitation force and propulsion torque are estimated to numerically discuss the acoustic properties of the air gap between the stage and the wafer. Finally, a stage prototype 220 mm in diameter and 390 mm in height is fabricated to assess its performance. At 20.3 kHz working frequency and 400 V voltage, the stage yielded the maximal levitation height of &#8764;1 mm. Meanwhile, the maximal rotation speeds reach 0.15 and 0.16 rad/s in the clockwise and counter-clockwise directions, respectively. These results validate the effectiveness of our proposal and demonstrate the stage's potential for the semi-conductor manufacturing industry.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Voltage-Guaranteed Control of DC/DC-Buck-Converter-Interfaced DC Microgrids With Constant Power Loads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472613</link><description>Bus voltage control is a crucial issue in dc microgrids. Constant power loads (CPLs) exhibit negative incremental impedance characteristics and tend to affect the operation of the microgrid system. To this end, most of the existing methods concentrate on ensuring the steady-state performance of the system while the transient performance is often overlooked. Hence, this article proposes an adaptive voltage-guaranteed controller for the dc/dc buck converter feeding CPLs to enhance both steady-state and transient performances. First, a constrained function is utilized to incorporate the voltage constraint into the modeling of a buck converter. Second, the adaptive update laws are constructed to estimate uncertainties/disturbances for different operation conditions. Finally, the design guideline of the proposed adaptive controller is presented using the backstepping theory. Through the aforementioned design procedures, the proposed controller can keep the bus voltage working within the prespecified range even when large-signal disturbances happen. The stability of the closed-loop system is proved by using the Lyapunov stability theory. Both simulations and experimental studies are conducted to verify the efficacy of the proposed controller.</description></item><item><title>Investigation of Power Cycling Degradation on the Dynamic ON-Resistance of HD-GITs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472623</link><description>As promising candidates for high-performance power system applications, gallium nitride high electron mobility transistors (GaN HEMTs) have received a lot of attention from the market. However, reliability issues, particularly the dynamic on-resistance (dR$_{\text{DS(ON)}}$), also known as the current collapse effect, severely limit the promotion and application of GaN HEMTs. This article investigates and compares the dR$_{\text{DS(ON)}}$ under various power cycle aging conditions for hybrid drain-embedded gate injection transistors (HD-GITs), which serve as representative devices of GaN HEMTs. For the purpose of this, HD-GITs are prepared using power cycling tests, and a voltage clamping circuit is employed to accurately measure the dR$_{\text{DS(ON)}}$ during the switching applications in both the double-pulse test and the multipulse test. Experimental results demonstrate that, under certain conditions, the dR$_{\text{DS(ON)}}$ of the device deteriorates as it ages. Furthermore, the primary mechanisms responsible for the deterioration of dR$_{\text{DS(ON)}}$ characteristics under different aging states are discussed based on systematic electrical test results and reasonable inference. The finds are of great significance for guiding the design, manufacture, and application of GaN devices.</description></item><item><title>A Fast and Sensitive Current Differential Protection for MMC-HVDC Lines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10495727</link><description>This article proposes a fast and sensitive current differential protection (CDP) for modular multilevel converter based high voltage direct current lines. This method utilizes the fully distributed and frequency dependent (FD) line model to compensate for the influence of FD parameters, thus achieving high sensitivity. The improved curve fitting scheme in the FD line model is provided to enable the formulation of the differential current. Then, a fast time domain convolution scheme is specially designed to achieve the capability of the real-time calculation with the FD line model, and therefore guarantee the high response speed. A comparative analysis between the proposed CDP and the existing Bergeron based CDP is utilized to demonstrate the superior sensitivity and faster response speed of the proposed method. Moreover, the proposed method only requires a relatively low sampling rate and can complete internal fault detection within 3 ms after the fault occurs. Hardware-in-the-loop experiments using real time digital simulator are also conducted to verify the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Fault Diagnosis of DC/DC Buck Converter for Embedded Applications Based on BO-ELM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472681</link><description>With the increasing demand for ocean missions, the development of autonomous marine vehicles (AMVs) has flourished. AMVs rely on electricity to power various systems, so the high reliability and stability of dc-dc converters are critical to the normal operation of AMVs. In reality, fault diagnosis and optimization of converters under the low sampling frequency and computational capability conditions remain practical challenges. This article focuses on the buck converter circuit and utilizes undersampling techniques to obtain output voltage signals sampled at a low sampling frequency. Support vector machine recursive feature elimination is employed for feature selection to reduce computation. Bayesian optimization-based extreme learning machine is used for fault diagnosis, which is suitable for actual deployment and shown to outperform three classical machine learning models. The diagnosis results are used to propose a reliability optimization strategy involving switching frequency adjustment. Physical experiments based on a digital signal processor prove the feasibility of this method.</description></item><item><title>Single-Ended Protection of VSC-HVdc Outgoing Line Based on Backward Traveling Wave Time-Domain Weighted Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10500473</link><description>This article considers the problems of high difficulty in fault analysis of direct current (dc) line in a voltage source converter (VSC)&#8211;high-voltage direct current (HVdc) outgoing system from wind farms and the poor adaptability of traditional protection principle. To solve these problems, this article proposes single-ended protection of the VSC-HVdc outgoing line based on the time-domain weighted optimization (TDWO) of a fault backward traveling wave (BTW). The analysis of the propagation process of the internal fault (IF) and external fault (EF) voltage BTW and the attenuation characteristics of the dc line and boundary shows that the voltage BTW measured by the protection element decreases significantly under IF. When an EF occurs, the variation range of the voltage measured by the protection element is small, and the higher the frequency is, the more significant the difference between them is. The fault data are optimized by using the time-domain weighted coefficient, and the fault distinction between the IF and EF is expanded. In addition, the fault identification criterion is constructed according to the time-domain weighted coefficient. The proposed protection method is verified by experiments using a renewable energy grid-connected system constructed on a real-time digital simulation (RTDS) platform. The experimental results show that the proposed protection method can identify faults rapidly with a small amount of calculation and realize the full-line action with high speed, reliability, and sensitivity. The maximum achievable sampling rate for safeguarding equipment is up to 50 kHz; the proposed method, with a sampling rate of 20 kHz, has an application value in practical engineering.</description></item><item><title>Intrinsic Causality Embedded Concurrent Quality and Process Monitoring Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472781</link><description>The causality between different variables can reveal the flows of material, energy, and information in the process system. It is beneficial to reflect the relationship between quality variables and process variables. In this study, a concurrent quality and process monitoring method is proposed with intrinsic causality analytics. The proposed method explores the causality between different variables using transfer entropy. Then, the directly related variables and their corresponding time lags are combined to extract convolutional features, which are used to generate feature matrices for process and quality variables. In this way, the quality related information is extracted from the process variables which are directly related to the quality variables. After that, monitoring models are established for each pair of feature matrices, and the monitoring results are integrated to provide a final monitoring result. Since the process disturbances usually smear to directly related variables, the fault signature can be amplified to improve the detection sensitivity when the directly related variables are combined. Finally, the operation status of the process system is identified through the designed monitoring policy, which combines the decisions of different statistics. It is noted that the proposed strategy can be readily generalized to many other existing quality related monitoring methods. Experiments on a real industrial condenser show that the proposed method can distinguish the quality related faults from the process related faults in the condenser. Besides, it has better detection sensitivity than some commonly used quality related monitoring methods.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Power Splitting and Conversion in Ferrite/Piezoelectric Transformer Magnetoelectric Composites</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472890</link><description>Developing efficient power-splitting device for multichannel distributed low-frequency (LF) mechanical antenna (MA) communication system is challenging since conventional LF power-splitting technologies rely on lumped resistive elements with unsatisfied efficiency and poor electrical isolation. In view of this, a magnetoelectric (ME) power splitter consisting of nickel&#8211;zinc ferrite and Rosen-type piezoelectric transformer composite was modeled, fabricated, and packaged with a supporting theory to quantitatively describe the power-splitting ratio. To reveal the energy loss between interlayers, a noncontact optical Doppler measurement was employed to track the energy losses between interlayers. Results show that favorable input-to-output isolation with a high insulation voltage of 2.35 kV in the packaged device was obtained, and the maximum PE for Port I and Port II reached 34.45% and 35.87% at RL = 1 k&#937; and RL = 13 k&#937;, respectively, in tailored sample with thickness ratio of np = 0.412, and then the measured splitting ratio approximates 1.1 and matches well with the theoretical predictions. Finally, the proposed ME splitter was deployed in a dual-channel distributed LF communication system for implementing each MA excitation, the system divided one source into two independent transmitting ME antennas and accomplished 20 bps amplitude shift keying modulated signal delivery to searching coils under a distance of 125 cm and an input power of 3.57 mW.</description></item><item><title>A Two-Stage Interpolation Time-to-Digital Converter Implemented in 20 and 28 nm FGPAs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472783</link><description>This article presents a two-stage interpolation time-to-digital converter (TDC), combining a Vernier gray code oscillator TDC (VGCO-TDC) and a tapped-delay line TDC (TDL-TDC). The proposed TDC uses the Nutt method to achieve a broad, high-resolution measurement range. It utilizes look-up tables based gray code oscillators to build a VGCO-TDC as the first-stage interpolation for fine-time measurements. Then the overtaking residual from the VGCO-TDC is measured by a TDL-TDC to achieve the second-stage interpolation. Due to the two-stage interpolation architecture, the carry-chain-based delay line only needs to cover the resolution of the VGCO-TDC. Hence, we can reduce the delay-line length and related hardware resource utilization. We implemented and evaluated a 16-channel TDC system in Xilinx 20-nm Kintex-UltraScale and 28-nm Virtex-7 field-programmable gate arrays. The Kintex-UltraScale version achieves an average resolution [least significant bit (LSB)] of 4.57 picoseconds (ps) with 4.36 LSB average peak-to-peak differential nonlinearity (DNLpk-pk). The Virtex-7 version achieves an average resolution of 10.05 ps with 2.85 LSB average DNLpk-pk.</description></item><item><title>A Strong Offset-Resistant Electric Vehicle Wireless Charging System Based on Dual Decoupled Receiving Coils</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472778</link><description>In an electric vehicle wireless charging system, the dramatic variation of the mutual inductance caused by the coil misalignment is an urgent problem to be solved. An offset-resistant wireless charging system based on dual decoupled receiving coils is proposed, with one receiving coil as the unipolar coil and the other as the quadrupolar coil. With series compensation, they are connected in series through the diode rectifier. In this way, the total equivalent mutual inductance is the summation of the absolute values of the two mutual inductances. Thus, the total equivalent mutual inductance can remain stable against misalignment, guaranteeing a stable system output. Experimental results confirm that the designed system has good misalignment tolerance capability in two perpendicular directions, enabling stable and efficient power transmission. Along the misalignment, the output voltage fluctuation is only 2.81% with the highest system efficiency of 94.68%.</description></item><item><title>Synchronization Stability Analysis Under Ultra-Weak Grid Considering Reactive Current Dynamics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10476724</link><description>The synchronization stability of grid-following converter has attracted extensive attention. It has been reported that the transient synchronization behavior during a grid fault is dominated by the phase-locked loop (PLL), while the current loop is always approximated as a unity gain. Nevertheless, this letter notices that the reactive current dynamics will also influence the synchronization stability under ultra-weak grid, which increases the risk of losing synchronization, and causes the PLL output frequency to be outside the limitation. Accordingly, a refined fourth-order model is proposed to reveal the above underlying mechanism and quantify this coupling effect.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Impedance Compensation Method for IPT System Applying Inverse Coupled Current Doubler Rectifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10462682</link><description>Inverse coupled current doubler rectifier (ICCDR) has been applied in high output current scenarios due to its higher current gain and rectification efficiency than diode full-bridge rectifier. However, existing analysis about ICCDR has nonnegligible errors because the inductance effect of a transformer is simply ignored. In this letter, the inductance effect and energy storage-release process of transformer are taken into account innovatively. Then, an accurate input impedance model of ICCDR is first established via modal analysis, whose equivalent inductor leads to poor constant current effect within large load range. Based on this input impedance model, a novel compensation method, which can eliminate the impact of its equivalent inductor and optimize constant current output effect by tuning primary capacitance, is provided. The proposed S-S compensated inductive power transfer system applying ICCDR achieves zero phase angle and shows a &#177;5% output current change rate within 8:1 load resistance range. The analysis is verified by a 20-A output prototype, which shows a peak efficiency of 95.6%.</description></item><item><title>Modulation and Control Independent Dead-Zone Compensation for H-Bridge Converters: A Simplified Digital Logic Scheme</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472893</link><description>The H-bridge (HB) converters are essential components in various power typologies, offering dual energy flow, increasing power density, and enhancing extensibility. For the HB converters, the dead zone plays a crucial role in avoiding power semiconductors against shoot-through phenomenon in the phase leg of an HB converter. However, it also negatively affects the quality of the output ac currents, impacting system performance. This letter introduces a simplified digital logic-based scheme that effectively compensates for the dead zone in HB converters. Initially, the scheme examines the repercussions of dead zones in HB converter. Subsequently, it adjusts pulsewidth modulation signal waveforms by either delaying the leading edge or the lagging edge for the dead-zone compensation, irrespective of the control and modulation methods employed. Furthermore, extensibility of the proposed scheme to other power converters, such as a neutral-point-clamped converter is discussed. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated by experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Calculating Probabilistic Carbon Emission Flow: An Adaptive Regression-Based Framework</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10414125</link><description>Carbon intensities are beginning to be used as incentives for consumer-driven carbon reduction. Guided by time-varying carbon intensities, consumers can schedule loads in priority order to use more electricity during low-carbon periods. However, carbon intensities cannot be perfectly forecasted in advance due to the fluctuation of loads and renewable energy. The probabilistic distribution of carbon intensities can be calculated by the grid operator and used as a reference for power consumers. This paper presents a probabilistic carbon emission flow model to calculate the distribution of carbon intensities for consumers. An adaptive regression-based calculation framework combined with a carbon pattern dictionary technique is proposed to handle the high calculation complexity caused by the nonlinearity of the carbon emission flow model. The simulation results from the case studies demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Quantum Grover Search-Inspired Global Maximum Power Point Tracking for Photovoltaic Systems Under Partial Shading Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10418984</link><description>Tracking the global maximum power point (GMPP) of photovoltaic (PV) arrays under partial shading conditions (PSCs) is a critical research area.

The dispatch policy is designed to account for both calendrical and cyclical aging effects on BESS, explicitly modeling the impacts of ambient temperature on BESS lifespan. The proposed ADP employs an adaptive critic method and enhanced off-policy deterministic policy gradient (DPG) strategy, addressing the limitations of the on-policy gradient-based ADP approaches, including inadequate exploration, low data usage, and computational complexity. In particular, a customized policy is proposed to guide the algorithm to explore some promising decisions and thereby improve exploration capability and learning efficiency compared to conventional DPG-based learning approaches, which may struggle to find a global optimum due to random noisy action-based exploration or require expert demonstration with extra effort. The proposed method is illustrated using the IEEE 123-node system and compared with the existing ADP methods to prove solution accuracy and demonstrate the effects of incorporating degradation models into control design. Case studies showed that the proposed ADP effectively coordinates DERs with a 10 times smaller optimization gap compared to existing methods, and the incorporation of the BESS life loss model into the proposed control ensures the expected lifespan and results in significant cost savings.</description></item><item><title>Higher Order Sliding Mode Observer Based Fast Composite Backstepping Control for HESS in DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10432969</link><description>Hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is effective to compensate for fluctuation power in renewables and fast fluctuation loads in DC microgrids. To regulate DC bus voltage, a power management strategy is an essential issue. In the meantime, the increasing integration of constant power loads (CPLs) in DC microgrids brings great challenges to stable operation due to their negative incremental impedance. In this paper, a fast composite backstepping control (FBC) method is proposed for the HESS to achieve faster dynamics, smaller voltage variations, and large-signal stabilization. In the FBC method, a higher order sliding mode observer (HOSMO) is adopted to estimate the coupled disturbances. Furthermore, the FBC method is integrated with the droop control; so that the FBC-based decentralized power allocation (FBC-DPA) strategy for HESS in DC microgrids is developed. The proposed FBC method is designed based on the Lyapunov function to ensure its stability. Moreover, the design guidelines are provided to facilitate the application of the proposed method. Both simulation and experimental studies under different operating scenarios show that the proposed method achieves faster voltage recovery and smaller voltage variations than the conventional backstepping control method.</description></item><item><title>Rotor Speed Control in Above-Rated Wind Speed Region for Floating Offshore Wind Turbine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433765</link><description>Large oscillations of the rotor speed are often observed in floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) operating in above-rated wind speed region. This phenomenon drastically increases the mechanical fatigue loads and even causes damage to the generator. To address this problem, this article first establishes a Reduced-Order Speed-Control-Oriented Model (ROSCOM), which demonstrates the nonlinear coupling of the platform pitch motion and the turbine rotor rotation. The oscillation mechanism is then revealed that the platform pitch motion acts as the zero dynamics of ROSCOM, which can produce limit cycles and result in large oscillations of rotor speed. Based on the Bendixson criterion and Hopf bifurcation theorem, limit cycles and Hopf bifurcation in the platform pitch motion are identified and proved. Additionally, a nonlinear generator torque compensation strategy, named Non-Minimum Phase Platform Pitch Compensation (NMP$^{3}$C), is designed to eliminate the limit cycles in the FOWT system. The rotor speed control performance is thus greatly improved. Electromagnetic power variation, platform pitch variation and tower base fore-aft fatigue loads are also mitigated. Digital simulations based on OpenFAST verify the analysis results and the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Cluster-Based Distributed Secondary Control of Large-Scale DC Microgrid Cluster System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433685</link><description>With the high integration of distributed renewable energies, microgrid (MG) cluster system, consisting of complex physical structures and complicated networked control structure, has emerged as a growing trend. Currently, several secondary control strategies including centralized, decentralized and distributed control have been proposed to solve the secondary voltage restoration and power sharing problem in single DC MG systems. However, few efforts have been made on the secondary control of MG cluster system. In this paper, a first attempt on designing a decentralized cluster-based distributed secondary control strategy is made towards the goal of accurate voltage restoration and power sharing in the DC MG cluster system. Specifically, for the DGs within the same cluster, a distributed finite-time control approach is proposed, while no information exchange is involved among different clusters. As a consequence, all the distributed controllers of different clusters are totally decentralized. If each cluster has only one DG, our proposed control strategy reduces to the existing decentralized ones, while the case of one cluster boils down to distributed control. Rigorous theoretical analysis is provided for such control strategy. Compared to existing methods, our proposed strategy has better transient and steady-state performance than purely decentralized and better robustness than distributed ones. The proposed method is validated in an experimental test system built in OPAL-RT.</description></item><item><title>Synchronverters With Fault Ride-Through Capabilities for Reliable Microgrid Protection During Balanced and Unbalanced Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433740</link><description>Synchronverters are inverters that provide damping and inertia, similar to synchronous generators. Like traditional inverters, synchronverters are adaptable to the microgrid's operation modes. However, synchronverters may generate oscillatory active and reactive powers during faults and produce phase currents with excessive magnitudes. Therefore, this paper develops two fault ride-through (FRT) strategies for synchronverters: average power control and enhanced power control. Both strategies aim to reduce power oscillations, limit current generation, and ensure compliance with grid codes during faults, regardless of the fault conditions and the grid's operation mode. Additionally, synchronverters with the proposed FRT strategies are incorporated into an optimal protection coordination (OPC) program for microgrid protection. The OPC program obtains the settings of time-current-voltage overcurrent relays (TIV-OCRs) and demonstrates the effect of the proposed FRT strategies on microgrid protection. The obtained settings are suitable for both the microgrid's grid-connected and islanded modes during balanced and unbalanced faults. Evaluation results demonstrate the capability of the proposed strategies to reduce power oscillations, limit current generation, and comply with grid codes. Furthermore, the OPC results reveal the most appropriate strategy to minimize TIV-OCRs' operating times in a coordinated manner, regardless of the fault type and microgrid operating mode.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Dimensional Holomorphic Embedding Method for Probabilistic Energy Flow Calculation in Integrated Distribution Power and Heating System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10438069</link><description>A fast probabilistic energy flow (PEF) analysis method is proposed for integrated distribution power and heating system (IPHS) operations. The proposed solution will overcome the low efficiency of the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method for calculating the probabilistic energy flows (PEFs) iteratively, which will require an exhaustive set of energy flow calculations for a large number of samples. First, we use the multi-dimensional holomorphic embedding method (MDHEM) to derive the analytical energy flow expressions, so that the solutions for massive scenarios can be obtained by merely substituting the boundary conditions into expressions. Second, a PEF analysis model is established based on the analytical method for evaluating the impact of uncertainties on IPHSs, and accelerating the efficiency of traditional MCS methods significantly.

However, sudden variations in the magnitude and phase angle of grid voltage during grid faults may result in the phase-locked loop transient response (PLTR) of DPMWT. The PLTR changes the output characteristics of DPMWT through converter control loop. This alteration incorporates dynamic control errors and presents potential hazards to the transient frequency of power system. Therefore, the dynamic control error resulting from PLTR under the three-phase fault is found, and an emergency frequency control method for DPMWT under the three-phase fault is proposed. The quantification method for PLTR under the three-phase fault is proposed, and the conduction paths of PLTR within the converter control loop are analyzed. The mechanism of dynamic control error of DPMWT under the three-phase fault is analyzed, and the calculation method for dynamic control error is further proposed. Moreover, the transient frequency characteristics of the power system when affected by dynamic control error are analyzed, and the emergency frequency control method for DPMWT based on the compensation of dynamic control error is put forward. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by case studies.</description></item><item><title>Grid-Forming Control for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells in an Islanded Microgrid Using Maximum Power Point Estimation Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10449436</link><description>Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are promising distributed generation technologies for their controllability and efficiency. Traditional SOFCs are controlled as a current source to deliver predefined power to the grid. Since a microgrid can operate in both grid-connected mode and islanded mode, grid-forming control ability is required for SOFCs to achieve voltage/ frequency regulation. However, when subjected to load transients, nonlinear output characteristics of SOFCs would probably lead to the collapse of dc-link voltage and unintentional disconnection of SOFCs. To deal with this issue, grid-forming control for SOFCs is presented considering nonlinear characteristics between output current and voltage. The maximum power point (MPP) of SOFCs is tracked using proposed incremental impedance (INI) method and dc-link voltage difference is delivered to adjust output frequency of ac side. In this condition, stable operation and load sharing can be achieved simultaneously during load transients. Simulation results based on PSCAD/EMTDC are provided to validate the effectiveness of proposed grid-forming control.</description></item><item><title>Carbon-Embedded Nodal Energy Price in Hydrogen-Blended Integrated Electricity and Gas Systems With Heterogeneous Gas Compositions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10458410</link><description>Blending green hydrogen from renewable generations into the natural gas infrastructure can effectively mitigate carbon emissions of energy consumers. However, distributed hydrogen blending could lead to heterogeneous gas compositions across the network. The traditional nodal energy price scheme is designed for uniform gas composition, which cannot reflect the impacts of heterogeneous nodal gas composition and carbon emission mitigation. This paper proposes a novel nodal energy price scheme in hydrogen-blended integrated electricity and gas systems (H-IEGS). First, we propose a joint market-clearing model for H-IEGS, where the nonlinear physical properties of gas mixtures caused by heterogeneous gas compositions are characterized. The impacts of hydrogen blending on the carbon emission cost are also quantified. To retrieve the nodal energy price from this highly nonlinear and nonconvex optimization problem, a successive second-order cone programming (SSOCP) method is tailored to get the dual variables tractably. Considering the continuous market clearing process, a warm-start technique is proposed to provide initial reference points for the SSOCP to improve computation efficiency. Finally, an H-IEGS test case in Belgium and a large-scale practical case in Northwest China are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Sea-State-Dependent Control Strategy for Wave Energy Converters: Power Limiting in Large Wave Conditions and Energy Maximising in Moderate Wave Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10460174</link><description>Conventional control strategies for wave energy converters (WECs) maximise power capture of the WEC by amplifying its responses, but this exacerbates hardware constraint violations not generally taken into account, causing undesirable shutdown of electrical systems in adverse wave conditions. When WECs operate close to power take-off (PTO) capacity, the primary control objective is to limit peak power for hardware protection purposes, enabling longer continuous electricity generation time. In this paper, we propose a sea-state-dependent control strategy based on model predictive control to maximise the annual energy production of a WEC with a realistic PTO: in small to moderate sea states it adopts a conventional energy-maximising objective function to increase output power, while in higher sea states a speed-limiting objective function may be utilised to enable longer generating time before shutdown becomes necessary. While this control strategy applies to a wide range of WECs, here we carry out the case study on an attenuator WEC called M4, with gearbox transmission and a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) as its PTO, which is being designed for a 1/4 scale ocean test in Albany, Australia. Simulation results show that compared with a benchmark passive damping controller, a 66% increase in annual energy production can be expected at the targeted site.</description></item><item><title>Addressing Wind Power Forecast Errors in Day-Ahead Pricing With Energy Storage Systems: A Distributionally Robust Joint Chance-Constrained Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10461088</link><description>The rapid integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) has imposed substantial uncertainty and variability on the operation of power markets, which calls for unprecedentedly flexible generation resources such as batteries. In this paper, we develop a novel pricing mechanism for day-ahead electricity markets to adeptly accommodate the uncertainties stemming from RESs. First, a distributionally robust joint chance-constrained (DRJCC) economic dispatch model that incorporates energy storage systems is presented, ensuring that the DRJCCs are satisfied across a moment-based ambiguity set enriched with unimodality-skewness characteristics. Second, by applying the Bonferroni approximation method to tackle the DRJCCs, we show that the proposed model can be transformed into a second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem. Building on the SOCP reformulation, we then precisely derive the electricity prices, including the energy, reserve, and uncertainty prices. Furthermore, we prove that the obtained pricing mechanism supports a robust competitive equilibrium under specific premises. Finally, a PJM 5-bus test system and the IEEE 118-bus test system are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the suggested approach, underscoring its potential contributions to modern power market operations.</description></item><item><title>Two-Critic Deep Reinforcement Learning for Inverter-Based Volt-Var Control in Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10470443</link><description>A two-critic deep reinforcement learning (TC-DRL) approach for inverter-based volt-var control (IB-VVC) in active distribution networks is proposed in this paper. Considering two objectives of VVC, minimizing power loss and eliminating voltage violations, have different mathematical properties, we utilize two critics to approximate two objectives separately, which reduces the learning difficulties of each critic. The TC-DRL approach cooperates well with many actor-critic DRL algorithms for the centralized IB-VVC problems, and two centralized DRL algorithms were designed as examples. For decentralized IB-VVC, we extend the approach to a multi-agent TC-DRL approach and further simplify the multi-agent DRL approach with all agents sharing the same centralized two-critic. Extensive simulation experiments show that the proposed two centralized TC-DRL algorithms require fewer iteration times and return better results than the recent DRL algorithms, and the multi-agent TC-DRL algorithms work well for decentralized IB-VVC problems with different limited real-time measurement conditions.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Joint Distributionally Robust Chance-Constrained Operation for Multiple Integrated Electricity and Heating Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475580</link><description>Integrating heating and electricity networks offers extra flexibility to the energy system operation while improving energy utilization efficiency. This paper proposes a data-driven joint distributionally robust chance-constrained (DRCC) operation model for multiple integrated electricity and heating systems (IEHSs). Flexible reserve resources in IEHS are exploited to mitigate the uncertainty of renewable energy. A distributed and parallel joint DRCC operation framework is developed to preserve the decision-making independence of multiple IEHSs, where the optimized CVaR approximation (OCA) approach is developed to transform the local joint DRCC model into a tractable model. An alternating minimization algorithm is presented to improve the tightness of OCA for joint chance constraints by iteratively tuning the OCA. Case studies on the IEEE 33-bus system with four IEHSs and the IEEE 141-bus system with eight IEHSs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Stability Enhancement of Power Synchronisation Control Based Grid-Forming Inverter Under Varying Network Characteristics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10476727</link><description>Power synchronisation control (PSC) is commonly used in voltage source inverters due to its grid-forming capability and superior performance under weak grid conditions as compared to other grid-forming inverter (GFMI) strategies. However, there is a notable gap in understanding the application and performance of PSC under various practical operating scenarios, particularly in different network types. This paper addresses this critical shortcoming by conducting an in-depth analysis of PSC-based GFMIs under different network types, utilising a comprehensive mathematical and dynamic simulation models. The analysis reveals that the PSC-based GFMI system encounters instability in predominantly resistive networks. To address this issue, two decoupling strategies, namely virtual power (VP)-based and virtual impedance (VI)-based, are proposed to improve power-sharing accuracy and enhance system stability. Furthermore, the improved performance of these proposed strategies is verified in real-time using the IEEE-39 bus network on the OPAL-RT platform. The validation results reaffirm the suitability of PSC-based GFMI in all practical networks.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive Approach for Probabilistic Wind Power Forecasting Based on Meta-Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10476768</link><description>This paper studies an adaptive approach for probabilistic wind power forecasting (WPF) including offline and online learning procedures. In the offline learning stage, a base forecast model is trained via inner and outer loop updates of meta-learning, which endows the base forecast model with excellent adaptability to different forecast tasks, i.e., probabilistic WPF with different lead times or locations. In the online learning stage, the base forecast model is applied to online forecasting combined with incremental learning techniques. On this basis, the online forecast takes full advantage of recent information and the adaptability of the base forecast model. Two applications are developed based on our proposed approach concerning forecasting with different lead times (temporal adaptation) and forecasting for newly established wind farms (spatial adaptation), respectively. Numerical tests were conducted on real-world wind power data sets. Simulation results validate the advantages in adaptivity of the proposed methods compared with existing alternatives.</description></item><item><title>MADRL-Based DSO-Customer Coordinated Bi-Level Volt/VAR Optimization Method for Power Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478208</link><description>The high penetration of customer-side variable PVs could change power distribution networks (PDNs) operations and lead to frequent nodal voltage violations. The grid-side static var compensators (SVCs), controlled by distribution system operators (DSO), and customer-side PV inverters are usually used as fast devices to mitigate voltage problems caused by PVs. To effectively coordinate these two types of VAR resources with different ownerships, this paper proposes the multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) approach, which uses the asymmetric Markov game (ASMG) method to implement a cooperative bi-level Volt/VAR optimization (VVO) framework. In this framework, DSO is the leader, which makes decisions at the upper level to minimize the PDNs energy losses by regulating SVCs, and customers are the followers, which make decisions at the lower level by regulating PV inverters to mitigate nodal voltage deviations. Furthermore, a model-free Bi-level Actor-Critic (Bi-AC) algorithm is proposed to solve the ASMG problem, which defines the agents&#8217; decision priorities so that the follower agents can always execute the best response policy. The effectiveness of the proposed Bi-AC method is verified by utilizing improved IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 118-bus case with practical grid operation data.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Dynamic Power Sharing Control for Frequency Regulation Using Hybrid Hydrogen Electrolyzer Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478586</link><description>Hydrogen electrolyzers are promising tools for frequency regulation of future power systems with high penetration of renewable energies and low inertia. This is due to both the increasing demand for hydrogen and their flexibility as controllable load. The two main electrolyzer technologies are Alkaline Electrolyzers (AELs) and Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolyzers (PEMELs). However, they have trade-offs: dynamic response speed for AELs, and cost for PEMELs. This paper proposes the combination of both technologies into a Hybrid Hydrogen Electrolyzer System (HHES) to obtain a fast response for frequency regulation with reduced costs. A decentralized dynamic power sharing control strategy is proposed where PEMELs respond to the fast component of the frequency deviation, and AELs respond to the slow component, without the requirement of communication. The proposed decentralized approach facilitates a high reliability and scalability of the system, what is essential for expansion of hydrogen production. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated in simulations and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Aggregate Model of District Heating Network for Integrated Energy Dispatch: A Physically Informed Data-Driven Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10485435</link><description>The district heating network (DHN) is essential in enhancing the operational flexibility of integrated energy systems (IES). Yet, it is hard to obtain an accurate and concise DHN model for the operation owing to complicated network features and imperfect measurements. Considering this, this paper proposes a physically informed data-driven aggregate model (AGM) for the DHN, providing a concise description of the source-load relationship of DHN without exposing network details. First, we derive the analytical relationship between the state variables of the source and load nodes of the DHN, offering a physical fundament for the AGM. Second, we propose a physics-informed estimator for the AGM that is robust to low-quality measurements, in which the physical constraints associated with the parameter normalization and sparsity are embedded to improve the accuracy and robustness. Finally, we propose a physics-enhanced algorithm to solve the nonlinear estimator with non-closed constraints efficiently. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Modeling the Coupling of Rotor Speed, primary Frequency Reserve and Virtual Inertia of Wind Turbines in Frequency Constrained Look-Ahead Dispatch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10496871</link><description>With the increasing penetration of wind power, wind turbines (WTs) are required to provide primary frequency reserve (PFR) and virtual inertia support to the grid to ensure frequency security. However, in existing frequency-constrained scheduling research, the coupling of WTs' rotor speed, PFR and virtual inertia has been overlooked. This paper accurately models the PFR capacity and virtual inertia of WTs based on WT's rotor speed control and frequency control. Besides, a frequency-constrained stochastic look-ahead economic dispatch (FCS-LAED) model, which co-optimizes the PFR, virtual inertia and rotor speed of WTs is proposed. In this model, WTs' operation constraints are considered more comprehensively compared with existing research. A combination of convex hull relaxation and McCormick envelope is employed to convexify the proposed FCS-LAED model. To further tighten the relaxation, a modified sequential bound tightening method is proposed. Case studies on the modified IEEE 6-bus system and IEEE 118-bus system verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and methods.</description></item><item><title>Stability Constrained Optimal Operation of Inverter-Dominant Microgrids: A Two Stage Robust Optimization Framework</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10497873</link><description>To mitigate the stability issues in the droop-controlled isolated microgrids brought by aleatory renewable energy sources (RESs), which can be added at any given time, this paper proposes a two-stage robust coordination strategy to optimize the operation of multiple flexible resources. In the first stage, a day-ahead unit commitment (UC) schedule of microturbines(MTs) is formulated considering the uncertainty of RESs and loads. In the second stage, an hourly power dispatch and droop gains adjustment scheme for the energy storage devices are developed to minimize the operation cost and ensure the small signal stability. An adaptive column and constraint generation (C&amp;amp;CG) algorithm is developed to solve the stability-constrained two-stage robust optimization problem. Simulation results on a 33-bus microgrid system reveal that compared to benchmarking approaches, the proposed coordination strategy is able to guarantee the small-signal stability with lower cost. And a sensitivity analysis validates the robustness of the methodology against the uncertainties of RESs.</description></item><item><title>A Decision-Dependent Hydrogen Supply Infrastructure Planning Approach Considering Causality Between Vehicles and Stations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10497898</link><description>In the early commercialization stage of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs), reasonable hydrogen supply infrastructure (HSI) planning is a premise for promoting the popularization of HFCVs. However, there is a strong causality between HFCVs and hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs): the planning decisions of HRSs could affect the hydrogen refueling demand of HFCVs, and the growth of demand would in turn stimulate the further investment in HRSs, which is prompted by the chicken-egg conundrum. Meanwhile, there is a cost contradiction between energy planning and hydrogen refueling convenience of HFCVs caused by HRSs siting planning. To this end, this work establishes a multi-network HSI planning model coordinating hydrogen, power, and transportation networks. Then, to reflect the causal relation between HFCVs and HRSs effectively in the early stage of hydrogen infrastructure investment planning without sufficient historical data, hydrogen demand decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) and a distributionally robust optimization framework are developed. The uncertainty of hydrogen demand is modeled as a Wasserstein ambiguity set with a decision-dependent empirical probability distribution. Subsequently, to reduce the computational complexity caused by the introduction of a large number of scenarios and high-dimensional nonlinear constraints, we developed an improved distribution shaping method and techniques of scenario and variable reduction to derive the solvable form with less computing burden. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that this method can reduce costs by at least 7.7% compared with traditional methods and will be more effective in large-scale HSI planning issues. Further, we put forward effective suggestions for the policymakers and investors.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Optimal Scheduling With Heterogeneous Uncertainty Information: A Framework for Hydrogen Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10499851</link><description>Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) has emerged as a favored methodology for addressing the uncertainties stemming from renewable energy sources. However, existing DRO frameworks primarily focus on single types of uncertainty characteristics, such as moments. Exploring novel ambiguity sets that encompass heterogeneous uncertainty information to mitigate decision conservatism is thus an essential and strategic move. This paper introduces a day-ahead optimal scheduling model tailored for electricity-hydrogen systems under renewable uncertainty, with embedded technologies of hydrogen production, storage, and utilization. Three novel ambiguity sets enriched with the moment, Wasserstein distance, and unimodality information are adeptly devised. Building upon these elaborated ambiguity sets, we develop efficient and scalable reformulations of the expected objective function and uncertain constraints, leading to either a tractable mixed-integer second-order cone programming problem or a linear programming problem. We validate the effectiveness and operating flexibility of the proposed electricity-hydrogen model using both a 6-bus test system and the IEEE 118-bus test system. Furthermore, we demonstrate the superior cost performance and computational efficiency of our developed DRO approaches.</description></item><item><title>Spatial-Temporal Wind Power Probabilistic Forecasting Based on Time-Aware Graph Convolutional Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10502289</link><description>Spatial-temporal wind power prediction is of enormous importance to the grid-connected operation of multiple wind farms in the wind power system. However, most of the conventional methods are usually limited to predicting an individual wind farm's power, and thus lack enough effectiveness of wind power forecasting of multiple adjacent wind farms. This paper proposes a novel spatial-temporal wind power probabilistic prediction approach, named ZF-GCN-MHTQF, based on time zigzags and flexible convolution at graph convolutional network, point-wise loss function and the heavy-tailed quantile function. The proposed framework combines the advantages of time zigzags and flexible convolution at graph convolutional networks that can extract temporally conditioned topological information from multiple wind farms efficiently and incorporate the extracted topological information to predict wind power. At the same time, the proposed method incorporates the strengths of point-wise loss functions and heavy-tailed quantile functions which can effectively tackle the problem of the traditional multi-quantile regression and accurately capture the full conditional distribution information of wind power. In our experiments, two real-world wind power datasets from Australia are utilized to validate the proposed model. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art spatial-temporal models.</description></item><item><title>Robust Learning-Based Model Predictive Control for Wave Energy Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504609</link><description>This paper proposes a robust learning-based model predictive control (MPC) strategy tailored for sea wave energy converters (WECs). The control algorithm aims to maximize power extraction efficiency and maintain the WECs' operational safety over a wide range of sea conditions, subject to system constraints and plant-model mismatches. The theoretical basis is the robust tube-based MPC (RTMPC), enabling WEC system state trajectories to evolve around the noise-free nominal WEC model state trajectories. The disturbances can be bounded by pre-computed uncertainty sets for tightening the WEC's physical constraints to guarantee the constraint satisfaction of an uncertain WEC system. Typically, RTMPC constructs a tube with constant sets of uncertainties, which is likely to be overly conservative and hence potentially degrades energy conversion performance. In this work, a machine learning-based uncertainty set is introduced to dynamically predict and quantify the model uncertainties at each sampling instant, which can effectively enlarge the feasible region of the WEC TMPC control problem. The proposed RTMPC not only ensures improved energy conversion efficiency but also guarantees the operational safety of WECs under uncertain conditions. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed controller.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Short-Term Forecasting of Large Distributed Solar PV Fleets Using Sparse Smart Inverter Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504585</link><description>Ultra-short-term power forecasting for distributed solar photovoltaic (PV) generation is a largely unaddressed, highly challenging problem due to the prohibitive real-time data collection and processing requirements for a sheer number of distributed PV units. In this paper, we propose an innovative idea of forecasting the power output of a large fleet of distributed PV units using limited real-time data of a sparsely selected set of PV units, referred to as pilot units. We develop a two-stage method to address this problem. In the planning stage, we use the K-medoids clustering algorithm to select pilot units for the installation of real-time remote monitoring infrastructure. In the operation stage, we devise a deep learning framework integrating Long Short-Term Memory, Graph Convolutional Network, Multilayer Perceptron to capture the spatio-temporal power generation patterns between pilot units and other units, and forecast the power outputs of all units in a large PV fleet using the real-time data from the few selected pilot units only. Case study results show that our proposed method outperforms all baseline methods in forecasting for power outputs of individual PV units as well as the whole PV fleet, and the forecasting time resolution is not dependent on that of weather data.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Coordination of Networked-Microgrids Toward Decentralized Operation: A Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10505017</link><description>Multiple individual microgrids can be integrated as a networked microgrid system for enhanced technical and economic performance. In this paper, a two-stage data-driven method is proposed to hierarchically coordinate individual microgrids towards decentralized operation in a networked microgrid (NMG) system. The first stage schedules active power outputs of micro-turbines and energy storage systems (ESSs) on an hourly basis for energy balancing and cost minimization, where ESSs are controlled by a local P/SoC droop scheme. In the second stage, the reactive power outputs of PV inverters are dispatched every three minutes based on a Q/V droop controller, aiming to reduce network power losses and regulate the voltage under real-time uncertainties. At offline training stage, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning model is trained to learn an optimal coordination policy, enhanced by a safety model framework. For online application, the trained agent can work locally in a decentralized manner without information exchanges, and the safety model can also be applied to monitor and guide online actions for safety compliance. Numerical test results validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Temperature-Dependent Resistance Constrained PV Accommodation Capacity Improvement Based on Multi-Objective DRL</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10508485</link><description>Against the backdrop of the low-carbon energy transition, distribution system operators face the urgent challenge of balancing the contradictory demands of high photovoltaic (PV) accommodation capacity and low operation cost. Meanwhile, most iteration-based PV accommodation capacity improvement methods are limited by imprecise line resistance and the conflicting relationship between decision efficiency and modeling accuracy. To this end, a two-timescale distribution network dispatching approach based on muti-objective DRL is proposed. This approach is an online decision-making method based on real-time data and robust to temperature-dependent resistance via constructing a two-stage decision-making model based on multi-objective Markov decision process considering the weather factors. Also, the proposed model has a vectorized reward function to assess the trade-off between the economy and accommodation capacity for better operation. A novel multi-objective DRL (MODRL) algorithm based on the tchebycheff norm is proposed, which decomposes the proposed decision-making model into multiple sub-models for learning Pareto optimal policies. Comparative tests on the IEEE 33-bus system validate that the proposed method effectively acquires optimization strategies under varying user preferences to improve economic and PV accommodation capacity. The proposed algorithm obtains more diverse Pareto fronts and high-quality solutions than other state-of-the-art MODRLs.</description></item><item><title>Voltage Regulation Enhanced Hierarchical Coordinated Volt/Var and Volt/Watt Control for Active Distribution Networks With Soft Open Points</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10508977</link><description>The integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) into active distribution networks (ADNs) is essential for reducing carbon emissions but often results in voltage fluctuations and violations. This paper proposes a hierarchical voltage control framework that effectively coordinates diverse controllable devices with various response times in an ADN. The framework comprises three stages: day-ahead scheduling of on-load tap changer (OLTC), intra-day optimization for droop slopes and references for droop controllers in Soft Open Points (SOPs) and distributed generators (DGs), and real-time local voltage regulation. Unlike existing approaches, the proposed approach analytically establishes voltage stability constraints and incorporates them into droop slope optimization for local controllers, mitigating voltage oscillation risks. Additionally, a novel deviation-aware optimization method is developed to calculate optimal voltage references. This method treats the deviations between fixed-point voltages and their references as uncertainties and accounts for their impacts on voltage security through chance-constrained programming. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving voltage regulation performance with guaranteed stability.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Power Forecasting of Wind Farm Cluster Based on Global Information Adaptive Perceptual Graph Convolution Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10521869</link><description>At present, the installed capacity of wind power has increased significantly. Improving the power forecasting accuracy of Wind Farm Cluster (WFC) is of great significance to promote the consumption of renewable energy. How to effectively extract the complex spatio-temporal correlation between wind farms is the key to improve the power forecasting accuracy of WFC. Aiming at the above problems, this paper proposes a short-term WFC power forecasting method based on global information adaptive perception graph convolution. Compared with the traditional static graph structure, this paper designs the construction method of multiple Characteristic Graph Structures (CGSs) according to the correlation between farms.

First, a novel equal energy incremental rate criterion (EEIRC) is derived, based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition, for optimally utilizing the rotor kinetic energy that can enhance the frequency regulation capability of DWTs. Next, considering the coupling characteristics of inverter-side frequency and the wind turbine motion, the necessary and sufficient condition is explored for DWTs to maintain mechanical and electrical coupling (MEC) stability as they respond to ADN frequency deviations.

Finally, comprehensive simulations are conducted on the modified IEEE 123-bus system with 100% local wind power generation to validate the effectiveness and superiorities of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Objective Optimization and Stable Operation Control Strategy for Fractional Frequency Transmission System Based on Large Signal Stability Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10528906</link><description>Fractional frequency transmission systems perform well in offshore wind power transmission, yet analyzing the large signal stability of the whole system still remains a significant challenge. Particularly, the absence of optimized stable operation control strategy under large signal disturbances threatens the system's long-term reliability and stability. To tackle the issues, this paper develops the multiple T-S fuzzy model, incorporating equivalent models for offshore wind farms, M3C, and industrial frequency loads, and analyzes stability under large signal disturbances, considering coupling effects and interactions with different frequencies. Furthermore, to address the challenge of system inability to directly transition to a new steady-state point after encountering large signal disturbances, such as load transients, a multi-objective optimization method based on Normalized Boundary Intersection (NBI) is proposed. This method aims to solve the problem by determining one optimal intermediate transition point for the stable operation control strategy. By comprehensively considering stability margins and operational efficiency, the system adopts an optimal operational mode during transient processes to smoothly transition to the target operating point. Finally, simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness of large signal stability analysis findings and the stable operation control strategies.</description></item><item><title>Development and Performance Analysis of Aquila Algorithm Optimized SPV Power Imputation and Forecasting Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10534859</link><description>Solar photovoltaic (SPV) generators play a vital role in the global pursuit of sustainable energy. However, the intermittent nature of SPV generators poses a challenge to power system planning. Accurate long-term SPV power forecasting is essential, but obtaining high-quality training dsecata for many years is cumbersome due to faults in sensors, communication, or databases, leading to missing values. This paper proposes an attention network (AN) for SPV power imputation to address missing historical data. In addition, the SPV power forecasting model using BDLSTM NN is proposed for forecasting the SPV power in the long-term horizon. During training, the weights and biases of the imputation and forecasting models are proposed to be optimized using the Aquila optimization algorithm (AOA). Training and testing results substantiate that the proposed imputation and forecasting models consistently attain superior accuracy with a reduction in training time regardless of the missing rates, climatic patterns, and seasons as compared to benchmark models.</description></item><item><title>Inertia Estimation for Microgrid Considering the Impact of Wind Conditions on Doubly-Fed Induction Generators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10534804</link><description>With wind power penetration increasing, it is crucial to accurately estimate the impact of wind power generation on grid inertia levels.

The simulation reveals that the wind speed affects the microgrid inertia response through the turbine speed control. The method can assess the risk of frequency issues and assist in the safe and stable operation of microgrids.</description></item><item><title>An Electrolyzer Model for Power System Operation Optimization Over Broad Temperature Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10463117</link><description>Electrolyzers are recognized as promising equipment to improve power systems' operation flexibility. However, existing electrolyzer models used in power system operation optimization are either nonconvex or inaccurate when operating over a broad temperature range. Hence, this letter proposes an enhanced feasible operational area of electrolyzer (EFOAE) model. The EFOAE model is the first model that is convex and accurate over a broad temperature range (0 $^{\circ }$C&#8211;80 $^{\circ }$C). Therefore, the EFOAE model is favorable for operation optimization of the power systems with high penetration of renewables. Besides, to reduce errors, this letter improves the current electrolyzer feasible operational area derivation method, and removes the infeasible part in EFOAE. Compared with existing narrow temperature range (60 $^{\circ }$C&#8211;80 $^{\circ }$C) electrolyzer models, using EFOAE may release greater flexibility for power systems' operation, thereby reducing costs by 4.6% and wind curtailment by 63% in case studies.</description></item><item><title>Droop Coefficient Design of Wind Turbine Considering Rotor Speed Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10483536</link><description>This letter provides the design rule of the droop coefficient for the power synchronization loop (PSL) based grid-forming wind turbine (WT) considering the transient rotor speed constraints. The dynamic model for PSL-based WT is established first, and it is shown that the larger the droop coefficient, the larger the steady-state rotor speed deviation is. Accordingly, the maximum droop coefficient for ensuring the existence of equilibrium is derived. Finally, with the proper scaling of the transient rotor dynamic equation, the conservative evaluation of the maximum droop coefficient is obtained to make sure the WT does not touch the lower limit of the rotor speed during disturbance.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Wind Turbines and HVDC Power Transmission Lines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10531697</link><description>An innovative scheme for the direct integration of wind turbines into the existing High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission systems without the need for boost power converters and step-up transformers is presented in this article.

Employing electromagnetic transient (EMT) analysis in MGs becomes crucial for controlling the rapid transients. However, this requires an accurate but high-order model of power electronics and their underlying control loops, complexifying the stability analysis from the viewpoint of a higher control level. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a large-signal order reduction (LSOR) method for MGs with considerations of external control inputs and the detailed dynamics of underlying control levels based on singular perturbation theory (SPT). Specially, we innovatively proposed and strictly proved a general stability and accuracy assessment theorem that allows us to analyze the dynamic stability of a full-order nonlinear system by only leveraging our derived reduced-order model (ROM) and boundary layer model (BLM). Furthermore, this theorem furnishes a set of conditions that determine the accuracy of the developed ROM. Finally, by embedding such a theorem into the SPT, we propose a novel LSOR approach with guaranteed accuracy and stability analysis equivalence. Case studies are conducted on MG systems to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Event-Triggered Secondary Frequency Regulation by Sharing HESS Power in Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10413203</link><description>The fluctuated power output of renewable energy sources brings new challenges to frequency control, especially for islanded microgrids with small spinning reserves. However, energy storage systems and widespread flexible loads can be employed to the frequency regulation thanks to their flexibility of power outputs. This paper investigates the frequency regulation problem for islanded microgrids with distributed heterogeneous energy storage systems (HESS) composed of battery energy storage systems (BESS) and building thermal energy storage systems (BTESS). A distributed event-triggered balanced power sharing strategy considering denial of service (DoS) attacks is designed for frequency regulation by allocating HESS power according to BESS state of charge (SoC), BTESS state of temperature (SoT) and their capacities. The range of control parameters for a stable controller are all provided by Lyapunov analysis. Moreover, the frequency feedback control gain for HESS is derived by using linear quadratic regulator. Simulation results show that the proposed frequency regulation strategy can guarantee the recovery of microgrids frequency and the proportional sharing of HESS power. Besides, SoC and SoT balancing with fewer communications are achieved, even with considering various parameters of HESS, such as capacity, efficiency and with communication link failures as well as DoS attacks.</description></item><item><title>Control of AC-AC Interlinking Converters for Multi-Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10416262</link><description>This paper considers the control of AC-AC interlinking converters (ILCs) in a multi-grid network. We overview the control schemes in the literature and propose a passivity framework for the stabilization of multi-grid networks, considering both AC grid-following and AC grid-forming behavior for the ILC connections. We then analyze a range of AC/AC interlinking converter control methods derived from the literature and propose suitable controllers for this purpose including both AC grid-forming and grid-following behavior. The controller we propose is partially grid-forming; in particular, it is based on a combination of a grid-following and a grid-forming converter to improve the stability properties of the network. Simulation results and theoretical analysis confirm that the proposed ILC control designs are appropriate for the multi-grid network.</description></item><item><title>Fuzzy Granulation Interval-Based Fault Diagnosis Method for Ring-Type DC Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10416239</link><description>The lack of relevant protection schemes and standards brings significant challenges to the promotion of direct current microgrid (DCMG) technologies. The existing line fault diagnosis methods usually require additional measuring devices to obtain fault signals. Although reducing the number of sensors can lower the system costs, it also increases the difficulty of diagnosis. Pole-to-pole (PP) and positive pole-to-ground (PPG) fault classification under unknown fault resistance, and negative-to-ground (NPG) fault detection under unobvious positive pole current characteristics are two major difficulties. To solve the above issues, a fuzzy granulation interval (FGI) theory-based line fault diagnosis method is proposed in this paper. Only locally measured bus-side voltage and positive pole current signals shared with the converter controller inputs are required. Firstly, the fault characteristics and diagnosis difficulties are analyzed. Then a new NPG fault index interval range (IR) is designed to extract the abnormal post-fault voltage fluctuations. Moreover, the PP/PPG fault classification strategy is designed according to the interval characteristics and capacitor discharge process. Finally, the performance of the proposed method has been evaluated through MATLAB/Simulink simulations and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately discriminate different line faults within 1.5 ms under different fault conditions.</description></item><item><title>Reliability Evaluation of Pilot Virtual-Mesh FREEDMSs by SST Series and Three-Port Power Hub Parallel Energy Routers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10423828</link><description>Integrating FREEDMS and an energy router help overcome the variability and intermittency of renewable resources for energy Internet development. Due to the developed information technology interconnection approach, energy routers are expanding with more and more multi-port topologies, which can be considered as a point-to-point connection approach. In this paper, another connection approach is proposed. On the other hand, recently, SST (series) and three-port power hub (parallel) approaches as energy routers for FREEDMS have been getting more and more attention. However, the existing literature focusing on the reliability of FREEDMS infrastructures still needs to be addressed. The FREEDMS infrastructure enhances the smart grid&#8217;s reliability and resilience to support power to communities, so its reliability evaluation is critical to determine its superiority. This paper addresses and compares the reliability evaluation of existing energy routers by SSTs and Three-Port Power Hubs. Instead of series one, the Pilot Virtual-Mesh FREEDMS infrastructure and a parallel energy router approach are proposed.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Anti-Icing and De-Icing Coordination Scheme for Resilience Enhancement in Distribution Networks Against Ice Storms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443290</link><description>Ice storms can cause serious damage to power distribution systems, thus the development of effective anti-icing and de-icing strategies is of great significance. In this article, an optimal anti-icing and de-icing coordinated operation scheme is proposed to enhance the resilience of distribution systems against ice storms, which is based on the ice-melting capacity of distribution lines. Firstly, a comprehensive risk analysis for anti-icing and de-icing in ice storms is provided. Then, a novel critical condition for anti-icing initiation is proposed based on the weather forecast deviation and potential load loss in distribution systems. On this basis, the coordinated optimization model for anti-icing and de-icing in distribution networks with intelligent soft open point and energy storage systems is established, aims at minimizing the overall load loss. Considering the double risk of overloading anti-icing and de-icing methods, the power flow limit violation function is used in the optimization model to reasonably allocate the proportion of various risks. Finally, the proposed method is verified in the IEEE 33-node distribution network.</description></item><item><title>A Coordinated Emergency Response Scheme for Electricity and Watershed Networks Considering Spatio-Temporal Heterogeneity and Volatility of Rainstorm Disasters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10422813</link><description>This paper proposes a coordinated emergency response scheme for the secure operation and mutual coordination of electricity-watershed networks under spatio-temporal heterogeneity and volatility of rainstorms. The risk interdependencies of water flooding and power outages across power distribution networks (PDNs) and watershed networks (WSNs) are formulated, and a rainstorm-triggered failure model is proposed to quantify the potential spatio-temporal outage risk of PDNs and WSNs. A hyperplane transformation based partition method is developed to extract the uneven spatial distribution and temporal variability of rainfalls. Then, a coupled electricity-watershed network model derived from Saint-Venant partial differential equations (PDEs) is formed to describe the load flow of PDNs and nonuniform hydrodynamic processes of WSNs under compounding impacts of rainstorm variability and failure occurrences. Furthermore, an optimal joint scheduling strategy is proposed to coordinate the dynamic PDN reconfiguration and WSN pump cluster drainage. In order to reduce the computational burden of original PDE-constrained emergency optimization problem, a progressive hedging-based accelerated solution algorithm combined with multiple equivalent linearization techniques is presented. Comparative results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in reducing load shedding and mitigating flood damage losses.</description></item><item><title>Two-Stage Optimal Dispatch of Electricity-Natural Gas Networks Considering Natural Gas Pipeline Leakage and Linepack</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10439984</link><description>The interdependence of electricity and natural gas networks (ENGNs) has led to increased complexity and competing interests among stakeholders. In the event of a leakage failure in a natural gas pipeline, the changes in pipeline parameters pose significant challenges to the optimization and dispatch of natural gas and power grid supply systems. Hence, it would be difficult to simultaneously coordinate the respective interests and reduce the loss of load in the power grid. This paper first presents a natural gas pipeline flow model that accounts for pipeline leakage and linepack, followed by a two-stage dispatch to optimize the benefits for both electricity and natural gas suppliers, where the optimal dispatch with the worst-case scenario is linearized through mixed-integer programming (MIP). Then, a joint solution model for leakage rate and linepack is established based on the macropore leakage model and the dispatch of natural gas suppliers, considering the impact of natural gas flow rate changes on leakage parameters. The actual natural gas supply and the two-stage optimal dispatch are obtained by using the column-and constraint generation (C&amp;amp;CG) method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage optimal dispatch improves the power supply reliability and offers promising economic prospects for ENGNs, where the accuracy of power grid dispatch is significantly improved considering the natural gas pipeline leakage and linepack.</description></item><item><title>Defining and Characterizing Resilient Region of Interdependent Gas and Power Networks Under Extreme Events</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478308</link><description>With the increasing interconnection between gas and power networks, a small fraction of failed components caused by extreme events may trigger widespread cascading failures in an interdependent gas and power network (IGPN). A question of practical interest is how many initially failed components could break down the whole network, which can help us determine the condition for the collapse of the system. Considering that, the resilient region defined by the expected minimal fraction of initially failed components to break down the system is proposed for IGPNs to analyze the system resilience from a macroscopic perspective. To determine the resilient region, an innovative model is proposed based on the combination of percolation theory (that has been widely used in complex science) and statistical physics methods. Specifically, initial stochastic disturbances are simulated by a percolation model which progressively removes failed components from the network, and the percolation threshold (i.e., a critical fraction of failed components breaking down the network) is used as a statistical indicator for the system collapse conditions. On this basis, the boundaries of resilient regions can be characterized by the curves of the percolation threshold, and the corresponding resilience indices are developed. Considering the realistic failure propagation behaviors triggered by initial disturbances, a flow heterogeneity-driven cascading failure (FHCF) model is proposed, by which the resilient region can be computed numerically. Besides, criticality metrics are proposed to evaluate the influence of each component on the resilient region. Finally, the effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on two test IGPNs, and measures to enhance the resilience of IPGNs are concluded.</description></item><item><title>Improving the Load Flexibility of Stratified Electric Water Heaters: Design and Experimental Validation of MPC Strategies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10436431</link><description>Residential electric water heaters have significant load shifting capabilities due to their thermal heat capacity and large energy consumption. Model predictive control (MPC) has been shown to be an effective control strategy to enable water heater load shifting in home energy management systems. In this work, we analyze how modeling tank stratification in an MPC formulation impacts control performance for stratified electric water heaters under time-of-use (TOU) rates. Specifically, we propose an MPC formulation based on a three-node thermal model that captures tank stratification, and compare it to a one-node formulation that does not capture stratification and a standard thermostatic controller. These strategies are compared through both real-time laboratory testing and simulation-based evaluation for different water use patterns. Laboratory experiments show cost reductions of 12.3&#8211;23.2% for the one-node MPC and 31.2&#8211;42.5% for the three-node MPC relative to the thermostatic controller. The performance of the one-node MPC is limited by significant plant-model mismatch, while the three-node formulation better approximates real-world dynamics and results in much more effective cost reduction and load shifting. A simple analysis of how each strategy performs under water use forecast errors is also provided.</description></item><item><title>A Risk Diversification Strategy for Integrated Demand Response Under Imperfect Rationality</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10444038</link><description>Integrated demand response (IDR) is acknowledged as a cost-effective and low-carbon tool that helps alleviate imbalances between energy supply and demand in energy systems. However, the imperfect rationality of consumers can lead to a series of new issues, such as cognitive characteristics of bounded rationality as well as irrationality, subjective uncertainty, and correlated risks. This paper proposes an improved consumer model by using a dynamic subjective weight function with a rationality degree indicator to cope with cognitive characteristics, coupled with a deduced skew distribution modelling the subjective uncertainty. Besides, MESP model is also improved to deal with the correlated risks by managing the diversification level of risks that is defined based on Shannon entropy. The mathematical formulation of the proposed model is expressed as a bi-level stochastic optimization problem, which is equivalently converted into a single-objective optimization problem to be solved efficiently. Simulation results validate advantages of our model in enhancing the accuracy of consumer behavior prediction, effectiveness of incentive strategies, diversification level of response risks, which contributes to achieve a win-win situation between consumers and MESP by decreasing not only total response power deviation as well as cumulative response risks of MESP but also consumer&#8217;s discomfort level.</description></item><item><title>Analytical Fault Modeling of Droop-Controlled IIDG and its Cluster</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10409553</link><description>Fault modeling of inverter-interfaced distributed generators (IIDGs) is the basis of power system fault calculation and protection scheme design. Due to its inherent properties and flexible control strategy, analyzing the transient-state fault responses of droop-controlled IIDG is difficult, and an analytical fault model has yet to be proposed. This work establishes a controlled voltage source-based fault equivalent model of droop-controlled IIDG in synchronous reference frame to address this research gap. The impacts of droop characteristics, virtual impedance, double-closed-loop controller, current limiting, and low-voltage-ride-through requirements are all considered, and the obtained model can cover both the transient- and steady-state fault responses. An IIDG clustering method based on the equivalent admittance matrix of the grid is also proposed, which lays the groundwork for model reduction. A corresponding model aggregation method is then provided. With this, the complexity of fault analysis for peer-to-peer controlled distributed power systems can be significantly reduced. The scheme proposed in this paper is verified by simulation experiments in PSCAD/EMTDC software.</description></item><item><title>Agri-Energy-Environment Synergy-Based Distributed Energy Planning in Rural Areas</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10430377</link><description>Rural passive distribution networks can no longer meet the modern agricultural electrification and cleanliness requirements, and it is urgent to carry out distributed energy planning construction in rural areas. This paper studies the theoretical and methodological aspects of distributed energy planning in rural areas considering crop growth mechanisms. In light of the effects of agricultural load control on agricultural production, we have created a facility-based agricultural load control model rooted in crop physiological ecology. The proposed model encompasses electric irrigation, high-pressure sodium lighting and heating loads. In response to the impact of agricultural load control on carbon emissions in the energy system, carbon cycling within the agricultural and energy systems has been analyzed and modeled. Considering the significant differences in greenhouse load requirements at different growth stages of different crops, the distributed energy planning model is established based on representative daily profiles that reflect typical crop growth patterns. The proposed model constraints encompass constraints related to the healthy growth of crops and constraints within the energy system, with the optimization goal set to minimize the 15-year planning cost. We validate the planning model by applying it to a case study involving a rural energy system in Hebei Province, China, with an annual electricity consumption of 5,600,376 kWh. The adoption of this model led to a cost reduction of  $7.3\times 10^{{ 5}}$  CNY compared to conventional planning methods. The collaborative synergy between agriculture, energy, and the environment manifested in an annual carbon reduction benefit (ACRB) of  $1.7\times 10^{{ 4}}$ CNY from photovoltaic generation and an ACRB of  $1.2\times 10^{{ 4}}$  CNY from greenhouse gas absorption.</description></item><item><title>A Bandwidth-Conscious Event-Based Control Approach to Secondary Frequency Regulation Under Vehicle-to-Grid Service</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433821</link><description>This paper addresses the problem of communication resource-efficient secondary frequency regulation of power grids under vehicle-to-grid supplementary service. First, an event-based frequency regulation framework is established for power grids incorporated with electric vehicle (EV) participation, enabling system performance analysis and control design under event-based communication. The framework also takes into account the EV aggregator dynamics with battery charging/discharging processes under practical travel demands. Second, a novel resource-efficient event-based broadcast mechanism (REBM) is developed for intelligent transmissions of command signals from the dispatch center to the power plant and distributed EV aggregators. By deciding the broadcast actions with the particular consideration of the real-time bandwidth occupancy, the designed REBM is capable to flexibly adapt the command transmission rate to variable network status. Then, a co-design approach to the desired REBM and frequency controller is derived, based on which an implementation algorithm is provided for achieving satisfying secondary frequency regulation performance with enhanced communication efficiency. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed approach is verified through comparative case studies.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Planning of Standalone Net-Zero Energy Systems With Small Modular Reactors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433761</link><description>Renewable-based standalone systems are widely developed worldwide with the decentralization of power and energy systems. However, challenges are posed due to the intermittent nature of renewable resources and the lack of inertia. Small modular reactors (SMRs), a clean but also flexible and controllable energy, can be deployed to provide flexibility and inertia support to standalone energy systems with high penetration of renewable energy. In this paper, we propose a novel standalone net-zero energy system planning scheme that coordinates SMRs with other distributed energy resources, where both steady-state operation constraints and dynamic frequency security constraints are considered to guarantee the operational feasibility of the plan. Since the dynamics of SMR are very complex, the planning model becomes a complex and unanalytical optimization problem. To this end, we first develop a physics-informed data-driven approach to model the dynamic frequency characteristics of SMRs with high accuracy. On this basis, we propose a &#8220;checking and adjusting&#8221; heuristic approach to iteratively solve a series of MILP problems without the non-linear and unanalytical frequency constraint and then check whether the constraint can be satisfied. In this way, we can get a feasible and suboptimal solution in a tractable manner. Comprehensive case studies have been conducted, and results show that the inclusion of SMRs can substantially increase the flexibility and frequency security of standalone net-zero energy systems.</description></item><item><title>Joint Planning of Utility-Owned Distributed Energy Resources in an Unbalanced Active Distribution Network Considering Asset Health Degradation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10436425</link><description>Rapid integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) in active distribution networks (ADNs) necessitates advanced planning methods to optimally determine the size, site, and installation time of DERs. However, existing approaches often assume balanced networks and neglect health degradation of DER assets, limiting the accuracy and practicality of the planning results. This paper proposes a new planning method for utility-owned distributed generators (DGs) and energy storage systems (ESSs) in an unbalanced ADN considering asset health degradation. First, the three-phase branch flow is modeled for unbalanced characteristics of ADNs, and host DERs separately in different phases. Then, based on the Wiener degradation process, the aging path of each DG unit is modeled to estimate its available capacity along with service time; the ESS aging is modeled to reflect the degradation cost during charging and discharging. Finally, a copula-based stochastic programming method is presented considering the correlations between renewables and power demands. The inclusion of market volatility in electricity price uncertainty further enhances planning realism. Numerical case studies on an IEEE-34 bus three-phase ADN demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>MADP-Based Explicit Online Operation Policy for Robust Energy Management of ADN</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10453347</link><description>This paper proposes a multiparametric approximate dynamic programming (MADP)-based explicit online operation policy for the robust energy management problem of active distribution network (ADN). First, the online energy management problem is described from the perspective of distributionally robust optimization (DRO). Then, the risk-averse concept is introduced to quantitatively control the conservativeness of DRO. Considering that it is a complex online optimal problem, which is intractable for traditional algorithms, an MADP-based explicit online operation policy is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm is improved based on the multiparametric programming theory, according to which an explicit online operation policy can be further derived. Compared to traditional online decision-making policies, which need to execute an optimization program, the proposed policy is able to directly obtain solutions through an explicit expression. In this way, the calculation efficiency can be enhanced significantly. Cases on several test systems validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Interaction Dynamics Analysis and Active Stabilization of a Weak Grid-Tied Hybrid PV-Wind Power Generator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10466715</link><description>This paper addresses the dynamic stability of a hybrid photovoltaic (PV) and wind turbine (WT) system tied to a weak grid by back-to-back voltage-source converters (VSCs). The overall system stability is assessed by developing a detailed time-domain nonlinear model (TDNLM) and a linearized state-space model (LSSM). The dynamic interactions at both the peak-power point (PPP) and off-PPP operation of the PV and WT power characteristics curves have been examined. The results reveal that the complete system is stable under PV-only and WT-only generation scenarios at the PPP and off-PPP operation regions. However, the PV-WT hybrid system experiences low- and high-frequency fluctuation instabilities in the current-limited region (CLR) of the PV characteristic due to the interaction between the high dynamic resistances of the PV-WT source and the weak grid. Conversely, the system remains stable at the PPP and voltage-limited region (VLR) of the PV characteristic and in all operational regions of the WT characteristic. Motivated by these challenges, a novel active damping method is proposed to mitigate the interaction dynamics, maintaining overall system stability by relocating unstable eigenmodes and reshaping the dc-link transfer function. The proposed damping method offers several benefits: 1) it is simple yet efficient and can be implemented and modeled using linear analysis tools; 2) it allows for dynamic and stable operation across various operating regions; 3) it does not interfere with steady-state performance in both stiff and weak grid operations; 4) it facilitates successful low-voltage-ride-through (LVRT) at different operating regions; and 5) it effectively addresses its shortcomings by eliminating the need for additional voltage or current sensors, thereby enhancing simplicity and reducing cost in comparison to other approaches. Detailed offline and real-time simulations validate the analytical findings and the effectiveness of the proposed stabilization method under different operational scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Clusters Supported Bi-Level Control System With Lower Communication Requirements for a Distribution Network With Distributed Battery and Photovoltaic Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475702</link><description>This paper proposes a bi-level control framework for dynamic microgrid clusters in a distribution network with distributed photovoltaic and battery storage systems. The proposed bi-level control framework comprises interactive secondary and tertiary level control systems. A distributed event-triggered mechanism is proposed for the secondary level control of each dynamic microgrid cluster to achieve frequency and voltage regulation and balancing of the state of charge of battery storage systems within the cluster. At the tertiary level, a receding horizon model predictive control is implemented to minimize transmission power losses and battery storage systems losses by providing optimal battery storage systems output powers and the voltage source converters output voltages, with a one-minute interval. The secondary level control is modified to implement the optimal solutions provided by the tertiary level model predictive control. Furthermore, the secondary level distributed event-triggered control minimizes unnecessary data transmission by introducing a time delay, resulting in a reduced communication burden. The proposed bi-level control framework is validated in real-time on a modified IEEE 13-node test feeder using RTDS with the tertiary level model predictive control solved on a computer via the hardware-in-loop method.</description></item><item><title>A Contextually Supervised Optimization-Based HVAC Load Disaggregation Methodology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10440142</link><description>This paper presents a novel contextually supervised optimization-based approach for disaggregating heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) loads using smart meter or Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition data. To disaggregate the load into HVAC loads, large and infrequently used loads (LIUL), and base loads, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize a set of five loss terms, consisting of the reconstruction errors of the overall load profile, the ramp rate losses, and three distinct loss functions linked with the HVAC load, base load, and LIUL, respectively. To enhance accuracy, we incorporate two forms of contextual information into the problem formulation. First, we utilize mutual information to estimate HVAC energy consumption. Second, we employ a base load dictionary to constrain HVAC load estimation errors. The obtained HVAC load profiles are fine-tuned by abnormal ramp detection followed by binary hypothesis testing. The proposed method is developed and tested using sub-metered residential and commercial building data. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods across various data resolutions and load aggregation levels, showing excellent transferability and generalizability.</description></item><item><title>Electric Vehicles Charging Time Constrained Deliverable Provision of Secondary Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10411057</link><description>Aggregation of electric vehicles (EVs) is a promising technique for providing secondary frequency regulation (SFR) in highly renewable energy-penetrated power systems. Equipped with energy storage devices, EV aggregation can provide reliable SFR. However, the main challenge is to guarantee reliable intra-interval SFR capacities and inter-interval delivery following the automatic generation control (AGC) signal. Furthermore, aggregated EV SFR provision will be further complicated by the EV charging time anxiety because SFR provision might extend EV&#8217;s charging time. This paper proposes a deliverable EV SFR provision with a charging-time-constrained control strategy. First, a charging-time-constrained EV aggregation is proposed to address the uncertainty of EV capacity based on the state-space model considering the charging-time restriction of EV owners. Second, a real-time economic dispatch and time domain simulation (RTED-TDS) cosimulation framework is proposed to verify financial results and the dynamic performance of the EV SFR provision. Last, the proposed charging time-constrained EV aggregation is validated on the IEEE 39-bus system. The results demonstrate that with charging time-constrained EV aggregation, the dynamic performance of the system can be improved with a marginal increase in total cost. More importantly, the charging time constraint can be respected in the proposed SFR provision of the EV aggregation.</description></item><item><title>An Enhanced SD-GS-AL Algorithm for Coordinating the Optimal Power and Traffic Flows With EVs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10415053</link><description>The electric power distribution network (PDN) and the transportation network (TN) are generally operated/coordinated by different entities. However, they are coupled through electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs). This paper proposes to coordinate the operation of the two systems via a fully decentralized framework where the PDN and TN operators solve their own operation problems independently, with only limited information exchange. Nevertheless, the operation problems of both systems are generally mixed-integer programs (MIP), for which mature algorithms like the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) may not guarantee convergence. This paper applies a novel distributed optimization algorithm called the SD-GS-AL method, which is a combination of the simplicial decomposition, gauss-seidel, and augmented Lagrangian, which can guarantee convergence and optimality for MIPs. However, the original SD-GS-AL may be computationally inefficient for solving a complex engineering problem like the PDN-TN coordinated optimization investigated in this paper. To improve the computational efficiency, an enhanced SD-GS-AL method is proposed by redesigning the inner loop of the algorithm, which can automatically and intelligently determine the iteration number of the inner loop. Simulations on the test cases show the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed framework and algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Graph Reinforcement Learning for Carbon-Aware Electric Vehicles in Power-Transport Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10415871</link><description>Transitioning towards a low-carbon future necessitates massive efforts from both the transport and power sectors. Electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as a promising approach to realize this objective, leveraging their smart routing strategies and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) techniques. Previous studies have addressed various challenges in EV routing and scheduling through model-based optimization methods while ignoring the system uncertainties and dynamics. This paper focuses on studying the carbon-aware EV joint routing and scheduling problem within a coupled power-transport network that can enable EV recharging behaviors within the transport network while concurrently delivering carbon-intensity services within the power network. Specifically, a carbon emission flow model is introduced as a mechanism for tracing and calculating the nodal carbon intensity signals tailored for EVs to provide their carbon services. To solve this problem, we propose a model-free multi-agent reinforcement learning method that harnesses graph convolutional networks to capture essential network features and employs a parameter-sharing framework to learn large-scale control policies. The efficacy and scalability of the proposed method in achieving cost-effective and low-carbon transitions are verified through case studies involving two power-transport networks with 100 and 1,000 EVs, respectively.</description></item><item><title>DiffCharge: Generating EV Charging Scenarios via a Denoising Diffusion Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10418170</link><description>Recent proliferation of electric vehicle (EV) charging load has imposed vital stress on power grid. The stochasticity and volatility of EV charging behaviors render it challenging to manipulate the uncertain charging demand for grid operations and charging management. Charging scenario generation can serve for future EV integration by modeling charging load uncertainties and simulating various realistic charging sessions. To this end, we propose a denoising Diffusion-based Charging scenario generation model coined DiffCharge, which is capable of yielding both battery-level and station-level EV charging time-series data with distinct temporal properties. In principle, the devised model can progressively convert the simply known Gaussian noise to genuine charging demand profiles by learning a parameterized reversal of the forward diffusion process. Besides, we leverage the multi-head self-attention mechanism and prior conditions to capture the unique temporal correlations associated with battery or charging station types in actual charging dynamics. Moreover, we validate the superior generative capacity of DiffCharge on a real-world dataset involving ample charging session records, and attest the efficacy of produced charging scenarios on a practical EV operation problem in the day-ahead electricity market.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Dynamic Pricing of Fast Charging Stations Considering Bounded Rationality of Users and Market Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10423379</link><description>Electric vehicles (EVs), as popular transportation carriers and flexible electric loads, couple both the power distribution networks and transportation networks. The pricing schemes of fast charging stations significantly affects the EVs&#8217; on-tirp charging behaviors and the operations of coupled power and transportation networks. This interdisciplinary paper proposes an optimal dynamic pricing method for fast charging stations to boost charging network operator&#8217; (CNO&#8217;s) profits and avoid excessive charging costs of EVs. Time-varying traffic flow and charging demands are generated by a dynamic traffic assignment simulation, where a boundedly rational dynamic user equilibrium model is presented to capture the cost sensitivity of EVs and gasoline vehicle users. Additionally, a market regulator supervises the CNO&#8217;s pricing, balancing the interests of the CNO and users via a regulation constraint. To address the optimal dynamic pricing issue, we propose a three-level Stackelberg game involving the distribution network operator, CNO, and users. The existence of a game equilibrium is assured by the fixed-point theory. A Gauss-Seidel iteration algorithm with inertia weight is designed to solve the pricing problem. The numerical results have corroborated the effectiveness of the proposed method, illuminating the effects of bounded rationality and market regulation on the CNO&#8217;s profits and users&#8217; travel costs.</description></item><item><title>A Robust V2G Voltage Control Scheme for Distribution Networks Against Cyber Attacks and Customer Interruptions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433072</link><description>A decent vehicle-to-grid (V2G) control scheme improves voltage stability and grid reliability of distribution networks (DNs) by providing reactive power and ancillary services. However, unknown malicious attacks in cyber layers and uncertain EV charging/unplugging in physical layers will disturb the measurement process, leading to controller parameters&#8217; mismatching and severe voltage violations. This paper proposes a robust V2G voltage control scheme for DNs investigating cyber attacks and EV customer interruptions. Firstly, the impact of cyber attacks is characterized by time-varying uncertain matrices function with Lebesgur measurable elements, while the EV customer interruptions are represented by Signum variables. Then, a new state-space equation for V2G voltage control in DNs is constructed by incorporating above matrices function and Signum variables. Moreover, a robust voltage controller is proposed for measurement disordered V2G systems to suppress voltage violations while achieving  $H_{\infty }$  performance. By utilizing linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques, sufficient conditions for system closed-loop exponentially mean-square stability and the controller parameter tuning are presented. Case studies conducted on modified IEEE European low voltage test feeder compare two voltage deviation indices of the proposed controller with those of existing methods, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed approach against measurement anomalies.</description></item><item><title>Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional-Based Recurrent Network for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Demand Forecasting in Energy Market</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10445239</link><description>The increasing adoption of electric vehicles has led to new and unpredictable load conditions for electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs), making charging demand forecasting important to the profitable deployment of EVCSs. Although existing spatial-temporal forecasting models have made significant progress, they ignore the realistic topologies of EVCS networks and the influence of external interference on charging demand. Moreover, limited research exists on developing forecasting models from the perspective of EVCSs participating in the energy market. This paper proposes a novel parallel-structured spatiotemporal mutual residual graph convolution-combined bi-long short-term memory for predicting the charging demand of EVCSs. First, a new mutual adjacency matrix considering both the static and dynamic attributes of EVCSs is constructed. This matrix is then combined with graph convolution and residual blocks to capture multi-level spatial dependencies and map relations between nodes and external factors. Second, to address temporal dependencies, CBi-LSTM combining Bi-LSTM with an additional predictor that considers day-type tendency features is developed. Finally, a parallel structure is adopted to obtain the final prediction results and preserve the integrity of spatiotemporal dependencies. Case studies validated the performance of the proposed model, which demonstrated high forecasting accuracy and the potential for profitable application in the energy market.</description></item><item><title>Resilient Resource Allocations for Multi-Stage Transportation-Power Distribution System Operations in Hurricanes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10445529</link><description>The resilience of distribution networks (DNs) or transportation networks (TNs) has attracted a wide attention due to the frequent occurrence of extreme natural disasters. However, the existing works usually investigate the resilience of two systems independently, which neglects their coordinated operations. This paper models the interactions of DNs and TNs and coordinates multiple resilience enhancement strategies to make a more cost-effective resource allocation scheme for the operation of transportation-power distribution networks (TDNs) in hurricanes. Specifically, resource allocations and TDN operations are designed as a two-stage mixed-integer stochastic programming (TMISP) model, where the first stage is to make resource allocation decisions before the hurricane strikes, and the second stage is to perform multi-stage resilience enhancement strategies to minimize the expected TDN operational losses. The uncertain TDN outages with defensive resources in hurricanes are modeled as decision-dependent uncertainties, which are decoupled into decision-independent uncertainties for generating TDN outage scenarios. A comprehensive scenario reduction method is utilized to reduce the redundancies in simulated scenarios. The penalty-based Gauss-Seidel approach is combined with a scenario-skip technique to solve the TMISP problem with binary variables in both stages. Numerical simulations show that the proposed solution methods provide superior performances in computational efficiency and accuracy, over the traditional scenario reduction and scenario-wise decomposition algorithms in solving the TMISP problem. The investment efficiency is increased with the coordination of various DN and TN resources and multiple resilience enhancement strategies, compared with those of separate allocation schemes.</description></item><item><title>Market-Level Integrated Detection Against Cyber Attacks in Real-Time Market Operations by Self-Supervised Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10426800</link><description>The increasing integration of information and communication technologies into power grids makes the coupling between cyber and physical power system operations intricate. Along with the deregulation of energy markets, there is an increased potential opportunity for cyber attacks, challenging the effectiveness of current cyber protection methods. In a real-time electricity market, attackers can utilize various kinds of cyber attacks to cause significant financial losses and create catastrophic consequences for grid operations. Therefore, detecting cyber attacks in the real-time market is crucial. However, most of the existing detection methods are primarily designed to identify a single type of attack. Furthermore, there is a scarcity of research focused on developing market-level detection methods against cyber attacks based on market-level behaviors. To fill the above gap, in this paper a novel self-supervised learning based method is proposed to detect multiple types of cyber attacks by analyzing real-time locational marginal prices (RTLMPs) data. Specifically, an autoencoder-enhanced generative adversarial network (GAN)-based method is proposed to examine the spatial-temporal correlations of RTLMPs, and determine whether the RTLMPs are compromised by the attackers or not. Finally, Midcontinent Independent System Operator data are employed for case studies, and simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed data-driven method.</description></item><item><title>Risk-Sensitive Mobile Battery Energy Storage System Control With Deep Reinforcement Learning and Hybrid Risk Estimation Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10415092</link><description>The mobile battery energy storage systems (MBESS) utilize flexibility in temporal and spatial to enhance smart grid resilience and economic benefits. Recently, the high penetration of renewable energy increases the volatility of electricity prices and gives MBESS an opportunity for price difference arbitrage. However, the strong randomness of both the traffic system and renewable energy leads to difficulty in achieving profit with acceptable risk. To address this problem, this paper proposes a risk-sensitive MBESS control framework based on safe deep reinforcement learning, which can constrain the risk under a certain level according to the company&#8217;s risk preference. The risk-estimation safe deep deterministic policy gradient (RE-SDDPG) algorithm is proposed to learn the optimal policy under the premise of lacking direct risk signals. Moreover, a hybrid risk estimation method is proposed to avoid local convergence caused by inaccurate estimation during the learning process. Last, a parameter-sharing method is applied to increase learning efficiency by sharing the Q networks&#8217; parameters. The proposed methods are tested in the IEEE 30-bus system. The results show that the proposed method can keep the profit at a relatively high level while reducing the risk and increase learning efficiency compared with existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Cyber-Resilience of Power Systems&#8217; AGC Sensor Data by Time Series to Image Domain Encoding</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10418545</link><description>The shift to wide area networks (WANs) in power systems has introduced security challenges. While research has focused on attack detection, adversaries can outsmart even advanced anomaly detectors. Further, existing techniques fail to ensure data confidentiality, exposing telemetered data to eavesdropping. To address these evolving threats, we propose a novel framework to enhance power system data communication security over WANs. This innovative approach combines time series to image transformation, digital watermarking, and machine learning. These elements collaboratively encode sensor data into an unintelligible format, maintaining operational impact. We begin by converting time-series data into images with the Gramian Angular Field algorithm. These images are subtly embedded with invisible watermarks. The framework introduces an additional security layer to detect image tampering during communication. Using an Autoencoder-Support Vector Regression model, we restore the watermarked images to the original time series. Notably, the watermarking method is system-independent, maintains sensor data confidentiality, and certifies data integrity. In time-critical power system operations, traditional encryption and authentication can introduce latency. The proposed approach minimizes computational overhead and ensures real-time responsiveness, effectively securing power system data communications. To demonstrate the proposed framework&#8217;s effectiveness, experiments were conducted on the IEEE-39 bus system&#8217;s Automatic Generation Control system.</description></item><item><title>Data Protection Method Against Cross-Domain Inference Threat in Cyber&#8211;Physical Power Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10423301</link><description>Recent advancement of data-driven methods has enabled the mining of associations among various data sets, particularly those generated from cyber-physical power grids (CPPG) where different measurements may be inherently coupled by an underlying system. As such, attackers may infer sensitive parameters jointly from several publicly shared electricity data across different security domains based on their revealed associations. Traditional data protection methods, mainly focusing on reducing the risks of direct data probing, may not be applicable to properly guard sensitive information in such scenarios. In this paper, we elaborate on such a data security issue, namely cross-domain inference (CDI), and then propose the decoder-ensemble variational autoencoder (DE-VAE) which is used for noise-adding to protect against such attack. The DE-VAE is designed with a mutual information maximization scheme to preserve the original usability of the noise-added data. Meanwhile, a multi-objective optimization is solved to achieve a trade-off between privacy protection and data usability. Our protection method is evaluated on experiments involving four real-world scenarios in the modern sensor-rich smart power grid. The experimental results show that our method can provide effective protection ability against CDI threats without sacrificing much usability, and achieves a performance gain of more than 45% compared to several non-trivial baselines.</description></item><item><title>DAMGAT-Based Interpretable Detection of False Data Injection Attacks in Smart Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433005</link><description>False data injection attacks (FDIAs) significantly disrupt the secure operation of smart grids by manipulating the measured values collected by intelligent instruments. Existing studies have utilized deep learning techniques to enhance the detection of FDIAs, however, these studies often overlook the spatial correlation between power grid topology and measurement data. Meanwhile, the high complexity of deep neural network severely impedes the interpretability of detection models, resulting in the incredibility of detection results. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes an interpretable deep learning FDIAs detection method, named dual-attention multi-head graph attention network, DAMGAT. The DAMGAT introduces a dual-attention mechanism that incorporates both node feature attention and spatial topology attention into a multi-head graph attention network. This mechanism efficiently aggregates attack characteristics and spatial topology information by dynamically capturing the potential correlations between FDIAs detection and measurement data. Furthermore, the proposed model can provide clear and credible interpretations for high-accuracy detection results via analyzing features and spatial topology attention weights. Extensive simulations are performed using the IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus test systems. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art FDIA detection methods in terms of accuracy, while also providing reasonable interpretability for features and spatial dimensions.</description></item><item><title>FDI Attack Estimation and Event-Triggered Resilient Control of DC Microgrids Under Hybrid Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443300</link><description>In this paper, false-data-injection (FDI) attack estimation and event-triggered resilient control of DC microgrid (DC-MG) systems under FDI and denial-of-service (DoS) hybrid attacks are studied. In order to describe more general DoS attack characteristics, a time-constrained DoS attack (TCDA) model is established. This model only requires attack duration information compared to the classic DoS model. Based on the above TCDA model, a new event-based switching DC-MG system model with FDI attack compensation is established by using pulse observer, event-triggered mechanism and switching state feedback control law. In addition, by using the piecewise time-varying Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method related to the attack parameters, the sufficient conditions for the exponential stability of the closed-loop system are given. More importantly, a joint design scheme of event-based state feedback controller and FDI observer is proposed to realize FDI attack estimation and event-triggered resilient control under hybrid attacks of DC-MG. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed joint design scheme is demonstrated through the experimental study of DC-MG with two constant power loads.</description></item><item><title>A Monolithic Cybersecurity Architecture for Power Electronic Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443303</link><description>Power electronic systems (PES) face significant threats from various data availability and integrity attacks, significantly affecting the performance of communication networks and power system operation. As a result, several attack detection and reconstruction techniques are deployed, which makes it a costly &amp; complex cybersecurity operational platform with significant room for incremental extensions for mitigation against future threats. Unlike the said traditional arrangements, our paper introduces a foundational approach by establishing a monolithic cybersecurity architecture (MCA) via incorporating semantic principles into the sampling process for distributed energy resources (DERs). This unified approach concurrently compensates for the intrusion challenges posed by cyber attacks by reconstructing signals using the dynamics of the inner control layer. This reconstruction considers essential semantic attributes, like Priority, Freshness, and Relevance to ensure resilient dynamic performance. Hence, the proposed scheme promises a generalized route to concurrently tackle a global set of cyber attacks in elevating the resilience of PES. Finally, rigorous validation on a modified IEEE 69-bus distribution system and a real-world South California Edison (SCE) 47-bus network, using OPAL-RT under diverse operating conditions, underscores its robustness, model-free design capability, scalability, and adaptability to dynamic cyber graphs and system reconfiguration.</description></item><item><title>Wide Area Measurement-Based Cyber-Attack-Resilient Breaker Failure Protection Scheme</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10458870</link><description>Breaker Failure Protection trips the backup breakers when the primary breaker fails, causing a significant loss of load. Hence, a cyber-attack on the Breaker Failure Protection scheme may lead to major disturbance in a power system. Currently, there is a lack of literature addressing the cyber-attack on Breaker Failure Protection scheme. This paper proposes a novel Wide Area Measurement-based cyber-attack-resilient Breaker Failure Protection scheme. Modern digital relays have Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) integrated with them. A digital relay with PMU functionality is called Relay-PMU in this work. The proposed scheme has two parts. Part 1 is named as Synchrophasor-based Fault Validation Algorithm. It checks whether the Breaker Failure Protection operation is genuine or due to a cyber-attack. Breaker Failure Protection Relay-PMU will trigger the Part 1 of the proposed scheme which runs in a Phasor Data Concentrator. A novel concept named Dynamic Relay White-listing is proposed to avoid the usage of phasors from the susceptible Relay-PMUs. Part 2 is the modifications to the logics of the existing common Breaker Failure Protection schemes to incorporate the decision from the Synchrophasor-based Fault Validation Algorithm. The proposed scheme is computationally efficient and compatible with all common Breaker Failure Protection schemes. PSCAD simulations of the IEEE-118 bus system validate the proposed scheme. The execution time of the proposed scheme in the lab implementation setup adheres to the timeline of the Breaker Failure Protection scheme.</description></item><item><title>Customized Load Profiles Synthesis for Electricity Customers Based on Conditional Diffusion Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10438078</link><description>Customers&#8217; load profiles are critical resources to support data analytics applications in modern power systems. However, there are usually insufficient historical load profiles for data analysis, due to the collection cost and data privacy issues. To address such data shortage problems, load profiles synthesis is an effective technique that provides synthetic training data for customers to build high-performance data-driven models. Nonetheless, it is still challenging to synthesize high-quality load profiles for each customer using generation models trained by the respective customer&#8217;s data owing to the high heterogeneity of customer load. In this paper, we propose a novel customized load profiles synthesis method based on conditional diffusion models for heterogeneous customers. Specifically, we first convert the customized synthesis into a conditional data generation issue. We then extend traditional diffusion models to conditional diffusion models to realize conditional data generation, which can synthesize exclusive load profiles for each customer according to the customer&#8217;s load characteristics and application demands. In addition, to implement conditional diffusion models, we design a noise estimation model with stacked residual layers, which improves the generation performance by using skip connections. The attention mechanism is also utilized to better extract the complex temporal dependency of load profiles. Finally, numerical case studies based on a public dataset are conducted to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>LDM: A Generic Data-Driven Large Distribution Network Operation Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10498082</link><description>With the growing intelligence of power grids, the application of data-driven AI technologies has been widely studied in distribution network (DN) control and operation. However, most existing studies can only address a specific task. The recent surge of powerful, versatile AI models has inspired us to explore whether the grid controller can also evolve toward greater intelligence, enabling it to perform multiple DN operation tasks. To this end, this letter proposes a novel generic data-driven Large Distribution network operation Model (LDM) based on multitask reinforcement learning (MTRL). It can concurrently learn multiple DN operation skills and perform distinct tasks separately. Specifically, to effectively handle the unaligned heterogeneous action spaces across different tasks, action-masking is incorporated. Case studies on a modified 33-bus system prove the generalization capabilities of LDM.</description></item><item><title>Enabling Reliable Water&#8211;Air Direct Optical Wireless Communication for Uncrewed Vehicular Networks: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10468635</link><description>The next generation wireless networks demand full coverage from the sky to the deep ocean, in which the water-air cross-boundary communication is a critical component in a coordinated uncrewed vehicular network that connects both uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). In such a network, optical wireless communication (OWC) is an emerging and promising technology to implement direct high-speed wireless communication through the water-to-air interface. However, due to the high directionality of optical beams and the dynamics of the harsh oceanic environments, it faces significant challenges to achieve reliable and robust seamless cross-boundary communication, as the waves cause beam deflection and the mobility of the transceivers makes the link worse or even results in link disconnections. To deal with these challenges, in this paper, we investigate both static and mobile application scenarios to enable reliable water-air direct optical communications via the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches. In the static scenario, we propose an active alignment method and derive the optimal beamwidth to satisfy the requirement of bit error rate (BER) and improve the link availability. To cope with the oceanic environment-induced channel dynamics, in the mobile scenario, we design a DRL-based UAV control strategy by incorporating the extended Kalman filter (EKF) prediction technique to enhance reliable communication between the mobile transceivers. The numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed schemes achieve impressive performance in terms of energy consumption and reliable communications under both the static and mobile scenarios.</description></item><item><title>RIS-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems With Channel Aging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10468556</link><description>Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) are two disruptive technologies for enabling the sixth-generation network. In this paper, we investigate the effect of channel aging on the RIS-aided CF massive MIMO systems over spatially correlated channels. We consider a minimum mean square error channel estimator that facilitates the derivation of closed-form spectral efficiency expressions. For the uplink, we compare the large-scale fading decoding method with the centralized decoding method. For the downlink, we adopt the maximum ratio precoding and propose a practical fractional power control method to improve the performance. Based on the analytical framework, we unveil the interplay between channel aging, spatial correlation, and signal processing methods. Our results demonstrate that the RIS-aided CF massive MIMO system outperforms the conventional CF counterpart system in both static and mobile scenarios. Moreover, when the link is weak, the introduction of RIS can lead to even more substantial performance enhancement. Also, RIS can be deployed to compensate for system performance degradation caused by channel aging and potentially lead to energy savings, while still achieving excellent performance. Intriguingly, due to the mutual coupling of RIS element and AP antenna correlations, RIS can effectively mitigate the negative effects caused by spatial correlation among AP antennas. Furthermore, we provide a practical rule-of-thumb guideline for designing resource block length, accounting for the impacts caused by channel aging.</description></item><item><title>Goal-Oriented Transmission Scheduling for Energy-Efficient Wireless Networked Control in SAGIN: An AoI-Thresholding Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10473131</link><description>Addressing the goal-oriented design for mission-critical services like remote control, stands as a pivotal challenge in the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN). This paper investigates an energy-efficient wireless networked control system with local and remote controllers in SAGIN. Frequent state transmission from sensor to remote controller would improve the quality of control (QoC) at the expense of nontrivial energy consumption. Nevertheless, such a tradeoff for the considered system has received little attention. In this sense, we propose a goal-oriented transmission scheduling design to balance QoC and energy consumption. In particular, we formulate an optimization problem on minimizing the weighted sum of control cost and power consumption by making decisions about whether to transmit the state or not. By formulating a Markov Decision Process framework, the optimal transmission scheduling policy is proven to have a threshold structure tied to the age of information (AoI). Then, the optimal AoI threshold is obtained by means of a discrete-time Markov chain. Equipped with this, we propose an AoI-thresholding mechanism that can provide insights into when to transmit the state in a computationally-efficient manner. Numerical results shed light on the advantages of the proposed policy over the periodical and greedy transmission policies for the considered system.</description></item><item><title>Message Passing-Based Joint Channel Estimation and Signal Detection for OTFS With Superimposed Pilots</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475591</link><description>Receivers with joint channel estimation (CE) and signal detection using superimposed pilots (SP) can achieve high transmission efficiency in orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) systems. However, existing receivers have high computational complexity, hindering their practical applications. In this work, with SP in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain and the generalized complex exponential (GCE) basis expansion modeling (BEM) for channels, a message passing-based SP-DD iterative receiver is proposed, which drastically reduces the computational complexity while with marginal performance loss, compared to existing ones. To facilitate CE in the proposed receiver, we design pilot signal to achieve pilot power concentration in the frequency domain, thereby developing an SP-DD-D receiver that can reduce the power of the pilot signal with almost no loss of CE and bit error rate (BER) performance. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SP-DD-D receiver.</description></item><item><title>Enhancement of Direct LEO Satellite-to-Smartphone Communications by Distributed Beamforming</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475582</link><description>The Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite network is undergoing rapid development with the maturing of satellite communications and rocket launch technologies, and the demand for a global coverage network. However, current satellite communication networks are constrained by limited transmitting signal power, resulting in the use of large-size and energy-consuming ground terminals to provide additional gain. This paper proposes a novel technology called distributed beamforming to address such challenges and support direct communications from LEO satellites to smartphones. The proposed distributed beamforming technique is based on the superposition of Electromagnetic (EM) waves and aims to enhance the received signal strength. Furthermore, we utilize EM wave superposition to increase the link budget and provide the coverage pattern formed by the distributed antenna array, which will be affected by the array structure and the transmitter parameters. In addition, the impact of Doppler frequency shift and time misalignment on the performance of distributed beamforming is investigated. Numerical results show that the enhancement of the received power depends on the angle formed by those radiated beams and can be up to the square of the number of beams; namely, a maximum enhancement of 6 dB could be obtained by using two satellites and a maximum of 12 dB increase through four satellites, which provide a clear guideline for the design of distributed beamforming for future satellite communications.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Federated Learning via Joint Communication and Computation Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10476747</link><description>Federated learning (FL) is a promising distributed framework that a server leverages a large number of clients to collaboratively learn a model while keeping the privacy of their local data. However, the heterogeneity of computation and communication resources among clients, which maybe lead to the different time arriving at the server, has a negative effect on the convergence of FL algorithms because the stragglers heavily slow down the runtime. In this paper, we develop a joint optimization model of client central processing unit (CPU) frequency, channel assignment, power allocation and local model accuracy based on a designated global model accuracy to minimize the maximum delay of communication and computation of all participating clients. Unfortunately, this problem is a non-convex mixed-integer programming, which is NP-hard. Thus, an equivalent problem by transforming discrete variables into continuous ones is first developed in order to make the original problem tractable. Then we propose a novel Alternating Momentum Gradient Descent with Variable Similarity (AMGDVS) algorithm to solve the min-max problem, which incorporates a similarity index into the previous partial gradients so as to consider the interaction of variables. The proposed AMGDVS algorithm converges to the first-order stationary point with the accuracy factor being $\eta$ within $\mathcal {O}(\eta ^{-4})$ iterations. Our simulations, conducted under various parameter settings, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the average training time for learning an FL model on FMNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, both in the Independent Identically Distributed (IID) and Non-Independent Identically Distributed (Non-IID) scenarios, is noticeably reduced.</description></item><item><title>Joint Power and Pilot Length Allocation for Ultra-Reliable and High-Throughput Transmission</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10484984</link><description>Emerging services in Tactile Internet are expected to bring immersive experience for customers in watching live sports, action films, and advertisements, which demand ultra-reliable and high-throughput transmission. Since the power budget and the block length are limited for communications, allocating the transmit power and the pilot length becomes critical for efficient data transmission from the base station (BS) to the devices. In this work, taking the coding theory of finite blocklength and the resource allocation over channel estimation and data transmission into account, both data error probability and throughput are analyzed and optimized in terms of the pilot power and pilot length, respectively. It is revealed that both the data error probability and the throughput are quasiconcave and quasiconvex, respectively, with respect to ($w.r.t.$) the pilot length and the power of pilot signal from a block-level perspective. Regarding a frame consisting of multiple blocks, we propose the truncated channel inversion scheme to allocate the data transmission power over multiple blocks. Given the length of pilots, the average data error probability and the average throughput for a frame are proved to be quasiconcave and quasiconvex, respectively, $w.r.t.$ the desired power level of the received data signal. We propose a sub-optimal algorithm for frame-wise throughput maximization to derive the length of the pilots and the desired power level of the received data signal. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the fixed transmission power scheme in terms of the average data error probability for a frame by reducing an order of magnitude under the same system power constraints.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid RFF Identification for LTE Using Wavelet Coefficient Graph and Differential Spectrum</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10487783</link><description>The growing popularity of 4 G/5 G mobile devices has led to an increase in demand for wireless security. Radio frequency fingerprint (RFF) technique is an emerging approach for device authentication using intrinsic and unique hardware impairments. In this paper, we propose an RFF-based method to identify rogue/unknown long term evolution (LTE) terminals. This is achieved by combining wavelet transform (WT) coefficient graphs and differential spectrum. The proposed method involves extracting 48 levels of wavelet coefficients from the transient power-off of the physical random access channel (PRACH) signal and representing them in a WT graph. The steady-state part of the PRACH signal after a frequency domain differential processing between the adjacent spectrum is extracted. To detect unknown attack devices, an identification scheme based on an autoencoder (AE) is designed. Two different AE network structures are designed based on the proposed features, and a hybrid identification structure is proposed. An experimental evaluation system is set up with seven mobile phones from three categories and one universal software radio peripheral (USRP) software-defined radio (SDR) platform. Training and testing datasets are collected under different conditions such as location, working times, and dates. Experimental results show that rogue devices can be identified with an accuracy up to 98.84% for different categories and 90.27% for different individuals.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Task Deep Reinforcement Learning for Terahertz NOMA Resource Allocation With Hybrid Discrete and Continuous Actions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10480465</link><description>Terahertz (THz) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks have great potential for next-generation wireless communications, by providing promising ultra-high data rates and user fairness. In THz-NOMA networks, efficient and effective long-term beamforming-bandwidth-power (BBP) allocation is yet an open problem due to its non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) nature. In this article, the continuous property of power and sub-arrays ratios assignment and the discrete property of sub-bands allocation are carefully treated. In light of these attributes, an offline hybrid discrete and continuous actions (DISCO) multi-task deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is proposed to maximize the long-term throughput. Specifically, the deployment of multi-task learning enables the actor of DISCO to smartly integrate two state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, e.g., actor-critic (AC) that only selects discrete actions and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) that only generates continuous actions. Rigorous theoretical derivations for the neural network design and backpropagation process are provided to tailor our proposed DISCO for the BBP problem. Compared to the benchmark no-learning and conventional DRL algorithms, DISCO enhances the network throughput, while achieving good fairness among users. Furthermore, DISCO consumes hundred-of-millisecond computational time, revealing the practicability of DISCO.</description></item><item><title>Learning-Based One-Bit Maximum Likelihood Detection for Massive MIMO Systems: Dithering-Aided Adaptive Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10480278</link><description>In this paper, we propose a learning-based detection framework for uplink massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems with one-bit analog-to-digital converters. The learning-based detection only requires counting the occurrences of the quantized outputs of $+1$ and $-1$ for estimating a likelihood probability at each antenna. Accordingly, the key advantage of this approach is to perform maximum likelihood detection without explicit channel estimation which has been one of the primary challenges of one-bit quantized systems. However, due to the quasi-deterministic reception in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, one-bit observations in the high SNR regime are biased to either $+1$ or $-1$, and thus, the learning requires excessive training to estimate the small likelihood probabilities. To address this drawback, we propose a dither-and-learning technique to estimate likelihood functions from dithered signals. First, we add a dithering signal to artificially decrease the SNR and then infer the likelihood function from the quantized dithered signals by using an SNR estimate derived from a deep neural network-based estimator which is trained offline. We extend our technique by developing an adaptive dither-and-learning method that updates the dithering power according to the patterns observed in the quantized dithered signals. The proposed framework is also applied to channel-coded MIMO systems by computing a bit-wise and user-wise log-likelihood ratio from the refined likelihood probabilities. Simulation results validate the performance of the proposed methods in both uncoded and coded systems.</description></item><item><title>Effective Joint Scheduling and Power Allocation for URLLC-Oriented V2I Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10480268</link><description>Future vehicular applications, such as safety guarantee and autonomous driving, rely on vehicular-to-infrastructure (V2I) ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). This paper investigates the flow scheduling and power allocation mechanism to improve the transmission capacity of the downlink V2I orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) URLLC network. Given the stringent latency requirements, short package transmission is adopted and the approximation of the finite blocklength codes capacity is introduced for the algorithm design. Also in the system design, we fully consider the effect of Doppler spread caused by high vehicular mobility. We formulate the problem of maximizing the number of flows that satisfy delay and reliability requirements while meeting the constrained radio and power resources. To solve this challenging non-convex problem, we propose a joint optimization framework for flow scheduling and power allocation. In the scheduling phase, we propose a deferred acceptance based flow scheduling algorithm by leveraging matching game. In the power allocation phase, we design a collection-reallocation algorithm for local power optimization while fully considering the dynamic characteristics of V2I scenarios. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme effectively enhances the system performance compared to other state-of-art mechanisms.</description></item><item><title>STAR-RIS Assisted Offloading Based on Hybrid NOMA: A Time Minimization Perspective</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10487893</link><description>The simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) has emerged as a novel concept and promising technology for future wireless networks. In this article, we propose a STAR-RIS assisted multi-access edge computing (MEC) framework, where the user offloads the tasks to multiple edge nodes, and the STAR-RIS is deployed to enable and enhance the multiple offloading links at the same time. Meanwhile, the hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access (h-NOMA) is adopted to further improve the performance of the STAR-RIS assisted downlink parallel offloading. We aim to minimize the latency by jointly optimizing the offloading order and task division to the edge nodes, the time allocation for the time-division multiple access (TDMA) transmission and the NOMA transmission in the h-NOMA scheme, the transmit power and the decoding orders when employing NOMA, and the transmitting and reflecting coefficients at the STAR-RIS. To solve this highly complex optimization problem, we first derive the optimal solutions of the time allocation and task division in closed forms, and then propose a low-complexity alternative optimizing (AO) algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) technique to optimize the allocation of radio resources. Simulation results show that the proposed STAR-RIS assisted offloading scheme based on h-NOMA can effectively reduce the time latency compared with benchmark schemes, especially when the number of the STAR-RIS elements is small.</description></item><item><title>Secure and Distributed IoV Data Sharing Scheme Based on a Hybrid PoS Blockchain Protocol</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10480287</link><description>Internet of Vehicles (IoV) enables vehicles and other smart terminals to share data in order to improve traffic safety and efficiency. With the increase in data volume and data interaction frequency, the burden of the central server increases dramatically, and it is difficult for resource-limited vehicles to store and verify all messages in the untrusted environment as well. Therefore, a secure and distributed IoV data-sharing scheme needs to be constructed. This paper proposes a hybrid proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain consensus and constructs a secure and efficient distributed IoV data-sharing scheme based on it. In this scheme, participants can store and share data securely in a distributed way through blockchain. The hybrid PoS blockchain consensus, where block producers are chosen based on their own stakes, and multiple trusted managers supervise each other updating head blocks periodically, maintains a more secure blockchain as a consistent and tamper-proof record for data sharing, than some researches using existing consensus, as shown in the security analysis. Every entity can participate in the blockchain consensus equally, without consuming high computation power, which improves the distribution degree and achieves co-governance of the IoV system. The performance evaluation shows that referring to the Gini coefficient, our scheme achieves a higher degree of decentralization than other schemes with only RSUs participants. In this way, vehicles collaborating with roadside units, realize distributed storage and secure data sharing to whoever with their authorization.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Pricing for Vehicle Dispatching in Mobility-as-a-Service Market via Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475562</link><description>Vehicle dispatching in the mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) market has gradually become a situation of multi-service provider competition and coexistence. However, most existing research on vehicle dispatching with dynamic pricing for the MaaS market is still limited to single-service provider scenarios. In this paper, we propose an economic model that analyzes the vehicle dispatching service pricing and demand interactions between multiple mobility service providers (MSPs) and passengers, respectively. We formulate the vehicle dispatching service pricing and demand problem as a two-stage Stackelberg game under different pricing schemes, namely, independent pricing scheme (IPS) and competitive pricing scheme (CPS), considering the vehicle supply-demand relationship and market competition among the MSPs. The MSPs, as leaders, set their service pricing strategies first, and then the passengers, as the followers, determine their service demands. Due to the high-dimensional and complicated nature of the dynamic MaaS market environment, we develop a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm to achieve the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the formulated game, which indicates the optimal pricing and demand strategies for MSPs and passengers. Simulation results and analysis show that the proposed MADRL-based algorithm converges to the optimal solution and outperforms other benchmark schemes under both IPS and CPS in terms of maximizing MSPs' revenue and protecting passengers' benefits. Furthermore, the proposed MADRL-based algorithm under CPS improves MSPs' market attractiveness and long-term benefits, which encourages MSPs to participate in competitive vehicle dispatching in the MaaS market.</description></item><item><title>Energy-Efficient Resource Management for Multi-UAV-Enabled Mobile Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10477460</link><description>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely utilized to expand wireless network coverage and provide computation service for Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices in signal-blocked or shadowed environments. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-UAV-enabled mobile edge computing (MEC) architecture in which multiple UAVs provide both communication and computation services for IoT devices that cannot directly access the ground edge clouds. To achieve min-max fairness of energy consumption among UAVs, we minimize the maximal energy consumption among UAVs by jointly optimizing computation offloading decisions, communication and computation resource allocation, UAV positions, and task splitting decisions, while meeting the delay requirement of all tasks. The required optimization is a large-scale mixed-integer non-linear program that is generally intractable. To solve this problem, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm based on the successive convex approximation (SCA). The simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms various baseline schemes in processing computation-intensive and latency-critical tasks.</description></item><item><title>Task Offloading and Energy Optimization in Hybrid UAV-Assisted Mobile Edge Computing Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10477451</link><description>The paper considers a more challenging task offloading scenario in hybrid UAV-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) systems, where multiple dual-function UAVs tour in the sky to serve ground users (GUs) by acting as edge servers or aerial relays. Since each task can be executed on GUs, UAVs and the base station (BS) in parallel, the service assignment, task splitting, trajectory of UAVs, as well as resource and transmission power of both UAVs and GUs should be jointly optimized to minimize the system energy consumption with the subjection of the maximum tolerable latency and computing limitations. To tackle such mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combined successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm is proposed in the paper to seek a close optimal solution with low-complexity. In specific, the binary service assignment and continuous task splitting are obtained by DRL, while the trajectory planning and resource scheduling are jointly optimized by SCA in sequence to speed up the convergence. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed DRL-SCA algorithm equipped with dual-function UAV scheme is more effective in making full use of the on-board resource of UAVs and reducing the overall system energy consumption.</description></item><item><title>Energy-Aware Joint Route Selection and Resource Allocation in Heterogeneous Satellite Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10496916</link><description>In order to ensure efficient data transmission from satellites to ground stations (GSs), resource allocation schemes must be designed. In cases where direct data transmission from satellites to GSs is not possible due to a dynamic network topology and limited contact time, efficient relay selection or route selection schemes should be employed. This paper considers a satellite communication network in which a number of source low earth orbit(SLEO) satellites are attempting to transmit their data flows to the designated GSs. To improve the transmission performance of the data flows, one geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO) satellite and a number of relay LEO (RLEO) satellites in the network are used as relays. To maximize energy efficiency, a joint route selection and resource allocation mechanism is proposed. The energy cost of the system, which is the sum of the energy cost of the SLEO satellites and the RLEO satellites, is used to formulate the joint route selection and resource allocation as a system energy cost minimization problem. Since the original optimization problem is NP hard, it is transformed into three subproblems: inter-satellite power allocation, satellite-ground power allocation, and route selection. These subproblems are solved using a greedy algorithm, the Lagrange dual method, and a matching-based heuristic algorithm, respectively. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Multi-Objective Dynamic Offloading Scheduling for Air&#8211;Ground Cooperative MEC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475575</link><description>Utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with edge server to assist terrestrial mobile edge computing (MEC) has attracted tremendous attention. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art schemes based on deterministic optimizations or single-objective reinforcement learning (RL) cannot reduce the backlog of task bits and simultaneously improve energy efficiency in highly dynamic network environments, where the design problem amounts to a sequential decision-making problem. In order to address the aforementioned problems, as well as the curses of dimensionality introduced by the growing number of terrestrial terrestrial users, this paper proposes a distributed multi-objective (MO) dynamic trajectory planning and offloading scheduling scheme, integrated with MORL and the kernel method. The design of n-step return is also applied to average fluctuations in the backlog. Numerical results reveal that the n-step return can benefit the proposed kernel-based approach, achieving significant improvement in the long-term average backlog performance, compared to the conventional 1-step return design. Due to such design and the kernel-based neural network, to which decision-making features can be continuously added, the kernel-based approach can outperform the approach based on fully-connected deep neural network, yielding improvement in energy consumption and the backlog performance, as well as a significant reduction in decision-making and online learning time.</description></item><item><title>ICNet: GNN-Enabled Beamforming for MISO Interference Channels With Statistical CSI</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478677</link><description>This paper proposes a graph neural network (GNN) based model, termed interference channel net (ICNet), for multiple-input single-output (MISO) interference channels with statistical channel state information (CSI). After a graphic representation of MISO interference channels, the ICNet directly maps the statistical CSI to the beamforming vectors, and the attention mechanism is adopted to jointly utilize the node and edge features. Via unsupervised learning, the ICNet is able to solve the outage-constrained energy efficiency maximization problem. Numerical results show that the ICNet is with millisecond-level inference time compared to the second-level inference time of the convex optimization based algorithm and achieves less than 5% average optimality loss to the convex optimization based algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Inter-Carrier Interference Reduction Technique for Backscattered OFDM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10480310</link><description>The objective of this letter is to improve the bit error performance of backscattering sensors that implement Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). Many recent works in the literature have demonstrated the implementation of OFDM transmission from backscattering tags. A persistent shortcoming in such systems is the Bit Error Rate (BER) floor due to increased levels of Inter-Carrier Interference resulting from spectral spreading. In this letter, the authors employ unused subcarriers of the OFDM modulator to design an interference cancellation signal. The time domain signal is matched to the resolution of the impedance switching states of the tag. Significant suppression of the inter-carrier interference is possible with roughly equal numbers of used and unused subcarriers. Lower interference values result in lower BER floors. Furthermore, this technique allows the use of a larger number of data subcarriers than other existing techniques in the literature. The tag energy consumption per bit can therefore be reduced.</description></item><item><title>Physical Layer Security for Near-Field Communications via Directional Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10480457</link><description>Recently, near-field communications (NFCs) have drawn great attention for the near-field region expansion in the context of extremely large-scale (XL) antenna arrays, tremendously high frequencies, and new types of antennas trends. Considering the distinctive spherical wave propagation model in NFC, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques, such as channel modelling and estimation as well as hybrid beamforming technologies, have recently undergone reevaluation and redesign. Concurrently, as the NFC range continues to broaden, ensuring physical layer security (PLS) has emerged as an equally urgent concern, necessitating immediate attention and resolution. Therefore, in this contribution, we propose a single-user (SU) multiple-input single-output (MISO) near-field directional modulation (NFDM) system toward secure transmissions at both angular and distance scales. Furthermore, considering the hardware cost associated with XL arrays, a fully analog secure precoding algorithm integrated beamforming with artificial noise (AN) as well as power allocation is devised under the modulus-1 constraint of the phase shifters. Finally, simulation results indicate that the proposed NFDM scheme is capable of guaranteeing security at both angular and distance scales compared with its conventional far-field counterpart.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid MRT and ZF Learning for Energy-Efficient Transmission in Multi-RIS-Assisted Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10480579</link><description>The deep reinforcement learning-based transmission design for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted multiple input single output networks is investigated in this research. An energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem is formulated under constraints of the rate requirement, the power budget and the phase shift coefficient. To be adaptable to various wireless channel conditions, a novel model-based beamforming design, namely the hybrid maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and zero-forcing (ZF) scheme, is proposed in the action space. Besides, a new activation function is adopted to handle the power budget constraint. The proximal policy optimization (PPO) approach is adopted to learn the optimal policy. Numerical results validate the efficacy of the hybrid MRT and ZF scheme as well as the PPO-based algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Spectral Coexistence for Power-Harvested Multiuser Communication System With Radar</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10476770</link><description>In this paper, a co-design scheme for simultaneous optimization of the performance of radar and communication system in spectrum coexistence scenario is developed. Considering the possible information mismatch, the interference covariance matrices are reconstructed firstly. Then we adopt the signal-to-interference-plus noise ratio (SINR) on the radar side and the harvested power on the communication side as the performance indicators of the two systems, and obtain a weighted non-convex optimization formulation under the power constraints and similarity constraint. A sequential iterative optimization framework is presented to transform the non-convex problem into several single-variable subproblems, which exploits an alternating iterative procedure that combines Minorization-Maximization (MM) framework and double quadratic form optimizations with separable design (whose solution can be provided in closed-form). Finally, the merits of the proposed design are verified by simulation results.</description></item><item><title>LAPS-and-D2D Enabled Maritime Emergency Communications: Deployment Optimization and Resource Management</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478646</link><description>This paper investigates the application of low altitude platform station (LAPS) and device-to-device (D2D) techniques in maritime emergency communications. The hovering LAPS acts as an aerial base station to provide emergency telecommunications services, and the D2D technique is used to improve spectrum utilization. To make full use of the advantages of LAPS-and-D2D enabled networks, we formulate a sum rate maximization problem by jointly considering the deployment optimization and resource management (DORM). The formulated problem is constrained by the reliability and minimum capacity requirements. To solve this problem, an iterative optimization algorithm (IOA) is designed. First, by using the graphical method, the closed-form solution of optimal power allocation is derived. Next, we transform the spectrum reuse problem into a min-cost max-flow problem, and the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is employed to solve it. Then, we present a meta-heuristic algorithm to optimize the LAPS deployment. Finally, the simulation results indicate that the proposed DORM scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art works in term of the sum rate. In addition, the convergence and performance gap of the designed IOA are demonstrated.</description></item><item><title>PV System Installation Assessment Based on Power Measurement for Balcony Power Plant Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10507888</link><description>Photovoltaic systems for balcony power plant applications are rapidly growing, and with it comes the need for holistic concepts for energy utilization. Since these systems are intended for users without deep technical knowledge, the applications need to work and optimize themselves automatically without the user having to interfere. Therefore, this article presents a method to estimate the azimuth and the inclination of photovoltaic modules by analyzing the on-site power data and comparing it to a power forecast by Forecast. Solar, thereby making it unnecessary for users to provide these values themselves. The information gained hereby can be used to obtain and optimize a power forecast considering prevailing on-site conditions for energy management purposes. This is done by using low-volume power data at hourly resolution, where a single day of data is enough to make an estimation. The results of this method provide PV installation parameters with a resolution of the azimuth in 45$^{\circ }$-steps and the inclination in 15$^{\circ }$-steps, which are matched to the best-fitting power forecast.</description></item><item><title>High-Efficiency TOPCon Solar Cells With Laser-Assisted Localized Boron Doping via Silicon Paste</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10500405</link><description>In the present study, we establish a physical model for laser-assisted localized boron doping in N-type tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cells by employing the fluid dynamics method. Our simulations reveal that a flat-top beam inflicts less thermal damage on silicon than a Gaussian beam at a constant laser energy density. Additionally, we observe an acceleration in the flow rate of molten silicon in the molten pool as the laser energy density increases. This acceleration facilitates efficient doping of boron atoms into the silicon substrate, albeit accompanied by an expansion of the local thermal damage range. In light of these findings, we utilized boron-doped silicon paste as a doping source in experiments conducted on a 15 MW TOPCon solar cells production line employing four distinct laser energy densities. The experiments yielded a reduction in the sheet resistance to 81.9 &#937;/cm in the boron-doped regions, an increase in the peak boron doping concentration to 1.08 &#215; 1019 atoms/cm3, and a doping depth of 2.38 &#956;m. Consequently, the highest efficiency enhancement recorded was 0.14%, culminating in an efficiency of 25.06%. This research outlines the mechanism of the laser-assisted localized boron doping process and provides insights for enhancing the efficiency of TOPCon solar cells.</description></item><item><title>UV Laser Scribing for Perovskite Solar Modules Fabrication, Pros, and Cons</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10528668</link><description>Laser scribing is one of the most challenging steps in fabricating solar modules, which determines their internal resistance, geometrical factor, and efficiency. Pulsed Nd:YVO4 lasers with wavelengths of 355, 532, and 1064 nm are the most common lasers used in the photovoltaic industry. As using one single laser source for all scribing steps is more cost effective, in this article after summarizing recent progress in laser scribing for perovskite modules, a nanosecond UV-laser (355 nm) is used for all scribing steps needed for series interconnections in structures with glass or plastic substrates and studied how different scribing parameters, such as repetition frequency, output average power density, and scan speed, must be selected to adjust the transferred power density to the layer, enabling efficient scribing without overheating and cracking the layers. In addition to producing sharp strips on glass/ transparent conducting layer (TCO) substrates, especially thick fluorine-doped tin oxide, nanosecond UV laser provides a wide window for patterning the perovskite layer without damaging glass/TCO. However, in the case of plastic substrates, melted materials deform the edges of the strips&#8217; profiles. These results, along with reviewed results from the literature, provide a good insight into optimized laser scribing for perovskite solar module fabrication.</description></item><item><title>Metamorphic and Lattice-Matched GaInP Rear-Heterojunction Solar Cells for Improved Performance at Elevated Temperatures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10502388</link><description>We present the characteristics of n-on-p front-junction (FJ) and rear-heterojunction (RHJ) GaInP solar cells at operating temperatures (T) up to 300 &#176;C. Photovoltaic cells with efficient operation at high T may be important for satellite missions near the sun or as laser power converters for sensors operating in harsh environments. In this article, we show that the time-resolved photoluminescence lifetime (${{\tau }_{\text{TRPL}}}$) values in both lattice-matched (LM) n-Ga0.51In0.49P and metamorphic (MM) n-Ga0.37In0.63P double heterostructures are high and increase significantly with T. In contrast, the ${{\tau }_{\text{TRPL}}}$ values in their p-type counterparts are lower and decrease with T. We go on to demonstrate both LM and MM solar cells in FJ and RHJ configurations. The internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of MM RHJ cells increases significantly up to T = 300 &#176;C due to the increase in both ${{\tau }_{\text{TRPL}}}$ and the linear increase in diffusivity with T. In contrast, the IQE for MM FJ cells is nearly unchanged as T increases, while the IQE of LM cells drops sharply across all wavelengths. RHJ cells maintain higher open-circuit voltage and fill factor than their FJ counterparts, leading to a significant efficiency advantage at T = 100&#8211;300 &#176;C. Taken together, our work shows that MM cells perform well at elevated T and that RHJ cells are promising for high-T operation.</description></item><item><title>A Hysteresis Compensation Algorithm for the Generation of Nonlinear Voltage Sweep for IV-Characteristic Measurement of High-Capacitance Solar Modules With Xenon Flasher</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10540034</link><description>Short measurement time of tens of ms at industrial production leads to high influence of parasitic current on the current voltage (IV) curve characterization. This parasitic current deteriorates the measurement accuracy and should be mitigated. However, most methods, like, e.g., sectional measurement or DragonBackTM, are based on either unpractical long measurement time or sophisticated simulations. We present an algorithm for the generation of voltage sweep for low hysteresis measurement of IV characteristics in high capacitive solar modules. Using one linear voltage sweep-based IV characteristics as input, an optimized nonlinear voltage sweep is generated with our algorithm. While the linear voltage ramp during a 93 ms pulse leads to a hysteresis error at maximum power (&#1013;Pmpp) of 1.46% for a 1-cell heterojunction minimodule and 2.35% for a 120-cells heterojunction solar module, the &#1013;Pmpp with the optimized nonlinear voltage ramp is reduced to 0.38% and 0.48%, respectively. The hysteresis error of short-circuit current (&#1013;Isc) and hysteresis error of open-circuit voltage (&#1013;Voc) remain below 0.5% by optimized nonlinear voltage ramp. Thus, all three hysteresis error parameters &#1013;Pmpp, &#1013;Isc, and &#1013;Voc fulfill the standard IEC 60904-1 (edition-3).</description></item><item><title>Measurement of Photovoltaic Module Deformation Dynamics During Hail Impact Using Digital Image Correlation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10551381</link><description>Stereo high-speed video of photovoltaic modules undergoing laboratory hail tests was processed using digital image correlation to determine module surface deformation during and immediately following impact. The purpose of this work was to demonstrate a methodology for characterizing module impact response differences as a function of construction and incident hail parameters. Video capture and digital image analysis were able to capture out-of-plane module deformation to a resolution of &#177;0.1 mm at 11 kHz on an in-plane grid of 10 &#215; 10 mm over the area of a 1 &#215; 2 m commercial photovoltaic module. With lighting and optical adjustments, the technique was adaptable to arbitrary module designs, including size, backsheet color, and cell interconnection. Impacts were observed to produce an initially localized dimple in the glass surface, with peak deflection proportional to the square root of incident energy. Subsequent deformation propagation and dissipation were also captured, along with behavior for instances when the module glass fractured. Natural frequencies of the module were identifiable by analyzing module oscillations postimpact. Limitations of the measurement technique were that the impacting ice ball obscured the data field immediately surrounding the point of contact, and both ice and glass fracture events occurred within 100 &#956;s, which was not resolvable at the chosen frame rate. Increasing the frame rate and visualizing the back surface of the impact could be applied to avoid these issues. Applications for these data include validating computational models for hail impacts, identifying the natural frequencies of a module, and identifying damage initiation mechanisms.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Power Prediction for Bifacial PV Systems in Varied Shading Conditions: A Circuit-LSTM Approach Within a Digital Twin Framework</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10529620</link><description>The prediction of bifacial photovoltaic (bPV) system performance under variable conditions has persistently challenged researchers and practitioners alike, largely due to the unstable and imprecise irradiance measurements and the extensive training processes required for machine learning-based methods.

However, maintaining PV system efficiency remains a challenging problem. In desert regions, soiling is one of the most significant environmental factors that can cause PV system loss. In our early work, a PV soiling loss estimation method based on a single-image feature and in-lab testing was developed. In this study, we extend our previous work by incorporating various image features in a machine-learning regression model to predict PV soiling loss. The new model is trained and tested using PV performance data and RAW panel images collected in the field over several months, covering real-time soiling loss levels up to about 28%. There are 479 RAW images with 21 unique soiling loss levels, which were taken under different camera settings. The results show that the new method can reliably predict the soiling loss when the images are taken under similar settings as the training data (R-squared value of 0.98 and normalized RMSE is 0.01 for the training dataset).</description></item><item><title>Effects of Local Economy and Seasonal Cleaning Cycle on Yield and Profit of Soiled Solar Farms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10550921</link><description>Alongside advancements in photovoltaics (PV) technology, efficient solar farm operation (e.g., strategic panel cleaning) can help lower electricity generation costs in the field. In this work, we study the effects of season-dependent soiling and cleaning on energy yield, revenue, and profit in four locations &#8211; Dhaka (Bangladesh), Oregon City (USA), Berlin (Germany), and Rumah (Saudi Arabia). These locations cover a wide range of soiling rates, season-dependent rainfall, cleaning costs, and tariff rates for a broad techno-economic analysis of soiling-affected solar farms. While a two-month cleaning cycle, for example, apparently seems too long for soiling-prone locations (Dhaka and Rumah) &#8211; this is too frequent for Oregon City and Berlin due to their high cleaning costs. Therefore, the optimal strategy for maximum profit for the latter two locations is to never clean the panels. Even at optimal cleaning cycle (maximum revenue/profit), there is a profit-loss of 13.28%, 19.97%, 1.39%, and 42.88%, compared with the respective soiling-free rated farm output at these locations. We also show the sensitivity of output and profit to the variations in soiling rate and cleaning cost; farms in Dhaka and Rumah show strong sensitivity due to the high soiling rate and low cleaning costs.</description></item><item><title>Multidimensional Evaluation Method for the Operational Status of Photovoltaic Arrays in Large-Scale PV Power Stations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10506328</link><description>As the core and critical component of photovoltaic (PV) power stations, accurately evaluating the operational status of PV arrays is key to enabling intelligent operation of the power station. In the actual power station, only current and voltage data of the PV array are available, but the outputs of PV arrays exhibit noticeable random fluctuations, making it challenging to comprehensively evaluate the PV arrays in terms of power generation, data quality, and stability. To solve the above problems, this article proposed evaluation indicators for the operational status of arrays from multiple dimensions, including data quality, normalized generated power, performance ratio, dynamic performance, and stability of the arrays. The indicators were calculated individually, and then a comprehensive evaluation and recognition of the arrays&#8217; operational status were achieved through the utilization of weight calculation and quantile method. The article presented a systematic approach for evaluating the operational status of PV arrays using multidimensional evaluation indicators and the comprehensive evaluation method innovatively. The proposed multidimensional indicators provide a comprehensive evaluation of the PV arrays' operational status, without requiring any additional hardware investment. This study aims to provide a theoretical and practical foundation to effectively monitor the operational status of PV arrays. Compared with the traditional fuzzy C-means method, the method can give quantitative evaluation results of the operational status for PV arrays.</description></item><item><title>Implementation of Multiple-Step Quantized STDP Based on Novel Memristive Synapses</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10520271</link><description>Memristors have been widely studied as artificial synapses in neuromorphic circuits, due to their functional similarity with biological synapses, low operating power, and high integration density. Currently, the synaptic weight symbolic limitation and weight update inaccuracy are two challenging issues to be solved. In this work, a novel memristive synapse and a matched mixed-signal neuron circuit are designed to implement robust yet accurate spike-timing-dependent plasticity learning in excitatory and inhibitory synapses. To break through the weight symbolic limitation, a four memristors and two resistors (4M2R) synapse composed of 4M2R for spiking neural network (SNN) is designed. The proposed synapse can be either excitatory or inhibitory (E/I) by rationally arranging the resistors in the circuit, and it is the first of its kind, enabling Hebbian and anti-Hebbian training without additional adjusting of neural signals. In addition, the high symmetricity, linearity, and stability against device variation of the 4M2R synapse can also greatly improve the weight update accuracy. To further address the inaccurate weight update issue caused by signal complexity, a neuron circuit is designed to generate square-wave pulses for spike transmission and synaptic weight modulation. Simulations are carried out in the MATLAB Simscape as well as Virtuoso using SMIC  $0.18~\mu $ m process and a specially developed memristor model for SNN synapse simulation. The simulating results show good agreement with the weight change derived from the algorithmic methods, and the influence of weak signal-induced weight variation on circuit performance can be rigorously assessed.</description></item><item><title>Multibit Content Addressable Memory Design and Optimization Based on 3-D nand-Compatible IGZO Flash</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10521670</link><description>Content addressable memory (CAM) has been employed in various data-intensive tasks for its parallel pattern-matching capability. To enhance the density and efficiency of CAMs, emerging nonvolatile memory (NVM) technologies have been exploited in the CAM designs. Recently, the multilevel cell (MLC) characteristics of NVMs have been utilized in several analog and multibit CAM designs, achieving higher density than conventional binary/ternary CAM designs. However, these analog and multibit CAM designs are built with the practical experience of circuit designers, lacking a general analog/multibit design methodology. In this article, we propose a general and effective design and optimization scheme for multibit CAM, using a novel 3-D nand-compatible amorphous indium-gallium&#8211;zinc-oxide (IGZO) flash as a proxy of three-terminal NVM devices. The proposed scheme encodes the multibit data into the flash devices, enabling the 3-D nand flash array to operate as an ultradense nand or nor CAM without significant structural change. For further performance optimization, we propose a design space exploration scheme for optimal CAM parameters. Evaluation results suggest that the CAM design based on our proposed design and optimization scheme achieves over  $35\times $  area per bit saving compared with the representative ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET)-based multibit CAM, and a  $38.1\times $  energy-delay-area product (EDAP) improvement over the state-of-the-art analog CAM, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Three-Channel Package-Scale Galvanic Isolation Interface for Wide Bandgap Gate Drivers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10495721</link><description>This article presents the design of a three-channel package-scale galvanic isolation interface for SiC and GaN power switching converters. The isolation interface consists of two side-by-side co- packaged chips fabricated in a low-cost 0.32- $\mu \text{m}$  bipolar CMOS&#8211;DMOS (BCD) technology and includes three isolation data channels based on RF-coupled integrated microantennas. The isolation interface provides a channel for the gate driver control, a bidirectional channel for diagnostic, and a channel for the isolated power supply control. They use on&#8211;off keying (OOK)-modulated RF carriers of 1.5, 0.5, and 1.5 GHz, respectively. The galvanic isolation interface provides a maximum signal rate of 2 and 1.9 MHz for the driver and the power control channels, respectively, whereas the diagnostic channel guarantees half-duplex bidirectional communication up to 15 MHz. Thanks to the package-scale isolation approach, both reinforced galvanic isolation and first-rate common-mode transient immunity (CMTI) are achieved. High immunity to adjacent channel crosstalk is guaranteed by using channel frequency/physical separation. To best of the authors&#8217; knowledge, this is the first implementation of a package-scale galvanic isolation interface with three independent communication channels, including a bidirectional channel, in silicon technology.</description></item><item><title>A Power-On-Reset Circuit With Accurate Trigger-Point Voltage and Ultralow Typical Quiescent Current for Emerging Nonvolatile Memory</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10494042</link><description>In this article, a power-on-reset (POR) circuit with accurate trigger-point voltage and ultralow typical quiescent current for emerging nonvolatile memory (NVM) is presented. To keep the trigger-point voltage from the effect of process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) and supply ramp rate variations, low-cost current generators and a current comparator are adopted with brown-out detection (BOD). A protection circuit is utilized for correct operations in different BOD events. Meanwhile, delay blocks are utilized to generate reliable pulse signals that are less influenced by temperature and supply ramp rate. The simulation results show that the trigger-point voltage is 2.08 V with a temperature coefficient (TC) of 81.8 ppm/&#176;C and a deviation to the ramp time of 9.91% for a wide ramp time range from  $10 ~\mu \text{s}$  to dc. In addition, the reset duration time of the POR pulse is also reliable. The proposed POR circuit designed in the 55-nm CMOS process consumes only 0.65-nA typical quiescent current and  $59\times 146\,\,\mu \text{m}$  area, which is suitable for emerging NVM systems.</description></item><item><title>Low Complexity Design of Logistic Distance Metric Adaptive Filter for Impulsive Noise Environments</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10555050</link><description>In many practical scenarios, non-Gaussian noise contaminates the desired signal and introduces outliers. The recently proposed logistic distance metric adaptive filter (LDMAF) outperforms the existing algorithms and provides better performance in the presence of such outliers. There is a need for efficient hardware architecture for the implementation of LDMAF. This article proposes an efficient VLSI architecture of LDMAF. The implementation of error-gradient function of LDMAF puts significant implementation problem in terms of delay and cost.

This mixed-computation approach uses 4-bit Posit (Posit4), which has higher precision around 0, for representing weights with high sensitivity, while it uses 4-bit FixP (FixP4) for representing other weights. A heuristic for analyzing the importance and the quantization error of the weights is presented to assign the proper number system to different weights. In addition, a gradient approximation for Posit representation is introduced to improve the quality of weight updates in the backpropagation process. Due to the high energy consumption of the fully Posit-based computations, neural network operations are carried out in FixP or Posit/FixP. An efficient hardware implementation of an MAC operation with a first Posit operand and FixP for a second operand and accumulator is presented. The efficacy of the proposed low-precision mixed-computation approach is extensively assessed on vision and language models. The results show that on average, the accuracy of the mixed-computation is about 1.5% higher than that of FixP with a cost of 0.19% energy overhead.</description></item><item><title>iEDCL: Streamlined, False-Error-Free Error Detection and Correction Scheme in a Near-Threshold Enabled 32-bit Processor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10559764</link><description>This article presents internal error detection, correction, and latching (iEDCL), a designer-friendly, fully functional error detection and correction (EDAC) approach tailored for energy-efficient near-threshold systems capable of tolerating variations.

This research meticulously explores polynomial multiplication from the context of algebraic structures by introducing a novel hetero-blend recursive multiplier that harnesses the strengths of the contemporary state-of-the-art (SOTA) designs. The heterogeneous-blend recursive multiplier (HRM) adeptly merges the footprint efficiency of the Karatsuba multiplier (KM) and the compute-latency benefits of the overlap-free KM (OKM) at higher stages, while at lower bounds, it capitalizes the optimal balance of footprint and compute-latency benefits of the schoolbook multiplier (SBM). To further enhance the performance, HRM integrates the heterogeneous term division throughout its stages which is a characteristic find taken from the prior work on M-term nonhomogeneous Karatsuba multiplier (MNHKA). Furthermore, a MATLAB framework has been devised to expedite the exploration process in the finite field design space resulting from the heterogeneous usage of the M terms across multiple stages. The presented HRM design undergoes comprehensive evaluation when benchmarked against contemporary SOTA designs including KM, OKM, their corresponding homogeneous M term variants referred to as M-term Karatsuba multiplier (MKM), M-term OKM (MOKM) alongside recent variants of composite M-term Karatsuba multipliers (CMKA), MNHKA, and equivalent overlap-free variant M-term nonhomogeneous overlap-free Karatsuba multiplier (MNHOKA). The field-programmable gate array (FPGA) synthesized results for the HRM designs on Zynq ZCU-104 board showcase a best-case of 17.288% lookup table (LUT) savings, 5.68% reduction in delay, and 20.88% gain in area-delay product (ADP) compared with the optimal SOTA design, while also revealing a 13.49% reduction in LUT usage, 5.45% decrease in delay, and 12.97% improvement in ADP when compared with the best among MNHKA and MNHOKA designs. Furthermore HRM designs synthesized on the Cadence GPDK45 library achieved a best-case footprint saving of 16.18%, a critical path delay improvement of 29.53%, a remarkable 45.66% gain in the ADP, a substantial 30.37% reduction in power consumption, and a noteworthy 38.63% improvement in power per area when compared with the optimal SOTA design. In comparison to the leading MNHKA and MNHOKA designs, the HRM designs exhibit a best-case footprint improvement of 5.77%, 8.31% reduction in delay, 16.76% enhancement in ADP, a significant 20.18% power savings, and a notable 17.71% improvement in power-per-unit-area (PPA).

This article proposes a 112-channel system-on-chip (SoC) design for neural signal acquisition and processing, comprising full-channel read-out circuits, neural signal-processing accelerators, and a 32-bit RISC-V core. A clock-domain-crossing (CDC) structure is devised to minimize data storage overhead in read-out circuits, facilitating comprehensive data acquisition and high-throughput simultaneous transmission from all channels. The channel-specific processing unit incorporates hardware-efficient designs for lossless compression, spike detection, and extraction of spike features.

With the recent advances of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology, in particular, the necessity to endow interconnected devices with security facilities has increased as well. In this context, the efficient implementation of ROs on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) is crucial, even though it hides some pitfalls. This article presents a new design strategy for multistage ROs relying on the carry chains (CCs) available into modern FPGA devices. Several configurations of ROs designed as proposed here have been characterized in terms of hardware costs, jitter, and temperature/voltage sensitivity. In all the evaluated cases, the proposed design allows to achieve predictable routing schemes through the automatic place and route (P&amp;amp;R), while reducing slice occupancy and energy consumption by up to 50% and 44%, respectively, in comparison with the traditional lookup table (LUT)-based ROs. When realized on a Artix-7 device, the basic version of the proposed oscillator realized using 33 inverting stages allows obtaining multiphase outputs oscillating at 29.7 MHz with a standard deviation less than 10 kHz. The analysis conducted also demonstrates the high flexibility of the novel circuits, such as the possibility to easily change their behavior depending on the target application requirements. As an example, by exploiting additional pass-through elements, the proposed scheme achieves a sensitivity of 49 kHz/&#176;C that is more than 4 times higher than that shown by the corresponding traditional LUT-based competitor, thus making it more suitable for thermal monitoring applications.</description></item><item><title>A Design Framework for Generating Energy-Efficient Accelerator on FPGA Toward Low-Level Vision</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10559268</link><description>Low-level vision algorithms play an increasingly crucial role in a wide range of applications, such as biomedical, security, and autopilot. The low-level vision accelerators have also been extensively researched. As low-level vision is often deployed in embedded devices, its accelerators need to achieve high energy efficiency. Meanwhile, the broad application scenarios of low-level vision contribute to its rapid iteration. Designing energy-efficient accelerators for quickly evolving low-level vision algorithms demands substantial effort. Therefore, a design framework specifically tailored for the generation of low-level vision accelerators is urgently needed. In this article, we propose an end-to-end algorithm-hardware generation framework, EffiVision, on field-programmable gate array (FPGA), aimed at generating highly energy-efficient dedicated accelerators for low-level vision neural networks. EffiVision proposes a hardware template that features multiple parallelisms and large architecture exploration spaces specifically designed to accommodate the characteristics of low-level vision networks. Then, it employs activation-weight aware mixed-precision quantization and FPGA-aware NNLUTs to search the suitable hardware parameters within the hardware template, generating highly energy-efficient accelerators tailored for low-level vision networks. We used EffiVision to perform hardware generation for three low-level vision neural networks fast super-resolution convolutional neural network (FSRCNN), denoising convolutional neural network (DnCNN), and demosaicing convolutional neural network (DMCNN) on Xilinx FPGA development boards, achieving the best energy efficiencies of 174.9, 97.8, and 92.7 GOPS/W, respectively. The generated accelerators of FSRCNN and DnCNN are  $1.11\times $  and  $3.37\times $  more efficient than previous works.</description></item><item><title>A 40-Gb/s PAM-3 Receiver With Modified Summer-Merged Slicers and PRTS Checker</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10517958</link><description>This article presents a 40-Gb/s (25.6 GBaud) quarter-rate receiver utilizing three-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM).

Particularly, a coupled technique with bandpass (CTB) characteristic between the kth output node and the ( $k+1$ )th input node of amplification units (AUs) is adopted in the DPA design. It generates an additional signal reuse path (SRP) to reuse part of the output signal to superimpose the input signal, and then they will be reamplified to the output artificial transmission line (O-ATML). Moreover, due to the bandpass characteristic, the signal reuse can be manipulated to target the upper cutting edges of the working band to alleviate sharp gain and power roll-off. By carefully controlling the SRP, the overall gain, output power, and bandwidth are enhanced and extended. The systematic design approach for the DPA is detailed with circuit implementations and optimizations. To validate the proposed concept, a DPA MMIC prototype is implemented and fabricated in a commercial 0.25- $\mu $ m gallium nitride (GaN)-on-silicon carbide (SiC) high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) process. It shows the compact layout within a die size of 3.36 mm2. Under 28-V VDD power supply, the measured results show a flat  $14.8\pm 1.0$ -dB small-signal gain with 10.0-GHz wide operating bandwidth and good impedance matching conditions. A saturated output power ( ${P} _{\text {sat}}$ ) of 7.25 W with peak power-added efficiency (PAE) exceeding 38.7% is achieved.

We also protect timing paths by developing timing-ambiguous sequential cells called TA cells. We call this locking scheme ambiguous logic and timing logic locking (referred to as ALT-Lock). ALT-Lock ensures a two-pronged system-level security scheme where the attacker is forced to unlock not only combinational logic obfuscation but also timing obfuscation. We show that a combination of logic and timing ambiguity (TA) provides security against oracle-guided attacks. This method is superior to other traditional IP protection schemes such as combinational or sequential locking as it guarantees security against both oracle-guided and oracle-free attacks, while ensuring low power, performance, and area (PPA) overhead.</description></item><item><title>Symmetric and Multiphase-Interleaved Ladder Bucks for DC Capacitors Elimination</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10510403</link><description>To improve power density, a symmetric switched-capacitor (SC) ladder buck (SLB) is proposed in this brief that eliminates the fixed ladder in an SC ladder buck (SCLB) by tying the dc nodes in two 180&#176;-phase-shifted cells together. Unlike flying capacitor multilevel converters (FCMCs) that minimize the inductor current ripple, the ladder topology within an SCLB splits the inductor current optimally among the ladder switches, such that the overall equivalent output resistance is minimized. M-phase interleaving is proposed in this brief to allow SLB to regain this current splitting capability when operating via duty cycles larger than 0.5. Simulation results of a six-level four-phase design in 180-nm CMOS verify the performance advantages of the proposed topology.</description></item><item><title>An Unconditional Evenly Spaced STRO With a New Mitigated Drafting Effect Muller C-Element</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10520312</link><description>Muller C-element (MCE) can be utilized in synchronous circuits by forming an oscillator so-called self-timed ring oscillators (STROs).

The differential-like OTA consists of two asymmetric branches. The inverting branch used for multichannel inputs has more inverters in parallel than that of the noninverting branch used for reference. Two virtual rails with very low impedance are designed in the differential-like OTA to effectively reduce the noise-efficiency-factor (NEF) and crosstalk in input channels. The NEF and the effective average current per channel decreases as the number of channels increases. Furthermore, by optimizing the current ratio of the inverting and the noninverting branches of the OTA, the NEF of the proposed amplifier is minimized and approaches the NEF of an ideal inverter of  $\sqrt {2}/2$  as the channel counts increase to infinity. The area per channel is reduced even more significantly as the channel counts increase. The proposed amplifier architecture with 4-channel, 16-channel, and 64-channel configurations were fabricated and measured. The results show that the noise, power, and area performance were all improved by integrating more channels in parallel. For the 64-channel amplifier, the measured NEF is 0.84, the effective average current per channel is 422 nA and the area per channel is only 0.044 mm2.</description></item><item><title>An Enhanced Class-F Dual-Core VCO With Common-Mode-Noise Self-Cancellation and Isolation Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10453607</link><description>In this article, an enhanced class-F voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) with common-mode-noise self-cancellation (CM-NC) and common-mode-noise isolation (CM-NI) technique is proposed. With the proposed CM-NC technique, the common-mode-noise current of the drain coil and that of the nearby source coil are in the opposite direction. Therefore, the magnetic fields generated by the two coils cancel each other, which reduces the noise injected into the VCO from power supply and the ground node. Moreover, the principle of decoupling between the two inductors is also employed to eliminate the influence of the common-mode tail inductor on the differential mode. By winding the gate coil into a double-turn structure, the coupling noise from the drain inductor to the gate is opposite to the induced current of the gate coil, thereby cutting off the noise coupling path from the drain to the gate. Thanks to the dual-core 8-shaped inductor structure, the phase noise (PN) is improved without increasing the area, compared with existing methods using separated and dedicated tail filtering inductors. The VCO is fabricated in a 65-nm complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) technology. The measured tuning range is 21.7% from 11.5 to 14.3 GHz. The PN and figure of merit (FoM) at 1-MHz offset are &#8722;119.2 and 192.8 dBc/Hz, respectively. The power consumption across the frequency tuning range is 5.6&#8211;10 mW. The core area is 0.065 mm2 and the total area is 0.26 mm2.</description></item><item><title>A Compact 19.7- to 43.8-GHz Power Amplifier With 20.3-dBm Psat and 35.5% PAE in 28-nm Bulk CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10438943</link><description>This article presents a broadband millimeter-wave (mm-wave) linear power amplifier (PA) to support 5G and beyond wireless communication. An asynchronously tuned coupled resonator (ATCR) circuit model is introduced to effectively design PA&#8217;s non-ideal transformer-based broadband output matching network (OMN). Two adaptive feedback linearizers (AFLs) and multi-gated transistor (MGTR) techniques are adapted to optimize the linearity. Both amplitude-to-amplitude (AM&#8722;AM) and amplitude-to-phase modulation (AM&#8722;PM) distortion are improved over one octave with these techniques. A prototype PA is implemented in 28-nm bulk CMOS to verify the proposed ideas. The measured PA realizes 76%  $S_{21}\,\,-$ 3-dB fraction bandwidth (FBW) from 19.7 to 43.8 GHz, fully supporting five operating bands in 5G new radio (NR) frequency range 2 (FR2), i.e.,  $n$ 257&#8211; $n$ 261. The measured  $\vert $ AM&#8722;PM $\vert $  is less than 4&#176; over 24&#8722;43 GHz. The large-signal measurement results show that the PA realizes 18.7&#8722;20.3-dBm  $P_{\mathrm {sat}}$ , 16.8&#8722;19-dBm OP1dB, 24.9%&#8722;35.5% PAEmax, and 20.6%&#8211;29.7% PAEP1dB over 22&#8722;40 GHz. For 5G NR FR2 200-MHz 64-QAM signals [9.7-dB peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)], the PA achieves an average  $P_{\mathrm {out}}$ /PAE of 11.0 dBm/8.7% with &#8722;25.2-dB EVMrms at 24 GHz. The proposed PA achieves a compact size with a core area of 0.088 mm2, making it very suitable for large-scale phased array beamformers.</description></item><item><title>A 1.5-MHz BW 81.2-dB SNDR Dual-Residue Pipeline ADC With a Fully Dynamic Noise-Shaping Interpolating-SAR ADC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10426783</link><description>This article presents an energy-efficient high-resolution dual-residue (D-R) pipelined-successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC), with a backend capacitive interpolating SAR ADC incorporated with noise-shaping (NS) capability. The residue amplifier design could be simplified as the residue is pre-amplified by the amplifier for the kT/ $C$ -noise cancellation. Moreover, the proposed segmented digital-to-analog converter (DAC) structure overcomes parasitic capacitance limitations in the capacitive interpolation, improving resolution along with the gain-error-free advantage of the D-R structure. Fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS technology, the prototype ADC achieves an 81.2-dB signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) and an 89.9-dB spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) in a 1.5-MHz bandwidth (BW) at an over-sampling ratio (OSR) of 8 with a 170.4-dB SNDR Schreier figure-of-merit (FoM) without any calibration.</description></item><item><title>An SNR-Enhanced 8-Ary (SNRE-8) Modulation Technique for Wireline Transceivers Using Pulse Width, Position, and Amplitude Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10436129</link><description>This article presents a novel eight-ary modulation technique with improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to conventional pulse amplitude modulation 8 (PAM-8). The proposed SNR-enhanced 8-ary (SNRE-8) scheme modulates pulse width, position, and amplitude to improve the SNR. The proposed SNRE-8 modulation leverages the wireline channel loss to perform the modulation. Digital decoding of mutually exclusive eyes generated by the proposed SNRE-8 modulation further improves the eye margin at the receiver. A 27-Gb/s transceiver is implemented in a 65-nm CMOS process employing the proposed modulation. A PAM-8 transmitter is implemented on the same chip for comparison purposes. Compared to the PAM-8 modulation, the proposed SNRE-8 modulation shows an average SNR improvement of 10.6 dB at the near-end eye at the cost of 6.6% eye width reduction. With the aid of a time-domain feed-forward equalizer (FFE) and a continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE), the proposed SNRE-8 transceiver achieves a bit error rate (BER) of  $10^{-8}$  on a 9-dB loss channel with an energy efficiency of 5.39 pJ/bit.</description></item><item><title>A 26-Gb/s Framed-Pulsewidth Modulation Transceiver for Extended Reach Optical Links</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10477935</link><description>This article proposes a high-speed framed-pulsewidth modulation (FPWM) transceiver that applies a time-domain modulation scheme for increased spectrum efficiency. The achieved coding gain is 75%, indicating that the minimum pulsewidth is increased by 1.75 times compared to an NRZ scheme with an identical data rate. Such bandwidth reduction renders dispersion tolerance both in copper and optical channels. The encoder and decoder employ successive approximation (SA) and weighted sum (WS) algorithms for power-and-area efficiency. The FPWM demonstrates an 8-dB SNR gain over NRZ at 15-km single-mode fiber (SMF) transmission while maintaining identical back-to-back performance. The FPWM scheme shows 6-dB higher receiver sensitivity at a bit error rate (BER) of 2e-5 than the PAM-4 signaling in 26-Gb/s back-to-back transmission and achieves 4-dB SNR gain at 20-km transmission. The test chip is fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process and packaged in a flip-chip chip scale package (FCCSP). The test chip occupies  $2.2\times2.0$  mm, including bidirectional two lanes and two phase-locked loops (PLLs), while it consumes 262 mW per lane from a 0.9-V supply. The measured Tx random jitter is 265 fs $_{\mathrm {rms}}$ .</description></item><item><title>A Wireline Transceiver With 3-bit per Symbol Using Common-Mode NRZ and Differential-Mode PAM-4 Signaling Techniques</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10423028</link><description>This article presents a wireline transceiver using 3-bit per symbol signaling techniques that can simultaneously modulate and demodulate the common-mode (CM) 1-bit non-return to zero (NRZ) and differential-mode (DM) 2-bit pulse amplitude modulation 4 (PAM-4) signals (CMDM-8). The driver of the transmitter (TX) configured with two different types of current mode PAM-4 drivers generates CMDM-8, a mixed signal of single NRZ and differential PAM-4. If the common-mode voltage (VCM) of the two types of PAM-4 drivers is different, the VCM of the CMDM-8 signals swings between the two different VCM even if the two PAM-4 drivers generate the identical PAM-4 signal in the DM. Therefore, the TX can generate the NRZ signal in the CM while transmitting the PAM-4 signals. At the receiver (RX), the CMDM-8, which combines NRZ and PAM-4 signals, is divided into NRZ and PAM-4 signals in the analog front end. The divided analog signals are converted to the 3-bit digital data in the decoder. The 3-bit decoder recovers the NRZ and PAM-4 signals to the original data. When 2 bits are recovered from the PAM-4 signal, the VCM of the PAM-4 signal is not constant due to the residual NRZ signal. Thus, the proposed PAM-4 decoder applies an offset-based PAM-4 decoding method to achieve robustness against the VCM change. The prototype was fabricated with a 28-nm CMOS technology and had a maximum data rate of 48 Gb/s. The transceiver with an area of 0.117 mm2 enabled a bit error rate (BER) of 10 $^{-12}$  at 9.08-dB attenuation and had a power efficiency of 4.40 pJ/bit.</description></item><item><title>A Fully Integrated Multi-Phase Voltage Regulator With Flying-Capacitor-Based Inter-Inductor Current Self-Balancing Scheme and Charge-Recycling Gate Driver</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10430195</link><description>This article presents a fully integrated voltage regulator (FIVR) featuring a high power density, fast dynamic voltage scaling (DVS), and self-balanced inductor currents. The proposed two-phase 2L1C buck converter topology can 2 $\times $  reduce the number of power switches and flying capacitors (CF) compared to the conventional two-phase three-level (2P3L) converters while inheriting the benefit of a lower switching voltage. The single-CF-based self-balancing of the inductor currents with no extra overhead is a key contribution to this work. For the high scalability of the 2L1C topology, the inter-channel balancing (ICB) scheme is also presented. Moreover, the proposed charge-recycling gate driver is capable of reducing the switching power loss. The proposed two-phase FIVR chip with on-chip spiral inductors of 2 nH was fabricated in a 55-nm CMOS process.

The system incorporates a reconfigurable power amplifier (RPA) and an SIDO rectifier that generates regulated outputs of 1.2 and 2.5 V for different functional blocks of a bio-implant. A dynamic power distribution (DPD) scheme is employed to adjust the duty ratios of the outputs based on changing load conditions. The WPDT system makes use of the different reflected impedances of the two outputs to enable reliable data transfer. Implemented in a standard 65-nm CMOS process, the system achieves an uplink data rate of 423.75 kb/s, confirmed through experiments with pseudorandom binary sequence input data at distances of 6, 10, and 15 mm.

The proposed double charging keying (DCK) uplink data modulation method assisted by a dynamic zoom control breaks the trade-off between power delivery to the load (PDL) and uplink data such that the high data-rate uplink data telemetry no longer limits the amount of PDLs. Furthermore, DCK alleviates the design difficulty in simultaneous uplink data telemetry and RR. The dynamic ZOOM-based digital control algorithm is employed to ensure reliable uplink data telemetry and rapid transient response of SIDO-RR with two  $\Delta \Sigma $ -loops under distance variations.

Battery-free communication based on wireless power transfer (WPT) can eliminate the battery to reduce the size of a wireless implant, realizing minimally invasive surgery. However, conventional battery-free implants suffer from a short communication range, such as inductive coupling, near-infrared (NIR) transmission, and active body-channel communication (BCC), which cannot apply to deep brain zones. Ultrasonic power transfer and communication benefit from a low channel loss, but the low carrier frequency leads to a low data rate, which is not able to transfer full-span neural signals such as spikes and multichannel signals. In this work, a galvanically-switching passive-BCC technique is proposed for neural implants, to extend the effective range of both power transfer and wireless communication. The brain tissue is utilized to form a galvanic loop for power delivery, while the neural-recording data switch the loop current to conduct passive BCC. The proposed technique is implemented in a neural recording chip fabricated in a 55-nm CMOS process. Through-tissue measurement shows that the chip realizes a battery-free communication range of 5.5 cm, with a bit-error rate (BER) of  $4.4 \times 10^{-6}$ . In the in-vivo demonstration, a 5.9-mm3 flexible prototype with the proposed chip inside is fully implanted into a Sprague&#8211;Dawley rat, where the neural signals are read battery-free through the passive-BCC technique.</description></item><item><title>A 125 &#956; m-Pitch-Matched Transceiver ASIC With Micro-Beamforming ADC and Multi-Level Signaling for 3-D Transfontanelle Ultrasonography</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10418877</link><description>This article presents a pitch-matched transceiver application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for a wearable ultrasound device intended for transfontanelle ultrasonography, which includes element-level 20-V unipolar pulsers with transmit (TX) beamforming, and receive (RX) circuitry that combines eightfold multiplexing, four-channel micro-beamforming ( $\mu $ BF), and subgroup-level digitization to achieve an initial 32-fold channel-count reduction. The  $\mu $ BF is based on passive boxcar integration, merged with a 10-bit 40 MS/s SAR ADC in the charge domain, thus obviating the need for explicit anti-alias filtering (AAF) and power-hungry ADC drivers. A compact and low-power reference generator employs an area-efficient MOS capacitor as a reservoir to quickly set a reference for the ADC in the charge domain. A low-power multi-level data link, based on 16-level pulse-amplitude modulation, concatenates the outputs of four ADCs, providing an overall 128-fold channel-count reduction. A prototype transceiver ASIC was fabricated in a 180-nm BCD technology, and interfaces with a 2-D PZT transducer array of  $16\times16$  elements with a pitch of  $125 ~\mu \text{m}$  and a center frequency of 9 MHz.

However, the number and density of the tactile sensors are limited by factors such as routing complexity, signal latency, and power consumption. Inspired by neural signal processing, we present a multichannel capacitive interface circuits that read out the sparse tactile signals in an event-driven (ED) manner. A self-reconfigurable successive-approximation-register capacitance-to-digital converter (SR SAR CDC) is proposed to reduce power consumption in passive-sampling (PS) mode and to achieve high resolution in noise-shaping (NS) mode. To support parallel recording in NS data converters, we propose a 2 $^{N}$  oversampling-rate (2 $^{N}$ -OSR) code division multiplexing (CDM) technique.

Though integral (INT) CIM chips are emerging, the floating-point (FP) CIM chip has not been well explored. The high-accuracy demand of larger models and complex tasks requires FP computation. Besides, most of the neural network (NN) training tasks still rely on FP computation. This work presents an energy-efficient FP CIM processor. It is observed that most of the exponent values of FP data are concentrated in a small region. Therefore, the FP computations are divided into intensive and sparse parts and then executed on an intensive-CIM sparse-digital architecture. First, an FP-to-INT CIM workflow for the intensive FP operations is designed to reduce the CIM execution cycles. Second, a flexible sparse-digital core is proposed for the remaining sparse FP operations. Utilizing both the intensive-CIM and sparse-digital cores, this work can achieve both high energy efficiency and identical accuracy to the FP algorithm baseline. Considering the FP CIM execution flow, a CIM-friendly low-bit FP training method is proposed to further reduce the execution cycles. Besides, a low-MAC-value (MACV) CIM macro is designed to utilize the more random sparsity brought by FP alignment.

Many real-world COPs are non-deterministic polynomial-time hard problems intractable using classical computers. Ising machine, the hardware accelerator based on the Ising model and annealing operation, has gained much attention as an alternative for solving COPs. The COPs are mapped to the Ising model, and their optimal/near-optimal solutions are explored by the intrinsic convergence property of the Ising machine. However, prior Ising machines based on locally connected spins have limitations in solving hard COPs due to significant overhead while mapping the Ising model to the inflexible hardware topology.

However, implementing ODL on battery-limited edge devices poses significant challenges due to the generation of large-size intermediate data during ML training and the frequent data movement between the processor and memory, resulting in substantial power consumption. To address this limitation, certain ML accelerators in edge devices have adopted a processing-in-memory (PIM) paradigm, integrating computing logic into memory. Nevertheless, these accelerators still face hurdles such as long latency caused by the lack of a pipelined approach in the training process, notable power and area overheads related to floating-point arithmetic, and incomplete handling of data sparsity during training. This article presents a high-throughput super-pipelined PIM accelerator, named SP-PIM, designed to overcome the limitations of existing PIM-based ODL accelerators. To this end, SP-PIM implements a holistic multi-level pipelining scheme based on local error prediction (EP), enhancing training speed by 7.31 $\times $ . In addition, SP-PIM introduces a local EP unit (LEPU), a lightweight circuit that performs accurate EP leveraging power-of-two (PoT) random weights. This strategy significantly reduces power-hungry external memory access (EMA) by 59.09%. Moreover, SP-PIM fully exploits sparsities in both activation and error data during training, facilitated by a highly optimized PIM macro design. Finally, the SP-PIM chip, fabricated using 28-nm CMOS technology, achieves a training speed of 8.81 epochs/s. It occupies a die area of 5.76 mm2 and consumes between 6.91 and 433.25 mW at operating frequencies of 20&#8211;450 MHz with a supply voltage of 0.56&#8211;1.05 V. We demonstrate that it can successfully execute end-to-end ODL for the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets. Consequently, it achieves state-of-the-art area efficiency (560.6 GFLOPS/mm2) and competitive power efficiency (22.4 TFLOPS/W), marking a 3.95 $\times $  higher figure-of-merit (area efficiency  $\times $  power efficiency  $\times $  capacity) than previous work. Furthermore, we implemented a cycle-level simulator using Python to investigate and validate the scalability of SP-PIM. By doing architectural experiments in various hardware configurations, we successfully verified that the core computing unit within SP-PIM possesses both scale-up and scale-out capabilities.</description></item><item><title>iMCU: A 28-nm Digital In-Memory Computing-Based Microcontroller Unit for TinyML</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10436137</link><description>Tiny machine learning (TinyML) envisions executing a deep neural network (DNN)-based inference on an edge device for improving battery life, latency, security, and privacy. Toward this vision, recent microcontroller units (MCUs) integrate in-memory computing (IMC) hardware to leverage its high energy efficiency and throughput in vector&#8211;matrix multiplication (VMM). However, those existing works require large IMC hardware, severely increasing the area overhead. In addition, most existing works use analog&#8211;mixed-signal (AMS) IMC hardware, exhibiting limited robustness over process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. Finally, none can support a practical software development framework such as TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers (TFLite-micro). Due to these limitations, those MCUs did not present the performance for the standard benchmark MLPerf-Tiny, which makes it difficult to evaluate them against the state-of-the-art neural (not necessarily IMC-based) MCUs. In this article, we design a new IMC-based MCU, titled iMCU, for TinyML to address those challenges. In the design process, we: 1) define the optimal set of acceleration targets and 2) devise an area-efficient computation flow that requires the least amount of IMC hardware yet still provides a significant acceleration. In addition, we develop: 1) state-of-the-art digital IMC macros and 2) create the accelerator based on the macros, which can support the proposed computation flow in a fully pipelined manner. Combining those innovations, we prototyped the iMCU in a 28-nm CMOS. The measurement results show that the iMCU significantly outperforms the prior IMC-based MCUs in compute density, energy efficiency, and SRAM density (total SRAM size/total SRAM area). It also achieves a compact footprint of 2.73 mm2.</description></item><item><title>Scaling-CIM: eDRAM In-Memory-Computing Accelerator With Dynamic-Scaling ADC and Adaptive Analog Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10438359</link><description>This article presents Scaling-computing-in-memory (CIM), an energy-efficient embedded dynamic random access memory (eDRAM)-based in-memory-computing (IMC) accelerator with a dynamic-scaling readout for signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR) boosting and analog-to-digital converter (ADC) overhead reduction.

The proposed hardware accelerator is reconfigured to solve 2-D/3-D Laplace and Poisson equations, and it scales to solve larger 2-D problems with no additional overhead. The reconfigurable and scalable architecture is implemented by building a 16  $\times $  16 near-memory bit-serial processing element (PE) array and four 16 $\times $  boundary PEs with 92-kb static random-access memory (SRAM) distributed in the PE array.

The bit-serial computing architecture allows the PEs to communicate with neighbors via a minimal communication bandwidth (1 bit). The proposed hardware accelerator finds numerical solutions to 2-D PDEs (with up to a 64  $\times $  64 grid size) and 3-D PDEs (with up to a 16  $\times $  16  $\times $  16 grid size) using FDM.

To achieve this goal, we optimize a neuromorphic learning algorithm and propose random target window (TW) selection, hierarchical update skip (HUS), and asynchronous time step acceleration (ATSA) to reduce the on-chip learning power consumption. Our approach results in a 28-nm 1.25-mm2 asynchronous neuromorphic processor (ANP-I) with on-chip learning energy per sample less than 15% of inference energy per sample. With all weights randomly initialized, this processor enables on-chip learning for edge-AI tasks such as gesture recognition, keyword spotting, and image classification, consuming sub- $0.1 ~\mu \text{J}$  of learning energy per sample at 0.56 V and 40-MHz frequency while maintaining &gt;92% accuracy for all tasks.</description></item><item><title>A Fully Integrated Dual-Output Continuously Scalable-Conversion-Ratio SC Converter for Battery-Powered IoT Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10536188</link><description>This paper proposes a fully integrated dual-output continuously scalable-conversion-ratio (CSCR) switched-capacitor (SC) converter that increases the overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) beyond that of the conventional dual-output SC converters. The structure employs proposed dual-output CSCR SC stage and channel SC stage to transfer charges to two output load voltages ( $V_{\mathrm {OUT}}$ s) with high PCE. Also, the converter is controlled by analog switching frequency modulation (ASFM) and digital flying capacitance modulation (DFCM) loops to regulate both  $V_{\mathrm {OUT}}$ s simultaneously.

The proposed ACAID autonomously increases the supply current at the onset of the tracking phase, achieving a high slew rate. As the driver output voltage gradually follows the input signal in the RC-settling or hold phase, the supply current successively diminishes back to the original low quiescent level. The required sensing and actuating circuits for current adaptation are inherent components in the adopted capacitive feedback topology. A prototype version of the proposed ACAID has been designed and fabricated in a  $0.35\thinspace \mu {\mathrm { m}}$  CMOS process, along with integrated charge programming circuits and a 10-bit successive approximation register ADC. With  $0.5\thinspace {\mathrm { pF}}$  sampling capacitors loading the driver, the proposed ACAID achieves  $-70.1\thinspace {\mathrm { dB}}$  total harmonic distortion (THD) with a  $100\thinspace {\mathrm { kHz}}$  input signal with  $2.8V_{\mathrm { pp}}$  amplitude. When connected to an on-chip ADC with a  $200\thinspace {\mathrm { kHz}}$  sampling rate, the measured effective number of bits (ENoB) near the Nyquist rate is 9.1. The proposed ACAID saves more power as the input frequency increases or when the portion of the tracking period reduces. The prototyped driver circuit can save 49.5% power consumption when the input frequency is  $100\thinspace {\mathrm { kHz}}$  with a 10% duty cycle for tracking. The power-saving ratio can be up to 76.2% when the sampling rate increases to  $1\thinspace {\mathrm { MHz}}$ .</description></item><item><title>An 11uW, 0.08 mm2, 125dB-Dynamic-Range Current-Sensing Dynamic CT Zoom ADC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10549922</link><description>A Dynamic Continuous-Time Zoom-ADC current to digital converter for bio-sensing applications is presented, comprising a current DAC (IDAC), a loop filter, a comparator, and loop logic. Within the IDAC, a reference voltage is driven to resistor legs, obtaining an accurate current with high Rout. A  $1^{\mathrm {st}}$  order loop filter utilizes an inherently linear, zero-static-power, passive integrator. An isolation of the integrator from external sensor capacitance is obtained by a cascode transistor, enabling the use of the passive integrator. During the Zoom&#8217;s SAR phase, a binary search detects the approximate signal level and provides zoomed references for the Sigma-Delta phase, where fine conversion is performed. The dynamic mode tracks the comparator output data to determine when the input signal is close to the references and updates them accordingly. This paper is the first to propose a dynamic zoom ADC which utilizes a single DAC. An over-voltage detector detects integrator voltages exceeding the supply level, a result of high input currents, and prevents damage to the circuit. A 65nm implementation achieved a competitive dynamic range of 125dB, an SNR of 91dB and an FoM of 192dB. The design occupies 0.08 mm2, and a state-of-the-art power consumption of 11.4uW was measured. The dynamic mode supports up to 78Hz inputs, and an SFDR of 90.4dB was measured.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Memristor Based Distributed Decision Tree Circuit for Cybersecurity Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10537617</link><description>Cybersecurity at the edge requires fast computing in energy-constrained environments. Decision trees can provide an explainable solution for network intrusion detection with high detection accuracy at the packet level. However, their hardware implementation needs to support efficient real-time operation. In this paper, we propose a spatially distributed decision tree for network intrusion detection, using memristor-based chiplet leaves. Each chiplet processes an input by comparing it to a predefined boundary stored in the memristor cell and provides a binary output to select one of the interconnected leaves on the lower level, with an estimated power consumption in a 130nm node design of  $389~\mu $ W. The delay is  $2.5~\mu $ s for one inference decision. This chiplet approach is reconfigurable and in line with the natural architecture of decision trees. It also supports the prototyping with known good dies, overcoming the non-idealities challenge prevalent in memristor technologies. Our memristor-based decision trees show high intrusion detection accuracy of 82%, 84%, and 73% on the benchmark UNSW, CIC-IDS, and ACI-IoT datasets respectively, considering 6-bit device precision in one memristor vs. three memristor per boundary configurations. This distributed approach opens the way to utilizing memristor technology despite device defects for applications in need of local real-time computing.</description></item><item><title>A 50-Gb/s PAM-4 Receiver With Adaptive Phase-Shifting CDR in 28-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10516468</link><description>This paper presents a 50-Gb/s receiver (RX) with an adaptive phase-shifting (APS) phase detector (PD) for four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) clock and data recovery (CDR). The APS PD adopts a  $\beta $  detector to achieve a unique locking point that resolves the dead-zone problem caused by the combination of the conventional baud-rate PD and adaptive decision feedback equalizer (DFE). The APS CDR is configured with a sign-sign minimum mean squared error (SS-MMSE) PD and an addition of a digital coefficient which is adaptively controlled through the  $\beta $  detector by detecting pre-cursor inter-symbol interference (ISI) dependency of 1-level transitions. Therefore, the proposed CDR does not rely on external coefficients. Furthermore, adaptive programmable gain amplifiers (PGAs) and DFE are implemented with the APS CDR to compensate the pre and post-cursor ISIs, and main-cursor level. Since the adaptive equalizers and the APS CDR share the error samplers, no additional analog hardware is required. Fabricated in 28-nm CMOS technology, a prototype PAM-4 RX operates at 50 Gb/s and occupies an active area of 0.16 mm2. The RX tested over a 25.3-dB loss channel achieves a bit error rate (BER) of less than  $10^{-12}$  and energy efficiency of 2.52 pJ/b.</description></item><item><title>A 0.6 V, 1.74 mW, 2.9 dB NF Inductorless Wideband LNA in 28-nm CMOS Exploiting Noise Cancellation and Current Reuse</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10557511</link><description>This paper proposes an inductorless wideband common-gate (CG)-common-source (CS) noise-cancelling (NC) low-noise amplifier (LNA) with current reuse (CR) for ultra-low voltage (ULV) application. In the conventional NC LNA with CR, to reuse the DC current of the auxiliary amplifier, three transistors are stacked in a single branch, leading to a reduced voltage headroom. Moreover, additional inductor and capacitors are required, resulting in a large silicon area. In the proposed work, the DC current of the auxiliary amplifier can be reused without using any inductor. Meanwhile, only two transistors are stacked in a single branch, making it suitable for ULV application.

The design procedure relies on a modified analytical role-exchange Doherty-Chireix continuum theory which doubles the design space for the realization of high-efficiency PAs with a mode of operation continuously changing between the Chireix mode and two role-exchange hybrid Doherty-Chireix outphasing modes as the frequency varies up and down, respectively. Using this theory, a mixed-mode CM-OPA with constant output power back-off level and constant saturated power is developed. The CM-OPA theory is first verified at the current-source reference planes for a frequency range from 1.3 GHz to 2.0 GHz for a GaN HEMT. The proposed CM-OPA is then implemented at the package reference planes using the embedding model to synthesize the combiner circuit across the entire frequency bandwidth. The 1.3 to 2.0 GHz bandwidth-enhanced CM-OPA was fabricated and characterized using both continuous-wave and modulated signals. When driven by a 20-MHz LTE signal with 7.1 dB peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR), the proposed CM-OPA achieves better than -45 dBc adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) and higher than 44% power-added efficiency (PAE) after digital predistortion linearization at 1.3/1.6/1.8 GHz.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Design of a Sub-Sampling PLL of Low Phase Noise and Low Reference Spur</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10489983</link><description>This paper presents an analog low-power sub-sampling phase locked loop (PLL) that tackles the reference spur caused by VCO load modulation from the sub-sampling operation.

Histogramming is a common technique employed to detect, analyze, and store enormous volumes of data in real-time, making it useful for industrial applications in fields such as biology, chemistry, medical imaging, and spectroscopy. Due for them programming simplicity and low-cost large amount of memory, general-purpose temporal computing processors are commonly used, but they lack the ability to perform parallel computation at high-performance.

However, further improvements in computing energy efficiency are still desirable for resource-constrained conditions and practical applications. Therefore, in this work, a memristive analog transiently chaotic neural network (TCNN) system is proposed to solve the traveling salesman problems (TSPs), which is consisted of 1) a memristor array to perform matrix-vector multiplication for the network iteration; 2) neuronal modules and nonlinear activation function modules to emulate the basic functions of the network; 3) chaotic simulated annealing (CSA) modules to improve the solution performance at extremely low hardware overhead. Based on these, after mapping the TSPs onto the memristor array, the proposed TCNN can self-iterate to convergence states to solve the problems with high performance.

Its hardware realization is challenging due to the complex exponential and reciprocal operations. Existing studies applied piecewise models to approximate sigmoid function and employed numerical methods or non-uniform input segmentations to mitigate fitting inaccuracies. However, the breakpoints introduce inevitable approximation precision loss. Besides, additional fitting processes greatly increase hardware complexity and power consumption. This paper presents a hardware-friendly sigmoidal approximation from the perspective of probability theory. We find that for a given input, the output of a sigmoid function can be approximated by the probability that the sum of this input and a Gaussian random variable is greater than or equal to zero. As the derived theorem does not involve piecewise expressions, the precision loss caused by the breakpoint issue is avoided. A low-complexity binary-search-based address localization method is proposed to optimize our theorem for hardware implementation. For the optimized scheme, an efficient implemented circuit is also presented. Our scheme&#8217;s approximation ability and hardware efficiency are validated through software modeling and FPGA- and ASIC-based experiments. Feedforward neural network-based classification applications demonstrate that building networks with the proposed sigmoid approximator has only a tiny recognition rate loss.</description></item><item><title>Stabilization of Noisy Sampled-Data Networked Control Systems: Application to Interleaved Flyback Modular Integrated Converter Circuit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10485572</link><description>This paper is concerned with noisy sampled-data networked control systems with stochastic network-induced delays and noisy sampling intervals using a stochastic discrete integral quadratic constraint (DIQC) approach.

Due to its inherent ability of voltage amplification, the transformer-based voltage-multiplier becomes prevalent in step-up converters which are the inevitable parts in the usage of low-voltage renewable resources. Though its feasibility has been verified in many researches, an uncertain error in voltage conversion ratio exists between the reality and ideal, which leaves a theoretical gap. Accordingly, the key affecting characteristics, the reverse recovery process of the leakage inductance, is considered and analyzed in this paper. The power transmission mechanism is clarified, and the root-mean-square error of the gain can be reduced from 24.31% to 3.13%, and the maximum output power together with power effect on the gain are obtained. With the conclusion of this paper, parameters of power supply can be optimized at the beginning of design to satisfy the demand of maximum output power and gain over a wide power range, which can save the unnecessary trial-and-error during the case-by-case design.</description></item><item><title>A Single-Inductor Multiple-Output DC&#8211;DC Converter With Fixed-Frequency Victim-Last Charge Control for Reduced Cross Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10531808</link><description>This paper presents a single-inductor multiple-output (SIMO) DC-DC converter with fixed-frequency victim-last charge control. This scheme switches the load-transient channel (victim) to the last of the charging sequence, addressing the inherent cross-regulation issue in conventional charge control SIMO. We first analyze why the conventional fixed-frequency charge control has such an issue. Then, we present the working principle of the proposed scheme. After that, we propose a charge-error calibration technique that minimizes the side effects caused by victim-last control, ensuring a smooth order switching of the original last channel. We implemented and fabricated the proposed SIMO DC-DC converter in a 0.18- $\mu $ m BCD process. Measurement results show that we are able to reduce the cross-regulation to 0.057mV/mA with a 225-mA load step under fixed switching frequency. The measured peak efficiency is 84.1%.</description></item><item><title>Single-Phase Standalone Multi-Port DC/AC Inverter for Multiple Energy Production and Storage Units</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10552113</link><description>Multi-port power converters enable the combination of renewable energy sources and energy storage. This paper presents a single-phase standalone multi-port inverter (MPI) that integrates a photovoltaic (PV) array, a battery storage unit, a supercapacitor (SC) bank, and electric vehicle (EV) battery. The proposed MPI regulates the power flow between these ports to ensure optimal energy management and reliable operation of the AC power-supply system. The PV array is directly connected to the DC-link, eliminating the need for an additional power converter and reducing the volume and cost of the overall MPI. The energy management algorithm is designed to independently control each port and maintain a power balance between the input and output of the proposed MPI. Compared to conventional MPI architectures, the multi-port DC/AC inverter proposed in this paper contains less power devices, resulting in reduced switching power losses and implementation cost. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in regulating each port independently under various power flow scenarios, with a maximum efficiency of 95.3%.</description></item><item><title>A Fully Digital Relaxation-Aware Analog Programming Technique for HfOx RRAM Arrays</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10454578</link><description>For neuromorphic engineering to emulate the human brain, improving memory density with low power consumption is an indispensable but challenging goal. In this regard, emerging RRAMs have attracted considerable interest for their unique qualities like low power consumption, high integration potential, durability, and CMOS compatibility. Using RRAMs to imitate the more analog storage behavior of brain synapses is also a promising strategy for further improving memory density and power efficiency. However, RRAM devices display strong stochastic behavior, together with relaxation effects, making it more challenging to precisely control their multi-level storage capability. To address this, researchers have reported different multi-level programming strategies, mostly involving the precise control of analog parameters like compliance current during write operations and/or programming voltage amplitudes. Here, we present a new fully digital relaxation-aware method for tuning the conductance of analog RRAMs. The method is based on modulating digital pulse widths during erase operations while keeping other parameters fixed, and therefore requires no precise alterations to analog parameters like compliance currents or programming voltage amplitudes. Experimental results, with and without relaxation effect awareness, on a 64 RRAM 1T1R HfOx memory array of cells, fabricated in 130nm CMOS technology, indicate that it is possible to obtain 2-bit memory per cell multi-value storage at the array level, verified 1000 seconds after programming.</description></item><item><title>An Inductance-Variation-Insensitive Buck Converter Using a Dynamic Ramp Compensation With Slope Sensing Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10462485</link><description>This brief introduces a current-mode DC-DC buck converter that operates without performance degradations, even when the inductance value changes. The proposed circuit can be widely utilized to ensure the stable operation of various systems, as inductor values in PMICs may fluctuate despite being identical components. The proposed Inductance-Variation-Insensitive (IVI) buck converter directly senses the rate of change of inductor current and transmits information about the output voltage and inductance to a dynamic ramp generator. The dynamic ramp generator produces a ramp signal proportionate to the sensed inductor current slope, thereby maintaining a deadbeat state and preventing subharmonic oscillations. This innovative approach enables the converter to function seamlessly across a wide range of output values while maintaining overall stability. The proposed buck converter is fabricated using a 0.18  $\mu $  m 1P6M CMOS process, occupying an active area of  $0.82~mm^{2}$ . Experimental results demonstrate its stable operation over a broad range of output voltages, even in the presence of inductance variations, when compared to conventional fixed-ramp approaches. It exhibits a transient response recovery time of 3.9  $\mu $  s for a load change from 50 mA to 350 mA and 4.7  $\mu $  s for the reverse change, from 350 mA to 50 mA. Furthermore, this brief achieves a maximum power efficiency of 90.5%, accompanied by an output ripple of less than 30 mV.</description></item><item><title>Norton-Transformed Wideband High-Order Analog All-Pass Delays</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10462323</link><description>In this brief, we propose a novel compact wideband high-order all-pass-filter (APF) topology for use as an analog delay circuit.

The proposed VGPS circuit includes an in-phase-power-splitting stage that evenly divides the input signal. These two resulting signals are then directed into two separate phase-only tunable components achieved through phase shifters (PSs). Careful selection of specific phase settings for the two PSs yields the desired overall gain and phase shift when their outputs are combined. The operational principle and theoretical analysis of the proposed VGPS circuit are provided. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed topology, a VGPS circuit demonstrator was implemented using 45 nm Silicon-on-Insulator CMOS technology. The demonstrator incorporates two reflection-type phase shifters and non-isolated splitters/combiners at the input/output, fitting within a compact area of  $0.179~mm^{2}$ . Measurement results reveal excellent gain and phase tuning ranges of 20 dB (ranging from -7.5 dB to -27.5 dB) and 360&#176;, respectively.

This article presents a collaborative jitter-aware optimization in 2.5-D integrated circuits (ICs), incorporating power supply induced jitter (PSIJ), system impedance, target impedance, and decoupling capacitors, based on the hybrid precomputation and prestorage/duplicate removal-nondominated sorting differential evolution (PCPS/DR-NSDE) algorithm. An automatic channel model algorithm and a uniform decoupling capacitor placement strategy are proposed to improve the design efficiency. Then, the system transfer impedance, simultaneous switch current, sensitivity function, and amplification factor are individually modeled, leading to the assembly and verification of the final PSIJ in the 2.5-D system. A precomputation and prestorage (PCPS) strategy is proposed to handle high-time-consuming modules in the objective function and a duplicate removal (DR) operation is added to improve algorithm performance. The proposed PCPS/DR-NSDE is faster than traditional algorithms and has optimal hypervolume and coverage-metric (C-metric) indicators. The procedures for further obtaining desired solutions in the Pareto front are discussed. The impact of practical constraints and target impedance is also analyzed.

This NoC technology effectively addresses the escalating need for high-performance and energy-efficient on-chip communication in various applications, including high-performance computing (HPC), graphics processing units (GPUs), and multiprocessor SoCs (MPSoCs). However, the efficient mapping of applications onto 3-D Network-on-Chips (3-D NoC) remains a complex challenge, necessitating the development of improved algorithms to address the issue. In this context, we present a novel neural mapping model with a reinforcement learning (RL) approach (NeurMap3D) to design application-specific 3-D NoC-based IC. Additionally, we propose the neural congestion-aware through-silicon vias (TSVs) placement and application mapping (NCTPAM) approach, which not only addresses application mapping but also incorporates TSVs placement and load balance across the TSVs for the specific application. In order to reduce the CPU execution time of NCTPAM algorithm, we propose incorporating a partial model parameter  $(\theta)$  update mechanism.

However, the stacked memory architecture exhibits high power density, causing thermal hotspots. Further, systems under power constraints require careful planning for intelligent allocation of the available power to their various components. A straightforward dynamic power management policy of allocating more power to potentially high memory activity 3-D DRAM ranks so as to maximize system performance causes a rise in the temperature of such ranks, making them susceptible to thermal stalls and shutdown by dynamic thermal management (DTM) strategies. A rise in rank temperature, in turn, increases the leakage power of memory ranks, affecting power budgeting decisions. Thus, a coordinated strategy for power budgeting and thermal management is needed. We propose an adjacency-aware dynamic power budgeting technique, 3D-TemPo, which dynamically performs a reward-based power allocation to memory ranks, in order to maximize 3-D DRAM performance under power and thermal constraints, and is sensitive to strong thermal correlations between vertically adjacent ranks. We evaluate 3D-TemPo using SPEC CPU2017 and PARSEC 2.1 benchmark suites and observe speedups of  $1\times $  to  $17.94\times $  compared to baseline strategies.</description></item><item><title>Fast and Scaled Counting-Based Stochastic Computing Divider Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10436412</link><description>This article presents novel designs for stochastic computing (SC)-based dividers, which promise low latency, high energy efficiency, as well as high accuracy for error-tolerant arithmetic operations. We first introduce CBDIV, which is based on the recently proposed counter-based SC concept and correlation-based SC to perform division. Then, we introduce FSCDIV, which further improves the accuracy of CBDIV by applying a scaling strategy and mitigating the latency by optimizing the counting scheme. The FSCDIV will equally scale up the divider and dividend before the division process, and thereby avoid large relative error when both input values of the divider and dividend are small. The proposed fast counting method accelerates FSCDIV by counting new bit pair (0&#8211;1 pair) among only half of the stochastic number bitstream instead of the entire bitstream, resulting in almost half of the counting latency and one-fourth of the overall division operation latency. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CBDIV, implemented in a 32-nm technology node, outperforms state-of-the-art works by 77.8% in accuracy, 37.1% in delay, 21.5% in area, 50.6% in area delay product (ADP), and 25.9% in power consumption. Compared to the fixed-point division baseline, CBDIV also achieves a 31.9% reduction in energy consumption and is more energy efficient than existing SC-based dividers for binary inputs and outputs required in efficient image processing implementations. Moreover, we demonstrate that FSCDIV improves delay by 56.4%, ADP by 16.0%, energy consumption by 45.0%, and accuracy by 61.2%. We also evaluate CBDIV and FSCDIV designs in a contrast stretch image processing workload, and the results show that the proposed designs can improve the image quality by up to 18.3 dB on average when compared to state-of-the-art works.</description></item><item><title>ReApprox-PIM: Reconfigurable Approximate Lookup-Table (LUT)-Based Processing-in-Memory (PIM) Machine Learning Accelerator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443597</link><description>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved significant success in various applications. Numerous hardware accelerators are introduced to accelerate CNN execution with improved energy efficiency compared to traditional software implementations. Despite the achieved success, deploying traditional hardware accelerators for bulky CNNs on current and emerging smart devices is impeded by limited resources, including memory, power, area, and computational capabilities. Recent works introduced processing-in-memory (PIM), a non-Von-Neumann architecture, which is a promising approach to tackle the problem of data movement between logic and memory blocks. However, as observed from the literature, the existing PIM architectures cannot congregate all the computational operations due to limited programmability and flexibility. Furthermore, the capabilities of the PIM are challenged by the limited available on-chip memory. To enable faster computations and address the limited on-chip memory constraints, this work introduces a novel reconfigurable approximate computing (AC)-based PIM, termed reconfigurable approximate PIM (ReApprox-PIM). The proposed ReApprox-PIM is capable of addressing the two challenges mentioned above in the following manner: 1) it utilizes a programmable lookup-table (LUT)-based processing architecture that can support different AC techniques via programmability and 2) followed by resource-efficient, fast CNN computing via the implementation of highly optimized AC techniques. This results in improved computing footprint, operational parallelism, and reduced computational latency and power consumption compared to prior PIMs relying on exact computations for CNN inference acceleration at a minimal sacrifice of accuracy. We have evaluated the proposed ReApprox-PIM on various CNN architectures, for inference applications, including standard LeNet, AlexNet, ResNet-18, &#8722;34, and &#8722;50. Our experimental results show that the ReApprox-PIM achieves a speedup of  $1.63\times $  with  $1.66\times $  lower area for the processing components compared to the existing PIM architectures. Furthermore, the proposed ReApprox-PIM achieves  $2.5\times $  higher energy efficiency and  $1.3\times $  higher throughput compared to the state-of-the-art LUT-based PIM architectures.</description></item><item><title>Inter-Task Energy-Hotspot Elimination in Fixed-Priority Real-Time Embedded Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10457858</link><description>Multitask real-time embedded systems are often restricted by tight energy budgets, whilst they usually have environmental interactions through software-controlled energy-hungry peripheral modules, such as LTE, WiFi, and GSM. The way that the driver calls are used within the embedded software to do such a control introduces program energy-hotspots (EHs) from the peripheral module perspective, namely, the code pieces wasting the system energy. By the energy waste, we mean that the energy consumption is reducible via some program code modifications without threatening the system schedulability and logical correctness. This article examines the program EHs of fixed-priority real-time tasks where two types of energy inefficiency can occur: 1) intra-task type, causing energy waste even if a task runs individually and 2) inter-task type, happening due to the interaction between different system tasks, namely, preemption scenarios even if there is no intra-task EH. The main cause of such EHs is the unnecessary time intervals between the driver calls, causing extra energy consumption by peripheral modules. We propose some static analysis methods to automatically detect and eliminate both types of intra- and inter-task EHs regarding their mutual relevance, according to the extreme (worst-case and best-case) execution times of certain task code parts. Our manipulations on the tasks to eliminate the EHs include some program code modifications with the awareness of system schedulability and logical correctness, and changing some scheduling decisions, namely, limiting the preemption points. After applying our proposed method to the test tasks, our simulation results show an energy reduction of up to 19%.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Power Variation-Tolerant 7T SRAM With Enhanced Read Sensing Margin for Voltage Scaling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10439970</link><description>Reducing the minimum operating voltage  $(V_{\mathrm {min}})$  and improving the variation tolerance are the main design challenges of voltage-scalable static random access memories (SRAMs).

Though several schemes have been developed over the years, unfortunately, they suffer from time-consumption, power-consumption, and resource-bound tradeoff issues. Another major issue concerns designing efficient architecture to perform the alignment of multiple sequences. A novel hierarchical multiprocessing architecture, designed around pipelined processing elements, is presented for multiple pairwise sequence alignment at hardware-speed. In addition to parallel intrasequence trace-back value generation, it can efficiently perform parallel intersequence computation to attain maximum utilization of processing elements. It can accomplish parallel trace-back operations to achieve massive parallelism. It consumes  ${O({ni})}$  or  ${O({ji})}$  clock-cycles to perform alignment operations for  $j$ -nucleotide query and  $i$  reference sequences of  $n$ -nucleotide, instead of  ${O({(n+j)i})}$  or  ${O({nji})}$  clock-cycles used in state-of-the-art architectures. The entire architecture is evaluated for 16-to-512 multiple sequences of 16-to-512 nucleotides.

Especially with ever-increasing deep learning-based AI model size and computing complexity, it becomes the bottleneck for state-of-the-art AI computing systems. To address this challenge, in-memory computing (IMC)-based Neural Network accelerators have been widely investigated to support AI computing within memory. However, most of those works focus only on inference. The on-device training and continual learning have not been well explored yet. In this work, for the first time, we introduce on-device continual learning with STT-assisted-SOT (SAS) magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM)-based IMC system. On the hardware side, we have fabricated a STT-assisted-SOT MRAM (SAS-MRAM) device prototype with 4 magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs, each at 100 nm  $\times50$  nm) sharing a common heavy metal layer, achieving significantly improved memory writing and area efficiency compared to traditional SOT-MRAM. Next, we designed fully digital IMC circuits with our SAS-MRAM to support both neural network inference and on-device learning.

However, existing QCNNs still require nontrivial hardware resources and memory capacity in order not to compromise model accuracy. To address this issue, we propose an antiferromagnetic magnetic random-access memory (ARAM)-based processing-in-memory (PIM) system, leveraging bit-level sparsity. Three optimization techniques are proposed to optimize hardware resource utilization while preserving CNN accuracy. First, the ARAM-based memory subsystem allows dynamic adaptation of variable bit-width across CNN layers.

Third, a customized data path within the RISC-V core guarantees efficient instruction processing to the ARAM-based memory subsystem and bit-level accelerator, enabling optimal bit-level data transmission and computation. Experimental results demonstrate that this design remarkably reduces data movement by 50%&#8211;83% across existing CNNs. Compared to state-of-the-art designs, it enhances throughput and latency by an average of  $5\times $  and  $10\times $ , respectively. In addition, this design achieves speedups between  $1.63\times $  and  $2.96\times $ , outstripping other designs in AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet18 benchmarks.</description></item><item><title>Design of Sequential Load Modulation Balance Amplifier Using Multiobjective Particle Swarm Algorithm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443236</link><description>In this article, a multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MPSO) method is presented for the design of a sequential load modulation balanced amplifier (SLMBA).

In order to validate the proposed method, a SLMBA with a frequency range of 1.8&#8211;2.1 GHz was implemented and measured. Consequently, it is capable of achieving a saturation drain efficiency (DE) of 70.1%&#8211;74.3%, a saturated output power of 43.7 dBm, and a DE of 52.3%&#8211;57.9% with 10.5-dB output back-off. In order to improve the linearity of the manufactured SLMBA, a digital predistortion method has been implemented, and a 20-MHz 5GNR signal has been used to test the device with good results.</description></item><item><title>Compute-in-Memory-Based Neural Network Accelerators for Safety-Critical Systems: Worst-Case Scenarios and Protections</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10436429</link><description>Emerging nonvolatile memory (NVM)-based computing-in-memory (CiM) architectures show substantial promise in accelerating deep neural networks (DNNs) due to their exceptional energy efficiency. However, NVM devices are prone to device variations. Consequently, the actual DNN weights mapped to NVM devices can differ considerably from their targeted values, inducing significant performance degradation. Many existing solutions aim to optimize average performance amidst device variations, which is a suitable strategy for general-purpose conditions. However, the worst-case performance that is crucial for safety-critical applications is largely overlooked in current research. In this study, we define the problem of pinpointing the worst-case performance of CiM DNN accelerators affected by device variations. Additionally, we introduce a strategy to identify a specific pattern of the device value deviations in the complex, high-dimensional value deviation space, responsible for this worst-case outcome. Our findings reveal that even subtle device variations can precipitate a dramatic decline in DNN accuracy, posing risks for CiM-based platforms in supporting safety-critical applications. Notably, we observe that prevailing techniques to bolster average DNN performance in CiM accelerators fall short in enhancing worst-case scenarios. In light of this issue, we propose a novel worst-case-aware training technique named A-TRICE that efficiently combines adversarial training and noise-injection training with right-censored Gaussian noise to improve the DNN accuracy in the worst-case scenarios. Our experimental results demonstrate that A-TRICE improves the worst-case accuracy under device variations by up to 33%.</description></item><item><title>Cross-Domain Optimization of Low-Power Mixed-Signal Sensor Systems Under Classification Accuracy Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10457029</link><description>Optimizing mixed-signal systems-on-chips (SoCs) is a challenging task, especially when they involve both analog building blocks and machine-learning (ML) algorithms which make the overall system performance hard to predict. This article proposes a methodology for optimizing complex mixed-signal sensor systems, which consists of three steps: 1) modeling Pareto-optimal local performance of individual circuits; 2) building a macromodel of the mixed-signal system performance, including local nonidealities; and 3) finding the optimal set of system-level parameters using numerical optimization. The methodology is applied to the use case of an electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor system with embedded arrhythmia classification, with the objective of minimizing the system power consumption while imposing constraints on inference accuracy. Different numerical optimization methods are compared to evaluate their respective performance on the minimization task: gradient-based, genetic, or Bayesian optimization. The proposed methodology achieves the optimization in a reasonable execution time of 10 h, which had not been previously demonstrated on such complex mixed-signal system. Among the different methods tested, Bayesian optimization provides the best-success rate of 97% and fastest convergence speed.</description></item><item><title>Accelerating Real-Valued FFT on CPU-FPGA Platforms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472631</link><description>The real-valued fast Fourier transform (RFFT) is an ideal candidate for implementing a high-speed and low-power FFT processor because it only has approximately half the number of arithmetic operations compared with traditional complex-valued FFT (CFFT). Although RFFT can be calculated using CFFT hardware, a dedicated RFFT implementation can result in reduced hardware complexity, power consumption and increased throughput. However, unlike CFFT, RFFT has irregular signal flow graphs which hinders the design of efficient pipelined architectures. In this article, utilizing open computing language (OpenCL), we propose a high-level programming method for the implementation of pipelined architectures of RFFT on FPGAs. By identifying the regular computational pattern in the flow graph of RFFT, the proposed method essentially uses a for loop to implement the RFFT algorithm, and later with the help of high-level synthesis tools, the loop is fully unrolled to automatically build pipelined architectures. Experiments show that for a 4096-point RFFT, the proposed method achieves a  $2.49\times $  speedup and  $3.09\times $  better-energy efficiency over CUFFT on GPU, and a  $21.12\times $  speedup and  $16.09\times $  better-energy efficiency over FFTW on CPU, respectively. Compared to Intel&#8217;s CFFT design on the same FPGA, the proposed one reduces 12% logic resources and 16% DSP blocks, respectively, while achieving a  $1.48\times $  speedup.</description></item></channel></rss>
