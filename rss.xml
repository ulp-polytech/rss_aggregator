Unlike conventional reliance on virtual junction temperature in normal conditions, evaluating the non-uniform temperature distribution across the chip under surge conditions is essential for robustness and field reliability. This paper proposes a novel field-circuit coupling model for temperature calculation of SiC mosfets. The proposed field-circuit coupling model enables the collaborative computation of temperature fields and circuits within circuit simulation platforms, capturing the spatial distribution of electrical and thermal properties across the chip. The validity of the field-circuit coupling calculation model is verified through three different test conditions. The electrical and thermal characteristics of SiC mosfets under different surge current amplitudes are analyzed, leading to a prediction of the maximum surge current capacity of the device. The method proposed in this paper extends the traditional field-circuit coupling method, providing a novel perspective for calculating the temperature of power devices under extreme conditions. To enhance understanding, this paper is accompanied by a video demonstrating the computational process of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Reconfigurable Rectifier Based Communication-Free Wireless LED Driver With Dual-Customization CC Outputs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10737122</link><description>Due to the advantages of safety and convenience, wireless power transfer technology is a good candidate for underwater LEDs driving.

However, the additional switches required for each battery in this technology can introduce significant losses. To further reduce this portion of the losses, this letter proposes a DRB topology suitable for dc microgrid applications. This topology uses the same number of switches as the half-bridge topology but reduces the number of switches that current flows through during operation. Moreover, it allows for hybrid series-parallel connections between batteries, whereas the half-bridge topology only permits series connections. Comparative analysis shows that the proposed topology reduces losses from the additional switches by approximately 33% compared with the half-bridge topology in applications of a similar scale. Simulation and experimental results validate the performance of this topology in controllable input/output and self-balancing. Compared to existing topologies, this solution reduces losses while maintaining reconfiguration capability, making it well-suited for scenarios where high reliability and efficiency are critical. This advancement in DRB technology offers a new approach to energy storage system topology selection.</description></item><item><title>A Novel All-Passive Resonant Gate for LLC DCX Synchronous Rectification</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10746624</link><description>The drive losses of synchronous rectifier (SR) mosfets become significant factor limiting the efficiency of high-frequency, low-voltage, and high-current output LLC dc transformer (LLC DCX) in data center power supply applications.

Most of the PFM controllers rely on multiple sensors/control loops and exploit multiple proportional integral (PI) controllers. Thus, straightforward digital implementation of these controllers will not be simple and cost-effective. This article proposes a simple digital PFM control scheme for the series resonant converter (SRC)-based LED driver. The slope of the frequency change of the proposed PFM scheme is implemented using a hysteresis current regulator. The hysteresis current regulator utilizes an envelope signal and the rising and falling of the envelope signal are controlled by a hysteresis band. A sawtooth wave is compared with the envelope signal to produce variable frequency pulses. Thus, the proposed scheme can implement PFM without using any PI controller. Furthermore, the proposed technique exploits only one sensor and one control loop. Therefore, the proposed scheme is simple, cost-effective, and does not impose a huge computational burden on the digital platform. Guidelines for designing different components of the proposed control scheme are presented. Moreover, considering current output, the gain of the whole SRC LED system is derived and the design steps of the output filter are discussed. A 170W SRC LED driver prototype is developed and the proposed scheme is validated using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based digital platform. The proposed digital control scheme can be extended further for other resonant converter-based LED drivers.</description></item><item><title>Two-Segment High-Performance PV Grid-Connected Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10717474</link><description>In PV grid-connected applications, a grid-connected converter is usually used to connect with the grid to realize dc/ac conversion and power flow control. How to improve the quality of grid-connected current of power equipment so that the harmonic content injected into the grid is as little as possible has become a hot research topic in the field of PV grid-connected applications.

Reducing the current harmonics of the DTP-PMSM is beneficial for enhancing operational efficiency, diminishing noise and vibration, and improving electromagnetic compatibility, which is of significant importance for boosting the overall performance of the system. This article focuses on the current harmonic minimum pulse width modulation (CHMPWM) for the surface-mounted DTP-PMSM with a 3L-NPC inverter and an output filter. Based on the system model, the relationship between the switching angles and the harmonic current of the motor is derived, and the mathematical model of CHMPWM is established. Furthermore, the optimal switching angles that minimize the current harmonics can be obtained by solving the established optimization problem. The proposed CHMPWM takes into account the effect of filter and motor parameters on the current harmonic characteristics, which is the main difference from the conventional CHMPWM. Simulation and experimental studies were conducted on a 1 MW/40MJ flywheel energy storage system, and the results show that compared to sine PWM and space vector PWM, the current harmonics of the proposed CHMPWM are reduced by more than 40% on average. Compared to the conventional CHMPWM, the proposed CHMPWM further reduces the current harmonics by more than 20% on average and exhibits good robustness to motor parameters.</description></item><item><title>Low-Frequency Oscillation Damping of Grid-Forming STATCOMs With Phase-Compensated DC-Link Voltage Synchronization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10734203</link><description>The dc-link voltage synchronization (DCVS) can be applied in the grid-forming static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) to realize dc-link voltage regulation and synchronization with the grid simultaneously. However, DCVS may lead to low frequency oscillation (LFO) of grid-forming STATCOM. To analyze and resolve the LFO issues of grid-forming STATCOM, this article built the small signal model of grid-forming STATCOM with consideration of DCVS, ac voltage and current dual close loop control (VCDC) and reactive power control (RPC). It is revealed that the LFO is mainly caused by the &#8722;180&#176; phase characteristic of DCVS and phase lag introduced by VCDC. Besides, RPC may bring right half plan poles to the close loop and lead to subsynchronous oscillation. Based on the analysis, a lead-lag compensator is utilized and designed in this article to compensate phase lag in the close loop, which is simple but can effectively damp the LFO of grid-forming STATCOM. Besides, the proposed strategy is compared with the existing methods and shows the advantage of inertia provision to decrease the rate of change of frequency in the synchronization. Simulation and Experimental results validate the stability analysis and effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Level-Increased iSHE Modulation Method for Modular Multilevel Converters Based on DDPG</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10736353</link><description>The output waveform quality of modular multilevel converters (MMCs) may not be good enough when there are only a few submodules (SMs). This article proposes a technique to increase the quantity of equivalent output voltage levels of MMC by changing the capacitor voltage of certain SMs. This method significantly improves the performance of the MMC. In addition, the method combines a level-increased MMC with an improved selected harmonic elimination (iSHE) modulation, aiming to minimize the total harmonic distortion of the MMC output. The primary challenge of the iSHE modulation lies in solving a complex nonlinear mathematical model to determine the optimal switching angles.

Therefore, this article utilizes the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to calculate the optimal switching angles of the MMC. The integration of DDPG algorithm enhances the operational performance of the MMC, thereby contributing to the progress of power electronics using artificial intelligence.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Kalman-Based Constrained Predictive Control With Neural Estimator for a Noninverting Buck&#8211;Boost Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10737695</link><description>This article introduces an adaptive constrained model predictive control (AMPC) method for regulating the voltage of a noninverting dc buck&#8211;boost converter, capable of delivering up to 48 W output. The approach incorporates constraints on the control signal and its variations to minimize oscillations in both input current and output voltage. The AMPC controller employs a linear model, adaptively estimated via an online Kalman-based recursive least squares algorithm. To efficiently manage the computational demands of the AMPC algorithm, a dynamic neural network (DNN), trained using AMPC controller data, is utilized for control within a specific range of the output voltage's steady-state response. A constrained control variable tuning mechanism has been applied to the output of the DNN to reduce the oscillations of the steady-state response more efficiently. Experimental tests have been conducted to assess performance under varying conditions of reference voltage, load, and input voltage. Notably, the fluctuations in output voltage are lower compared to the basic AMPC, another constrained model predictive control, and a PI method. More specifically, for the proposed method, the output voltage fluctuation is about 72%, the calculation time is about 75%, and the minimum energy loss of the switch is about 8.5&#8211;10% average less than the basic AMPC.</description></item><item><title>Full-State Feedback Power Decoupling Control for Grid Forming Converter With Improved Stability and Inertia Response</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10737682</link><description>Virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control strategies have been widely researched and applied in grid-forming converters for utility grid inertia support under high level penetrations of renewable energies. Traditional VSG control encounters coupling issues between active and reactive power loops, especially in low voltage resistive feeder line conditions. This power coupling effect degrades not only the effectiveness of inertia support during transients, but also the system stability. In this article, the coupling mechanism between active and reactive power loops is analyzed and a full-state feedback control method is proposed to release the coupling issue in traditional VSG control. In the proposed control, the state feedback matrix is designed to eliminate the power coupling between active and reactive power control loops, and fully retain the capability for active and reactive inertia response. Disturbance injection is applied to avoid dependence on line parameters. Root locus analysis shows that the decoupled power control endows system with better stability and damping performance. Hardware experimental results indicate that the power decoupling VSG significantly releases the coupling between active and reactive power, contributing to better system stability and providing improved transient power inertia response to power grid.</description></item><item><title>Harmonic Current Injection Control Algorithm for Narrowing the Switching Frequency Range in CrM Totem-Pole PFC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10739909</link><description>Power factor correction (PFC) converters are utilized extensively across various applications, and therefore, developing customized control algorithms is essential to meet the diverse operational requirements. In critical conduction mode totem-pole PFC technology, introducing harmonic currents into a command signal is a viable approach for enhancing the performance of the PFC converter. However, this approach suffers from the risk of exceeding the planned harmonic current injection because of external interference. To overcome this issue, this article introduces a novel control algorithm that incorporates a harmonic injection technique to maintain stable performance despite disturbances or load variations. This algorithm uses Fourier analysis to precisely calculate each harmonic component and employs proportional-integral compensation along with feedforward corrections method to inject harmonic currents accurately in alignment with theoretical expectations. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is validated through experiments conducted on a 350 W totem-pole PFC converter prototype under various load conditions. A comparison between the harmonic injection commands determined through a power analyzer and the actual measurements revealed that control was maintained within an error margin of 4.5%, demonstrating that harmonic control was effectively operational even under load variations.</description></item><item><title>Small-Signal Stability of Sequence-Decomposed Grid-Forming IBRs With DC-Link Voltage Dynamics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10739667</link><description>The proliferation of technical specifications for grid-forming (GFM) inverter-based resources (IBRs) is accelerating globally to facilitate their effective integration in power grids. Notably, the precise regulation of negative sequence currents is currently mandated for GFM IBRs, necessitating the incorporation of sequence-decomposed modules (SDMs) into the GFM control architecture. However, SDMs have an adverse impact on the dynamics of the GFM control loops, resulting in performance loss of system stability. Specifically, GFM IBRs with dc-link voltage control (DVC) are susceptible to losing their steady-state operating points due to the presence of SDMs. This article investigates the effects of SDMs on the small-signal stability of GFM IBRs with DVC. A single-input single-output small-signal model considering interactions of the entire control loops is developed to unveil the unstable subsynchronous oscillation (SSO) issues induced by SDMs. Subsequently, potential remedies for the SSO issues are explored. To mitigate instability risks, an active power reference feedforward control method is proposed to actively dampen the oscillations inherent in the dynamics of active power and dc-link voltage. Controller hardware-in-the-loop experiments are conducted to corroborate the theoretical findings and the efficacy of the proposed control method under different grid conditions.</description></item><item><title>Stability Constrained Transient Overcurrent Capability Enhancement of Grid Forming Converters Based on Switching Frequency Adjustment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10739957</link><description>The short-term overcurrent capability is critical for grid forming (GFM) converters to provide support during grid fault transient. Although the transient overcurrent (TOC) capability enhancement strategy based on customized and oversized design for power converters has developed in recent studies, these solutions are still difficult to promote due to their high cost and complex hardware structures. To address this issue, this article introduces the switching frequency as the degree of freedom to improve the TOC capability of GFM converter at the software level. By actively reducing the switching frequency in the TOC stage, the rise in junction temperature caused by overrated current can be suppressed effectively. Moreover, the inherent control stability issue of the inner voltage vector control loop under the substantial decrease of the switching frequency is quantitatively studied. On this basis, a multiparameters coregulation strategy is further proposed to ensure sufficient stability margin of the control loop during the TOC stage with the decreasing switching frequency. This strategy solves the contradiction between control stability and thermal demands in the switching frequency-based TOC method and it can further enhance the TOC capability without redesigning the hardware. Finally, the proposed TOC capability enhancement strategy is verified in both the electrothermal simulation and experiment.</description></item><item><title>Impedance Profile Prediction for Grid-Connected VSCs With Data-Driven Feature Extraction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10748372</link><description>Data-driven approach is promising for predicting impedance profile of grid-connected voltage source converters (VSCs) under a wide range of operating points (OPs). However, the conventional approaches rely on a one-to-one mapping between operating points and impedance profiles, which, as pointed out in this article, can be invalid for multiconverter systems. To tackle this challenge, this article proposes a stacked-autoencoder-based machine learning framework for the impedance profile predication of grid-connected VSCs, together with its detailed design guidelines. The proposed method uses features, instead of OPs, to characterize impedance profiles, and hence, it is scalable for multiconverter systems. Another benefit of the proposed method is the capability of predicting VSC impedance profiles at unstable OPs of the grid-VSC system. Such prediction can be realized solely based on data collected during stable operation, showcasing its potential for rapid online state estimation. Experiments on both single-VSC and multi-VSC systems validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Isolated Hybrid Three-Level DC Converter With High Voltage Gain and Wide Voltage Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10753076</link><description>The isolated high-voltage gain DAB converter has extensive and significant applications in data centers, electric vehicles, and space power systems.

Incorporating the boost converter into the traditional hybrid T-type three-level converter expands the output voltage range of the converter. Based on this, addressing the issue of increased conduction loss and decreased conversion efficiency caused by the excessive RMS value of the inductor current in the converter, a control strategy based on minimizing the RMS value of the inductor current is proposed. Simultaneously, in order to reduce the switching loss, the conditions for achieving ZVS/ZCS soft switching in the converter are analyzed. Finally, a 100 V/15&#8211;55 V converter experimental prototype is designed and established, and the performance of the new dc converter is experimentally examined. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed new dc converter can not only achieve a high voltage gain but also attain high conversion efficiency within a wide output voltage range.</description></item><item><title>Junction Temperature Extraction for Silicon Carbide Power Devices: A Comprehensive Review</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10740592</link><description>The complete replacement of silicon devices with silicon carbide (SiC) devices still faces many reliability challenges considering higher cost, higher junction temperature, and its wider variations.

In particular, an insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) power module equipped with free-wheeling fast recovery diodes (FRDs) is investigated with two types of TIMs, namely the thermal grease and graphite sheet. The theoretical analysis of thermal coupling among the chips inside the power module is carried out, which is followed by the numerical simulation and experimental test results. The agreement among the results verifies that lower thermal conductivity of the TIMs leads to stronger thermal coupling among chips.

However, IGCT's current-controlled nature restricts its turn-off capability, which in turn limits the fault current handling ability in high-voltage direct current power systems. It has been identified that IGCT has the potential of over-current interruption under ultralow turn-off voltage in the companion paper. Thereby, this article proposes to utilize the insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) in parallel to form an IGCT-IGBT hybrid switch, which facilitates the IGCT with quasi-zero voltage switching condition as well as current turn-off assistance. To testify the effectiveness, the prototype platform of the hybrid switch is developed with a 4-inch 4.5 kV/2.67 kA IGCT and the 4.5 kV/1.2 kA IGBT modules, and a series of current switching tests up to 20 kA are carried out, which reaches five times of IGCT's official turn-off capability.

Accurate steady-state analysis is critical for the parameter design, device selection, and performance evaluation of the DR-MMC. However, existing steady-state analysis methods for this topology demonstrate considerable errors due to insufficient consideration of the DR commutation process and the neglect of the intercoupling between the DR and MMC. This article presents a more elaborate description of the DR commutation process within the DR-MMC by taking into account the dc current ripple, ac-side equivalent series resistance, and the coupling from the MMC. Building upon this, a novel steady-state model constituted by double loops is developed for the DR-MMC. Specifically, the commutation process of the DR and the power conservation of this hybrid topology together form the outer loop, whereas the steady-state model of the individual MMC serves as the inner loop. Experimental results from a scaled-down prototype validate that the proposed steady-state model can determine the electrical quantities of the DR-MMC accurately across its entire operating range.</description></item><item><title>Improved Synchronized SVPWM Strategy for High-Power Three-Level Active Neutral Point Clamped Traction Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10737040</link><description>The high-power three-level active neutral point clamped (3L-ANPC) traction inverter is employed in maglev train. During high-speed operation, the carrier ratio (Cr) is relatively low. To optimize the harmonic performance of the output voltage, an improved synchronized space vector pulsewidth modulation (ISSVM) tailored for the multisampling rate control system is proposed, which can achieve any phase voltage half-period pulse number under an integer multiple Cr of three. Through the proposed spectrum analytical method based on the 3L-ISSVM, the harmonic characteristics of the phase voltage are fundamentally analyzed. A smooth switching strategy for broadband multimode ISSVM by phase compensation and switching in a specific angle interval is introduced. The experimental results indicate that, compared to existing synchronized pulsewidth modulation strategies, the proposed ISSVM offers superior harmonic and dynamic performance. The switching between the two ISSVM strategies can be realized without two-level jump in phase voltage and simultaneous action in three-phase.

This converter is capable of stepping up and down the voltage in a wide range. Moreover, this class of converters uses a small inductor along with a very small film capacitor at the link, instead of electrolytic capacitors used in most conventional dc-link converters. Electrolytic capacitors have a shorter lifetime compared to other components of a power electronic converter and their elimination significantly improves the reliability of a converter. The power conversion is carried out in one stage, increasing the efficiency compared to multistage power converters. Due to the small size of the link capacitor, the dynamic response of the proposed converter would be very fast, making the proposed converter suitable for very fast response applications. Furthermore, when isolation is needed, a compact high-frequency transformer can be employed at the link instead of heavy line-frequency transformers to increase the converter's power density. Compared to &#262;uk-based universal converters, this topology reduces the link peak voltage on the film capacitor and reduces the size of the filters.

However, handling the high-voltage (HV) inputs from TENGs has been a challenging task when a power management integrated circuit (PMIC) is considered. Specifically, HV source characteristics limit converter structures and design strategies for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and input sensing. To address this issue, this study presents a PMIC suitable for TENG energy harvesting. Three key features of this work are perturb and observe based MPPT suitable for TENG energy harvesting implemented efficiently using a novel mixed-signal approach, a filter-based inductor current sensor suitable for measuring the small current from the TENG, and ultralow-power (2.3 nW) voltage and current sensors that measure the HV input from the TENG. Our MPPT approach is based on a simple proportional relationship between the input power and converted digital value. In addition, the proposed approach is implemented using simple pulse counting, which can be realized without a high-power and high-gain amplifier. The digital implementation has a low power consumption of 67 nW. The inductor current sensor is designed to meet the unique TENG characteristics of HV and small current. The proposed PMIC is fabricated using a 180-nm bipolar-CMOS-double-diffused metal oxide semiconductor (DMOS) process. The maximum input voltage to the PMIC is 70 V. All the functions of the integrated circuit are realized using only 786.2 nW. Characterization of the PMIC is performed using fluorinated ethylene propylene-based TENG operating in contact-separation mode. The measured results show a peak tracking efficiency of 97.8% that is achieved at an input power of 88 &#956;W. A peak end-to-end efficiency of 81.2% is achieved when delivering 153 &#956;W output power.</description></item><item><title>Multimode Sequence Modeling Method for Accurate Description of VHF Resonant Converters Based on Mixed Logical Inequalities</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10726730</link><description>Due to the high operating frequency and the fact that they usually work in resonant soft-switching mode, very-high-frequency (VHF) converters are characterized by multiple modes and significant influence of parasitic parameters, and usually suffer from mode-skipping. These characteristics make the modeling and analysis of such systems more difficult. Therefore, taking a VHF resonant boost converter as an example, this article proposes a multimode sequence (MMS) modeling method based on mixed logical inequalities for accurately describing VHF converters. First, according to the mode analysis of the converter, the mode switching sequence is determined. Then, the simplified constraints of each mode are derived. After that, by combining mixed logical inequalities with simplified constraints, the MMS model of the VHF converter is established, and the corresponding calculation process is given. In addition, by a simple derivation, the proposed method can also consider the nonlinear parasitic capacitance and does not affect the computational complexity. It is worth mentioning that the MMS modeling method does not need to obtain analytical expressions for the state variables, so it is not limited by the order and topology of the converter and can provide a basis for the design, analysis, and control of VHF converters. Finally, a prototype with an operating frequency of 10 MHz is built to verify the feasibility of the method.</description></item><item><title>A Compact and Accurate Self-Subtracted RLG Current Sensor for Low-Voltage Monolithic Multiphase Buck Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10737690</link><description>This article introduces a novel self-subtracted RLG current sensor (SSRLGCS) for a low-voltage monolithic multiphase buck converter. The sensor subtracts the product of the duty cycle and VIN voltage from VLX voltage with a simple RC filter to obtain the inductor current information with a sensing gain equal to RLG. By adjusting the RC filter corner frequency, this sensor effectively extracts either the full waveform or dc information of the inductor current, facilitating modulation or phase current balancing, respectively. Furthermore, precisely matching the upper and lower power switch on-resistances, which is easily and is the only design overhead of SSRLGCS, achieved in monolithic power integrated circuit design, ensures accurate inductor current extraction. The developed sensor serves as an on-chip solution for balancing a multiphase buck converter without a traditional off-chip bulky matching filter associated with direct-current resistance current sensing. It guarantees the current balance accuracy independent of off-chip parasites, inductor mismatch, and temperature coefficient. A dual-phase buck converter integrated circuit was fabricated using a taiwan semiconductor (TSMC) 0.18 &#956;m complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process, occupying a compact 0.586 mm&#178; whole chip area (including the power stage) and 0.062 mm&#178; current sensor and current balance circuit area for verifying the SSRLGCS dedicated to the current balance. The measured current balance error is within 2.2% of a loading ranging from 1 A to 2 A. A 71% current sharing accuracy improvement between the two phases is achieved. Moreover, the standalone SSRLGCS measured sensing error falls within 50 mA with a loading range of 1.2 A to 2.6 A.</description></item><item><title>Small-Signal Modeling and Loop Analysis of Ultrafast Series Capacitor Trans-Inductor Voltage Regulator With Constant On-Time Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10740318</link><description>In this article, a comprehensive small-signal model is developed for multiphase series capacitor trans-inductor voltage regulator (SCTLVR) with current mode constant-on time (CMCOT) control.

The mechanisms by which the flying capacitor voltages are able to balance have been extensively studied and theoretically there are certain combinations of level count and duty cycle at which the flying capacitor voltages do not balance. Although the flying capacitor voltages should diverge from the balanced distribution, in practice this behavior is rarely observed. To resolve this discrepancy between FCML converter theory and experiment, this article analyzes the impact of switch output capacitance on the flying capacitor voltage balancing dynamics, and illustrates that this capacitance has a naturally balancing effect. The additional mechanism of switch output capacitance induced balancing is analytically described and compared against experimental results on several FCML converter prototypes.</description></item><item><title>High Step-Down Ripple-Free Resonant DC/DC Converter Using Stacked T-Type Half-Bridge</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10750305</link><description>This article presents a high step-down ripple-free resonant dc/dc converter. By incorporating the stacked T-type half-bridge and center-tapped rectifier structure, it achieved high step-down capability without using a high-turns ratio transformer. By using voltage fluctuation across a T-type half-bridge circuit, hard-switched components are turned off with nearly zero-voltage-switching. Soft-switching capability realizes high switching frequency operation, which brings down the size of the magnetic components. The interleaved active-clamped circuit and corresponding switching modulation with a duty ratio fixed at 0.5 generate ripple-free output current. This aspect ensures no use of extra filter inductor. The use of secondary-side switching hinders the magnetizing current from flowing through the resonant inductor; the core size of the resonant external inductor can remain compact. As a result, the proposed converter features high-voltage step-down, high efficiency, and ripple-free characteristic. To confirm the viability of the design concept, a 1-kW laboratory built prototype is implemented with the input voltage of 400&#8211;600 V and the output voltage of 48 V.</description></item><item><title>Virtual Vector Modulation and Capacitor Voltage Control for Coupled Eight-Switch Three-Phase Three-Level Inverter With Full Lagging Reactive Power Flow Capability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10586755</link><description>Due to the requirement of low cost in photovoltaic (PV) applications, an eight-switch three-phase three-level inverter (TP-TLI) and its modulation strategy have been proposed. However, it can only operate under high power factor (PF) conditions with this modulation strategy. In this article, the reactive power flow capability of each voltage vector is analyzed for the eight-switch TP-TLI. Based on this, a novel virtual space vector modulation (VSVM) is proposed. In each sector, it defines one virtual small vector and uses the vectors which are viable for full operation range of lagging PF. Hence, the proposed VSVM achieves full operation range of lagging PF. Besides, an active neutral point voltage control (NPVC) strategy is also proposed. Only one coefficient needs to be calculated, so the calculation is simple. In addition, it considers both the NPV fluctuation and the NP current introduced by the selected virtual small vector, and it can provide zero, positive, and negative NP current. Hence, it is accurate to control the NPV, and it could balance the NPV without obvious dc offset and ac ripples under all PF conditions and modulation indexes. The proposed modulation and control strategies are verified by experiment results with a 3 kVA prototype.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Topology and Design Methodology for Improved Power Quality of High-Power Charger</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10601658</link><description>This article introduces a novel topology and design methodology of a high-power charger. The proposed topology integrates a modified 12-pulse Diode Bridge Rectifier (12pDBR) with an interleaved boost converter (IBC) to meet the charging requirements and power quality standards.

However, it is difficult to meet the comprehensive requirements of high water pressure resistance, micro size, and low power consumption at the same time, which means that the existing vehicles are difficult to achieve long-term operation in the narrow and complex deep water environment. The piezoelectric jet drive can realize miniaturization, good antipressure ability, and simple control method, while the underactuated mode can reduce energy consumption and extend the endurance time.

However, the existing WPT-based VEs fail to balance the cells once the onboard receiver (Rx) is away from the transmitter (Tx), and the efficiency and capacity are limited. This article proposes a reconfigurable WPT-based multiport hybrid charging approach to achieve UAV&#8217;s cell string balancing under multiple states. By converging one Tx port, one Rx bidirectional port, and two voltage-balance (Vx) driving ports, the approach enables the source-to-cell (STC) and pack-to-cell (PTC) charging/balancing, which achieves cell balancing during charging, discharging, and standing conditions. Circuit analyses of the corresponding topology validate its operating principles and basic performance. Efficiency and capacity in the STC balance mode are improved with the combined Rx and Vx output ports. The cell&#8217;s voltage equivalation can still be realized without Tx in the PTC balance mode. Asymmetric Tx and Rx coils and orthogonal Vx coils integrated into Rx are designed with specific coupling or decoupling as the multiport WPT coupler to enable the charging and balancing with a robust misalignment tolerance. An experimental prototype for eight cells is established, and the test results demonstrate the effectiveness of this scheme.</description></item><item><title>A Family of High Step-Up Interleaved DC-DC Converters Based on the Coupled Inductors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10586749</link><description>This article proposes a series of high-step-up interleaved dc&#8211;dc converters utilizing coupled inductors and quadratic voltage gains.

For high-frequency alternating input voltage, which is conventionally used in wireless power transfer (WPT) systems, the high-order harmonic components are usually regarded as interferences to the system. However, this proposed WPDT solution, instead of filtering the high-order harmonics, uses it as the combined source for simultaneous power and driving signal transmission. Thus, it is possible to design the system for two resonance frequency channels with arbitrary primary currents for control. As a result, the transmission currents for the main power and driving signals can be automatically modulated on the primary side, while demodulated for the two channels on the secondary side. All the control can be completed through only one full-bridge converter. The experimental prototype successfully demonstrates that the system can be flexibly shifted between two modes for 1/0 driving signal transmission while maintaining the stability of the output power with high efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Multiple Frequency Spectrum Impedance Matching Method of Nonlinear Geological Surveying Electromagnetic Method for Power Amplifier Capacity Utilization Enhancement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10586773</link><description>This article proposes a multiple frequency spectrum impedance matching method to extend the applying environment of the impedance matching technology from linear sinusoidal voltage to nonlinear voltage in the electromagnetic method (EM) of geological survey.

Although SiC devices are known to reduce switching losses, a snubber is essential to mitigate the high dv/dt ratio on the switch&#8217;s drain&#8211;source voltage, which results from the surge in current when the SiC switch is turned off. This work proposes a floating-voltage source (FVS)-based snubber, presenting a single-circuit solution that provides soft turn-off (ringing suppression) capabilities for multiple power switches in MLC. Moreover, it ensures that this soft turn-off feature is consistently effective across all duty-cycle (D) ratios of the MLC without any constraint. This work also presents two approaches for realizing the FVS-based snubber: dissipative and energy-regenerative methods. In this article, a prototype of a 7-kW three-level flying-capacitor buck (TLFCB) converter with a 537 VDC input is developed. This prototype successfully demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed snubber across D ranging from 0.2 to 0.8.</description></item><item><title>Design of a High-Voltage Low-Ripple Converter With High-Frequency Dickson Multipliers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10595839</link><description>High-voltage, low-ripple dc-dc converters are essential in various industrial and scientific applications.

To address this problem, an adaptive current-limiting control (ACLC) method, which is based on the bridge arm current, has been proposed. A dynamic ACLC model, aiming to suppress the fault current, has been constructed by introducing of a bypass ratio that reduces the dc voltage. This model incorporates the bridge arm current as a critical variable, giving a linearized current limit suppression curve for adaptive bypass ratio output. Additionally, the ac/dc coupling mechanism within the converter has been thoroughly analyzed. The influence of the ACLC on the ac side current has been examined, providing a theoretical basis for the upper limit of the bypass ratio constraint in both strong and weak ac systems. A half-bridge high-voltage direct current transmission technology based on the modular multilevel converter (HB-MMC-HVDC) network model was built in the real-time digital simulator to test the proposed ACLC method.

The proposed converter comprises an interleaved current-fed bridge and a voltage quadrupler rectifier with a bidirectional switch on the primary and secondary sides of the transformer, respectively, for achieving high-voltage gain and zero input current ripple. Furthermore, it can achieve an additional increase in voltage gain by adjusting the duty cycle of the bidirectional switch, even with a fixed duty cycle of 0.5, which simultaneously ensures ripple-free input current. So, these structural advantages allow the converter to achieve a much higher voltage gain with the least transformer turns-ratio value than existing step-up converters. The voltage quadrupler also makes the output component's voltage stress half the output voltage. In addition, the resonant operation enables all the switches and diodes to fully attain soft switching over the operating voltage range.

However, the HDLLER is a nonlinear system and has strong coupling between the joints and parameter ingestion problems, which will affect its trajectory tracking performance. This article focuses on an effective decoupling control algorithm. First, the strongly coupled nonlinear system of the HDLLER is converted from the strict-feedback form into a canonical form through feedback linearization, which can avoid the differential explosion problem of the backstepping method. To reconstruct the state variables and nonlinear term of the transformed system, the extended state observer (ESO) which is a foremost component of active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is adopted. Then, the backstepping controller based on ESO is designed and its stability is proved by Lyapunov's theorem. Finally, contrast experiments are implemented to confirm the correctness of the proposed algorithm, which indicates the presented approach can better suppress the coupling to improve tracking performance.</description></item><item><title>Investigation and Comparative Study of Double-Sided Yokeless Asymmetric Flux Reversal Permanent Magnet Linear Machine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10591787</link><description>This article proposes two types of double-sided yokeless asymmetric flux reversal permanent magnet linear machines (DYAFR-PMLM) for long-distance application.

These algorithms must ensure proper synchronization even in the case of disturbances such as voltage-sags and phase-jumps, which are common in high-voltage and low-voltage ride-through applications. Therefore, the development of robust synchronization algorithms in these situations is of interest. In this article, a nonlinear synchronization algorithm suitable for application in grid-following inverters operating under fault ride-through conditions is proposed. This algorithm is called multilevel limit cycle oscillator frequency-locked loop (MLCO-FLL), and it is used as a prefilter for a synchronous reference frame phase-locked loop (SRF-PLL). This algorithm is robust against phase-jumps and variations in the voltage, both representing important features for fault ride-through applications. Also, it automatically detects the operation at different voltage levels without state machines or logic conditions. These features might be of interest in other research fields, where the detection of orbits is important. A comparison with other linear and nonlinear synchronization algorithms showed that MLCO-FLL features important advances. Moreover, in future, it is possible to improve its performance once its characteristics and parameters are examined in detail. Simulations and experimental results obtained from a 15 kW inverter connected to a grid-emulator were used to validate the MLCO-FLL.</description></item><item><title>Three-Switching Surface Nonsingular Terminal Sliding Mode Control for Two-Phase Buck Converters with Load Variations and Uncertain System Parameters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10583941</link><description>To enhance the robustness of two-phase buck converter under load variations and uncertain system parameters, a novel voltage regulation strategy is proposed. The voltage regulation strategy consists of a three-switching surface nonsingular terminal sliding mode controller (TSSNTSMC) to regulate the output voltage and a current controller to equalize the inductor currents. Regarding the TSSNTSMC, the phase plot is divided into four regions by three switching surfaces. Depending on the region in which the sliding variable is located, the TSSNTSMC can directly determine the quantity of high-side switches to be turned on. This approach is beneficial in reducing the internal disturbances. The convergence of the designed controllers is analyzed by the Lyapunov theory. The TSSNTSMC is not affected by the current controller in terms of convergence. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed strategy provides favorable response and disturbance rejection performance under load variations and uncertain system parameters.</description></item><item><title>Event-Triggered Secure Consensus Control for DC Microgrids Under DoS Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10586771</link><description>Distributed control strategy has been widely applied in dc microgrids for better performance, but it is susceptible to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, which can render it ineffective and impact system stability. To this end, this article has proposed a secure consensus control for dc microgrids under DoS attacks, which guarantees bus voltage regulation, current sharing for multiple distributed generation units, and the state of charge balance for multiple distributed energy storage units. Besides, a Zeno-free event-triggered aperiodic communication strategy is proposed to relieve the communication burden of the controller. Based on the Lyapunov method, the stability of the whole closed-loop system is rigorously analyzed and a simplified guideline is provided for control parameters selection and tolerable DoS attack evaluation. Finally, a dc microgrid system is built in a hardware-in-the-loop testbed to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed event-triggered secure consensus controller.</description></item><item><title>A Decentralized-Distributed Control Framework for Configurable Networked Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10595843</link><description>Networked microgrids (NMGs) have emerged to tackle the intricate challenge posed by today's increasing power demands. However, the configuration of NMGs is subject to change due to revamping, faults, or privacy issues within each microgrid (MG), and existing control mechanisms cannot realize configurable control with a privacy guarantee. To address this control problem, we offer a fresh perspective on the control framework by proposing a configurable decentralized-distributed control strategy using directed graphs with minimal communication and less privacy disclosure risk. Specifically, one distributed generator (DG) in each MG is designated as the leader to ensure complete privacy protection in a decentralized manner, eliminating the need to exchange information among other NMGs. Follower DGs communicate exclusively with their leader DGs within clusters, enhancing the control performance. Furthermore, by introducing a novel leaky integral control law, the proposed configurable control framework can adapt to different NMG configurations without redesigning controllers. The stability of the entire NMG system is analyzed rigorously. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control framework is demonstrated in solving secondary frequency restoration and active power-sharing problems of NMGs. The experimental test system is built on the OPAL-RT system, and the results show the superiority of our proposed control method under decentralized, distributed, and hybrid NMG configurations.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Short-Term Wind Power Forecasting Based on the Strategy of &#8220;Dynamic Matching and Online Modeling&#8221;</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10620613</link><description>Ultra-short-term wind power forecasting plays a vital role in real-time scheduling, frequency regulation, and intraday market transactions. Due to the complexity of weather systems, unit aging, wind farm control strategies, etc., the temporal dependency relationship in wind power series changes from time to time (known as concept drift), which leads to the low forecasting accuracy of the commonly used offline modeling methods. Online modeling can effectively deal with concept drift by utilizing the latest information in the flow data and capturing the latest concepts during the modeling process. However, the existing online modeling methods cannot meet the timeliness requirements of the power grid for ultra-short-term wind power forecasting. Therefore, a strategy of &#8220;dynamic matching and online modeling&#8221; for ultra-short-term wind power forecasting is proposed in this paper. Training samples are dynamically selected according to the characteristic similarity of amplitude and fluctuation, aiming to improve the representativeness of samples and reduce the training time simultaneously. In addition to historical power, Numerical Weather Prediction wind speed is also introduced in the process of &#8220;dynamic matching&#8221; to improve the forecasting accuracy. Operation data from three wind farms in China is used to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. The results show that the forecasting accuracy can be improved by 1.18%&#8211;4.32% for 4 hours in advance.</description></item><item><title>Resilience-Oriented Two-Stage Restoration Considering Coordinated Maintenance and Reconfiguration in Integrated Power Distribution and Heating Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10620409</link><description>The inherent linkage between a power distribution system (PDS) and a district heating system (DHS) necessitates coordinated load restoration after natural disasters. To guarantee optimal load restoration during a recovery process, a coordinated dispatch strategy of the maintenance crew for the PDS/DHS considering the optimal reconfiguration of their respective networks is proposed in this paper. The proposed solution focuses on the intricate mutual interaction of the DHS and PDS and coordinates the fault isolation and service restoration stages. The proposed optimization is modeled as a mixed-integer second-order cone problem (MISOCP), which contains numerous integer variables. To lessen the computational burden, a two-stage acceleration algorithm is proposed, which divides the solution procedure into two stages based on two types of integer variables: load status variables and variables associated with the maintenance path and network topology. Then, the acceleration principles are proposed to determine the load status variables. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed model are validated by extensive cases, which demonstrate the performance of the coordinated maintenance and reconfiguration in integrated energy systems for fault recovery.</description></item><item><title>A Comprehensive Control Strategy for F-SOP Considering Three-Phase Imbalance and Economic Operation in ISLDN</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638221</link><description>With the increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RES) and single-phase loads, three-phase imbalance and transformer lightly/heavily loaded operation issues has become more prominent in low-voltage distribution networks (LDN). However, existing research on interconnected systems of LDN (ISLDN) rarely addresses the comprehensive management of both three-phase imbalance and lightly/heavily loaded operation issues. To this end, a comprehensive control strategy for three-phase imbalance and lightly/heavily loaded operation in ISLDN based on a four-leg soft open point (F-SOP) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the comprehensive loss characteristics model of ISLDN including the F-SOP and the transformer are established, revealing that both imbalance and load rate can affect the equipment efficiency. Secondly, considering the objective of minimizing power loss, an optimization dispatch strategy with constraints of three-phase imbalance and the optimal economic operation area is proposed to obtain the dispatch power commands for the F-SOP. Furthermore, an improved peer-to-peer control for F-SOP is proposed to ensure the conduct of the optimization dispatch strategy and enhance stability performance of system. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed comprehensive control strategy are validated by the simulations and experiments. The results show that comprehensive control of lightly/heavily loaded operation and three-phase imbalance in the ISLDN can significantly reduce daily power loss by 62%, improving system operation reliability and economy.</description></item><item><title>Graph-Based Large Scale Probabilistic PV Power Forecasting Insensitive to Space-Time Missing Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643410</link><description>In recent years, power systems integrated with distributed energy resources (DERs) have been considered to mitigate climate change. However, this makes power systems even more uncertain and complex, so uncertainty-aware accurate forecasting needs to be considered for the massive penetration of renewable energy. To this end, we propose a scalable and missing-insensitive framework for probabilistic multi-site photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting, specifically focused on large-scale PV sites and space-time missing data. By leveraging the graph neural network (GNN), the proposed scalable graph learning mechanism with random coarse graph attention and probabilistic spatio-temporal learning performs efficiently for large-scale PV sites in terms of forecasting accuracy and model training complexity. At the same time, our framework adaptively imputes the missing PV data in the space and time domain, respectively. Ablation study results demonstrate that our framework is effective for extracting complex spatial-temporal features across large-scale PV sites. Under extensive experiments, our framework shows 7$-$10% and 6$-$25% improvement on average for over 1600 PV sites and three types of space-time missing data, which ensures accurate and stable forecasting.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Dispatch Strategy for a Multi-Microgrid Cooperative Alliance Using a Two-Stage Pricing Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10648707</link><description>To coordinate resources among multi-level stakeholders and enhance the integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into multi-microgrids, this study proposes an optimal dispatch strategy within a multi-microgrid cooperative alliance using a nuanced two-stage pricing mechanism. Initially, the strategy assesses electric energy interactions between microgrids and distribution networks to establish a foundation for collaborative scheduling. The two-stage pricing mechanism initiates with a leader-follower game, wherein the microgrid operator acts as the leader and users as followers. Subsequently, it adjusts EV tariffs based on the game's equilibrium, taking into account factors such as battery degradation and travel needs to optimize EVs' electricity consumption. Furthermore, a bi-level optimization model refines power interactions and pricing strategies across the network, significantly enhancing demand response capabilities and economic outcomes. Simulation results demonstrate that this strategy not only increases renewable energy consumption but also reduces energy costs, thereby improving the overall efficiency and sustainability of the system.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Optimization Operation of Improved Power-to-Hydrogen-and-Heat Method at Low Temperature for Reducing Carbon Emissions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654708</link><description>The power-to-hydrogen-and-heat (P2HH) method is a potential means of improving energy efficiency while reducing carbon emissions. However, existing P2HH methods are ineffective at low temperatures, and do not consider physical constraints on heat exchange between the electrolyzer and heating network. Hence, this paper proposes an improved P2HH (IP2HH) method to overcome these shortcomings. First, this paper proposes a novel collaborative mechanism between the electrolyzer and the heating network. In this system, the electrolyzer can not only transfer excess heat to the heating network when at high temperatures, but can also be heated by the heating network when at low temperatures. Second, this paper takes the physical limitations of heat exchange between electrolyzer and heating network into consideration, and models the regulating valve of heat exchanger. These considerations allow produce simulation results that better approximate real-world scenarios. Finally, a convex model integrated with the IP2HH approach is established. Compared with the existing P2HH method, the IP2HH method may allow electrolyzer to work intermittently based on fluctuations in renewables supplies while maintaining high hydrogen production efficiency. Such improvements could reduce carbon emissions by 35.5%, costs by 10.7%, and renewables curtailment by 26.4% at ambient temperature of 1 $^{\circ }$C.</description></item><item><title>Scheduling Multiple Industrial Electrolyzers in Renewable P2H Systems: A Coordinated Active-Reactive Power Management Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654460</link><description>Utility-scale renewable power-to-hydrogen (ReP2H) systems typically consist of multiple electrolyzers (ELZs), many of which are powered by thyristor rectifiers (TRs). A TR-powered ELZ has a nonlinear and nondecouplable relation between its active and reactive loads. The on-off switching and load allocation across multiple ELZs impact the efficiency of P2H energy conversion and the active and reactive power flows in the electrical network. Improper scheduling may result in an excessive reactive load from the hydrogen plant, causing voltage violations and increased network losses, which compromise both safety and profitability. To address these issues, this paper first explores the tradeoffs between the energy efficiency and reactive loads of ELZs. Then, we propose a joint active-reactive power management method to coordinate the loads and thermal properties of the ELZs, renewables, energy storage, and var compensation to improve the overall productivity and profitability. Mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) is established to achieve these goals, and a decomposition algorithm enables its applicability in large-scale systems. Case studies show that the proposed method, at best, increases the hydrogen yield by 2.49% while reducing network losses by 3.12% compared to the state-of-the-art strategies based on wind and solar power data from Inner Mongolia, China. The optimal var resource configuration for ReP2H systems is also briefly discussed.</description></item><item><title>Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning for Real-Time Optimal Power Flow With Renewable Energy Resources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10660524</link><description>The serious uncertainties from the extensive integration of renewable energy generations put forward a higher real-time requirement for power system dispatching. To provide economic and feasible generation operations in real-time, a physics-informed reinforcement learning (PIRL) method based on constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) for optimal power flow (OPF) is presented in this paper. In the proposed method, a physics-informed actor based on the power flow equations is designed to generate generation operations that satisfy the equality constraints of OPF. To specify inequality constraints in actor optimization, the policy gradient is augmented with the constraints to correct unfeasible generation operations. In particular, the cost functions related to inequality constraints can be directly calculated based on the output of the actor, which is more accurate than using networks to approximate in general CRL methods. The proposed method is tested on the IEEE 118-bus system, and the simulation result shows that the proposed method achieves a significant improvement in computation speed compared with the traditional interior point method while obtaining a similar generation cost.</description></item><item><title>Exploiting the Flexibility of District Heating System for Distribution System Operation: Set-Based Characterization and Temporal Decomposition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10660566</link><description>The proliferation of distributed renewable resources increases the uncertainty in distribution systems. Coupling the distribution system and district heating system helps leverage the flexibility of thermal storage and thus supports the operation of the electrical grid. This paper proposes a method to characterize flexibility from district heating system via polyhedral sets. First, a recursive robust feasibility condition that ensures heat supply adequacy under uncertain demand is established. Then, stagewise robust feasible sets of thermal storage levels are calculated using a customized projection algorithm. Finally, dynamic bounds of electric heaters are computed by a further projection step. With those dynamic bounds, the electric heaters behave like reducible loads, and the demands in each period are decoupled over time, although the dispatch of thermal storage units must comply with inter-temporal constraints. The proposed method allows the two coupled systems to be operated in a distributed way without forecasts and extensive communications. Numerical simulations on small and practically sized testing systems validate the advantage of the proposed method. On average, the set calculation takes about 8 minutes for the day-ahead problem and 11 seconds for real-time dispatch on a portable laptop, and the prediction-free operation policy has an average optimality gap of 3.6% compared to the hindsight optimum.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Volt-VAR Coordinated Scheduling With Mobile Energy Storage System for Active Distribution Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10664000</link><description>In order to improve the voltage distribution and operation cost for ADN, A scheduling strategy is designed to integrate flexible resources, particularly mobile energy storage systems, within the coupling of ADN and TN, under an uncertain environment. A day-ahead Volt-VAR coordinated scheduling framework for ADN and TN can be proposed through incorporating a data-driven day-ahead scenario generation method based on denoising diffusion probabilistic model. First, the historical data may be employed to learn the error relationship between real power curves and predicted power curves for generating RES scenarios. The probability distribution for prediction error is constructed which can describe the day-ahead output power curve of RES. Subsequently, a SCCO approach is employed to measure voltage operating risk in uncertain environment, which can effectively utilize the controllability of different resource at timescale and spatial scale in ADN to fulfill the anticipated operational requirement. Finally, The ADN coupled with TN model can be linearized and converted into the mixed-integer linear programming method. Numerical simulations based on the IEEE 33-bus distribution system coupled with 15-node transportation network may verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Photovoltaic-Grid Integrated System for the Residential Power Management</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10663696</link><description>This paper proposes a photovoltaic (PV)-Utility integrated system with inductive power transfer (IPT) for electric vehicle (EV) charging applications in residential management applications. To realize this objective, a buck boost-interleaved H-bridge (BBIHB) configuration is proposed to integrate the PV source with the DC link of the front end converter (FEC) while achieving maximum power from the PV and power delivery to the IPT simultaneously. The DC bus of the IPT in the proposed system is obtained through the additive connection of the PV and FEC DC-link, which results in inherent boost of the DC bus voltage for the IPT system thus enhances the transmission power for the EV charging. Furthermore, the FEC allows bidirectional power flow between the utility and BBIHB converter by sharing the deficient or excess power in the system based on PV power availability. The complete modeling of the system and a control algorithm to achieve the above mentioned objectives is presented in this paper. Other features of the proposed system include inherent voltage boosting, a simple control strategy, and the absence of a separate converter for the PV to extract maximum power. Finally, an experimental hardware setup is developed in the laboratory and tested up to 4 kW of output power to validate the proposed system's performance, achieving a maximum DC-to-DC efficiency of 94% at this condition.</description></item><item><title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Dynamic Droop Control Strategy for Real-Time Optimal Operation and Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10664502</link><description>The optimal operation of an islanded AC microgrid system is achieved by proper power sharing among generators. The conventional distributed cost optimization strategies use a communication system to converge incremental costs. However, these methods are dependent on the distributed communication network and do not consider frequency deviations for real-time load variability. Thus, this paper proposes a DRL-based dynamic droop control strategy. The proposed twin delayed DDPG-based DRL interacts with the environment to learn the optimal droop gain for reducing generation cost and frequency deviation. The trained agent uses local information to transmit dynamic droop gains to the primary controller as demand load changes. It can simplify the control structure by omitting the secondary layer for optimal operation and power quality. The proposed control strategy is designed with a centralized DRL training process and distributed execution, enabling real-time distributed optimal operation. The comparison results with conventional distributed strategy confirms better control performance of the proposed strategy. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed strategy was verified by experiment on AC microgrid testbed.</description></item><item><title>Cross-Timescale Interaction Analysis Between Current Control and Rotor Speed Control Timescale Dynamics in a High-Proportion DFIG-WT System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10665985</link><description>Power electronics (PE) equipment contains multiple timescale energy storage components and control loops. As a result, the dynamic process presents multiple timescale characteristics in PE-dominated power systems. For simplicity, single timescale dynamics are often the focus of corresponding analysis, and the influence of different timescales (i.e., cross-timescale analysis) is rarely considered. However, there is an interaction effect between multiple timescale controls and energy storage components, which complicates system dynamics. In this study, the cross-timescale impact of current control on the dynamics of rotor speed control timescale are evaluated. First, based on a two-machine two-area system comprising a phase-locked loop (PLL)-synchronized doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbine (WT), the influence of the PLL on cross-timescale interactions is revealed via modal analysis. Then, a current control equivalent circuit is derived for analyzing its cross-timescale influence on rotor motion, and the LC resonance mechanism related to the current control is revealed. Moreover, the impact of the PLL on cross-timescale interactions is elucidated. Finally, the cross-timescale influence phenomena and mechanisms are verified via real-time digital simulations.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Short-Term Prediction of Wind Farm Cluster Power Based on Embedded Graph Structure Learning With Spatiotemporal Information Gain</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10669105</link><description>Ultra-short-term prediction of wind farm cluster power (UPWFCP) is of great significance for the development of intra-day power generation plan, and the power prediction accuracy is difficult to be further improved due to the chaotic effect of the weather system and the incompleteness of the information. In this regard, this paper proposes an embedded graph structure learning method for wind farm cluster (WFC) that incorporates spatiotemporal information gain (STIG) theory. The graph structure describing the spatiotemporal evolution relationship of information between wind farms (WFs) is constructed based on the spatiotemporal transfer relationship of power waveforms between WFs. An embedded graph attention network (EGAN) is proposed to learn STIG adjacency relationship among WFs, and a dynamic grouping scheme of redundant nodes in WFs based on STIG distance is constructed to reduce the modeling complexity. The proposed method is applied to the WFC of Inner Mongolia, China, and the results show that the NRMSE, NMAE, and MAPE of the proposed method are on average 2.63%, 2.09%, and 20.95% lower, and the R2 and Pr are on average 7.66% and 6.64% higher, respectively, compared with the rest of the comparison methods at all time scales.</description></item><item><title>Integrating Air-Source Heat Pumps into the Demand-Side Fast Frequency Response Service: A Study Based on Thermal Dynamic Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10669175</link><description>Fast frequency response services, designed to quickly balance the electrical grid within seconds, have a critical importance for managing sudden anomalies in low-inertia power systems. Battery systems often serve as versatile prosumers on the demand side to facilitate fast frequency response services. However, the nature of fast frequency response services leads to a highly fluctuating power profile for batteries, which can shorten their lifetime. In contrast, distributed air-source heat pumps in residential areas have a substantial untapped potential to support fast frequency response services. This paper seeks to integrate them into the existing services through a controller upgrade. We analyze the influence of air-source heat pumps' inherent complex thermal dynamics on fast frequency response services, revealing control challenges posed by unpredictable operating condition changes. Such a challenge is tackled with a standard droop control structure which is tuned through ${{H}_\infty }$ method, guaranteeing practical and stable operations within the permitted operating condition range. Finally, the proposed fast frequency response service scheme is tested through multiphysics simulations on a small-size low-inertia residential microgrid. The obtained results strongly supported the proposed new service.</description></item><item><title>Globally Optimal Distributed Operation of Integrated Electric and Heating Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10677480</link><description>Unit commitment (UC) is a key player in the coordinated operation of integrated energy systems. However, the participation of multiple market entities with widely different characteristics in large-scale energy systems has urged the critical need for the application of a distributed scheme to the UC problem. The NP-hard UC problem is a challenging mixed-integer programming problem. The presence of a large number of binary variables in the UC subproblems, which are solved by each participating entity after implementing the UC decomposition, fails to guarantee the convergence and the optimality of existing solution methods. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a distributed method, using logic-based Benders decomposition (LBBD), for the UC problem in a typical multi-entity system, i.e., integrated electric and heating system (IEHS). By searching the branch and bound tree of the district heating system (DHS) subproblem, the lower bound of its objective function is rigorously derived as a valid Benders cut to ensure the convergence to global optimal results. This distributed method is suitable for both deterministic and robust UC solutions. Numerical simulations are conducted on two test systems to demonstrate the performance of the proposed model and its distributed solution method.</description></item><item><title>Set-Valued Regression of Wind Power Curve</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10678875</link><description>Precise wind power curves are pivotal for monitoring the status of wind turbines and predicting wind power, which are important parts of utilizing wind energy in power systems. However, the data sets for training wind power curve models have a critical issue. A considerable proportion of the data sets is abnormal due to communication failure and other factors. Using the data sets with abnormal data will significantly deteriorate the fitting performance. This paper resolves the above issue by proposing a unified way to achieve abnormal data detection and curve fitting. Instead of regression with scalar output, set-valued regression of the wind power curve is considered, giving a set of wind power for a given wind speed. Interval neural network is adopted as the model for set-valued regression. A chance-constrained optimization problem is formulated to train an interval neural network. The obtained interval neural network can specify a subset with the normal data area, which can be used to give the threshold for abnormal data detection. Besides, the center points of the interval can be used as the fitted wind power curve. Since the formulated chance-constrained optimization problem is intractable, a sample-based sigmoidal approximation method is proposed to approximately solve it. The convergence and probabilistic feasibility of the approximation are given. Finally, experimental validations have been conducted to compare the proposed method with several existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Preserving Normal Power Curve Data With Sparse Density via Wind Speed-Power Correlation Trend Cleaning Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10678883</link><description>Stochastic wind conditions and curtailment lead to a sparse distribution of normal data compared to outliers on the Wind Power Curve (WPC). This results in the removal of sparse normal data during the data cleaning process, hampering short-term wind power assessment and forecasting. To address this issue, this paper proposes a decision boundary construction method that utilizes the wind speed-power correlation trend to retain normal WPC data. First, leveraging the positive correlation between wind speed and power, an incremental trend search strategy is used to obtain the trend curve. Building on this curve, a scatter motion trend algorithm is introduced to eliminate densely clustered curtailed power data. Finally, a kernel function-based 3-sigma boundary construction method is suggested to further reduce the influence of remaining clustered outliers on decision boundaries. The proposed method is compared to eight advanced algorithms using data from 17 wind turbines across three wind farms, demonstrating superior performance, especially in scenarios with sparse normal data.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Inertial Control for Wind Turbine Generators in Fast Frequency Response Based on the Power Reduction Period Assessment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10678806</link><description>Fast frequency response of wind turbine generators (WTGs) is achieved by injecting incremental power to the grid followed by power reductions to avoid over-deceleration and ensure secure rotor speed recovery. Second frequency deeps (SFDs) are the results of such power reductions that are challenging during abrupt frequency transients that may lead to under-frequency load shedding, or cascading events leading to blackouts. To address this issue, this paper presents an adaptive inertial control (AIC) scheme for WTGs designed to maximize the improvement in frequency nadir without causing SFD. The proposed method is developed through an assessment of power reduction period of WTGs during fast frequency response. This analysis investigates the impacts on the system frequency of a) injecting different shares of disturbance size (SoDSs) by WTGs and b) latency/delay in power injection. Derived from this analysis, the AIC is proposed to inject the maximum possible SoDS during the over-production period and successfully stabilize and recover the rotor speed during the assigned optimal power reduction period with SFDs disabled. This is achieved by adaptively adjusting the AIC in the reduction period based on the SoDS injected by WTGs during the over-production stage. Also, the AIC is modified to adapt against wind speed deviations. To evaluate the performance of the AIC, a comprehensive verification is carried out by comparing AIC with thirteen existing inertial control schemes and maximum power point tracking control in various cases using wind-integrated IEEE 39-bus system in Digsilent PowerFactory and real-time experimental tests. The results confirm the effectiveness of AIC in terms of achieving maximum improvement in frequency nadir without generating SFD.</description></item><item><title>Causal Mechanism-Enabled Zero-Label Learning for Power Generation Forecasting of Newly-Built PV Sites</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10679087</link><description>Power forecasting of newly built photovoltaic (PV) sites faces huge challenges owing to the lack of sufficient training samples. To this end, this paper proposes an unsupervised zero-label learning method for power generation forecasting of newly built PV sites without relying on any historical power output data. The main idea is to extract invariant causal structures across different PV sites and leverage this causality to enhance the power forecasting performance on the newly built ones. In particular, a causality-enabled domain adaptation network (CEDAN) is designed to capture the causal mechanism of PV generation from the multiple fine-grain segments of time-lagged data. It relaxes the causal relationships to an associative structure which is further concretized as attention score vectors through the designed intra- and inter-variable attention mechanisms. To quantify the distribution discrepancies between source and target domain causal structures, a specific domain adaptation loss function is designed for the optimization of CEDAN. It is further extended to a domain adaptation quantile loss to handle the uncertainties of PV power output. By jointly minimizing the domain adaptation loss and power forecasting error/conditional quantile loss, an invariant power generation causal mechanism across data domains for a newly built PV site can be learned. This allows the proposed method to achieve accurate and highly generalized power generation forecasting for newly built PV sites without relying on labeled data. Extensive experiments utilizing real PV generation data demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art transfer learning methods by 7.57% at least in deterministic forecasting and 8.37% at least in probabilistic forecasting.</description></item><item><title>Startup Control of Grid-Forming Offshore Wind Turbines Connected to the Diode-Rectifier-Based HVDC Link</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10680154</link><description>The Diode-Rectifier (DR) based HVDC has been considered as an economical solution to connect remote offshore wind turbines (WTs) to the onshore power grid. However, the DR is a passive device and cannot support the startup of the WTs. Therefore, it is worth finding an appropriate and cost-effective startup strategy for the DR-connected WTs. This paper investigates to use of wind energy to startup those WTs to avoid the need for additional grid support or the energy storage system, which can reduce the overall cost of such transmission system. The first challenge for this strategy is that the output active power of WTs can be extremely low during the startup process, which puts the WT rotor at a high risk of overspeed. Another challenge is to prevent power surges between synchronizing WTs. To address those issues, the pitch control has been innovated for the DR-connected WTs. In addition, a seamless synchronization control of the DR-connected WTs is proposed, which does not need the phase-locked-loop and can facilitate the whole startup process of the DR-connected WTs. The feasibility of these proposed control strategies for the startup of the DR-connected WTs is verified by comprehensive simulation studies.</description></item><item><title>Reliability-Based Planning of Cable Layout for Offshore Wind Farm Electrical Collector System Considering Post-Fault Network Reconfiguration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10681539</link><description>The electrical collector system (ECS) plays a crucial role in determining the performance of offshore wind farms (OWFs). Existing research has predominantly restricted ECS cable layouts to conventional radial or ring structures and employed graph theory heuristics for solutions. However, both economic efficiency and reliability of the OWFs heavily depend on their ECS structure, and the optimal ECS cable layout often deviates from typical configurations. In this context, this paper introduces a novel reliability-based ECS cable layout planning method for large-scale OWFs, employing a two-stage stochastic programming approach to address uncertainties of wind power and contingencies. To enhance reliability, the model incorporates optimal post-fault network reconfiguration strategies by adjusting wind turbine power supply paths through link cables. To tackle computation challenges arising from numerous contingency scenarios, a customized progressive contingency incorporation (CPCI) framework is developed to solve the model with higher efficiency by iteratively identifying non-trivial scenarios and solving the simplified problems. The convergence and optimality are theoretically proven. Numerical tests on several real-world OWFs validate the necessity of fully optimizing ECS structures and demonstrate the efficiency of the CPCI algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Transient Interaction Mechanism Analysis and Stability Control of Multi-Paralleled DFIG-Based WTs During Asymmetrical Grid Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10681307</link><description>In this article, from the perspective of DC-link voltage (DCV) control, the transient interaction mechanism of multi-paralleled doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbines (WTs) is investigated during asymmetrical grid faults. Firstly, considering the coupling characteristics of positive and negative sequence (PNS) components and the interaction characteristics between the rotor side converter (RSC) and grid side converter (GSC), a large-signal nonlinear model of multiple-parallel DFIG-based WTs in DC-link voltage control time-scale is obtained. Furthermore, by using the energy function method, the dynamic interaction mechanism of multiple-parallel DFIG-based WTs is analyzed. The influence of different parameters on the transient characteristics of DC-link voltage is analyzed by using phase trajectory diagram. The dominant factors affecting the transient stability of the WTs and stability level of DC-link voltage are obtained. In addition, considering the interaction among WTs, the dynamic interaction between RSC and GSC, as well as the requirement of grid codes, a transient stability optimization strategy during asymmetrical grid faults is proposed to improve the transient stability level of the DC-link voltage and the transient stability of multiple-parallel DFIG-based WTs. Finally, simulation and experimental results validate the correctness of theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Reactive Power Optimization for Flexible Distribution Networks With Successive Relaxation Iteration Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10682812</link><description>The flexible soft open point (SOP) connected to active distribution networks (ADNs) offers a promising manner of improving voltage and VAR control (VVC) by providing flexible power regulation. Due to the expansion of interconnective networks, the centralized optimization method has recently faced various challenges. This paper thus proposes a novel distributed coordinated reactive power optimization strategy for SOP-based multiregional ADNs based on local model decoupling and iterative interactions. By applying the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), the centralized VVC optimization problem is divided into several subproblems, allowing each area to optimize its local subproblem in a fully distributed manner. Multiple resources are thereby coordinated by the VVC, including both discrete and continuous devices. To ensure computability of both integer and non-convex problems, the relaxation iteration and successive linear approximation methods are nested to the ADMM framework, within this approach to allow ready solution to the distributed VVC optimization problem to be generated using a relaxation iterative algorithm, which significantly improves algorithm convergence and computational efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in this work using a modified IEEE standard interconnection system.</description></item><item><title>Fast Power Regulation Method During System Restoration for D-PMSG-Based Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10685139</link><description>The speed of the pitch action is one of the primary constraints that limit the power ramp rate of wind turbines (WTs). By storing kinetic energy (KE) within the wind wheel, blades, and generator rotor, the output power of the WT can be regulated more rapidly with less pitch action. This capability is beneficial in specific situations where additional power injection is required by the external system, such as during the system restoration process after a blackout. In this paper, a novel fast power regulation method for direct-drive PMSG-based (D-PMSG-based) WTs is proposed. This method allows for the early completion of the most time-consuming pitch reduction process and ensures that KE can be stored within the WT before the external system becomes available. As a result, the WT will be able to achieve maximum power output before the system restoration is fully completed. The potential operation boundary and the maximum external power support capability of D-PMSG-based WTs are analyzed. By following the operation boundary, converter modulation problem caused by high KE reserve can be avoided. The proposed fast power regulation method can significantly reduce the power increase speed and maximize the output power capability of D-PMSG-base WTs.</description></item><item><title>Research on PV Hosting Capacity of Distribution Networks Based on Data-Driven and Nonlinear Sensitivity Functions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693542</link><description>Voltage calculations are critical for assessing photovoltaic hosting capacity; however, acquiring precise parameters and the topology of the medium voltage distribution networks poses a significant challenge, thereby rendering traditional power flow computational methods ineffective. To address this issue, this paper introduces a hybrid method that utilizes a data-driven approach in conjunction with nonlinear functions to determine node voltages. Firstly, a deep neural network model for distribution network's power flow and voltage-power sensitivity analysis is established using historical data. This model captures the data-driven error, which reduces time consumption and increases accuracy. Secondly, a fourth-order Taylor expansion of power to voltage is derived based on the power flow mathematical equation to extrapolate voltage. This is necessary because when photovoltaic generators are connected to the nodes, the load data often exceeds the historical data range, rendering neural networks inapplicable. Finally, the sparrow search algorithm is employed to determine the hosting capacity. The proposed methods are validated using IEEE 33 and IEEE 69 case systems, demonstrating that the data-driven approach, combined with nonlinear functions, can ensure the accuracy in obtaining node voltage and the hosting capacity.</description></item><item><title>Analytical Evaluation to Power System Oscillation Damping Capability of DFIG-POD Based on Path Damping Torque Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693531</link><description>The increasing wind power decreases power system damping and may intensify low-frequency oscillation (LFO). The LFO are usually damped by the power system stabilizer (PSS) at synchronous generator (SG), and now by the power oscillation damper (POD) at doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG). The existing damping torque analysis (DTA) sets the parameters of the PSS and evaluates its damping capability, but can not be applied to the POD due to the difficulty of finding the damping path related to the DFIG and the coupling between the POD and the DFIG, which are studied in this paper. At first, the analytical expression of the coupling between the POD and DFIG is newly derived with linear fractional transformation (LFT) technique. Then the path damping torque analysis (PDTA) is proposed to reconstruct the damping path of the POD. Thirdly, the damping indicator based on the return difference matrix is proposed to evaluate the contribution of damping path to the LFO. Finally, numerical results of test system are given to validate effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed model, and parameter optimization to the multi-input POD (MIPOD) is performed to show the application value of the proposed model.</description></item><item><title>Spatiotemporal Adversarial Domain Generalization for Locating Subsynchronous Oscillation Sources Under Unseen Conditions in Large-Scale Renewable Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693450</link><description>Subsynchronous oscillations (SSOs) in renewable power systems have emerged as a major challenge, jeopardizing the stability and safety of power system operations. Thus, it is essential to accurately and timely locate SSO sources. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods for locating SSO sources have become increasingly popular, existing AI-based methods usually fail in practical applications due to unavailable or insufficient real-world SSO data for model training, and significant distribution gaps in samples under different operational conditions. They also fail to fully utilize the temporal characteristics of oscillations and the spatial topology of the system. Moreover, these methods only focus on locating either negative-damping-SSO or forced-SSO sources. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel strategy termed Spatiotemporal-Adversarial-Domain-Generalization (STADG) to locate oscillation sources in both SSO scenarios of real power systems. This method allows the model to train on multi-source domains (simplified-simulation power systems) with sufficient labeled samples, and to be directly applied to an unseen test target domain (real power system) under unknow operating conditions. The proposed approach employs a graph-attention network and a long-short-term-memory network to fully leverage spatial and temporal features of SSOs. Extensive experiments on the modified IEEE-39 and WECC-179 bus systems confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Two-Level Distributed Consensus Control of Multiple Wind Farms for Fast Frequency Support</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10694712</link><description>The neighboring wind farms have great frequency support potential. The wind turbine generators (WTGs) in these wind farms are influenced by wake effects and have different frequency support capabilities. In order to fully utilize the WTGs' support capabilities under different operating states, this paper proposes a two-level distributed consensus (TLDC) control to cooperate all the WTGs. Level I is leader-follower control, which is equipped within the wind farms. Level II is leaderless control which is used among the wind farms. This method is able to assign different values of power commands to different WTGs in the system to achieve better frequency support effect and stability. Based on MATLAB/Simulink and Opal-RT real-time simulation platforms, the two-area power system and Guangshui system (100% renewable energy power system) are analyzed, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed TLDC method has a better effect compared with other frequency support methods. It can also flexibly respond to communication interruptions and delays.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Stage Integrated Transmission and Distribution Expansion Planning Under Uncertainties With Smart Investment Options</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10694803</link><description>The shift towards a decentralized paradigm in power systems in response to decarbonization and deregulation efforts necessitates stronger coordination between transmission and distribution operators for cost-effective operation and planning. However, long-term uncertainties in the transition to net-zero are posing major challenges for decision-making. Moreover, literature has traditionally focused on the transmission and distribution expansion planning problems independently, as is customary in industry, leading to a lack of sophisticated integrated planning methods and inefficient expansion decisions in practice. This paper proposes a novel multi-stage stochastic programming framework for the integrated transmission and active distribution networks expansion planning under multi-dimensional uncertainties. Infrastructure investments are co-optimized with non-network alternatives with diverse techno-economic characteristics to support flexible planning. To manage the increased computational complexities, a machine learning-assisted multi-cut Benders decomposition approach is implemented. The case studies firstly highlight the strategic and economic advantages of the proposed multi-stage formulation, and then demonstrate the significant role and value of smart investment options in managing uncertainty. Lastly, the application of the proposed model on a study involving a 229-bus test system and 18 long-term scenarios validates its scalability and practical applicability.</description></item><item><title>Interaction Modeling and Stability Analysis of Grid-Forming Energy Storage System Based on SISO Transfer Functions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10700987</link><description>With the rapid expansion of photovoltaic (PV), grid-forming energy storage systems (GFM-ESS) have been widely employed for inertia response and voltage support to enhance the dynamic characteristics. Converters with different synchronization methods represent significant differences in dynamic behavior. The interactions between grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) devices with multi-time scale control may lead to small-signal instability in hybrid systems. This paper investigates a grid-connected system comprising a grid-forming energy storage system and a grid-following PV system (GFL-PV). Based on single-input-single-output (SISO) transfer functions, a dynamic interaction model for the PV-ESS system is established. Combining the open-loop transfer functions of full-loop and sub-loop, the proposed model reveals how GFM-ESS modifies the dynamic characteristics of GFL-PV under weak grid conditions. Subsequently, the impact of different control loops and parameters on the small-signal stability of the system is analyzed. The stability margins of both devices are also compared through the SISO model. Electromagnetic transient simulation results in MATLAB/Simulink and experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed models and analyses.</description></item><item><title>Impedance Characteristic Analysis and Phase-Locked Angle Feedforward-Based Stability Improvement for LCC-HVDC in Sending AC Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10704965</link><description>With the increasing penetration of wind power, the line-commutated converter-based high-voltage direct-current (LCC-HVDC) system in sending AC grid faces a potential risk of sub/super-synchronous oscillations (SSSOs), which threatens the stability of the power system. The impedance-based method is an effective way to analyze and suppress the SSSOs. However, since the effects of each control part in LCC-HVDC on the stability of sending AC grid are not yet well-investigated, there is a lack of theoretical guidance for implementing the impedance reshaping strategy for LCC-HVDC. Therefore, this paper establishes and analyzes the modular impedance model of LCC-HVDC, to elucidate the contribution of each control part and the interaction between different control loops. On this basis, an impedance reshaping strategy based on phase-locked angle feedforward (PAF) is proposed to improve system stability by attenuating the interaction. Compared to the existing virtual impedance-based method, the proposed PAF-based method addresses its possible failure in suppressing the SSSOs of sending AC grid. The theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the aforementioned conclusions and the effectiveness of the proposed impedance reshaping strategy.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Operation Flexibility in Modular Power to Hydrogen Based Ammonia Industries</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10706701</link><description>Modularization of Hydrogen Electrolyzers (HEs) is projected to be immediate, resilient, and efficient for load management in large-scale Hydrogen Consuming Industries (HCIs). It offers a scalable and flexible solution that can adapt to changes in hydrogen and power system demands. However, Modular HEs are studied primarily as small-scale wind hydrogen systems only, converting excess Renewable Energy (RE) into hydrogen without the integration of rigid downstream operations. Downstream constraints in HCIs, like rigid hydrogen demands, device operational/ramping limits, and storage constraints, can limit or regulate modular HE's use for power system services. Furthermore, oversimplified HE operational modeling within HCIs leads to suboptimal outcomes for integrated modular HCI and RE-rich power system (RPS) operations, resulting in RE curtailments and inaccurate flexibility estimations. This happens due to improper loading rates arising from unrealistic inter and intra-modular HE operations. This work proposes a comprehensive model for modular HE management in integrated ammonia (HCI) and power systems for flexibility in sector-coupled scenarios. The work considers and demonstrates how downstream constraints regulate HEs flexibility through a unit commitment problem framework. HE operations with detailed and extended electrochemical dynamics are considered to improve and enhance operational flexibility calculations of growing RPS-based modular HCIs. This allows for better sectoral integration and estimation of power system services.</description></item><item><title>An Overvoltage-Averse Model for Renewable-Rich AC/DC Distribution Networks Considering the Sensitivity of Voltage Violation Probability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10709908</link><description>The increasing renewable generation increase the probability of voltage violation. The spatial and temporal power transfer can be achieved in AC/DC distribution networks based on voltage source converters (VSCs) and energy storage (ES), which can effectively avoid system voltage violation. However, the existing voltage violation mitigation methods in uncertain scenarios are either limited by the long solution time or complex modeling, which are difficult to meet the overvoltage probability reduction requirements of intra-day dispatch. In addition, the power transfer will simultaneously affect interconnected systems because the power is coupled through the VSCs. Overvoltage probability reduction on one line may lead to an increase on the other. This paper proposes a two-stage overvoltage-averse model considering the sensitivity of voltage violation probability. The proposed method analytically depicts the impact of power adjustment on the system overvoltage probability. The day-ahead optimization model is established as chance-constrained model. The intra-day optimization model is established as a quadratic convex model, which can be efficiently solved. Simulation results verify that the method proposed can effectively achieve the overvoltage probability reduction of renewable-rich AC/DC distribution networks.</description></item><item><title>A Mimicking-Avoiding Short-Term Probabilistic Power Forecasting Method for Wave Energies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10709879</link><description>Wave energy is essential for sustainable marine development. However, complex marine weather conditions cause fluctuating wave power outputs, resulting in a mimicking phenomenon in predictions. Moreover, the lack of accurate numerical weather prediction (NWP) data sources aggravates the prediction inaccuracy. To address these obstacles, a series characteristic perception (SCP) method coordinated with an advanced hybrid model, the quantile liberty loss gated recurrent unit kernel density estimation (QLB-GRU-KDE), is proposed for the floating point absorber wave energy system. In the first stage, the SCP method gains prior knowledge via ensemble approaches. In the second stage, a liberty loss function is used to mitigate the mimicking phenomenon. Furthermore, a hybrid model that integrates a GRU and KDE is adopted for the probabilistic forecasting of wave energy generation. In addition, a metric is proposed to evaluate the severity of the mimicking. A case study based on a real-world wave dataset is conducted, where both deterministic and probabilistic prediction approaches are examined. Comparisons with the cutting-edge counterparts reveal that the designed liberty loss effectively mitigates the mimicking issue. The comprehensive performance of the proposed model, including the accuracy, stability, reliability and sharpness in wave power prediction, is validated by multiple metrics.</description></item><item><title>Approximate Optimal Energy Management of Thermal-HESS System for MIMO Fuzzy Logic Controller Based AGC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10710156</link><description>Compared to one-type of energy storage device, hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) offer benefits for Auto generation control (AGC) command tracking and can reduce investment in energy storage. Traditional control method, although effective in meeting the matching of AGC commands at a specific moment, often lacks coordination across multiple time intervals, resulting in frequent and irregular charging/ discharging which reduces the overall lifetime. To address this, this paper presents an approximate optimal operation strategy for Thermal-HESS system, aiming to enhance the AGC performance of the generating unit and improve the energy management capability of the HESSs. Firstly, an auto-adjust Markov Chain prediction method is proposed to forecast the power demand of the AGC command tracking to determine power demand's tendency. Secondly, a stochastic model predictive control (SMPC)-based optimal model, which considers the current step and cost-to-go function, is proposed. However, the SMPC based model is multiple-step optimal operational problem, which will increase the computational burden of the controller. Therefore, this paper further designs a Multiple-Input-Multiple-output (MIMO) fuzzy logic controller to approximate the optimal alternative to the cost-to-go function of SMPC model, meeting the computational and application requirements more effectively. Finally, numerical case studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in AGC command tracking and HESSs energy management.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Resilience of Urban Electric-Road-Metro Interdependent Network Considering Electric Bus Scheduling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10711253</link><description>With the increasing electrification of urban transportation, urban power and traffic systems are highly coupled and influence each other, leading to a challenge for the post-event resilience enhancement of urban electric-traffic interdependent network (ETIN). In this context, we propose a multi-layer electric-metro-road interdependent network where the metro network (MN) depends on the distribution power network (DPN) and interacts with the road traffic network (RTN) synchronously. Electric buses (EBs), as one public dispatchable resource, are considered and explored to provide bridging routes for disabled MNs and supply power for failed DPNs, with consideration of three different service trips, i.e., the original trip, bridging trip, and charge-discharge trip. On this basis, a spatio-temporal network-based EB route schedule model is constructed. To consider the evacuation demand of affected MN routes, a fast DPN restoration strategy is proposed to minimize the time cost of lost load by integrating the network reconfiguration with the collaborative allocation of repair crews (RCs) and EBs. Finally, a distributed method is further devised for the coordination among different stakeholders. The proposed method is verified on two electric-traffic systems to show that the collaborative scheduling of RCs and EBs can effectively enhance the resilience of ETIN under metro service disruptions.</description></item><item><title>An Integrated Sparse Gated Graph Density Network Based on Transfer Learning for Multi-Site Probabilistic Forecasting of Renewable Energy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10714034</link><description>Large-scale new energy grid-connected poses significant challenges to the safe and efficient operation of smart grids. Renewable energy probabilistic forecasting (REPF) technology can analyze uncertainties in power generation, quantitatively balance risks, and prevent the breakdown of the grid. However, current REPF methods reliant on spatio-temporal maps fail to accurately estimate the probability density function (PDF) of renewable energy, resulting lacking comprehensive uncertainty analysis for distributed power generation systems (DPGS). To fill this gap, in this study, an integrated sparse gated graph density network (ISGGDN) that incorporates transfer learning to tackle the REPF challenge. A sparse gated graph dynamic convolutional network based on cross attention and residual connection is developed, which can effectively extract spatial features and spatio-temporal interactions between sites and improve the accuracy of probabilistic prediction. Furthermore, to effectively identify the types of features lost during the transfer process and to enhance the transfer learning (TL) capability, we developed an integrated approach involving multiple fine-tuning strategies based on TL. We evaluated the proposed model using wind and photovoltaic (PV) power generation data from two neighboring multi-sites, and the experimental results demonstrate that ISGGDN outperforms other existing solutions in terms of accuracy and effectiveness in REPF.</description></item><item><title>Aggregating Large-Scale Residential Users for Regulation Reserve Provision: Truthful Combinatorial Auction Based Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10715698</link><description>The proliferation of flexible loads has empowered residential users in contributing both upward and downward frequency regulation reserves to the power grid. Due to barriers like minimum bid size, residential users with relatively small power consumption must be aggregated before they can enter the reserve market. However, the large number of residential users renders the aggregation mechanism design problem a challenging task. In particular, the cost for reserve provision of each user is not only highly heterogeneous, but also coupled through both the temporal dimension and the up/down regulation direction. In order to allow the users to fully express their costs, in this paper, we propose a combinatorial reverse auction (CRA) framework as the market mechanism for user aggregation. In this auction, the aggregator is the auctioneer and procures reserves from residential users. The users submit package bids consisting of combinations of both upward and downward reserves over multiple time-slots, capturing the coupling in the user cost. Furthermore, to address the infamous computational challenges of large-scale combinatorial auctions, we develop a novel fast combinatorial auction (FCA) mechanism that can be solved in polynomial time. It includes an approximate winner determination algorithm and a critical payment scheme. Notably, our proposed mechanism is rigorously proved to possess desirable economic properties such as truthfulness and individual rationality. Extensive simulations have validated the theoretic properties of the proposed CRA mechanism and its advantages over existing methods. In particular, compared with the widely employed truthful Vickery-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, CRA can be $10^{4}$ times faster than VCG when the user number is above 1000. Meanwhile, it is able to achieve near-optimal social cost, where the average optimality loss is 2.92%.</description></item><item><title>Coordinated Planning for Stability Enhancement in High IBR-Penetrated Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10716464</link><description>Security and stability challenges in future power systems with high penetration Inverter-Based Resources (IBR) have been anticipated as one of the main barriers to decarbonization. Grid-following IBRs may become unstable under small disturbances in weak grids, while during transient processes, system stability and protection may be jeopardized due to the lack of sufficient Short-Circuit Current (SCC). To solve these challenges and achieve decarbonization, the future system has to be carefully planned. However, it remains unclear how both small-signal and transient stabilities can be considered during the system planning stage. In this context, this paper proposes a coordinated planning model of different resources in the transmission system, namely the synchronous condensers and GFM IBRs to enhance system stability. The system strength and SCC constraints are analytically derived by considering the different characteristics of synchronous units and IBRs, which are further effectively linearized through a novel data-driven approach, where an active sampling method is proposed to generate a representative data set. The significant economic value of the proposed coordinated planning framework in both system asset investment and system operation is demonstrated through detailed case studies.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Swing PLL Synchronization Transient Stability of Grid-Connected Paralleled Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10720168</link><description>During grid faults, the grid-connected paralleled converter systems is susceptible to a phase-locked loop (PLL) synchronization transient instability. Most existing studies focus on first-swing transient stability analysis using the equal-area criterion. However, achieving first-swing transient stability does not guarantee overall stability, as the system may still experience multi-swing transient instability. This paper analyzes the type of multi-swing transient instability issue from two aspects: transient instability mechanism and transient stability assessment. Firstly, the mechanism of multi-swing transient instability is revealed from the transient energy conversion point of view. Then, considering transient interactions between converters, the largest estimated domain of attraction (LEDA) is constructed utilizing the Takagi-Sugeno method. Using the LEDA, the multi-swing transient instability problem of the grid-connected paralleled converter systems is quantitatively analyzed. Finally, the theoretical results are verified based on the RT-LAB hardware-in-the-loop experimental platform.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Low-Frequency Oscillation Damping in Low-Voltage Islanded Multi-Bus Microgrids With Virtual Synchronous Generators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10566859</link><description>In the low-voltage islanded multi-bus microgrid (LVIMB-MG), the virtual synchronous generators&#8217; (VSGs&#8217;) inertia constant and damping coefficient play an important role in low-frequency oscillations (LFOs). However, existing LFO analyses lack the consideration of microgrids&#8217; required rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) and steady-state active power-frequency (P-f) characteristics when designing the VSG&#8217;s inertia and damping. With these practical considerations, this paper reveals that the interactions between VSGs can cause significant LFOs, posing a threat to the microgrid&#8217;s stability. In contrast, the LFOs related to the interactions between SGs are less pronounced. To this end, a distributed LFO damping (DLFOD) control is proposed to suppress the LFOs between VSGs from two aspects: the adjustment of the VSG&#8217;s phase angle mitigates the uneven instantaneous active power sharing, while the adjustment of the VSG&#8217;s active power setpoint enhances the mutual damping. Compared with existing methods, the proposed DLFOD control 1) pertains to multi-bus microgrids, 2) guarantees the RoCoF and steady-state P-f characteristics, and 3) possesses a linear structure. Furthermore, a dynamic switching variable is devised to handle the disconnection and reconnection of communication links or VSGs, which enables the DLFOD control to remain partially functional during these interruptions. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated through theoretical analysis, real-time simulations, and experiments.</description></item><item><title>Parameter Boundary Characterization for DC Microgrid Islanding Detection Based on Time-Domain Voltage Oscillation Trajectory Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10571933</link><description>Unintentional islanding events cause potential threats to the safety of dc microgrids. Selected frequency islanding detection is considered a promising technology thanks to its good power quality and high detection accuracy. However, the conventional frequency-domain-based islanding detection parameter boundary cannot consider the impact of detection time, which causes a quite slow detection speed and thus leads to detection failure. To overcome this obstacle, a linear model of the islanding dc system is developed first to analyze the steady-state response of the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC). On top of that, the components of the islanding system characteristic equation are analyzed based on modal analysis, which lays a good foundation for simplifying the time-domain response model of the PCC voltage. Then, the oscillation trajectory of the PCC voltage triggered by the islanding event is characterized in the time domain, which facilitates the analysis and calculation of islanding detection time. Furthermore, the boundary of the islanding detection parameters considering the detection time effect is accurately depicted to guide the resonator design. In this manner, the effect of resonant parameters on the detection time can be evaluated visually while the fast detection speed is also ensured. Finally, the proposed method is validated in simulations and hardware-in-loop experiments.</description></item><item><title>Research on Generic Diagnostic Methods for Short-Circuit Faults in AC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10580987</link><description>Micro grid fault of rapid detection and removal is the key to ensure its reliability. With the access of many distributed generations (DG) to the system, the characteristics of short-circuit faults of microgrids in grid-connected and islanded modes have changed, and the traditional protection methods can no longer be applied to both operating modes of microgrids simultaneously. Due to the advantages of wavelet energy spectrum in the identification of the mutation characteristics of the weak signal as well as that of neural network in the location accuracy, this paper proposes a short circuit fault detection and protection method in AC microgrids. The method takes the current at the detection point as the object of analysis, uses the wavelet energy spectrum transform to analyze the current waveforms under normal and fault operation states, and extracts the fault characteristic quantities. At the same time, considering the effect of transition resistance, a generalized fault area identification model for both grid-connected and islanded modes is established by using a neural network algorithm. Simulation and experimental results show that this method can realize accurate judgment and area location of short-circuit faults in different modes, different DG capacities, different fault types and different fault regions.</description></item><item><title>A Comprehensive Review of High-Frequency AC Microgrids for Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10586271</link><description>Continuous advancements in distributed generation, energy storage, electric vehicles, and industrial modernization have forced the electrical distribution system to operate efficiently and controllably. To address these challenges, in addition to ensuring efficient bidirectional power flow while minimizing power losses, a comprehensive grid restructuring is crucial. The deployment of a high-frequency AC (HFAC) microgrid has emerged as a feasible solution, offering the potential to establish a reliable and efficient energy supply that aligns with the demands of the current distribution landscape. This necessitates thorough planning and operational assessments. However, parallel operations of the current HFAC involve multiple power conversion stages. This review outlines insights, challenges, opportunities, and recommendations for future HFAC research directions. The practical feasibility of the HFAC microgrid is tested on a typical IEEE-33 bus system in MATLAB/Simulink by incorporating AC-AC converters and their switching modulation techniques. The promising simulation results and existing research demonstrate that the HFAC microgrid architecture works well, illustrates the need and benefits in the context of the distribution system compared with the existing traditional system, and has possibilities for further extension with multiple case studies. This review can serve as a substantial foundation for researchers in HFAC microgrids to pave the way for promoting energy efficiency to unprecedented heights.</description></item><item><title>A Global Optimal Benchmark for Energy Management of Microgrid (GoBuG) Integrating Hybrid Energy Storage System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10614145</link><description>This paper proposes a general benchmark for evaluating online/real-time energy management strategies (EMS) for microgrids (uG) supported by hybrid energy storage systems (HESS). A multi-objective optimal control problem with multiple control/state variables, multiple control/state constraints, and multiple boundary conditions is introduced to reduce power losses, prevent the HESS from oscillations, and increase source lifespan, which is handled by using an alternative Pontryagin&#8217;s minimum principle and inheriting finite difference methods. On that foundation, the multi-objective Global optimal Benchmark for uG (referred to as GoBuG) is constructed and assessed via several numerical scenarios, including a real case study of a uG located in B&#7841;ch Long V&#297; island, Vi&#7879;t Nam. The assessment shows that GoBuG is tens of times faster than conventional methods like dynamic programming when computing EMS in the islanded uG with a single battery ESS. Moreover, for uG consisting of HESSs, while dynamic programming is unable to provide solutions, GoBuG remains superior with high accuracy, reliability, and speedy computation. With its superior performance, the proposed GoBuG is therefore compatible with benchmarking purposes for general uG systems.</description></item><item><title>An Improved Probe Power Unit (PPU)-Based Fault Location Estimation in Low-Voltage DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10553240</link><description>Good accuracy in estimating the exact fault location in low-voltage DC microgrids (LVDC MGs) reduces the time for fault restoration, power outage and maintenance. Off-line active fault location determination in low-voltage DC microgrid has an advantage of using sufficient information for analysis and reliable decision making. This paper proposes a parametric estimation-based fault location using a more accurate computation of the natural oscillating frequency. The proposed algorithm considers the advantage of both time as well as frequency domain analysis. Peak fittings of the probe current in time domain and exact resonating frequency in the Fourier magnitude spectrum, are used to find out the accurate natural oscillating frequency of the fault path. The proposed fault location technique is tested for various fault conditions of the LVDC network on MATLAB/Simulink environment and provides improved performance even in presence of noise in the measured probe current.

This paper proposes an adaptive voltage control method to coordinate multiple PV inverters as a cluster, realizing dynamic voltage support without relying on accurate system model parameters. Based solely on the measured input/output data of the controlled system, the proposed method dynamically linearizes the controlled system through online identification. Subsequently, a data-driven cooperative adaptive controller is designed to coordinate multiple PV inverters as a cluster. The method can effectively regulate the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC) of the controlled PV cluster with adaptability to system changes. The stability of the proposed control method is theoretically clarified. Numerical simulation using MATLAB/Simulink shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Coordinated Islanding Partition and Scheduling Strategy for Service Restoration of Active Distribution Networks Considering Minimum Sustainable Duration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10609444</link><description>This paper presents a coordinated islanding partition and scheduling strategy for service restoration of active distribution networks (ADNs) to maximize weighted restored energy considering the minimum sustainable duration (MSD) of controllable islands (CIs). To avoid the forming of uncontrollable islands, the concept of dominated buses is proposed and integrated into the topological model of ADNs for islanding partition. The co-optimization of mobile distributed generator (MDG) dispatch and dominated bus identification is carried out to accelerate the restoration process. The MSD of CIs is explicitly modeled, and the CIs are scheduled in a risk-adjusted way, whose conservatism can be adjusted by controlling the predefined risk confidence level. Interruptible loads are considered as flexible resources in the islanding partition strategy considering the effects of the MSD of CIs. To improve the practicability of the presented method, time-varying power demands and distributed renewable generation outputs are incorporated into the presented framework. The studied problem is formulated as a mixed-integer second-order cone programming model, which can be efficiently solved by commercial solvers. Finally, a modified version of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company 69-bus distribution system, a practical medium-voltage distribution system in Denmark, and a modified IEEE 123-bus distribution system are employed to demonstrate the performance of the developed model.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Risk-Averse Optimal Dispatch for Integrated Power and Transportation System Considering Carbon Trading</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10556757</link><description>With the global climate change, the significance of carbon emission reduction is widely recognized. As an effective tool for emission reduction, carbon trading needs to be considered in the operation of the integrated power and transportation system (IPTS). This paper proposes a distributed risk-averse optimal dispatch scheme for IPTS considering carbon trading. First, a carbon trading framework for IPTS is developed, in which the microgrids (MGs) within the power distribution system (PDS) and the electric vehicle agent (EVA) of the transportation system (TS) jointly participate in the carbon trading market. Furthermore, the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) method is used in the proposed scheme to manage the risks arising from diverse uncertainties, including power load, renewable power generation, traffic demand, and carbon price. To protect the privacy of the PDS and TS and improve computational performance, the spectral penalty parameter based alternating direction method of multipliers (S-ADMM) distributed solution method is developed to solve the IPTS dispatch model. Numerical results on two test systems illustrate the economic and carbon reduction benefits, risk management ability, and computational performance of the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>Supervised Optimization Framework for Charging and Discharging Controls of Battery Energy Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10561610</link><description>Although residential houses have widely adopted battery energy storage (BES) in conjunction with solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, it has been challenging to optimize BES controls owing to the uncertainty inherent in electricity prices, renewable energy resources, and electricity demand loads. The main objective of this study is to propose a supervised optimization (SO) framework designed to enable supervised learning to infer efficient BES operations in conjunction with mathematical optimization. Based on the proposed SO framework, a mathematical optimization model is formulated and solved to generate optimal charging and discharging controls given historical data in an offline optimization fashion. Then, a supervised learning model can be trained based on the optimal charging and discharging controls to infer efficient BES charging and discharging controls in an online optimization fashion. Specifically, an objective function and constraints driven by the mathematical optimization model are reflected in the course of training and inferring by supervised learning models so that the SO framework can infer feasible and efficient BES controls. Numerical experiments are conducted with data collected from a residential community in Texas, and the results reveal that the proposed SO framework results in better performance compared to the benchmark model, such as reinforcement learning and model predictive control.</description></item><item><title>Asynchronous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-Based Framework for Bi-Level Noncooperative Game-Theoretic Demand Response</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10566880</link><description>Demand response (DR) is proposed to address the uncertainty of distributed energy resources (DER) and energy storage systems in distribution networks. However, current research neglects the temporal relationships and the noncooperative relationship of demand response participants. A novel bi-level non-cooperative Stackelberg-Nash dynamic game-theoretic framework is proposed in this paper, specifically designed to address the issue of overlooking consumers&#8217; interests and temporal relationships of participant actions in traditional demand response frameworks. Within this innovative framework, an asynchronous multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed and named as Stackelberg-Nash multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm (SN-MAPPO). SN-MAPPO allows utility company (UC) and consumers to maximize their utilities within the proposed framework, ultimately leading to the convergence of UC and consumers&#8217; strategies to Stackelberg-Nash equilibrium. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, simulations are conducted using authentic data, involving one UC and eight power consumers. Simulation results confirm that the proposed demand response mechanism, while safeguarding consumers&#8217; benefits, fosters the integration of distributed energy resource and effectively mitigates load fluctuations.</description></item><item><title>Eliminating Distribution Network Congestion Based on Spatial-Temporal Migration of Multiple Base Stations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10571587</link><description>The integration of high proportions of distributed energy resources and the soaring development of 5G base stations (BSs) could lead to operational issues such as grid congestion in distribution networks. Meanwhile, 5G BSs can also serve as the flexible resources to support the distribution network. In this regard, this paper proposes a novel method to eliminate distribution network congestion with spatial-temporal migration of multiple base stations (BSs). First, the collaborative structure of the distribution network operator (DNO) and mobile network operator (MNO) is presented and the event-driven congestion management framework of the distribution network with multiple BSs is illustrated. Secondly, the specific spatial-temporal migration models of multiple BSs are established, which contain traffic migration, BS sleeping, and dispatchable capacity of the BS backup energy storage system. Then, the event-driven adaptive congestion management model is proposed, which includes congestion detection, congestion response and elimination model, and the step-wise algorithm of the congestion response is proposed. Finally, the modified IEEE 33-node and IEEE 123-node distribution system are adopted for case studies, from numerical analysis we can draw that, the proposed congestion management method can alleviate the congestion issue of the distribution network effectively while reducing costs of both DNO and MNO.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Preserved Aggregate Thermal Dynamic Model of Buildings</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10577505</link><description>The thermal inertia of buildings brings considerable flexibility to the heating and cooling load, which is known to be a promising demand response resource. The aggregate model that can describe the thermal dynamics of the building cluster is an important interference for energy systems to exploit its intrinsic thermal inertia. However, the private information of users, such as the indoor temperature and heating/cooling power, needs to be collected in the parameter estimation procedure to obtain the aggregate model, causing severe privacy concerns. In light of this, we propose a novel privacy-preserved parameter estimation approach to infer the aggregate model for the thermal dynamics of the building cluster for the first time. Using it, the parameters of the aggregate thermal dynamic model (ATDM) can be obtained by the load aggregator without accessing the individual&#8217;s privacy information. More specifically, this method not only exploits the block coordinate descent (BCD) method to resolve its non-convexity in the estimation but investigates the transformation-based encryption (TE) and the secure aggregation protocol (SAP) methods to realize privacy-preserved computation. Its capability of preserving privacy is also theoretically proven. Finally, simulation results using real-world data demonstrate the accuracy and privacy-preserved performance of our proposed method.</description></item><item><title>POMDP-Based Dispatch Scheme for Residential Distributed Energy Resources Under Customer Fatigue Consideration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10577471</link><description>With rapidly growing penetration of renewable energy, there is an increasing need for real-time balance in the power system. In recent years, as a vital component of the end user side, residential distributed energy resources (RDER) have shown promising prospects in demand response (DR). This paper addresses the RDER optimal dispatch problem from an online learning perspective. The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and the logistic regression model are employed to describe how the DR service contractor learns the uncertain response model of the customer affected by the fatigue and recovery effect. A non-stationary combinatorial multi-armed bandit paradigm is applied to dispatch RDER. In addition, we use the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) technique to estimate the customer&#8217;s unobservable states. Through simulations based on public datasets, our proposed Greedy-MLE and CUCB-MLE policies for dispatch decision-making outperform existing methods in relative power adjustment mismatch, collective fatigue, and cumulative regret. The simulation results highlight the benefits of the proposed RDER dispatch approach in ensuring customer satisfaction, service quality, and economic efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Robust Coordinated Planning of Multi-Region Integrated Energy Systems With Categorized Demand Response</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10606443</link><description>In this paper, categorized demand response (DR) programs are proposed to address the coordinated planning problem in multi-region integrated energy systems (MRIESs). The categorized DR programs comprise a discrete manufacturing production model for industrial areas, a real-time pricing-based DR program for commercial areas, and diverse operational tasks for various electrical appliances in residential areas. Subsequently, the detailed DR model is leveraged to minimize the operation cost and gas emissions in a renewable-integrated MRIES considering the uncertainties from wind and solar power. Then, a flexible adjustable robust optimization (FARO) approach is presented to deal with all uncertainty sources. The FARO approach aims to ensure the safe operation of the MRIES against any uncertainty while meeting predefined performance objectives. Furthermore, a bi-level solution algorithm is designed by combining the stochastic dichotomy method and the column-and-constraint generation (C&amp;amp;CG) algorithm to solve our coordinated planning model. Finally, case studies are conducted on a practical MRIES in Changsha, China. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the categorized DR programs in adjusting allocable resources to maximize holistic system profits. Besides, compared to the commonly used information-gap decision theory (IGDT) method, our FARO approach can maintain the optimality of the solution while reducing conservatism.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Frequency Control of Heterogeneous Energy Storage Systems Considering Short-Term Ability and Long-Term Flexibility</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10659173</link><description>Renewable energy sources introduce more fluctuations into the power system and bring challenges to maintain the system stability. Conventional generation units are gradually replaced and may soon become inadequate to meet the frequency regulation (FR) requirements. Consequently, demand-side resources for FR have received increasing attention. Among demand-side sources, inverter air conditioners (IACs) have huge regulation capacity and account for nearly 40% of the total power consumption in summer, while energy storage systems (ESSs) excel in rapid response and powerful ramp rate. However, the inadequate ramp speed of IACs and the insufficient regulation capacity of ESSs render them incapable of providing FR independently. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a distributed coordinated control algorithm that allows the effective utilization of ESSs and IACs to provide FR considering the respective advantages. Firstly, an equivalent thermal energy storage model of IAC in alignment with ESS is introduced considering heterogeneous parameters. Subsequently, a coordinated control framework is proposed for heterogeneous ESSs (hetero-ESSs), which are composed of ESSs and IACs. Based on the framework, a distributed consensus algorithm is devised for hetero-ESSs, and its stability is demonstrated through the application of the Lyapunov theorem. Finally, numerical studies verify that the proposed framework can promote ESSs&#8217; short-term ability and IACs&#8217; long-term flexibility.</description></item><item><title>Alleviating the Curse of Dimensionality in Minkowski Sum Approximations of Storage Flexibility</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10576684</link><description>Many real-world applications require the joint optimization of a large number of flexible devices over time. The flexibility of, e.g., multiple batteries, thermostatically controlled loads, or electric vehicles can be used to support grid operation and to reduce operation costs. Using piecewise constant power values, the flexibility of each device over d time periods can be described as a polytopic subset in power space. The aggregated flexibility is given by the Minkowski sum of these polytopes. As the computation of Minkowski sums is in general demanding, several approximations have been proposed in the literature. Yet, their application potential is often objective-dependent and limited by the curse of dimensionality. We show that up to  $2^{d}$  vertices of each polytope can be computed efficiently and that the convex hull of their sums provides a computationally efficient inner approximation of the Minkowski sum. Via an extensive simulation study, we illustrate that our approach outperforms ten state-of-the-art inner approximations in terms of computational complexity and accuracy for different objectives. Moreover, we propose an efficient disaggregation method applicable to any vertex-based approximation. The proposed methods provide an efficient means to aggregate and to disaggregate energy storages in quarter-hourly periods over an entire day with reasonable accuracy for aggregated cost and for peak power optimization.</description></item><item><title>Continuous Approximate Dynamic Programming Algorithm to Promote Multiple Battery Energy Storage Lifespan Benefit in Real-Time Scheduling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10586215</link><description>This paper aims to promote the lifespan benefit of multiple battery energy storage (BES) in real-time scheduling. An effective real-time scheduling model is formulated with the proposed concept of multiple BES (MBES) comprehensive lifespan benefit, which makes a tradeoff between MBES short-term operation and long-term profits. Then, a novel piece-wise linear function (PLF) based continuous ADP (PLFC-ADP) algorithm is proposed to optimize the scheduling model under uncertainties. A new decomposed value function approximation method employing both BES state of charge and BES cumulative life loss is proposed to achieve high optimality and wide applicability. Combined with the difference-based decomposed slope update method to train the PLF slopes with empirical knowledge, the proposed PLFC-ADP algorithm can handle the increasing computation complexity of MBES scheduling and obtain the approximate optimality of stochastic real-time scheduling. Numerical analysis demonstrates the validity of the proposed scheduling model, and superior computation tractability and solution optimality of the proposed PLFC-ADP algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Attention-Enhanced Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Against Observation Perturbations for Distributed Volt-VAR Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10587051</link><description>The cloud-edge collaboration architecture has been widely adopted for distributed Volt-VAR control (VVC) problems in active distribution networks (ADNs). To alleviate the computation and communication burden on edge sides, centralized training &amp; decentralized execution (CTDE) based multi-agent reinforcement learning methods have been proposed. However, the performance of these methods relies heavily on the agents&#8217; coordination mechanism and accurate observations. Given access to a vast amount of distributed energy resources, it becomes increasingly challenging to achieve efficient coordination within CTDE framework. Furthermore, the agents&#8217; observations always involve perturbations such as measurement noises and even cyber-attacks in real-world ADNs, which can significantly degrade the distributed VVC performance and may cause severe security issues. In this paper, we propose an attention-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning method to address observation perturbations for distributed VVC. In our proposed method, a mix network on the cloud platform with an agent-level attention mechanism is used to approximate the global reward, successfully capturing the intercorrelations between agents and achieving excellent coordination. A novel robust regularizer is also designed to enhance the agents&#8217; robustness facing the observation perturbations, which greatly improves the applicability of reinforcement learning methods. Numerical simulations on IEEE test cases with real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Secondary Voltage Control for DC Microgrids: A Design Perspective for SoC With Voltage Restoration Provision</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10609424</link><description>The energy management system (EMS) secondary voltage control design, integrating state-of-charge (SoC) equalization and droop control in redundancy-based dc microgrids (MGs), is ideal for vehicles, aircraft, and medical centers with sensitive loads. This paper proposes secondary voltage restoration in a dc MG to enhance S-shaped functions for SoC equalization among battery energy storage system (BESS) units. The dc MG topology is a cascaded bidirectional Cuk converter (CBC) linked to a cascaded bidirectional boost converter (CBB), both sharing two BESS units. The CBC is the primary module, while the CBB is an auxiliary module that operates under a failure in one of the Cuks, enhancing the dc MG resilience. Additionally, a fuel cell (FC) is connected to the CBC dc-link. The EMS for coordinating BESS and FC is modified by secondary voltage control to maintain the dc-link voltage at the set-point. Initially, the redundancy-based dc MG operates with voltage secondary control for the EMS, with infinity norm and Lyapunov&#8217;s indirect method ensuring the stability analysis. Finally, the validation process is conducted integrating the SpeedGoat and dSPACE platforms.</description></item><item><title>A Distributed Privacy-Preserving Framework With Integrity Verification Capabilities for Metering Data and Dynamic Billing in a Malicious Setting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10609448</link><description>Smart metering enables near-real time collection of customer energy consumption data by Electrical Service Providers (ESP). Access to this granular metering data raises privacy concerns, hindering global adoption of the smart grid. Aggregation-based frameworks aim to address these concerns, but suffer from several limitations such as, a high computational overhead on smart meters, architectural complexity, and vulnerability to single points of compromise. Distributed aggregation-based frameworks show promise, but often assume an unrealistic semi-honest threat model, a lack of integrity verification capabilities for metering data, and dynamic billing (Time Of Use) capabilities. This paper introduces a distributed framework in a malicious setting that provides integrity verification of metering data while preserving customer privacy. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed framework is the first attempt to include integrity verification capabilities of metering data and dynamic billing in a distributed data collection setting while considering a malicious adversary. A proof of concept demonstrates our proposed framework&#8217;s viability and performance against other frameworks. Our framework is shown to be lightweight on smart meters, resilient to cyberattacks, and more efficient, compared to competing techniques in the literature.</description></item><item><title>A Semi-Decentralized Real-Time Charging Scheduling Scheme for Large EV Parking Lots Considering Uncertain EV Arrival and Departure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10580944</link><description>Developing large commercial electric vehicle (EV) parking lots to support the rapid EV adoption arouses interest in optimizing their real-time charging schedules with enhanced economic efficiency. This problem has been studied in literature via fully centralized or decentralized schemes, i.e., EV charging schedules are solely determined by the parking lot central operator or individual chargers, confronting the dilemma of scalability and parking-lot-wise economic optimality. This paper studies a semi-decentralized real-time charging scheduling scheme, in which the central operator and individual chargers collaborate to achieve optimal EV charging schedules. Specifically, the central operator uses a chance-constrained model to estimate aggregate charging energy needs in a rolling process at a coarse time granularity, while considering uncertainties of aggregate arrival and departure EV charging demands via a Gaussian mixture model; with the estimated aggregate charging energy, the central operator further calculates charging energy references of individual chargers regarding their distinct charging urgency and discharging availability; each charger finally determines the actual charging power by leveraging the charging dynamics, EV departure uncertainty scenarios, and charging energy reference at a fine time granularity. The economics and efficiency of the proposed scheme are evaluated by comparing it to various forms of fully centralized schemes via numerical simulations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme, with proper settings on the charging urgency factor, time granularity, and discount factor, significantly enhances efficiency in the minute-wise charging scheduling of large-scale EVs at the slight cost of compromised revenue.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Method for Estimating Inertia of a PV-Integrated Power Grid for Enhanced Security</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10592076</link><description>The decommissioning of traditional thermal power plants with high levels of renewable energy resources (RES) always causes a reduction in system inertia. A hybrid power grid must maintain stable frequency during severe disturbances. Therefore, this study provides a generalized approach for estimating the online grid inertia under normal and disturbed operating conditions. Large-scale deployment of photovoltaic (PV) power generation is considered to replicate the rapid growth of RES and its impact on actual power grids. The individual inertia of existing conventional synchronous generators in the hybrid system is quickly estimated using the online recursive least square (RLS) method. A Kalman filter is used to reject any noise contained in the measured signals. The noise-free rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) and electrical power are further used to refine the estimation of inertia, damping coefficient, and mechanical power to enhance the overall accuracy of the proposed tracking scheme. Next, the virtual inertia of the existing PV system is derived mathematically from the identified model parameters, which are further verified using simulation results, thereby demonstrating the robustness of the proposed approach. Finally, the spectral cluster-based method is used to determine the sets of coherent machines and provide online tracking for each coherent group&#8217;s inertia, as well as the total grid inertia in response to different disturbances and intermittency of RES power generation. The proposed inertia estimation method is proven to be very fast, allowing preventative action to be taken before any instability occurs.The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested and verified using IEEE 39-bus, 68-bus, an islanded AC microgrid, as well as a modified IEEE 39-bus based MTDC test system.</description></item><item><title>Peer-to-Peer Energy Transactions for Prosumers Based on Improved Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10571970</link><description>With the evolution of the power market, the active involvement of prosumers in both consuming renewable energy and maximizing financial gains has emerged as a pivotal and compelling trend in the prospective landscape of energy market development. However, the optimal energy trading strategy for prosumers under a complicated peer-to-peer (P2P) market environment is still a great challenge, due to the incomplete information and large decision space. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an improved deep deterministic policy gradient (IDDPG) algorithm to optimize the P2P energy trading and operation strategy for prosumers. The proposed IDDPG algorithm uses a wave-attention network to model the external interactive environment of each prosumer to simplify the complexity of multi-agent trading environment. Moreover, a priority sampling mechanism is proposed to learn valuable experiences purposefully and adopts a cyclic learning rate to avoid local optimality. Finally, the feasibility of the method is verified by the case study of P2P trading with different scales of prosumers. The numerical results show that the proposed IDDPG algorithm outperforms the traditional reinforcement learning algorithms in both calculating efficiency and convergence, and provides a reference for the P2P transaction strategy of prosumers.</description></item><item><title>A Dynamic and Static Combined State Recovery Method Against FDI Attacks in Power Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10564142</link><description>The widespread integration of information technology into power systems increases their vulnerability to false data injection (FDI) attacks, where attackers can mislead the power system state estimator to produce incorrect results. Consequently, it is critical to identify the attack and recover the real system state of the power grid. The primary method of state recovery is to derive the real state from measurements covered by the static measurement protection (SMP) methods, which are expensive to apply. The dynamic reactance perturbation (DRP) methods are low-cost but may fail in some conditions to detect attacks due to the topology limitation. In this paper, we propose a dynamic and static combined defense (DSCD) method, which combines the DRP and SMP methods to identify attacks and enhance the resilience of the state estimator at a lower cost. First, we propose the framework of DSCD and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for recovering the system state. Second, we develop a non-convex optimization model to implement DSCD and propose heuristic algorithms under two extreme scenarios. Using these algorithms, defenders have the flexibility to balance between cost and delay. Simulation results on four IEEE test systems validated the superior performance of the proposed DSCD method.</description></item><item><title>Barrier-Function Adaptive Finite-Time Trajectory Tracking Controls for Cyber Resilience in Smart Grids Under an Electricity Market Environment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10566851</link><description>The advancement and proliferation of digitalization and communication infrastructure have facilitated the rise of real-time bidding markets in smart grids. In these dynamic markets, energy distribution companies and power-generating companies interact to establish energy exchange contracts based on offered prices. However, the fluctuation in power flow resulting from contract changes within the real-time bidding market introduces a potential vulnerability that malicious attackers can exploit to launch successful stealthy attacks. To enhance the smart grid resiliency against cyber-attack in the power market bidding environment, a new barrier-function adaptive finite-time trajectory tracking control is proposed in this paper. The developed controller is utilized to actively counteract and mitigate potential cyber-attacks to ensure their rejection and prevention. The stability analysis convincingly demonstrates the rapid convergence of system states within a finite time frame, empowering the system to effectively reject cyber-attacks in real-time. Test results of an IEEE test systems, considering governor dead bound nonlinearity and communication time delay are presented and compared with those obtained from other methods to ensure and demonstrate the performance of proposed method. The Speedgoat real-time target machine, along with Simulink real-time, validates the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Blockchain-Based Authentication Scheme for Energy Trading in Electric Transportation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10580954</link><description>Authentication between Electric Vehicle (EV) users and Battery Charging/Switching (BCS) stations is a significant problem for energy trading. Although there are many existing authentication schemes, cross-domain authentication for EV users and BCS stations from different domains (such as different regions, companies, manufacturers) has not been well addressed; several blockchain-based cross-domain authentication schemes have more than 11 times communication rounds and involve over 4 times exponentiation, scalar multiplications and bilinear pairing cryptographic operations; this leads to high communication and computational costs. This work aims to tackle this problem by using blockchain and certificate-based public-key cryptography. It proposes an authentication scheme that uses a blockchain ledger to record authentication materials across different domains. A two-stage smart contract is designed and deployed to verify the authentication materials before storing them permanently in the blockchain. A novel certificate-based authenticated key establishment (CB-AKE) protocol is proposed to authenticate EV users and BCS stations. Based on the theoretical analysis and practical evaluation on the security and performance, the proposed scheme can well address the cross-domain authentication problem with acceptable cost. Compared to benchmark schemes, the authentication latency of CB-AKE is decreased by at least 25% and the throughput of CB-AKE is increased by at least 34%.</description></item><item><title>Data-Enabled Modeling and PMU-Based Real-Time Localization of EV-Based Load-Altering Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10586268</link><description>Recently, the integration of electric vehicles (EVs) and their associated electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) has increased significantly in smart grids. Due to the cyber vulnerabilities of this EV ecosystem, such integration makes the entire grid prone to cyberattacks, which can result in the outage of generators or even blackouts. On this basis, this paper leverages a data-enabled predictive attack model (DeeP-AM) to design an EV-based dynamic load-altering attack (EV-DLAA) that targets the frequency stability of the grid. Subsequently, a robust localization framework for the developed EV-DLAAs is proposed using power system measurements obtained from phasor measurement units (PMUs). First, frequency measurements in the transmission grid are used to develop an optimal EV-DLAA without having perfect knowledge of the grid&#8217;s topology. Such an optimal attack model ensures that the targeted frequency deviation is reached by utilizing the least number of EVs and a minimized time of instability (ToI). Then, a PMU-based real-time localization framework is developed based on the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) method, which simultaneously estimates the magnitude and location of EV-DLAAs. The equations obtained from the SINDy method are effectively solved using a modified basis pursuit de-noising (MBPDN) approach. This approach enhances the accuracy and robustness of the localization framework, particularly when confronted with noise. The attack implications and the localization performance are evaluated using the New England 39-bus and Australian power systems.</description></item><item><title>Anomaly Observer-Based Cyber-Resilient Torque Control Against Hybrid Attacks in Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10599829</link><description>Inspired by the continued focuses on renewable energy cybersecurity issues, this paper aims to propose a cyber-resilient torque control framework for wind turbines to defend against the hybrid attack. The cyber threat model is established combining denial-of-service and data manipulation attacks, which attempts to destabilize the wind turbine system by implementing the attacks on the communication link from the rotor speed sensor to the controller. Particularly, the impact of hybrid attack is analyzed and classified into two cases, and the corresponding compensatory measures are developed. To mitigate the impact of the hybrid attack and stabilize the wind turbine system, a cyber-resilient torque control scheme combining zero-order holder and anomaly observer is proposed, which requires simple computational ability of the wind turbine system. Using the Lyapunov theory, the control target of optimal rotor speed tracking is guaranteed and the tolerable attack range under the proposed method is derived. Extensive studies are carried out on a 1.5 MW doubly-fed induction generator-based wind turbine, and the simulation results indicate that the proposed control strategy could effectively reduce the impacts caused by the hybrid attack.</description></item><item><title>PAP: A Privacy-Preserving Authentication Scheme With Anonymous Payment for V2G Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10613000</link><description>Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) networks, as an emerging smart grid paradigm, can be integrated with renewable energy resources to provide power services and manage electricity demands. When accessing electricity services, an electric vehicle  $\left ({{\mathcal {E}\mathcal {V}}}\right)$  typically provides authentication or/and payment information containing identifying data to a service provider, which raises privacy concerns as malicious entities might trace  $\mathcal {E}\mathcal {V}$  activity or exploit personal information. Although numerous anonymous authentication and payment schemes have been presented for V2G networks, no such privacy-preserving scheme supports authentication and payment simultaneously. Therefore, this paper is the first to present a privacy-preserving authentication scheme with anonymous payment for V2G networks (PAP, for short). In addition, this scheme also supports accountability and revocability, which are practical features to prevent malicious behavior; minimal attribute disclosure, which maximizes the privacy of  $\mathcal {E}\mathcal {V}$  when responding to the service provider&#8217;s flexible access policies; payment binding, which guarantees the accountability in the payment phase; user-controlled linkability, which enables  $\mathcal {E}\mathcal {V}$  to decide whether different authentication sessions are linkable for continuous services. On the performance side, we implement PAP with the pairing cryptography library, then evaluate it on different hardware platforms, showing that it is essential for V2G applications.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Blockchain-Based Data Aggregation Scheme With Privacy-Preserving on the Smart Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10612996</link><description>With the development of smart grid, the introduction of blockchain technology provides a novel idea for secure power data sharing. The existing blockchain-based data aggregation schemes generally rely on a unique leader node to perform verification algorithms, but there may be a lazy leader node not performing aggregation data verification to save computation costs. In addition, in the existing verification mechanism, light nodes need to perform the same verification operations as the leader node, which results in resource-constrained light nodes being unable to bear. In this paper, we propose an efficient blockchain-based data aggregation scheme with privacy-preserving on the smart grid, called EC-ASPG, which implements a supervised mechanism for the lazy leader node, enhancing the security of the system. Furthermore, we propose a separable consensus verification mechanism, which can prevent other light nodes from performing duplicate verification operations like the leader node, effectively improving the efficiency of consensus verification. Finally, we present a formal security proof and comprehensive performance evaluations.

LLRA incorporates continuous after-the-fact leakage-resilient property. Furthermore, extended BPR (CLR-eBPR) security model and extended GNY (CLR-eGNY) logic were introduced. Through provable security analysis, logic analysis, and practical performance evaluations, we demonstrated that LLRA effectively mitigates side-channel attacks while maintaining minimum authentication delay and energy consumption for the computing devices used in smart meters and NAN gateways. Compared to benchmark protocols, the authentication delay of LLRA was decreased by at least 14%; in addition, the energy consumption of LLRA was decreased by at least 7%.</description></item><item><title>Detection of Malicious Command Injection Attacks Against Static Var Compensators in Smart Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643841</link><description>In a smart grid, voltage control and reactive power control are crucial to its safe and reliable operation. Static Var compensators (SVCs) are widely used to achieve these controls in a transmission system, either through centralized control by Energy Management Systems or through local closed loop control systems. In smart grids, the command channels to control SVCs are vulnerable to cyber attacks. In this paper, attack scenarios involving injection of malicious commands to SVCs are studied in detail. Attack models are established for both methods of control. Based on these attack models, two detection algorithms are proposed. The principle behind these algorithms involves the notion that even though an adversary can manipulate the commands and measurements related to SVCs, it is nearly impossible to hide the effect on other state variables and measurements in the system. The algorithms are developed mathematically using electrical quantities, making these schemes independent of the underlying Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) used. The rationale behind the choices made during the development of the algorithms are proven formally. Finally, two algorithms are formally proposed, which are easy to implement and computationally less intensive, when compared to iterative and multi-stage algorithms. These algorithms are then tested on various test-cases on the IEEE 118-bus system and found to be effective.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Optimal Power Flow for Multi-Agent Active Distribution Networks: A Differentially Private Consensus ADMM Algorithm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10659236</link><description>In multi-agent active distribution networks, the information exchanges in the ADMM algorithm for the decentralized distribution-level optimal power flow (D-OPF) may expose sensitive load flows of tie-lines across adjacent agents.

However, working hydraulic system of existing electric wheel loaders are centralized load-sensing (LS) system. The LS system suffers from low energy efficiency because of valve throttling losses. Therefore, an independent electro-hydraulic variable speed drive (VSD) with separate layout, normal pump speed and closed circuit is proposed to increase the efficiency of working hydraulic system and electric wheel loader. The VSD is powered by a variable-speed electric motor and a fixed pump without throttle control valve, eliminating throttling losses. Besides, the separate VSD utilizes commercially available electric motor and pump, interconnecting actuator via hydraulic pipelines. The system components are modeled in detail and the influence of pipeline is considered in simulation analysis. A mode-based control strategy for the proposed powertrain is developed. The simulation study is carried out to verify the feasibility of the proposed separate design and control strategy. The powertrain operation and energy comparison between proposed powertrain and baseline powertrain are conducted. Results demonstrate the efficiency of independent electro-hydraulic variable speed drive improves from 36.9% to 70.6% compared to centralized LS system. Furthermore, the proposed powertrain reduces energy consumption by 32.3% compared with baseline powertrain.</description></item><item><title>Electromagnetic Localization and Tracking Control of Underactuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicle for Subsea Cable Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10645344</link><description>Subsea cables are important channels for international interconnection and power transmission. Traditional subsea cable operation and maintenance approaches rely on underwater remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). This method is time-consuming, labour-intensive, and uneconomical due to insufficient autonomy and strong dependence on surface ship auxiliary. This paper proposes an intelligent detection scheme for simultaneous electromagnetic localization and autonomous tracking of subsea cables based on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with an electromagnetic system. The dual triaxial electromagnetic array carried by AUV is designed to calculate the spatial location of the subsea cable. The localization results are used to design the AUV tracking guidance law, and the underactuation problem is solved. At the AUV kinetic level, the command filter and adaptive neural network are designed to solve the constraints of electromagnetic noise, unknown dynamic parameters and complex ocean current interferences. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed autonomous detection and tracking control scheme for subsea cables are verified by comparative simulation studies.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Agent Framework for P2P Energy Trading With EV Aggregators Supporting V2X Services</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654511</link><description>The number of electric vehicles (EVs) has multiplied rapidly due to governments' push towards clean energy transition. Being an integral part of future transportation-power coupling, how to make the most of these EVs in this interdependent interaction while respecting their privacy concerning EV batteries' state conditions and physical limits becomes critical. This paper proposes a new peer-to-peer energy trading framework between EV aggregators and local entities with distributed energy resources. The framework enables the efficient use of EV batteries for various vehicle-to-everything (V2X) operations, like vehicle-to-grid and vehicle-to-vehicle, while ensuring safe operation and protection of confidential data. Safe operating envelopes are developed to control EV battery state of charge and temperature limits, reducing dimensionality without compromising accuracy and privacy. Additionally, an incentive model is introduced to capture the EV owner's willingness to support V2X and undergo multiple charge/discharge cycles during the trading period. Moreover, a model predictive control-based architecture is developed to effectively manage the dynamic nature of EV arrivals and departures. The proposed peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading framework incorporates grid constraints and has been rigorously evaluated through numerical simulations conducted using the IEEE 33-bus distribution network with 5 prosumer agents, hosting a combination of solar PVs and multiple EVs. Simulation results show that the framework facilitates efficient engagement of EVs in P2P energy trading without violating their safe operational limits as well as the grid constraints.</description></item><item><title>A Soft-Switched Three-Phase Inductor Coupling Quasi-Z-Source Integrated Charger With Reduced Output Current Ripple for Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10661226</link><description>This paper proposes a three-phase inductor coupling quasi-Z-source integrated charger (qZIC) to realize zero current switching (ZCS) and zero voltage switching (ZVS) operation with low current ripple. The conventional qZIC, applying a modified modulation based on modified ZSVM3 (three-segment Z-source Space Vector Modulation), has been proposed due to its capability to achieve fully soft switching without any additional circuits. However, the inductor operates with discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), resulting in significant output charging current ripple. To figure it out, the proposed qZIC substitutes a coupled inductor for the two inductors of quasi-Z-source network. The output current is continuous and ripples are suppressed. In addition, all power switches can still realize ZVS or ZCS by designing the coupled inductor according to the operation principle. The operation principle is analyzed in detail and design considerations are provided. A 6-kW prototype is built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed inductor coupling qZIC. Experimental results demonstrate the elimination of output current ripples, and all switches operate with soft switching.</description></item><item><title>IRS-Enabled Monostatic Backscatter MIMO Communication Design for V2I Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643685</link><description>Future vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) wireless networks are meeting unprecedented challenges regarding the high energy consumption problem caused by the large number of radio frequency (RF) emitters deployed. The backscatter communication (BackCom) and Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) techniques can achieve low-power transmission while implementing effective beamforming. Thus, this paper leverages these two techniques into V2I communication systems, where multiple IRSs transmit roadside information to a multi-antenna vehicle by backscattering the vehicle's signals. Considering the self-interference and two optimization methods at the vehicle, i.e., post-detection (PD) and integrated detection (ID), we formulate two weighted sum-rate maximization problems. The detection matrix and transmit power at the vehicle, as well as the IRS reflection coefficients, are jointly designed based on an alternating algorithm. The simulation results validate the convergence performance of the proposed algorithm, the feasibility of the introduced system model, and the effectiveness of the optimization scheme.</description></item><item><title>Secrecy Capacity Analysis of 4-WFRFT Based Physical Layer Security in MIMO System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10652904</link><description>In this paper, the integration of antenna selection(AS) and 4-weighted-type fractional Fourier transform (4-WFRFT) technologies into the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system based channel correlation has been proposed to enhance the security performance of wireless communications, where the energy of transmitting signals is split into four portions by employing the 4-WFRFT technology. This is equivalent to introducing additional artificial noise at the eavesdropper. To characterize system performance, the channel correlation is first considered, then we propose a valid method to model the distribution of composite instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of eavesdropper as the tractable exponential distribution. Furthermore, we drive the close-form expressions for both the joint probability density function (PDF) of channel and the average SNR at the eavesdropper. Based on above results, we deduce the close-form expressions of average security capacity with AS and 4-WFRFT technologies. To obtain further insights, we also derive the theoretical expressions of secrecy outage probability. The analysis results show that AS and 4-WFRFT technologies exist to simultaneously increase the average security capacity and then decrease the secrecy outage probability. The numerical results illustrate that: 1) 4-WFRF technology can validly eliminate the impact of channel correlation due to introducing the artificial noise; 2) the secrecy performance of system can be improved remarkably by employing AS and 4-WFRFT technologies.</description></item><item><title>Human-Assisted Resilient Coordination for Automated Platoon With False Data Injection Attack</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10648953</link><description>This paper investigates the resilient platooning problem of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) under false-data injection (FDI) attacks. These attacks can alter the system state of any vehicle within a platoon at any time, presenting a significant challenge. To tackle this, we introduce a human-assisted resilient coordination (HARC) approach for CAVs, comprised of three core modules: a joint attack detection mechanism, a human-assisted coordination scheme, and a distributed optimization-based control module. The attack detection approach monitors vehicles at two distinct levels - local communication and global communication. Our human-assisted coordination strategy is designed not only to respond efficiently to attacks but also to ensure seamless coordination of the vehicle platoon, thereby preventing accidents and enhancing flexibility. By incorporating human input, we bolster the resilience and security of platoon coordination. Moreover, we present a distributed optimization-based control technique tailored specifically for constrained CAVs. A resilience constraint is designed and incorporated into the optimization problem, thereby empowering CAVs to identify adversarial communication channels via a localized communication detector. We provide experimental results to showcase the effectiveness of our proposed approach and to highlight its implications for resilient platooning under FDI attacks.</description></item><item><title>FSO-Based HAP-Assisted Multi-UAV Backhauling Over $\mathcal {F}$ Channels With Imperfect CSI</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10645309</link><description>Non-terrestrial Network (NTN), utilizing high-altitude platforms (HAP)-based free-space optical (FSO) backhaul and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for last-mile access, is a feasible and promising architecture to achieve high data rate and seamless network coverage in the future 6G era. Effective resource allocation emerges as a pivotal concern for such networks. This paper addresses the data allocation issue for FSO backhaul from the HAP to multiple UAV-mounted base stations (BSs) under the constraints of ground users' requested data rates. We introduce frame allocation schemes (FAS), including rate adaptation with constraints (RAC)- and rate/power adaptation (RPA)-aided FAS. The key idea of these schemes is to allocate data frames effectively based on UAV's turbulence channel conditions, which aims to (i) guarantee the quality of services (QoS), (ii) retain both latency and throughput fairness, and (iii) minimize the transmitted power. Furthermore, the performance of these schemes is also analyzed under the impact of imperfect channel state information (CSI). We newly derive the channel probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative density function (CDF), considering the imperfect CSI due to channel estimation and quantization errors. Capitalizing on the derived PDF and CDF, different performance metrics are analytically obtained, incorporating combined effects of cloud coverage, transceiver misalignment, Fisher-Snedecor $\mathcal {F}$ turbulence, and angle-of-arrival (AoA) fluctuations. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our design proposals over the state-of-the-art. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations are employed to validate the analysis.</description></item><item><title>Energy Minimization for UAV-Enabled Data Collection With Guaranteed Performance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654581</link><description>Due to their mobility, flexibility, and access to remote areas, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a versatile solution for various wireless communication applications. In this paper, we consider a UAV-enabled wireless communication system where a rotary-wing UAV is dispatched as the mobile data collector for multiple sensor nodes (SNs). Our objective is to minimize the total energy consumption of the UAV by jointly optimizing the mission completion time, UAV trajectory, and communication scheduling of the SNs. This will be achieved while ensuring that the minimum throughput requirements of all SNs involved in the system are satisfied. It has been demonstrated that the formulated problem exhibits non-convexity, compounded by the uncertainty in mission completion time. Therefore, current convex optimization techniques or traditional time discretization methods are insufficient for effectively addressing this problem. To tackle this challenge, we first propose a fly-hover-fly scheme that leverages the UAVs ability to swiftly move between points of interest and maintain stationary positions for data collection. We introduce a well-designed hovering location selection algorithm to ensure coverage of all SNs while minimizing the number of required hovering locations. As a result, the original problem is segmented into several tractable subproblems. Leveraging the fly-hover-fly trajectory solution, we further develop a waypoint adjustment scheme that progressively refines the UAVs hovering locations through successive convex approximation technique. The validity of our proposed solution is verified through in-depth numerical simulations.</description></item><item><title>Primal-Dual Deep Reinforcement Learning for Periodic Coverage-Assisted UAV Secure Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654565</link><description>Considering the UAVs' energy constraints and green communication requirements, this paper proposes a periodic coverage-assisted UAV secure communication system to maximize the worst-case average achievable secrecy rate.UAV base stations serve legitimate users while UAV jammers periodically dispatch interference signals to eavesdroppers. User scheduling, UAV trajectory and power allocation are modeled as a constrained Markov decision problem with coverage evaluation constraint. Then, the joint optimization of user scheduling, UAV trajectory and power allocation is achieved by the primal-dual soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm. Specifically, the reward critic network assesses the secrecy rate and the cost critic network fits the coverage constraint. Meanwhile, the actor network generates the user scheduling, UAV trajectory and power allocation policy while updating the dual variables. For comparison, we also adopt other deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solutions namely the SAC algorithm and the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) as well as the traditional random method and greedy method. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs best in the training speed, the reward performance and the secrecy rate.</description></item><item><title>Accelerating Maximum-Likelihood Detection in Massive MIMO: A New Paradigm With Memristor Crossbar Based In-Memory Computing Circuit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10738291</link><description>Massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) signal processing algorithms heavily rely on high-dimension matrix operations, which impose excessively high computational complexity. Moreover, in the post-Moore era, the performance of the classical von Neumann computing architecture is facing severe limitations. The memristor crossbar based in-memory computing holds the potential to break the memory wall and enhance the circuit's energy efficiency by orders-of-magnitude. In this paper we present a memristor crossbar based circuit design for performing the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) MIMO detection with high computation parallelism at the base station equipped with a large-scale antenna array. Simulation results show that, despite considering the circuit programming error and the memristor bit-precision, the bit error rate (BER) of the proposed circuit is almost the same as that achieved by the digital computer. Moreover, the proposed circuit achieves roughly the same level of computing performance as the NVIDIA QUADRO GV100, but with about 40 times higher energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>One-Bit PMCW Radar: Designing Binary Transmit Code and Receive Filter via a Worst-Case Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10648744</link><description>Phase-modulated continuous-wave (PMCW) radar is one of the emerging technologies in various wide-band applications, such as automotive radars. Utilizing a one-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) at the receiver side can reduce the cost and power consumption of this kind of radar while leveraging its benefits. In this correspondence, we consider the joint design of the binary transmit code and the receive filter for PMCW radars in the presence of a one-bit ADC at the receiver. When using a one-bit ADC, noise samples play an essential role in the sidelobe increment of the filter output. Therefore, the mean-integrated sidelobe level (MEISL) metric is used as the design criterion to cover the effect of noise. Since the target backscattering coefficient ($\alpha$) is unknown at the design stage, we resort to the worst-case approach concerning the target backscattering coefficient and cast a minimax problem. We demonstrate that the inner maximization problem has a closed-form solution. Indeed, we prove that the maximum value of MEISL for the fixed code and filter occurs at a real-valued $\alpha$ that relates to the minimum acceptable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the radar system. Finally, by recasting the objective function, a cyclic optimization procedure is utilized, for which the filter optimization subproblem has a closed-form solution, and the code is optimized using the coordinate descent framework. Several numerical examples are provided to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed design procedure. The proposed method exhibits superior performance compared to some state-of-the-art methods, particularly in low-SNR scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Design of a New CIM-DCSK-Based Ambient Backscatter Communication System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643386</link><description>To improve the energy efficiency and the data rate in differential chaos shift keying (DCSK) based ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) system, we propose a new AmBC system based on code index modulation (CIM), referred to as CIM-DCSK-AmBC system. In the proposed system, the CIM-DCSK signal transmitted in the direct link is used as the radio frequency source of the backscatter link. The signal format in the backscatter link is designed to increase the data rate as well as eliminate the interference of the direct link signal. As such, the direct link signal and the backscatter link signal can be received and demodulated simultaneously. Moreover, we derive and validate the analytical bit error rate (BER) expressions of the CIM-DCSK-AmBC system over cascaded multipath Rayleigh fading channels. Regarding the short reference DCSK-based AmBC (SR-DCSK-AmBC) system as a benchmark system, numerical results reveal that the CIM-DCSK-AmBC system can achieve better BER performance in the direct link and higher throughput in the backscatter link than the benchmark system.</description></item><item><title>Towards High Energy Efficiency for Cell-Free Massive MIMO: A Low-Complexity Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10645316</link><description>In this correspondence, we investigate the energy efficiency (EE) of the uplink in a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system equipped with low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).

Subsequently, we formulate an optimization problem aimed at maximizing EE through the joint design of receiver weights and power control factors. To tackle this non-convex challenge, the alternating optimization method is employed, facilitating the development of low-complexity, closed-form algorithms. These algorithms leverage the generalized eigenvalue, quadratic transformation, and Lagrangian dual transformation techniques.

In this article, we propose a novel PV power combination prediction model based on complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) in conjunction with a hybrid neural network. To mitigate the influence of strong fluctuations in PV power on prediction outcomes, we employ CEEMDAN to decompose the PV data into several subsequences. Subsequently, sample entropy (SE) is used to quantify the complexity of each subsequence. Subsequences with similar SE values are then restructured to reduce computational load. Moreover, to overcome the limitations of a single neural network in capturing historical data features of PV power, a hybrid sequential convolutional neural network-gate recurrent unit (CNN-GRU) neural network is proposed. The effectiveness of our proposed model is validated through case studies involving PV power stations in two regions. To provide a comprehensive assessment, we conduct comparative validation by building and evaluating alternative models, including long-short term memory (LSTM), GRU, CEEMDAN-LSTM, CEEMDAN-GRU, and CNN-GRU.

Each chiplet contains an analog front end in combination with a channel-selection multiplexer, a successive-approximation-register analog-digital converter (SAR-ADC), an ultra-wideband transmitter (UWB-TX), a low-power on-chip crystal-based clock generation circuit, and a low-dropout voltage regulator, including voltage reference. The die occupies an area of 3.64mm2 in a 180-nm 1P6M CMOS technology. A flexible acquisition of bio-potentials is possible due to the rail-to-rail (R-R) input dc tolerance and multiple bandwidth and gain modes (0.2&#8211;128/512/2048Hz, and 19.9&#8211;53.1dB, respectively). In addition, a low total harmonic distortion (THD) of &#8722;51.1dB of the bio-signal acquisition analog front end (Bio-AFE) for bio-signal relevant levels and a high signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) of 83.0dB of the SAR-ADC result in a high linearity of the recorded bio-signals. A low input-referred noise ranging from 2.9 to 7.1 $\mu $ Vrms, together with a high differential input impedance of 216M $\Omega $  and a common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of 81.6dB, is essential for the acquisition of the low-amplitude bio-signals. The low-power consumption of 0.37&#8211;1 $\mu $ W per channel (mode-dependent) of the Bio-AFE and that of 1.22 $\mu $ W per channel of the SAR-ADC, both from a 1-V supply, enable battery- or RF-powered applications in a small form factor.</description></item><item><title>55&#8211;100-GHz Enhanced Gilbert Cell Mixer Design in 22-nm FDSOI CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10682099</link><description>This article presents a wideband active millimeter wave (mmWave) CMOS downconversion mixer preceded by thorough analysis.

The overall structure consists of two stacked pseudo-differential PAs and transformer-based quadrature hybrids designed with 22-nm CMOS FDSOI. Two techniques to compensate frequency-dependent amplitude response of the quadrature hybrid when operating away from the center frequency are proposed. The first one involves a dual input drive and the second one involves asymmetric biasing. With distortion contribution analysis, it is shown that asymmetric biasing compensates quadrature hybrid asymmetry but also produces mutually compensating third-order nonlinearity, resulting in improved linearity. Measurements with continuous wave (CW) and high dynamic range fifth generation (5G) modulated signal demonstrate that the described techniques improve output power that can be reached within the linearity specifications when operating away from the center frequency.</description></item><item><title>A 22-nm All-Digital Time-Domain Neural Network Accelerator for Precision In-Sensor Processing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10758340</link><description>Deep neural network (DNN) accelerators are increasingly integrated into sensing applications, such as wearables and sensor networks, to provide advanced in-sensor processing capabilities.

Yet, time-domain accelerators are typically not fully digital, limiting the full benefits of time-domain computation. In this work, we propose an all-digital time-domain accelerator with a small size and low energy consumption to target precision in-sensor processing like human activity recognition (HAR). The proposed accelerator features a simple and efficient architecture without dependencies on analog nonidealities such as leakage and charge errors. An eight-neuron layer (core computation layer) is implemented in 22-nm FD-SOI technology. The layer occupies  $70 \times \,70\,\mu $ m while supporting multibit inputs (8-bit) and weights (8-bit) with signed accumulation up to 18 bits. The power dissipation of the computation layer is 576 $\mu $ W at 0.72-V supply and 500-MHz clock frequency achieving an average area efficiency of 24.74 GOPS/mm2 (up to 544.22 GOPS/mm2), an average energy efficiency of 0.21 TOPS/W (up to 4.63 TOPS/W), and a normalized energy efficiency of 13.46 1b-TOPS/W (up to 296.30 1b-TOPS/W).</description></item><item><title>Static-Linearity Enhancement Techniques for Digital-to-Analog Converters Exploiting Optimal Arrangements of Unit Elements</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10756519</link><description>Driven by the ongoing challenge of designing high-accuracy digital-to-analog converters (DACs) at the cost of a relatively small area occupation, optimal combination algorithms (OCAs) recently gained attention within the myriad of possible calibration techniques for DACs. OCAs show appealing properties with respect to traditional approaches such as dynamic element matching (DEM). At start-up or upon request, mismatches affecting DAC elements are measured on-chip, allowing rearrangement in the selection logic of the DAC unit elements. The newly found arrangement is, hence, used during normal operation, achieving superior linearity. As of today, several alternative OCAs have been proposed; however, designers willing to implement OCA-calibrated DACs are faced with unclear tradeoffs and insufficient design guidelines. In this work, we provide a detailed comparison of existing OCAs based on statistical behavioral simulations. Starting from this, we investigate the relationships between OCAs&#8217; performances and circuit-level design aspects. Specifically, OCAs&#8217; effectiveness in improving the static linearity is linked to the number of DAC bits and the accuracy of the auxiliary comparator required by every OCA. Unforeseen trends emerge, and new design considerations are suggested, fostering novel awareness on the subject of high-accuracy DAC designs enabled by OCA-based calibration techniques.</description></item><item><title>Marmotini: A Weight Density Adaptation Architecture With Hybrid Compression Method for Spiking Neural Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10682801</link><description>Brain-inspired spiking neural network (SNN) has recently attracted widespread interest owing to its event-driven nature and relatively low-power hardware for transmitting highly sparse binary spikes. To further improve energy efficiency, some matrix compression algorithms are used for weight storage. However, the weight sparsity of different layers varies greatly. For a multicore neuromorphic system, it is difficult for the same compression algorithm to adapt to all the layers of SNN model. In this work, we propose a weight density adaptation architecture with hybrid compression method for SNN, named Marmotini. It is a multicore heterogeneous design, including three types of cores to complete computation of different weight sparsity. Benefiting from the hybrid compression method, Marmotini minimizes the waste of neurons and weights as much as possible. Besides, for better flexibility, a reconfigurable core that can be configured to compute convolutional layer or fully connected layer is proposed. Implemented on Xilinx Kintex UltraScale XCKU115 field-programmable gate array (FPGA) board, Marmotini can operate at 150-MHz frequency, achieving 244.6-GSOP/s peak performance and 54.1-GSOP/W energy efficiency at 0% spike sparsity.</description></item><item><title>Designing Precharge-Free Energy-Efficient Content-Addressable Memories</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10723100</link><description>Content-addressable memory (CAM) is a specialized type of memory that facilitates massively parallel comparison of a search pattern against its entire content. State-of-the-art (SOTA) CAM solutions are either fast but power-hungry (NOR CAM) or slow while consuming less power (nand CAM). These limitations stem from the dynamic precharge operation, leading to excessive power consumption in NOR CAMs and charge-sharing issues in NAND CAMs. In this work, we propose a precharge-free CAM (PCAM) class for energy-efficient applications. By avoiding precharge operation, PCAM consumes less energy than a NAND CAM, while achieving search speed comparable to a NOR CAM. PCAM was designed using a 65-nm CMOS technology and comprehensively evaluated under extensive Monte Carlo (MC) simulations while taking into account layout parasitics. When benchmarked against conventional NAND CAM, PCAM demonstrates improved search run time (reduced by more than 30%) and 15% less search energy. Moreover, PCAM can cut energy consumption by more than 75% when compared to conventional NOR CAM. We further extend our analysis to the application level, functionally evaluating the CAM designs as a fully associative cache using a CPU simulator running various benchmark workloads. This analysis confirms that PCAMs represent an optimal energy-performance design choice for associative memories and their broad spectrum of applications.</description></item><item><title>Hi-NeRF: A Multicore NeRF Accelerator With Hierarchical Empty Space Skipping for Edge 3-D Rendering</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10689648</link><description>Neural radiance field (NeRF) has proved to be promising in augmented/virtual-reality applications. However, the deployment of NeRF on edge devices suffers from inadequate throughput due to redundant ray sampling and congested memory access. To address these challenges, this article proposes Hi-NeRF, a multirendering-core accelerator for efficient edge NeRF rendering. On the architecture level, a hierarchical empty space skipping (HESS) scheme is adopted, which efficiently locates the effective samples with fewer skipping steps and thus accelerates the ray marching process. Furthermore, to alleviate the memory access bottleneck, a vertex-interleaved mapping (VIM) method that eliminates memory bank conflicts is also proposed. On the hardware level, ineffective sample filters (ISFs) and voxel access filters (VCFs) are introduced to further exploit spatial sparsity and data locality at run-time. The experimental results show that our work achieves  $2.67\times $  rendering throughput and  $11.2\times $  energy efficiency compared to a SOTA NeRF rendering accelerator. The energy efficiency can be improved by  $561\times $  compared to a commercial GPU.</description></item><item><title>Spread Spectrum-Based Countermeasures for Cryptographic RISC-V SoC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10649588</link><description>Side-channel analysis attacks have become the primary method for exploiting the vulnerabilities of cryptographic devices. Therefore, focusing on countermeasures to enhance the security level of these implementations evolves even more urgently. This article proposes a time-based hiding countermeasure by using spread-spectrum signals. In our RISC-V system on chip (SoC), cryptographic accelerators are given by random dynamic frequency-hopping signals. We found 223 available parameter sets for a Xilinx Mixed-Mode Clock Manage primitive in spread spectrum mode and achieved better effectiveness in the occupied bandwidth (OBW) metric. The mixed mode clock managers (MMCMs) output signal and the range of frequencies within the spread will be changed randomly, resulting in multiple clocks for individual encryption. The effectiveness of this proposal is demonstrated by conducting realistic side-channel attacks (SCAs) and state-of-the-art leakage assessment methodologies on the well-known data encryption standard, i.e., the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) accelerator. Even though we used up to five million power traces, the test results show that our defense can stand up to a regular correlation power analysis (CPA) attack as well as alignment preprocessing methods, like CPA attacks that use a sliding window or an amplitude peak location algorithm. Furthermore, the t-test methodology cannot detect any first-order information leakage in five million traces; meanwhile, the deep learning leakage assessment (DLLA) requires nearly one million power traces in the training test to detect leakage points.</description></item><item><title>A CMOS Readout Circuit for Resistive Tactile Sensor Array Using Crosstalk Suppression and Nonuniformity Compensation Techniques</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10649812</link><description>This article presents a novel readout circuit for the resistive tactile sensor array. Based on the 2-D scanning mechanism, a crosstalk suppression technique is proposed by combining the correlated double sampling (CDS) and zero potential method (ZPM). The output of the same sensor under different bias conditions is captured twice and amplified by a channel-parallel fully differential gain stage, performing analogous subtraction. To achieve nonuniformity compensation, the current injected into the readout channel is adjusted by the channel-parallel digital-to-analog converter (DAC). A successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) performs quantization, and the chip can be used as a serial peripheral interface (SPI) slave to update register values for gain configuration, power consumption control, and nonuniformity compensation. The 180-nm CMOS prototype chip occupies an area of  $4.8~\text {mm}^{2}$  and consumes  $285~\mu $ W. In order to validate the design, a tactile sensing system is built, using the readout circuit along with a  $10\times 10$  flexible sensor array. With the techniques proposed in this article, the readout error of the sensors in array is less than 0.3&#8240;.</description></item><item><title>A Post-Bond ILV Test Method in Monolithic 3-D ICs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10666909</link><description>Monolithic 3-D (M3D) integrated circuits (ICs) have the potential to achieve significantly higher device density compared with conventional ICs. The implementation of nanoscale interlayer vias (ILVs) in M3D plays a pivotal role in achieving enhanced transistor density and increased flexibility for circuit design. However, the high integration density and aggressive scaling of the interlayer dielectric make ILVs especially prone to defects. In this article, we propose a post-bond ILV test method for the detection and diagnosis of ILVs&#8217; open faults, stuck-at faults (SAFs), and short faults in the fabrication process of M3D ICs. The proposed method is well-suited for post-bond ILV test, which can significantly save the cost and improve the yield. The HSPICE simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively detect and localize ILVs&#8217; open, stuck-at 0, stuck-at 1, and short faults. Evaluation results for M3D benchmarks demonstrate the proposed method has a quite small power-performance&#8211;area (PPA) overhead and a relatively low test-time overhead.</description></item><item><title>A 22-nm 264-GOPS/mm2 6T SRAM and Proportional Current Compute Cell-Based Computing-in-Memory Macro for CNNs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10684134</link><description>With the rise of artificial intelligence and big data applications, the general-purpose Von Neumann architecture is no longer capable of fulfilling the requirements of these application scenarios. The large amount of parallelizable and repeatable multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations in deep neural networks provide the possibility for the emergence of storage-computing integrated architectures. Current-based computation and quantization are employed to circumvent signal margin limitations on the power supply voltage of the computing unit, thereby facilitating low-power design. The proposed design is a computing-in-memory (CIM) circuit based on current sampling accumulation and applies a current-sensing analog-to-digital converter design that exhibits reduced sensitivity to parasitic capacitance compared to voltage-based analog-to-digital converters. Its power consumption is proportional to the input current, achieving higher area efficiency and energy efficiency gains. The design of the CIM circuit based on the current sampling in the 22-nm FDSOI process is fabricated with an area efficiency of 264 GOPS/mm2. The peak energy efficiency is 20.81 TOPS/W, and the inference accuracy reaches 92.11% when employed to VGG-16 under CIFAR-10 dataset.</description></item><item><title>Quasi-Adiabatic Clock Networks in 3-D Voltage Stacked Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10684299</link><description>Power delivery in three-dimensional (3-D) integrated systems poses several challenges such as high current densities, large voltage drops due to multiple levels of resistive vertical interconnect, and significant switching noise originating from transient currents within different layers. Voltage stacking is a power delivery technique that is highly compatible with 3-D integration due to the physical proximity between layers, enabling the efficient transfer of recycled current. Power noise in clock networks is, however, not inherently addressed by 3-D voltage stacking. In this brief, a quasi-adiabatic technique between multiple clock networks within 3-D voltage stacked systems is proposed. The technique exploits the proximity of the clock networks to enable mutual charging and discharging when the clock signals transition to the same voltage. During this transition, the clock distribution networks are isolated from the power grid, reducing simultaneous switching noise and current load. The maximum current is reduced by an additional 13% as compared to only voltage stacking, the maximum voltage noise is reduced by up to 72% when the clock networks are isolated from the power grids, and the clock networks pull nearly 50% less charge from the source. The proposed technique is evaluated on a 7 nm predictive technology model.</description></item><item><title>Low-Latency PAPR Reduction Architecture for Discrete Multitone Based on Approximate Midrange</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10608036</link><description>In this brief, a low-latency hardware architecture is presented for the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction in discrete multitone (DMT) systems. The state-of-the-art scheme suffers from high latency due to a series of selections in calculating the midrange of the DMT frame. To overcome the drawback, an approximate calculation of the midrange that transforms the dominant operation from the selections to the summation is proposed. Grounded on the transformation, in addition, a low-latency architecture to calculate the approximate midrange is constituted. While the selections involve negation, carry propagation, and multiplexing in every stage, the summation can be promptly done by carry-save adders (CSAs) without such manipulations. Slightly relaxing the accuracy of the midrange, as a result, the overall latency can be effectively alleviated compared with the state-of-the-art counterpart.</description></item><item><title>Unveiling the True Power of the Latched Ring Oscillator for a Unified PUF and TRNG Architecture</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10664638</link><description>This work presents a novel proposal for utilizing the latched ring oscillator (LRO) as a reconfigurable entropy source, outperforming the existing literature on both physical unclonable functions (PUFs) and true random number generators (TRNGs). The PUF working principle and mathematical model are proposed in this manuscript for the first time as well as its performance measured on FPGA. The proposed LRO-based PUF is  $2\times $  more compact than state-of-the-art PUFs on FPGA. The LRO TRNG architecture has been revisited, and an XOR-tree-based postprocessing technique has been introduced to increase the throughput from 0.76 up to 800 Mbit/s, paving the way for a novel class of high-throughput reconfigurable entropy sources. The results of NIST tests carried out also under supply voltage and temperature variations have demonstrated robust key extraction and secure random number generation for different applications. This comprehensive proposal aims to advance the state of the art in compact and high-throughput entropy sources, catering to the increasing demands of modern cryptographic hardware.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Jitter and Compact-Area Fractional-N Digital PLL With Fast Multi-Variable Calibration Using the Recursive Least-Squares Algorithm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10682595</link><description>This work presents a fractional-N digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) characterized by low jitter and small area, featuring fast multi-variable calibration. To minimize the use of silicon area, the LC voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) incorporated a compact three-turn inductor. Then, to still achieve low jitter, the bandwidth of the PLL was designed to be wide to suppress the poor phase noise of this VCO. To mitigate in-band noise, a digital-to-time converter (DTC) was employed to cancel the quantization noise (Q-noise) from the  $\Delta \Sigma $ M, and a phase selector (PSEL) was used to reduce the thermal noise of the DTC. The effectiveness of these jitter-reduction techniques relies on digital background calibration. However, conventional multi-variable calibrators (MVCs), which utilize the least-mean-squares (LMS) algorithm, suffer from a prolonged convergence time. To overcome this limitation, this work introduced a recursive least-squares (RLS)-based MVC using a dichotomous coordinate descent (DCD) algorithm that can facilitate rapid calibration at a moderate implementation cost. The proposed DCD-RLS MVC achieved a calibration time of less than  $7.2~{\mu }$ s, which was 40 times faster than the LMS MVC. The DPLL of this work achieved 88 fsrms jitter at a near-integer-N channel with 68-dBc fractional spurs. Fabricated using a 40-nm CMOS process, it occupied only a 0.12-mm2 active area and consumed 15.7 mW of power.</description></item><item><title>A Millimeter-Wave Four-Way Doherty Power Amplifier With Over-GHz Modulation Bandwidth</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10675497</link><description>This article presents the design and analysis of a millimeter-wave (mmWave) four-way Doherty power amplifier (PA), aiming to enhance the PA energy efficiency when amplifying orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based 5G new radio (NR) signals with a 10&#8211;12-dB peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). We first introduce a systematic approach to extending a conventional two-way Doherty PA to N ways, followed by a new transformer-based N-way Doherty network synthesis flow. The proposed network synthesis achieves N-way Doherty load modulation using ( $N-1$ ) transformers, one fewer transformer and thus lower loss than conventional designs. In addition, it enables the desired impedance transformation from  $R_{\text {ANT}}$  to  $R_{\text {OPT}}$  and effectively absorbs the parasitic capacitance of the power cells. Along with the Doherty network, we also introduce a high-speed adaptive biasing circuit, addressing the modulation bandwidth bottleneck in prior Doherty PA demonstrations. As proof of concept, a four-way Doherty PA prototype is implemented in the 47-GHz 5G band (band n262) using the GlobalFoundries 45-nm CMOS silicon-on-insulator (SOI) process. It achieves 24.0-dBm saturated power ( $P_{\text {SAT}}$ ), 23.7-dBm output 1-dB compression point ( $P_{1\,\text {dB}}$ ), 26.8% peak power-added efficiency ( $\text {PAE}_{\text {PEAK}}$ ), 26.3% PAE at  $P_{1\,\text {dB}}$  ( $\text {PAE}_{1\,\text {dB}}$ ), 21.7% PAE at 6-dB back-off ( $\text {PAE}_{6\,\text {dB}}$ ), and 13.1% PAE at 12-dB back-off ( $\text {PAE}_{12\,\text {dB}}$ ), demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. In the modulation tests, the PA achieves 14.1-dBm average output power ( $P_{\text {avg}}$ ) and 13.7% average efficiency ( $\text {PAE}_{\text {avg}}$ ) when amplifying a 2000-MHz 5G NR 64-QAM OFDM signal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first silicon PA demonstration of 2000-MHz channel modulation bandwidth for 5G NR OFDM along with back-off efficiency enhancement up to 12-dB back-off.</description></item><item><title>A Chain-Weaver Balanced Power Amplifier With an Embedded Impedance/Power Sensor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10679720</link><description>This article introduces an N-way chain-weaver balanced power amplifier (PA) for millimeter-wave (mm-wave) phased-array transmitters (TXs). Taking advantage of the proposed combining network, an embedded impedance/power sensor is implemented, which can be utilized for output power regulation, built-in self-test, and load-based performance optimization. The proposed PA architecture offers linearity and gain robustness under the antenna&#8217;s frequency/time-dependent voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR). In the event of impedance mismatch, the proposed PA provides N different loads equally distributed on the VSWR circle. Consequently, the performance of the PAs is the average of N PAs with N different loads, which makes this structure VSWR resilient. As a proof of concept, an eight-way chain-weaver balanced PA (BPA) is realized in 40-nm bulk CMOS technology, and it delivers 25.19-dBm  ${P} {_{\text {SAT}}}$  with 16.19% PAE. The proposed PA supports a 2-GHz 64-QAM OFDM signal with 16-dBm average power, achieving &#8722;25-dB error vector magnitude (EVM). The average EVM is better than &#8722;30.3 dB without digital pre-distortion (DPD) for an &#8220;800-MHz 256-QAM OFDM&#8221; signal while generating an average output power of 12.17 dBm. The performance of the PA is also evaluated under 1.5:1&#8211;3:1 VSWR conditions. The measured small-signal gain variation under VSWR 3:1 is &#177;0.7 dB. Moreover, assuming any frequency/time-dependent loading condition within the VSWR 3:1 circle, the proposed chain-weaver BPA achieves &lt;2.8&#176; amplitude-to-phase (AM-PM) over 3-GHz bandwidth. Besides, the embedded impedance/power sensor accuracy outperforms the state of the art. The proposed impedance sensor can measure VSWR 3:1 by the maximum angle and magnitude errors of 12.3&#176; and 0.106, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A 23.2-to-26-GHz Low-Jitter Fast-Locking Sub-Sampling PLL Based on a Function-Reused VCO-Buffer and a Type-I FLL With Rapid Phase Alignment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10684529</link><description>This article presents a type-II sub-sampling phase-locked loop (SSPLL) that achieves low jitter, low spur, and sub- $\mu $ s locking time when synthesizing millimeter-wave (mm-wave) frequencies. The proposed function-reused (FR) voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)-buffer eliminates the noise and capacitive loading from the transistors in the buffer, improving the jitter and reference (ref.) spur of the SSPLL simultaneously. It also eliminates the inductor typically employed in the high-frequency buffer, reducing the chip area. The proposed low-power fast frequency-locked loop (FLL) utilizes a phase aligner to decouple the dependency of the locking time on the initial phase error. The FLL also employs a coarse-fine-time-to-digital converter (TDC)-based type-I loop for promptly searching the control word of the switched capacitors (SCs). This article also details the analysis of the ref. spur and the phase noise (PN) performance using the FR VCO-buffer as well as the design considerations of the proposed FLL. Fabricated in 28-nm CMOS, the SSPLL occupies a compact area of 0.065 mm2 and achieves an rms jitter of 48.3 fs at 26 GHz while consuming 19.1 mW, corresponding to excellent FoMJ and FoMN of &#8722;253.5 and &#8722;277.6 dB, respectively. The measured ref. spur is &#8722;66 dBc, and the measured locking time at a frequency jump from 0.4 to 2.8 GHz is within 55 ref. cycles.</description></item><item><title>A Tri-Band Dual-Concurrent Wi-Fi 802.11be Transceiver Achieving &#8722;46 dB TX/RX EVM Floor at 7.1 GHz for a 4 K-QAM 320 MHz Signal</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643491</link><description>A high-linearity, wideband transceiver for Wi-Fi 7 to support 4 K-QAM 320 MHz bandwidth (BW) is presented and fabricated using a 14 nm Fin-FET CMOS process. To provide a high-performance local oscillator (LO) signal, a fractional-N sampling phase-locked loop with a high gain sampling phase detector (SPD) is implemented with digital-to-time converter (DTC) non-linearity calibration (NLC) based on a least mean square (LMS) algorithm. The transceiver exhibits excellent integrated phase noise (IPN) performances with a single-core voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) achieving &#8722;54.3 dBc at 7115 MHz frequency channel. IPN performance can be further improved to &#8722;55.2 dBc with a dual-core VCO. A wideband frequency operation transmitter (TX) architecture for a 5&#8211;7 GHz frequency range is introduced. It utilizes a high Q tunable switched inductor for a wideband matching network and flexible frequency adjustment. A coupling-minimized switched inductor (CMSI) is implemented to cancel out magnetic flux when two inductors are enabled simultaneously. This improves mutual inductance and the Q factor while extending the frequency tuning range. The TX error vector magnitude (TX EVM) floor is achieved up to &#8722;46.1 dB at 7.1 GHz, marking the best-reported value to date. A 5/6G receiver (RX) is designed to improve noise performance while maintaining linearity. To achieve this, a resistor attenuator block is introduced between a voltage-to-current (V2I) and a mixer, while a high signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) performance is maintained in a wider input power range. The RX error vector magnitude (RX EVM) floor is measured as &#8722;46 dB at 7.1 GHz. These results demonstrate the transceiver&#8217;s excellent performance, making it a promising solution for Wi-Fi 7 applications.</description></item><item><title>A 167- &#956;W 71.7-dB SFDR 2.4-GHz BLE Receiver Using a Passive Quadrature Front End, a Double- Sided Double-Balanced Cascaded Mixer, and a Dual-Transformer-Coupled Class-D VCO</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10701049</link><description>This article reports a 2.4-GHz Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) receiver with a number of passive-intensive RF functions to improve power efficiency and blocker resilience. It features a passive quadrature front end (QFE) built with a hybrid coupler plus two step-up transformers. They passively provide input-impedance matching, voltage gain, and single-ended-to-differential-I/Q RF generation. The four-phase RF outputs simplify the LO generator into a 2.4-GHz class-D voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) that has an intrinsically boosted output swing, averting the power-hungry divider-by-2 and LO buffers. The frequency down-conversion based on a double-sided double-balanced (DSDB) cascaded mixer offers a high passive gain to reduce the noise and power consumption of the baseband (BB) circuitry while securing a high spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) to tolerate the out-of-band (OOB) blockers. The BB circuitry is a power-efficient hybrid low-IF filter that employs a 2nd-order active-feedback notching to enhance the 1st-adjacent channel rejection. Fabricated in 28-nm CMOS, the BLE receiver exhibits a maximum RF-to-IF gain of 71 dB. The noise figure (NF) is 8.5 dB and the OOB-IIP3 is 20.1 dBm; they correspond to a 71.7-dB SFDR for a 2-MHz BLE channel and a 10-dB minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR $_{\min }$ ).

A complementary topology-based LNA is proposed with a bandpass filter (BPF) integrated into its output. The LNA includes a complementary common gate (CCG) stage to isolate the BPF from the undesired loading of the LNA&#8217;s input stage to achieve a high Q and 5- to 10-GHz tuning range. This CCG stage relaxes a trade-off between headroom and linearity. Furthermore, capacitive and transformer coupling techniques are proposed in the LNA to increase its OP1dB and second-order intermodulation (IM2) by 4 and 27 dB, respectively, compared to noncomplementary counterparts without these techniques. An automatic feedback-based back-gate biasing technique is proposed for the variable gain transconductance amplifier (VGTA) following the BPF to increase VGTA&#8217;s transconductance range for a given width over length (W/L). The receiver is fabricated in a 22-nm fully depleted silicon on insulator (FDSOI) CMOS.

The integration of bottom and top plate mixing provides HR at both the antenna node and the output of the mixer in a passive and low-loss manner. A prototype mixer-first receiver (RX) in 45-nm partially depleted silicon-on-insulator (PD-SOI) is implemented, consuming 34.8&#8211;64.5 mW for clock frequencies ( $f_{\text {LO}}$ ) of 0.25&#8211;4 GHz and occupying an active area of 0.68 mm2. Due to the passive and early HR, it achieves an exceptional in-band (IB) harmonic blocker 1-dB compression point (B1 dB) of +14/+16.5 dBm at the third/fifth harmonics at a clock frequency of 1 GHz. Notably, with blocker powers up to 5 and 6.5 dBm at  $3f_{\text {LO}}$  and  $5f_{\text {LO}}$ , respectively, the harmonic blocker noise figure (BNF) only deteriorates by 3 dB at a clock frequency of 1 GHz.

NU DT finite impulse response (FIR) acts as an anti-aliasing (AA) filter for a nonuniformly sampled signal which relaxes the subsequent ADC speed and dynamic range (DR). To save power and area and to improve linearity, the FIR filter is implemented in the current domain and shares the capacitive DAC with a subsequent asynchronous SAR ADC.

It could be improved by using tri-level cells in the IDAC, but this has not yet been realized in high-voltage (HV) CDAs due to the large difference in the common-mode levels between the DAC and the CDA. This article describes an HV CDA directly driven by an HV IDAC. By using the same output common mode for the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and CDA, the noise penalty associated with shifting the common mode is avoided. To address the distortion due to mismatch and intersymbol interference (ISI) in the IDAC, a transition-rate-balanced bidirectional real-time dynamic element matching (RTDEM) technique is also introduced. Fabricated in a 180-nm BCD process, the CDA prototype achieves a DR of 121.7 dB and a peak THD+N of -104.0 and -109.0 dB for 1- and 6-kHz inputs, respectively. It can deliver a maximum of 14 W into an 8- $\Omega $  load with a power efficiency of 90%.</description></item><item><title>A 0.00055% THD + N Class-D Audio Amplifier With Capacitive Feedforward PWM and Wide-Band Aliasing Reduction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654776</link><description>Linearity of Class-D audio amplifier based on conventional closed-loop pulsewidth modulat ion (PWM) is deteriorated by large swing of loop filter and input-dependent comparator delay. Furthermore, PWM-residual-aliasing has been revealed as a source of distortion, especially in low-power filter-less structure. This article presents a class-D amplifier (CDA) that utilizes an input-feedforward carrier to mitigate both loop filter swing and comparator delay coupling. As for the PWM-residual-aliasing, we propose a 2nd-order PWM-residual-aliasing reduction (PRAR) technique with loop compensation to achieve steeper filtering and wide-band linearity improvement. In addition, a fully passive anti-aliasing filter is used to suppress the PWM residue leakage. This CDA was fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu $ m CMOS 5 V process. It achieves a state-of-the-art total harmonic distortion plus noise (THD + N) of 0.00055% (&#8722;105.2 dB) and an FoM $_{\text {THD}\,+\,\text {N}}$  of 2119 while consuming a low quiescent current of 0.81 mA. Thanks to the wide-band-effective linearity enhancement, the THD + N across 20&#8211;20-kHz audio bandwidth is less than &#8722;100 dB.</description></item><item><title>A &#946;-Compensated NPN-Based Temperature Sensor With &#177;0.1 &#176;C (3&#963;) Inaccuracy From -55 &#176;C to 125 &#176;C and 200fJ &#183; K&#178; Resolution FoM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10645971</link><description>This article presents a CMOS temperature sensor that achieves both state-of-the-art energy efficiency and accuracy. An NPN-based front end uses two resistors to efficiently generate a PTAT and CTAT current, whose ratio is then digitized by a continuous-time (CT)  $\Delta \Sigma $ -modulator. A  $\beta $ -compensation technique is used to mitigate base current errors associated with the NPN&#8217;s finite  $\beta $ . Component mismatch and 1/f noise are mitigated by applying chopping and dynamic element matching (DEM), while the spread in  $V_{\text {BE}}$  and the ratio of the two resistors are digitally trimmed at room temperature (RT). Fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu $ m CMOS process, the sensor draws  $2.5~\mu $ A from a supply voltage ranging from 1.4 to 2.2 V. Measurements on 40 samples show that it achieves an inaccuracy of  $\pm 0.1~^{\circ }$ C ( $3\sigma $ ) from  $- 55~^{\circ }$ C to  $125~^{\circ }$ C. Furthermore, it is both highly energy efficient, with a resolution figure of merit (FoM) of  $200\text {fJ}\cdot \text {K}^{2}$ , as well as very compact, occupying only 0.07 mm2.</description></item><item><title>A 14-b BW /Power Scalable Sensor Interface With a Dynamic Bandgap Reference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10714445</link><description>This article presents a 14-bit fully dynamic sensor interface that consists of a switched-capacitor (SC)  $\Delta \Sigma $  modulator and a dynamic bandgap reference (BGR). The BGR is implemented by summing the proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT) and complementary to absolute temperature (CTAT) outputs of two PNP-based capacitive DACs. At the sampling rate, the DAC capacitors are pre-charged to the supply and then discharged for a fixed period via PNPs, thus biasing them and simultaneously sampling their base-emitter voltages. By using the modulator&#8217;s first integrator to sum the DAC outputs, a dynamic BGR can be realized, which does not need additional reference buffers or decoupling capacitors. To make the system fully dynamic, the modulator itself is based on capacitively biased (CB) floating inverter amplifiers (FIAs). Implemented in a standard 130-nm CMOS process, the sensor interface occupies an area of 0.2 mm2. It achieves an SNDR of &gt;84.5 dB over a scalable bandwidth (BW) ranging from 98 Hz to 5.9 kHz while consuming 1.7&#8211; $50.8~{\mu }$ W. Furthermore, by employing a time-domain temperature-compensation scheme, it achieves a batch-trimmed gain error of &#177;0.26% from  $ - 40~{^{\circ } }$ C to  $125~{^{\circ } }$ C.</description></item><item><title>A Fully Integrated, Domino-Like-Buffered LDO Regulator With High Power-Supply Rejection Across the Full Frequency Spectrum</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10645972</link><description>This article presents a fully integrated low-dropout (LDO) regulator that offers high power-supply rejection (PSR) across the full frequency spectrum. The proposed domino-like-buffered (DLB) design, which features multistage-cascaded buffers that progressively drive segmented pass transistors, significantly elevates non-dominant poles beyond the unity-gain frequency, thereby addressing stability challenges posed by the small output capacitor ( $C_{\mathrm {L}}$ ). This advancement allows the full exploitation of the high PSR advantage inherent in the output-pole-dominant (OPD) LDO, even with a compact on-chip  $C_{\mathrm {L}}$ . Compared to traditional LDO designs, our approach can loosen the  $C_{\mathrm {L}}$  requirement by  $2.4\times $  to maintain the same phase margin (PM). The chip, fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process, is designed to supply up to 10 mA of load current with a typical dropout voltage of 200 mV. Performance tests reveal an undershoot and overshoot of 51 and 50 mV, respectively, for a 9.8-mA load step. Despite its small on-chip  $C_{\mathrm {L}}$  of 50 pF, the DLB LDO demonstrates a worst case PSR of &#8211;28 dB across frequencies from 10 Hz to 1 GHz. It also occupies a minimal silicon area of 0.012 mm2, including the on-chip  $C_{\mathrm {L}}$ .</description></item><item><title>A High-Efficiency Envelope-Tracking Supply Modulator Using a Class-G Linear Amplifier and a Single-Inductor Dual-Input-Dual-Output Converter for 5G NR Power Amplifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10737452</link><description>This article presents a hybrid envelope tracking supply modulator (ETSM) comprising a class-G linear amplifier (LA), a single-inductor dual-input-dual-output (SIDIDO) converter and a switching amplifier (SA) for 5G new radio (NR) power amplifiers (PAs). With an additional supply rail, the class-G LA detects the amplitude of the input signal in real-time, adaptively utilizes the higher supply rail when the signal exhibits large swings, and seamlessly transitions to the lower supply rail when the signal swing decreases. This operation effectively reduces the average voltage drop of LA&#8217;s bias, sinking and sourcing current, thus improving the supply modulator (SM) efficiency at tracking bandwidth (BW) as high as 200 MHz. To mitigate the distortion induced on the output envelope due to high-speed switching between the different supply rails, a smooth transition technique is introduced for high linearity. An SIDIDO converter is employed to generate the LA&#8217;s supply rails efficiently and cost-effectively. The SM is fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process. It measures 83.4% peak efficiency when tracking the NR 200-MHz envelope with 1&#8211;5-V wide output swing range at the PA model of  $5~\Omega $  in parallel with 200 pF capacitance.</description></item><item><title>A Monolithic 12.7 W/mm2, 92% Peak-Efficiency Switched-Capacitor DC-DC Converter Using CSCR-First Topology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10706589</link><description>This article introduces the continuously scalable conversion-ratio (CSCR)-first topology for monolithic switched-capacitor voltage regulators (SCVRs), substantially improving the performance of CSCR SCVRs for higher input voltages. The topology combines fixed-ratio 2:1 stages together with a CSCR stage to limit the voltage across the CSCR stage while boosting the allowable input voltage higher without relying on stacking capacitors or transistors. Furthermore, by running the fixed-ratio and CSCR stage out of phase, the effectiveness of the CSCR&#8217;s intermediate rails and switches is doubled, thus reducing the required transistor footprint. This article discusses a scalable implementation of this technology, leveraging an array-able voltage regulator (VR) core that encompasses the required powertransistors, capacitors, as well as local signal generation circuits, that is then combined with a single centralized controller to meet the current demands of small and large power domains. Measurement results of the VR, realized on Intel 16 technology using high-density metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors, demonstrate the transient performance and reliability of the proposed approach, while showcasing a record 12.7 W/mm2 peak power density for monolithic voltage conversion, and 92% peak efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A 12-to-1&#8211;1.8-V Hybrid DC-DC Converter With a Charge Converging Phase for Inductor Current Reduction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10679735</link><description>This article presents a 12-V-input and 1&#8211;1.8-V-output hybrid buck converter featuring a charge converging phase (CCP-HB). During this phase, charges from multiple paths converge into one flying capacitor, increasing the charge accumulated on it. Such charge gets transferred to the output in parallel with the inductor during the other phase, and thus, the average inductor current is reduced to consistently less than half of the load current across the entire voltage conversion ratio (VCR) range. This approach significantly reduces dc resistance (DCR) conduction loss and mitigates the reliance on a bulky inductor. Besides, a stacked switched-capacitor network (SCN) is adopted between the input and the output to reduce voltage stress on power switches for better efficiency. The converter was fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu $  m BCD process, utilizing only 5- and 1.8-V NMOS as power switches. Measurement results show that the converter achieves a peak efficiency of 95.4% with a small DCR of 10.5 m $\Omega $ . Moreover, the CCP enables the use of a compact inductor as small as the 2016 series ( $2{\times }1.6{\times }1$  mm3) with a large DCR of 57 m $\Omega $  and a low saturation current of 3.6 A to deliver a full load of up to 5 A. The converter still maintains a peak efficiency of 94.7%, and the current density of total passive volume is up to 685 A/cm3.</description></item><item><title>A Power-Efficient Single-Mode Buck-Boost DC&#8211;DC Converter With Bilaterally Symmetrical Hybrid Topology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10670527</link><description>This article presents a bilaterally symmetrical hybrid buck-boost (BS-HBB) dc-dc converter designed for battery-to-3.4-V power conversion. Traditional buck-boost converters suffer from high inductor currents ( $I_{\text {L}}$ ) compared to load currents, resulting in considerable conduction losses. While many hybrid designs incorporating flying capacitors have attempted to reduce  $I_{\text {L}}$ , these topologies often struggle with non-smooth transitions between modes, the inability to reduce  $I_{\text {L}}$  in either the buck or boost region, and inefficient high-voltage switches with poor ON-resistances. In contrast, the BS-HBB topology proposed in this work enables seamless single-mode operation throughout its entire voltage conversion range. This converter not only achieves lower  $I_{\text {L}}$  in both buck and boost regions but also utilizes low-voltage CMOS switches that exhibit low ON-resistance, thereby enhancing power efficiency. The BS-HBB chip was fabricated using a 180-nm CMOS process. Designed to supply up to 1 A, this chip outputs a voltage of 3.4 V from an input voltage ranging from 2.7 to 4.2 V. A peak efficiency of 96.9% (95.5%) was achieved using an inductor having a dc resistance of 9 m $\Omega $  (250 m $\Omega $ ). This work also successfully validated the single-mode operation by demonstrating a flawless output voltage under continuously fluctuating input voltage.</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid Single-Inductor Bipolar-Output Converter With a Concise PWM Control for AMOLED Displays</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10682814</link><description>This article presents a compact single-inductor bipolar-output (SIBO) converter for active-matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED) displays. Addressing the demand for a large load capacity within a limited form factor, we propose a hybrid SIBO converter featuring two flying capacitors ( $C_{\mathrm {F}}$ s) which are introduced to further reduce the inductor current ( ${I} _{\mathrm {L}}$ ) and voltage stress of power switches. The proposed converter mainly consists of two operation states that determine the energy charging and distribution, respectively, when the two outputs have the same load currents. To address potential loading imbalance, two auxiliary phases are incorporated into the main operation states. A concise PWM control strategy, consisting of a common-mode (CM) loop and differential-mode (DM) loop, is also proposed for bipolar output regulation with fast transient responses. The converter is fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu $ m BCD process and the measured peak efficiency reaches 94.5% using a  $2.5\times 2.0\times 1.2$  mm3 inductor. Furthermore, the converter achieves 3.99 W/mm2 on-die power density with the total off-chip components occupying 15.32-mm3 volume, demonstrating that this design provides a compact solution for AMOLED displays.</description></item><item><title>An Integrated Dual-Side Series/Parallel Piezoelectric Resonator-Based DC-DC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10623621</link><description>The use of piezoelectric resonators (PRs) as energy storage elements in dc-dc converters has captured considerable interest, in part due to the ultra-thin planner form factor, excellent frequency/volume scaling properties, and high coupling and quality factors offered by PRs. Traditional PR-based converters, however, exhibit performance diminishment at low voltage conversion ratios (VCRs), rendering them less appealing to applications that require low VCR operation. This article presents a dual-side series/parallel PR (DSPPR)-based hybrid dc-dc converter that integrates two 2:1 switched capacitor (SC) circuits into the operation of the baseline PR-based converter, enabling efficient conversion at low VCRs (VCRs  $\leq 0.125$ ), while reducing the active area by up to  $23\times $  compared to a baseline discrete converter.

To sustain reliable power transfer against inductive-link fluctuation, a hybrid voltage-/current-mode (V/CM) receiver (RX) is proposed to provide CM recovery when the coupling becomes weak for VM operation. To optimize the end-to-end (E2E) efficiency, a digital pulsewidth modulation (PWM)-based global power regulation technique is proposed, which allows a fully on/off operation of the three-mode power amplifier (PA) at the transmitter (TX) side and fast load-transient responses. Moreover, the system adopts a fully integrated voltage-sensing load-shift-keying (LSK) demodulation technique, which replaces conventional current sensing methods with a streamlined implementation and reduced power consumption. Both prototype TX and RX chips were fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS process. The proposed system, powered by a 1.8-V supply at TX, realizes a regulated 1.8-V dc output at RX. With the help of the hybrid V/CM RX, the proposed system achieves an up-to-150% WPT range extension compared to VM-only operation and an up to 7.2-cm WPT range. Benefiting from the global digital-PWM regulation, it achieves up to 72.3% E2E efficiency over the loading range from 0.18 to 81 mW. A 10- $\mu $ s load-transient recovery is also attained at a  $164{\times }$  load step with a 110-mV undershoot and unnoticeable overshoots.</description></item><item><title>98.7% Efficiency 1200&#8211;48 V LLC Converter Using Triple Step-Down Converter With One-Inductor Technique Compliant With EVSE Level 1</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10628040</link><description>The proposed LLC flyback converter converts the 1200 V of the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) into a 48 V battery system. The triple step-down converter with one inductor (TSDC-OL) technique converts 1200&#8211;400 V, and the transformer steps it down to 48 V. The zero-voltage switching (ZVS) mechanism is used for each switching operation and the equivalent on-resistance  $R_{\text {ON}}$  is reduced to 1/4.5 times that of the existing technology. The proposed reference voltage compensator (RVC) can accurately maintain the charging current at 25 A. Since the left half-plane zero error amplifier (LZEA) contributes to the LHP zero, it ensures the stability of the RVC and prevents periodic variations. When the battery charges to 48 V, the operation switches to constant voltage (CV) mode via burst operation control (BOC) comparison with a leakage-based ultralow  $I_{Q}$  comparator (LUC) with 2 nA  $I_{Q}$  leakage. Finally, the proposed LLC flyback converter meets EVSE level 1 requirements in constant current (CC) mode and achieves 98.7% efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A 2.08-mW 64.4-dB SNDR 400-MS/s Pipelined- SAR ADC Using Mismatch and PVT Variation Tolerant Dynamically Biased Ring Amplifier in 8 nm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10710178</link><description>In this article, we introduce a new dynamically biased ring amplifier that is tolerant to mismatch and PVT variation without requiring bias calibration, and we verify it in a 12-bit 400-MS/s pipelined-SAR analog-to-digital converter (ADC), fabricated in an 8-nm FinFET process. Our novel ring amplifier solves the biasing issues inherent in conventional ring amplifiers while maintaining the benefits of high gain, slew-based charging, and nearly rail-to-rail output swing. We also propose a technique to enhance the DC accuracy of a switched-capacitor common-mode feedback (CMFB) without consuming additional power, which we named feedback voltage sampling CMFB. Furthermore, we introduce a full-scale matching residue amplification technique for the prototype pipelined-SAR ADC to utilize the top-plate input sampling for the first-stage SAR ADC, resulting in faster and lower power conversion. The prototype ADC demonstrates the robustness of our dynamically biased ring amplifier to mismatch and PVT variation without any interstage gain, bias, or reference calibration, and achieves 64.4-dB SNDR and 77.6-dB SFDR for a low-frequency input while consuming 2.08 mW. This measured performance is equivalent to Walden and Schreier FoMs of 3.8 fJ/conversion $\cdot $ step and 174.2 dB, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A 12-GS/s 12-b 4&#215; Time-Interleaved ADC Using Input-Independent Timing Skew Calibration With Global Dither Injection and Linearized Input Buffer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10747403</link><description>This article presents a 12-GS/s 12-bit  $4{\times }$  time-interleaved (TI) pipelined analog-to-digital converter (ADC), which utilizes a global dither injection (GDI) scheme to facilitate an input-independent background timing skew calibration. The GDI scheme adds dithers into the input signal of the push-pull source follower (PP-SF) in the input buffer (IBF), avoiding undetectable skews in conventional local dither injection (LDI) schemes. Meanwhile, the perturbations between the input signal and dither are mitigated by cross-coupled capacitive networks. This work also significantly improves the efficiency of the interleaver using the following techniques: first, the PP-SF-based IBF is linearized by a self-adaptive current compensation (SACC), achieving high linearity under 1.2-V low supply voltage headroom. Second, the speed of the 12-bit channel is lifted to 3 GS/s in 28-nm CMOS using a sturdy ring amplifier (SRingAmp) with feedforward (FF), which enables a nonhierarchical interleaver with a small interleaving factor of  $4{\times }$ . The time-interleaved ADC attains a 54.1-dB SNDR and a 66.0-dB SFDR under a near-Nyquist input with 179.8-mW power consumption, translating into a Walden figure of merit (FoM) of 36.2 fJ/conversion step and a Schreier FoM of 159.3 dB.</description></item><item><title>A &#8722;90-dBFS-IM3, &#8722;164-dBFS/Hz-NSD, 700-MHz-Bandwidth Continuous-Time Pipelined ADC With Digital Cancellation of DAC Errors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10715661</link><description>This paper describes a continuous-time (CT) pipelined analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that represents a technology push along both&#8212;third-order distortion and noise&#8212;dimensions.

Therefore, this paper proposes CorTile, a scalable neuromorphic processing core designed for cortical simulation. We propose a hybrid-mode router that supports Remote Unicast and Local Broadcast (RULB) routing method, leveraging the high local connectivity and low distal connectivity observed in cortical models. This approach achieves reductions of 36.7% in average router load, 40.7% in peak load, 51.2% in average link traffic, 41.7% in peak traffic, respectively, compared to conventional routing methods. Additionally, the proposed Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM)-based Sparse Connection Memory (TSCM) architecture leads to 87.1% reduction in area and a 62.7% reduction in power consumption. These approaches effectively decrease communication traffic and mitigate the quadratic increase in memory requirements, achieving linear growth instead, thus achieving scalability. The proposed CorTile is simulated using UMC 40-nm CMOS process, occupying an area of 5.15 mm2, supporting a maximum of 8k neurons and 64M synapses. Evaluated using a typical macaque cortex model, it consumes 8.25 mW, with the router operating at 200 MHz and the other modules at 100 MHz. This design achieves an average router load of 12.33 Mpackets/s and peak link traffic of 21.16 MB/s. Thanks to the scalability of the proposed processing core that can be tiled into many-core processors, it paves the way for chiplets and multiple chip integration towards a brain-scale neuromorphic computing system.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Complexity Soft-Output Massive MIMO Detector With Near-Optimum Performance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10623240</link><description>In massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection, the likelihood ascent search (LAS) algorithm is well-known for its near-optimum performance and low complexity. It employs gradient descent to enhance the performance of suboptimal MIMO detectors, specifically the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) algorithm. In this paper, we introduce several techniques to improve the MMSE-based LAS (MMSE-LAS) algorithm in terms of both complexity and performance. To reduce complexity, the MMSE is first replaced with the low-complexity optimized coordinate descent (OCD) algorithm at the cost of negligible performance loss. Then, the conventional OCD and LAS algorithms are optimized for better computation reuse. Besides, we derive a new soft-output computation formula for LAS to improve the coded performance. The proposed modulation-based successive gradient descent (MB-SGD) detector outperforms MMSE-LAS and the latest work in terms of either complexity or performance for  $64\times 8$  and  $128\times 8$  LDPC-coded MIMO systems with multiple modulations from QPSK to 256-QAM.

The SS circuits can significantly enhance the output power under the same vibration excitation. Some SS solutions have also been developed for an inductive electromagnetic (EM) source by referring to its capacitive PEH counterpart and taking a reciprocal design. This paper proposes a synchronized current inversion and energy extraction (SCIEE) circuit for EM energy harvesting (EMEH). SCIEE utilizes two switched capacitive branches to carry out the synchronized current inversion at the electromotive voltage negative-to-positive zero-crossing instants and energy extraction at the voltage positive-to-negative zero-crossing instants. By inverting the transducer current, SCIEE increases the torque/force inside the transducer to extract more energy from the relative movement between magnets and coils. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed circuit is suitable for use with an EM transducer, whose quality factor is relatively large. Experiments compared the output power of three harvesting schemes: SCIEE, synchronized switch energy extraction (SSEE), and conventional pulse-width modulation (PWM)-based harvesting scheme. When using the same prototyped EM harvester under the same mechanical excitation, SCIEE can harvest 38% more power, compared with the cutting-edge SSEE circuit for EMEH; and 900% more power, compared with the PWM-based harvesting scheme.</description></item><item><title>An Energy-Efficient CNN/Transformer Hybrid Neural Semantic Segmentation Processor With Chunk-Based Bit Plane Data Compression and Similarity-Based Token-Level Skipping Exploitation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10720334</link><description>A novel energy-efficient semantic segmentation (SS) processor is proposed for achieving high system energy efficiency on mobile devices. 1) Excessive external memory access and 2) a large amount of redundant computation hinders energy-efficient SS acceleration. Three key features enable real-time energy-efficient CNN/ViT hybrid SS. A new compression method named Chunk-based Bit Plane Compression (CBPC) reduces the memory footprint and energy consumption due to external memory access. CBPC enhances compression ratio by leveraging the high inter-token similarity of feature maps and applying bit plane compression in sign-magnitude data representation, using chunk-wise low-bit plane shared bias. The proposed CBPC encoder/decoder supports CBPC with minimum area overhead. Additionally, the Similar Token Coarse Skipping (STCS) Core enhances the throughput and reduces the computation power by eliminating redundant computations.

First, we have presented the input impedance model of an N-stage CMOS RF-DC rectifier by applying  $\Delta $ -Y transform to the input coupling capacitors and including a nonlinear input resistance of the MOS transistors. Based on the developed model, we have carried out the steady-state and transient analyses of the N-stage RF-DC rectifier. According to the analysis results, the input power sensitivity increases as the RF-DC rectifier contains more rectifier cells. However, integrating a large number of rectifier cells normally reduces the passive amplification gain of the matching network and thus may not bring the desired results. In this paper, we propose the RF-DC rectifier adopting a metal ground shield plane beneath the input coupling capacitors thereby incorporating as many as 570 rectifier cells without lowering the passive amplification gain. By doing so, the 884-MHz, 570-stage RF-DC rectifier implemented in a 28nm CMOS process achieves the measured input power sensitivity of &#8722;41.8dBm at 1V output DC voltage. The measured recharging time from 0.88V to 1.0V is 11.1 seconds when the storage capacitor is 1nF.</description></item><item><title>Sequential Bayesian Inference and Monte-Carlo Sampling Using Memristor Stochasticity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10704776</link><description>In this paper, we study the stochastic state trajectory and conductance distributions of memristors under periodic pulse excitation. Our results, backed by experimental evidence, reveal that practical memristors exhibit a  $1/f^{2}$  Brownian noise power spectrum. Based on this, we develop a Memristive Distribution Generator (MDG) circuit that produces tunable analog distributions by exploiting the physical stochasticity of memristors. By encoding the prior distributions of Bayesian problems in the physical output samples of these circuits, we demonstrate that Monte-Carlo sampling can be devised without knowledge of the analytical output distribution of the memristor. Using examples of 1-D Bayesian linear regression and a dynamic 2-D nonlinear localisation problem, we show how MDG circuits can act as a tunable source of randomness, efficiently representing distributions of interest. Our results, obtained using Pt/TiO2/Pt memristors, validate the use of memristor-based MDGs for implementing probabilistic algorithms.</description></item><item><title>An Online Monitoring Method for Capacitor Condition of Cascaded H-Bridge STATCOM Based on Sensorless Capacitor Voltage Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638768</link><description>In order to achieve the stable dc voltage support during the process of reactive power compensation, the cells within the chain of CHB STATCOM are equipped with high-capacity capacitors (along with dc voltage detection devices). However, over time, these capacitors exhibit varying degrees of aging, leading to discrepancies in capacitance reduction or variations in the equivalent series resistance (ESR) values, which not only complicates the task of balancing the capacitor voltages across the chain&#8217;s cells, but also increases the risk of device overvoltage. To address the problem, an online monitoring method for capacitor conditions based on sensorless capacitor voltage detection is proposed. Initially, the mapping relationship between the capacitance and its corresponding voltages is established on basis of the cell&#8217;s switching state and the principle of energy conservation. Subsequently, the capacitance estimation algorithm is constructed based on the data from sensorless capacitor voltage detection. In addition, the factors contributing to capacitance estimation errors are analyzed, and potential solutions are offered. This method facilitates the detection of each cell&#8217;s dc voltage and capacitance variations, while eliminating additional costs related to dc sensors and its associated communication devices. Ultimately, the effectiveness of the proposed online monitoring method is verified by MatLab/Simulink simulation and the StarSim experimental platform.</description></item><item><title>Investigation and Design of Ultra-Wideband Resistive-Reactive Series of Continuous Inverse Modes Power Amplifier With Input Second-Harmonic Manipulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10721221</link><description>In this article, the analysis of a series of continuous inverse modes power amplifiers (PAs) with resistive-reactive is presented under the impact of input nonlinearity. Theoretical analysis manifests that, different from the conventional extended series of inverse continuous modes (ESCIMs), where the source second harmonic is short-circuited, the second harmonic generated by input nonlinearity can promote and maintain the performance of PAs over a wide frequency band within a flexible impedance range. Furthermore, in the presence of input nonlinearity, a new load design space is reshaped and combined with the source second-harmonic manipulation space generated by input nonlinearity to collaboratively achieve optimal ESCIMs PAs performance. Subsequently, based on the proposed design theory, an ultra-wideband PA is designed, implemented, and fabricated using a two-stage cascaded square ring stub-loaded resonator microstrip bandpass filter architecture with wideband response and a commercially available 10-W gallium nitride (GaN) device. The measurement results show that in the frequency band range of 0.4-4.0 GHz with a relative bandwidth of 160%, a drain efficiency of 55.3-73.8%, an output power of 38.9-41.9 dBm, and a gain of 8.9-11.9 dB have been achieved under saturated output power. Measurement results confirm the theoretical findings reported in this paper.</description></item><item><title>A Dynamic Capacitance Matching (DCM)-Based Current Response Algorithm for Signal Line RC Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10701569</link><description>This paper proposes a dynamic capacitance matching (DCM)-based RC current response algorithm for calculating the current waveform of a signal line without performing transistor level SPICE simulation. Specifically, unlike previous methods such as current source model, driver linear representation, waveform functional fitting or equivalent load capacitance, our algorithm does not rely on fixed reduced model of standard-cell driver or RC load. Instead, it approaches the current waveform dynamically by computing current responses of the target driver for various load scenarios. Besides, we creatively use symbolic expression to combine the y-parameter of RC network with the pre-characterized driver library in order to perform capacitance matching and simulate current waveform by considering the Miller and over/undershoot effects. Our algorithm is experimentally verified on 40nm CMOS technology and has been adopted by latest commercial tool for different nodes (from 180nm to 3nm). Experimental results show that our algorithm has only about 1% error compared with SPICE golden results while the runtime is improved by 50 to 200 times, which demonstrates overwhelming capability in calculating timing, power and electromigration of signal lines.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Single- and Dual-Band Rectifiers With Wide Range of Load Variations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10754630</link><description>With the development of low-power devices, wireless power transfer and wireless energy harvesting techniques become increasingly important. As the critical component, the rectifier is required to maintain good performance under different scenarios. Most existing works focus on the improvement in bandwidth and input power range with a constant load value. However, the impedance of the driven devices cannot be predicted in practical applications, resulting in performance deterioration. Thus, an adaptive signal diversion approach is proposed to diver the injected signal to the parallel high and low load branches with distinct reactance compensation networks. This topology can be applied to both single- and dual-band rectifiers with simplicity and scalability in design. For validation, two rectifiers are designed, fabricated, and measured. The rectifier operating at 2.4 GHz achieves a load range of 0.16 k $\Omega $  to 6 k $\Omega $  (load variation ratio of 37.5). The dual-band rectifier working at 2.49 GHz and 5.14 GHz achieves load ranges from 0.21 to 5.4 k $\Omega $  (load variation ratio of 25.7) and from 0.07 to 4.2 k $\Omega $  (load variation ratio of 60), respectively. It can be found that the proposed rectifiers exhibit the largest load variation ratio with the minimum number of diodes and load compared with the state-of-the-art works.</description></item><item><title>Bidirectional High Step-Up/Down DC/DC Converter With a Coupled Inductor and Switched Capacitor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10651604</link><description>This article is a study of bidirectional DC/DC converter for the energy storage systems. Non-isolated interleaved bidirectional high step-up/down (NIBH) DC/DC converter consists of a coupled inductor and a switched capacitor. The NIBH converter has important features such as low ripple current on the low voltage side, low cost, low component count, high voltage conversion ratio, low voltage stress, and soft switching operation of switches. Two coupled inductors are connected in parallel to the low voltage side to have low ripple current and increase the turns ratio to achieve high step-up/step-down voltage gain. The switched capacitors can be stacked in series with the high voltage side to achieve high voltage gain, and the active clamp circuit enables the switches to reduce conduction and switching losses with low voltage stress and soft switching operation. To verify the theoretical analysis and performance of the proposed converter, a 650W prototype circuit was implemented in the laboratory.</description></item><item><title>Analysis of Off-Resonant Flexible Tertiary Coils in Biomedical Implants for Back Telemetry Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10607967</link><description>A systematic design technique of flexible tertiary coil in a wireless power transfer (WPT) system for back telemetry detection is presented. The detection (tertiary) coil is co-planar with the primary coil and receives the backscattered load shift keying (LSK) data from the secondary stage. Tertiary coil parameters such as the number of turns, compensation capacitance, and quality factor are determined to maximize the link gain and the end-to-end (E2E) efficiency. The analysis is validated through SPICE simulations and measurements. A novel area-saving inner-tertiary coil is further proposed and critically compared with traditional outer-tertiary coil. The RF electromagnetic radiation or Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) value of the coils was evaluated for possible health hazards using 3D head models and ANSYS/HFSS finite element software. In comparison to a heuristic outer-tertiary coil design, the primary-secondary (operating) distance is improved by 50%, from 12 mm to 18 mm. At an operating distance of 15 mm, the link gain and E2E efficiency are improved by ~207% and ~18%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Firefly: A Versatile Experimental Platform for Oscillator-Based Ising Machines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10665921</link><description>Oscillator-based Ising machines (OIMs) are specialized in solving combinatorial optimization problems, that can be represented as the Ising model. They exploit the interaction of (integrated) electrical oscillators in a configurable network for the computation. Such systems naturally evolve towards a ground state, which forms a solution to the problem quickly and energy efficiently. This work presents the design of our 400 oscillator node chip in a 28nm technology. The focus is on the analog oscillator and coupler circuits, which determine the computing performance. Weighted optimization problems with up to 6-bit resolution can be solved within just 714ns. A comprehensive experimental analysis based on a versatile benchmark set is provided. We discuss the computation process and investigate the impact of multiple factors including the randomness of the initial oscillator phases, the frequency mismatch, the coupling strength, and the locking strength. A small range of parameters like the coupling strength and locking strength exists, which show the highest accuracy. Extensive benchmarks achieve an accuracy compared to the best-known solution of more than 94.5% for problems with equal weights and 89.8% for weighted problems. This emphasizes, that carefully designed oscillator-based Ising machines (OIMs) are not only fast, but can find solutions near the global optimum.</description></item><item><title>Reconfigurable and Energy-Efficient Architecture for Deploying Multi-Layer RNNs on FPGA</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10721225</link><description>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are extensively applied in sequence prediction tasks such as sentiment analysis, and machine translation. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) are popular recurrent layers for mitigating gradient vanishing challenges.

Thus, it is essential to explore architecture based on novel devices and computing paradigms to fulfill data-centric applications, such as artificial intelligence. In this paper, we propose a balanced symmetry ternary (BST) fully digital in-MRAM computing macro (BSTCIM) using hybrid voltage-gated spin-orbit torque magnetic tunnel junctions (VGSOT-MTJ) and gate-all-around carbon nanotube field-effect-transistors (GAA-CNTFET) technology. The overall computing is based on the highest efficiency multi-bit ternary system. BSTCIM includes a ternary dot product (TDP) unit with 4 GAA-CNTFETs and 2 VGSOT-MTJs achieving TDP operation without complex logic circuits. The multi-bit ternary multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operation is realized through the proposed ternary adder tree and ternary post adder which accumulate TDP results within the digital domain enabling high accuracy neural network inference. Furthermore, due to the advantages of BST, ternary signed MAC is more easily performed compared to TBCIM macros that adapt 2&#8217;s complement or separate signed bit calculations. BSTCIM with 288 kb is simulated, achieving throughput and energy efficiency of 0.72 TOPS and 54.5 TOPS/W, respectively, at a 0.6 V supply voltage and 1.15 TOPS and 33.7 TOPS/W, respectively at a 0.8 V supply voltage with 8b-IN, 8b-W, and 20b-OUT.

Traditional methods of calculating switching loss have exhibited inconsistencies when applied to designs incorporating GaN HEMTs and various operational conditions. Consequently, there is a pressing need for more precise methods to estimate switching loss in GaN HEMTs. This paper introduces two distinct switching loss calculation models, presented both as empirical formulas and analytical models. These models take into account the influence of critical parasitic inductances and junction temperature. The comparative analysis of these two calculation methods with the experimental results is provided to demonstrate their efficacy. Furthermore, the impact of nonideal factors, such as power loop parasitic inductance, common-source inductance, and junction temperature, is assessed.</description></item><item><title>Advancing Circuit Transient Response Macromodeling: From Conventional Neural Networks to Siamese-LSTM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10607935</link><description>Macromodeling is a crucial technique to enhance a circuit design.

By analyzing the frequency response of different types of Doherty power combiner, a novel voltage-combined Doherty LMN with shorted TL and corresponding design procedure are proposed to achieve broadband power back-off (PBO) bandwidth and compact footprint. A compact quadrature hybrid coupler without lumped capacitor is also devised to generate wideband quadrature signals. To improve PBO efficiency, an envelope detector is adopted to produce adaptive DC bias for auxiliary path. For the proof of concept, a dual-driver Doherty PA is implemented in 65-nm bulk CMOS technology with a chip size of 0.42 mm2 including all pads. The PA achieves a 3-dB small-signal  $S_{21}$  bandwidth from 21.1 to 30.4 GHz and a 1-dB saturated output power ( $P_{\text {sat}}$ ) bandwidth from 24 to 30 GHz. The measured  $P_{\text {sat}}$ , output 1-dB compression point ( $OP_{\text {1dB}}$ ), peak power-added efficiency (PAE) and PAE at 6dB-PBO are 20.0 dBm, 19.1 dBm, 24.6% and 20.0% at 27 GHz, respectively.

Traditional REC methods have difficulty identifying complex radar signals in the present day. Inspired by biology, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gradually gained widespread attention due to their low power characteristics. Compared with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), SNNs are more suitable for application in the field of REC. The reason is that SNN can not only maintain higher accuracy in the presence of noise interference, but also reduce the power consumption of mobile devices. However, it is challenging to make full use of the input sparsity of radar emitter signals and the weight sparsity of pruned SNN models. In this paper, a 28-nm neuromorphic processor for REC named NeuroREC is proposed. It uses matrix compression algorithms to store sparse weights on chip, and designs corresponding spike detection circuits for this purpose. As a single-core design, we propose a ping-pong running mechanism to alleviate the imbalance between IO throughput and peak performance. Two SNN models for classifying RadioML2016.b and RadioML2018.a datasets are deployed on the chip, achieving competitive accuracy with only 8 timesteps, and demonstrating better robustness than CNN. Fabricated in 28-nm CMOS process, NeuroREC runs at frequencies ranging from 22.5MHz to 744MHz. Under specific sparsity conditions, it can reach an energy efficiency of 7.22TSOP/W for 8-bit weight.</description></item><item><title>Impact of Non-Idealities on the Behavior of Probabilistic Computing: Theoretical Investigation and Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10690181</link><description>Probabilistic computing is a promising computational paradigm that harnesses the inherent stochasticity of devices to tackle problems that can benefit from stochastic-driven search. A probabilistic bit (p-bit), the workhorse of probabilistic computing, is popularly implemented using energy-efficient low-barrier nanomagnets, highly-scaled transistors, and unstable memory elements. These implementations are prone to process- and environmental-induced variations and aging-induced non-idealities. These non-idealities can manifest as unwanted bias in a p-bit and its incoming signals, impacting the figures of merit of probabilistic computing. For the first time, this work systematically investigates this aspect of probabilistic computing. First, we investigate the behavior of a non-ideal p-bit using an analytical model proposed in this work and corroborate the results using numerical computation. Then, we examine the impact of these non-idealities on the functionality and robustness of the probabilistic computing using Boolean logic implementation and image completion networks in the forward and backward modes of operation, respectively. For Boolean logic implementation, the weight matrix is found to be robust enough to allow p-bit network to retain its intended functionality despite non-idealities. Moreover, we show that there can be canceling effects of non-idealities, which can potentially be utilized in compensating reliability-induced degradation in a p-bit network. Additionally, using 1T-1MTJ-based p-bit implementation and SPICE simulations, we illustrate the applicability of the proposed model in analyzing and assessing the impact of non-idealities and process-induced variations on a p-bit network. We also demonstrate that statistical analysis techniques, such as Monte Carlo simulations, can help derive application-dependent constraints on the non-ideality of p-bits. These constraints will serve as critical design criteria for future p-bit implementations.</description></item><item><title>Scalable Double Crosstalk Canceling Digital Predistortion for MIMO Transmitters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10634549</link><description>Nonlinear distortion becomes more severe due to strong crosstalk between different transmitter branches in multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) arrays. A double crosstalk canceling (DCC) digital predistortion (DPD) algorithm is proposed in this paper to solve the power amplifier (PA) nonlinearity, nonlinear and linear crosstalk problems in MIMO transmitters. The algorithm includes two canceling modules to estimate and cancel the nonlinear and linear crosstalk respectively. We propose two different methods named iterative training (IT) and reference signal training (RST), to estimate the crosstalk coupling coefficients. Furthermore, we propose a scalable DCC single-input-single-output (SDCC-SISO) structure. The structure can easily generalize the proposed DCC DPD algorithm from  $2\times 2$  to larger scale MIMO. Simulated and measured results show that the DCC DPD algorithm outperforms other DPD algorithms at strong nonlinear and linear crosstalk levels for  $2\times 2$  MIMO case and its coefficients are reduced by nearly half or more compared with other algorithms. Furthermore, we conduct simulation experiments to test the performance of the SDCC-SISO DPD algorithm for the 3, 4, 5 and 10-branch MIMO cases. SDCC-SISO DPD always maintains good linearization performance and low complexity. Simulation results prove the excellent scalability of SDCC-SISO structure, which is difficult to be achieved by other DPD methods.</description></item><item><title>A Single-Ended PAM-4 Transmitter Using Unstacked Tailless CML Driver and Coefficient-Corrected FFE for Memory Interfaces</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10665897</link><description>This paper presents a single-ended four-level pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM-4) transmitter using an unstacked tailless current-mode logic (CML) driver for memory interfaces. Compared with the voltage-mode (VM) driver commonly used for single-ended memory interfaces, the proposed CML driver has stable termination for impedance matching and a small pre-driver with low dynamic power consumption, which allow the transmitter to achieve a higher data rate and a better total energy efficiency. The unstacked driver structure with an auxiliary leg and a current calibration scheme leads to high PAM-4 linearity by compensating for channel-length modulation that causes current source variation while occupying a small area. The strength of the feed-forward equalization (FFE) distorted by channel-length modulation is also compensated by an additional pulse of the proposed coefficient-corrected equalization. A prototype chip fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process has an area of 0.0172 mm $^{2}{}$ .

While simplified numerical models can reduce the computational burden, they are unable to guarantee fidelity in highly nonlinear systems. To accelerate the detailed numerical simulation while maintaining high fidelity, this paper proposes a novel data-driven approach to modeling PE converters based on neural ordinary differential equations (ODE). This model eliminates the iterative solution of nonlinear equations by being data-driven and thus accelerates the simulation. In addition, to enhance the model fidelity, this approach incorporates prior knowledge about numerical ODE solvers into the model structures and distinguishes multi-scale characteristics from the dataset using a specific filtered MSE loss function. Experiment results demonstrate significant improvement of calculation speed and reduction of computational overheads compared to the detailed numerical methods.

However, due to the imperfect fabrication, RRAM cells suffer from the variations, which make the values in RRAM cells deviate from the target values so that the accuracy of the RRAM-based NN accelerator degrades significantly. Moreover, in a practical hardware design of RRAM-based NN accelerators, if the number of wordlines and bitlines in a crossbar array activated at the same time increases, ADCs with a high resolution are required and the power consumption of ADC increases. This paper proposes a novel methodology to mitigate the impact of variations in RRAM-based neural network accelerators. The methodology includes a unary-based non-uniform quantization method and a variation-aware operation unit (OU) based framework. The unary-based non-uniform quantization method equalizes the significance of weights stored in each RRAM cell to reduce the impact of variations. The variation-aware OU-based framework activates only RRAM cells in the same OU at the same time, which reduces the power consumption of ADCs. Additionally, the framework introduces three methods, including OU skipping, OU recombination, and OU compensation, to further mitigate the impact of variations. The experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art among four NN models on two datasets with 2-bit cell resolution.</description></item><item><title>A Wide Tracking Range Heterodyne Phase-Tracking Receiver With 1-bit Phase-Domain Demodulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10599529</link><description>This paper describes a crystal-less heterodyne phase-tracking receiver (PTRX) architecture that offers a wide tracking range, flexible yet robust loop dynamics, and a 1-bit demodulation output. Unlike the sliding-IF PTRX, a nested integer-N bang-bang phase-locked loop (BBPLL) is implemented within the PTRX to enhance the tracking range by taking the output of an intermediate-frequency (IF) voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) as an input. The BBPLL also performs phase-to-digital conversion with an oversampled 1-bit digital output. To further improve the demodulation performance, a dual-path injection method with extra control inversion is employed. In the proposed heterodyne PTRX, a phase offset over frequency variation is minimized in the IF mixer. As a result, the mixer-based phase detector in the proposed PTRX has lower gain variation over frequency changes even with a type-I loop, resulting in stable loop dynamics. In this paper, the frequency-tracking and phase-tracking properties of the PTRX are analyzed in view of the jitter transfer and jitter tolerance characteristics of a clock-and-data recovery (CDR) circuit for the first time. The proposed 2.4-GHz PTRX is implemented in 65-nm CMOS, consuming 3.0 mW from a 0.9-V supply.

For achieving FD-SBD signaling, the transceiver employs a resistor-transconductance (R-Gm) hybrid-based subtractor to enable concurrent transmission and reception of non-return to zero (NRZ) data stream on a single differential channel. The transmitter of a conventional current-mode R-Gm hybrid transmits through a split termination, which effectively reduces the impedance at the transmitting node and increases the power consumed by the transmitter by almost two times compared to the conventional current-mode logic (CML) transmitter. In this work, we have proposed a current-sharing topology by reusing the same transmitter current in both transceivers so that the power consumed by the transmitters is reduced by  $2\times $ . A prototype of the proposed transceiver has been implemented in 65 nm CMOS technology for full-duplex signaling across a short FR4 link with a 2.5 dB insertion loss at Nyquist frequency.

The CCOQ, used as a frequency quantizer, improves the efficiency of high-order incremental operation as it provides multi-bit quantization, intrinsic dynamic element matching, and an additional order of residual accumulation. At the same time, the CCOQ conveniently does not require reset in the analog domain, thus simplifying oscillator design. A prototype IC was fabricated in 180nm CMOS process. Clocked at 3.2 MHz with a Nyquist sampling rate of 50 kHz, based on measurements it achieves 87.1 dB SNDR, 99.1 dB SFDR, and 89.7 dB DR and consumes 204 $\mu $  W at 1.4V supply. This results in a competitive 168 dB SNDR-based Schreier FoM, and it demonstrates the potential for leveraging CCOQ benefits within an IADC topology.</description></item><item><title>A 60-GHz Current-Reused Cascode Noise-Canceling Low Noise Amplifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10584099</link><description>In this brief, a current-reused noise-canceling low noise amplifier (LNA) operating at 60-GHz is proposed. To reduce the noise of cascode at millimeter-wave (mm-wave) frequency, an auxiliary path is introduced to neutralize the extra thermal noise of common-gate (CG) transistor caused by parasitic capacitance.

Standardized solutions remain elusive due to significant design challenges, particularly when confronted with capacitive loads close to the range of internal parasitic capacitances. Herein, we present a novel parallel-type slew-rate enhancer based on a current-recycling core, along with insights regarding settling time optimization under power constraints. We designed a switched-capacitor integrator based on a recycling folded cascode OTA, assisted by the proposed slew-rate enhancer, in a 180-nm 1.8-V CMOS technology. The circuit is operated with an equivalent capacitive load of approximately 8 pF and an input differential voltage step as large as 3.6 V. The system is required to settle in less than 40 ns, with a relative error on the final value below 0.1%. Simulation results show that, within the power budget of  $540~\mu $ W, the proposed solution achieves a  $\times 3.5$  improvement in settling time compared to the OTA alone and a  $\times 2.1$  improvement compared to the OTA assisted by a standard parallel slew-rate enhancer.</description></item><item><title>A 0.5-8GHz Reconfigurable CMOS RF Receiver Front-End for CR and DPA Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10587032</link><description>This brief presents a 0.5-8 GHz CMOS RF receiver front-end (RxFE) tailored for cognitive radio (CR) and digital phased array (DPA) applications.

Specifically, by combining the programming language in MATLAB with commercial electronic design automation (EDA) software, such as advanced design system (ADS), the joint optimization process can be achieved. Then, the complex load modulation can be achieved and high-drain efficiency (DE) at various output power back-off (OBO) levels can be obtained by using the proposed overall optimization strategy, which proves the superiority of the combined optimization strategy in optimizing SLMBA compared with the optimization algorithms embedded in ADS. To verify the proposed optimization strategy, a prototype operating at 1.8&#8211;2.1 GHz was demonstrated and implemented using Gallium Nitride (GaN) transistors. A high-back-off efficiency SLMBA is simulated and measured, which the measured saturated total output power reaches 42.7&#8211;43.5 dBm with 75.8%&#8211;81.2% DE and 55%&#8211;62.5% DE at 10-dB power back-off. After that, digital pre-distortion (DPD) is implemented to further improve the linearity of the designed SLMBA with 20-MHz 5G NR signal, and good performance is achieved.</description></item><item><title>Optimization of High-Efficiency GaN Load Modulated Balanced Amplifier for Integrated Sensing and Communication Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10561560</link><description>The novelty of this article is proposing an optimization strategy to design a high-efficiency load modulated balanced amplifier (LMBA) for integrated sensing and communication applications. Taking account of the operating characteristics, theoretical analysis reveals that different load modulation factors of the LMBA need to be realized in Mode I for communication applications, and in Mode II for sensing applications, respectively. To address this issue, the proposed strategy is used to optimize the LMBA, so as to achieve good performance for both modes. To verify the proposed strategy, an LMBA prototype operating from 1.55 to 2.55 GHz is designed with the use of three commercial gallium nitride (GaN) transistors. When tested in Mode I, the LMBA achieves a 9-dB back-off efficiency of 50.1%&#8211;68.7% and a saturated efficiency of 65.0%&#8211;79.6%. When excited by a 60-MHz 5G new radio signal with a 9-dB peak-to-average power ratio, the adjacent channel power ratio of the LMBA in Mode I is from -45 to -52.2 dBc after digital predistortion with the average efficiency of 50.0%&#8211;66.9% over the entire bandwidth. When the LMBA is measured in Mode II, it achieves a saturated output power of 43.7&#8211;45.4 dBm and a saturated efficiency of 55.3%&#8211;72.2% from 1.55 to 2.55 GHz.</description></item><item><title>Timing Error Tolerant CNN Accelerator With Layerwise Approximate Multiplication</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10517283</link><description>Exploiting the error tolerance in computation, approximate circuits become an emerging computing paradigm to increase the energy efficiency in digital systems, which is crucial in high-performance and low-power systems for the Edge Internet of Things (EIoT) devices. Inspired by the state-of-the-art high-efficiency NN accelerators, three techniques are proposed for effectively integrating the approximate computing unit into convolutional neural network (CNN) accelerator to achieve a dynamic energy-accuracy tradeoff: 1) an approximate multiplier that can be configured to three precision modes is proposed. A weight pre-encoding method is used to save hardware overhead; 2) for hybrid-accuracy layerwise mapping, the hessian-aware layerwise accuracy scaling is proposed, which concerns inference accuracy and hardware overhead simultaneously. A progressive retraining approach is proposed to enable an aggressive approximation configuration and higher-power reduction; and 3) a tensor multiplication unit (TMU) with timing error detection and correction (TEDC) approach is proposed, enabling an aggressive voltage scaling and a 41.5% power reduction is obtained. An energy-efficient CNN accelerator is proposed and shows how deep learning can be brought to EIoT devices by running each layer at its appropriate computational accuracy. Implemented under 28-nm CMOS technology, the CNN accelerator achieves the energy efficiency of 14.4 TOPS/W. The proposed accelerator and method are conducted on the applications of keyword spotting of GSCD, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, 44.5%&#8211;46.7% multiplication energy is saved while reducing the accuracy by less than 0.6%.</description></item><item><title>Beware Your Standard Cells! On Their Role in Static Power Side-Channel Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10509766</link><description>Static or leakage power, which is especially prominent in advanced technology nodes, enables so-called static power side-channel attacks (S-PSCAs). While countermeasures exist, they often incur considerable overheads. Besides, hardware Trojans represent another threat. Although the interplay between static power, down-scaling of technology nodes, and the vulnerability to S-PSCA is already established, an important detail was not covered yet: the role of the components at the heart of this sensitive interplay, the standard cells. Here, we study this intricate relationship for two commercial 28 and 65 nm technologies, using a commercial-grade integrated circuit design setup, and under realistic power consumption, performance, and area (PPA) objectives. Specifically, we study how threshold-voltage (VT) tuning of standard cells impacts the resilience of representative AES and PRESENT cipher hardware, including versions with established countermeasures. Our proposed CAD framework enables a security-versus-PPA-aware design-space exploration. Contrary to the belief that high-performance designs are generally more vulnerable to S-PSCA, we find that timing constraints and the distribution of different VT cells are more pivotal factors. Furthermore, we discover that attackers can deploy highly effective and stealthy S-PSCA-based Trojans, all without any gate overheads or any timing violations.</description></item><item><title>TVTAC: Triple Voltage Threshold Approximate Cache for Energy Harvesting Nonvolatile Processors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10542704</link><description>Energy harvesting is considered to be a substitute for batteries in many modern systems. Systems based on energy harvesting receive environmental energies from sources, such as sun, radio frequency, wind, vibration, etc, and convert them to electrical energy to be used by the capacitor of the system or feed the cyber-physical system (CPS) system directly. Despite its advantages, energy harvesting comes with some limitations, such as the instability of the received energy, which means that the energy may not be received for a moment due to environmental conditions during energy harvesting. Therefore, due to not receiving enough energy, the system function may face problems, which can lead to system shutdown and data loss. To prevent program execution interruption caused by frequent power interruptions in systems based on energy harvesting, these systems use nonvolatile processor (NVP). Saving the state in the NVP is done through nonvolatile registers and memories that can hold the contents until the power is restored. However, systems based on energy harvesting and NVPs also have challenges, such as frequent backups&#8217; energy consumption, slow program forward progress, and loss of data. In this article, we propose TVTAC, a framework for energy harvesting-based NVP CPS systems. TVTAC modifies conventional NVP&#8217;s cache architecture to efficiently work with newly introduced operational mode to prevent unnecessary backup operations. Furthermore, TVTAC is equipped with an NVP&#8217;s specific approximation unit that controls the approximation knobs during the approximate data cache accesses in order to save more energy. The simulation results show that TVTAC improves forward progress by 28% in the best case and 12% on average, compared to similar methods. From an energy consumption perspective, TVTAC reduces energy consumption by 43.5% in the best case and 28.5% on average.</description></item><item><title>Block-Wise Mixed-Precision Quantization: Enabling High Efficiency for Practical ReRAM-Based DNN Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10547183</link><description>Resistive random access memory (ReRAM)-based processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures have demonstrated great potential to accelerate the deep neural network (DNN) training/inference. However, the computational accuracy of analog PIM is compromised due to the nonidealities, such as the conductance variation of ReRAM cells. The impact of these nonidealities worsens as the number of concurrently activated wordlines (WLs) and bitlines (BLs) increases. To guarantee computational accuracy, only a limited number of WLs and BLs of the crossbar array can be turned on concurrently, significantly reducing the achievable parallelism of the architecture.While the constraints on parallelism limit the efficiency of the accelerators, they also provide a new opportunity for the fine-grained mixed-precision quantization. To enable efficient DNN inference on the practical ReRAM-based accelerators, we propose an algorithm-architecture co-design framework called block-wise mixed-precision quantization (BWQ). At the algorithm level, the BWQ algorithm (BWQ-A) introduces a mixed-precision quantization scheme at the block level, which achieves a high weight and activation compression ratio with negligible accuracy degradation. We also present the hardware architecture design BWQ-H, which leverages the low-bit-width models achieved by BWQ-A to perform high-efficiency DNN inference on the ReRAM devices. BWQ-H also adopts a novel precision-aware weight mapping method to increase the ReRAM crossbar&#8217;s throughput. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of BWQ, which achieves a  $6.08 \times $  speedup and a  $17.47 \times $  energy saving on average compared to the existing ReRAM-based architectures.</description></item><item><title>A Multichiplet Computing-in-Memory Architecture Exploration Framework Based on Various CIM Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10561622</link><description>Computing-in-memory (CIM) architectures based on various devices, such as resistive random access memory, SRAM, DRAM, etc., have demonstrated promising energy efficiency. Single-device-based CIM chips show different advantages on performance, power, or area metrics under different workload/operators sizes and application requirements. Some nonidealities, such as the write endurance of some nonvolatile devices, also influence the design choices. Motivated by the emerging 2.5-D/3-D chiplet integration, this work aims to combine the advantages of CIM/storage chips based on different devices, and proposes a design exploration framework to combine the advantages of CIM chips based on these devices in a 3-D-stack architecture. This work proposes: 1) an evaluation method for the power, performance, and area metrics of the multichiplet CIM architecture; 2) an abstraction for the single-device-based CIM chiplets and artificial intelligence algorithm operators; and 3) a mapping and optimization strategy to explore the 2.5-D/3-D CIM chiplet set. The effectiveness of the mapping strategy is verified with a small-scale brute-force search. The proposed design exploration framework can help to find a better-multichiplet CIM architecture. Under a simple design case, the proposed 3-D CIM architecture shows  $4.68\times $ &#8211; $53.32\times $  energy efficiency compared with the single CIM chip baselines. The abstracted chiplet library is open-source available in the open-source https://github.com/dai0dai/3D_CIM_Chiplet_Architecture_Exploration.</description></item><item><title>Data-Pattern-Based Predictive On-Chip Power Meter in DNN Accelerator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10554667</link><description>Advanced power management techniques, such as voltage drop mitigation and fast power management, can greatly enhance energy efficiency in contemporary hardware design. Nevertheless, the implementation of these innovative techniques necessitates accurate and fine-grained power modeling, as well as timely responses for effective coordination with the power management unit. Additionally, existing performance-counter-based and RTL-based on-chip power meters have difficulty in providing sufficient response time for fast power and voltage management scenarios. In this article, we propose PROPHET, a data-pattern-based power modeling method for multiply-accumulate-based (MACC) deep neural network (DNN) accelerators. Our proposed power model extracts the predefined data patterns during memory access and then a pretrained power model can predict the dynamic power of the DNN accelerators. Thus, PROPHET can predict dynamic power and provide sufficient responding time for power management units. In the experiments, we evaluate our predictive power model in four DNN accelerators with different dataflows and data types. In power model training and verification, our proposed data-patterns-based power model can realize the 2-cycle temporal resolution with  $R^{2} \gt 0.9$ , normalized mean absolute error &lt;7%, and the area and power overhead lower than 4.5%.</description></item><item><title>Study of p-(6H, 4H, 3C)SiC/n-GaN Heterojunction SDR, DDR IMPATT Diodes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10540363</link><description>In this article, three polytypes of p-(6H, 4H, 3C)SiC and n-GaN heterojunction single-drift (SDR) and double-drift (DDR) impact-ionization-avalanche-transit-time (IMPATT) diodes are studied. We conduct the numerical simulations of the direct current (DC), radio frequency (RF), and noise characteristics of IMPATT diodes. The results show that (6H)SiC/GaN IMPATT diodes have the optimum RF characteristics. Among them, the RF power density of (6H)SiC/GaN DDR IMPATT diode can reach 2.23 MW/cm2. The DC-RF conversion efficiency of (6H)SiC/GaN SDR IMPATT diode can reach 23.4%. Their noise performances are being examined in the meantime. The (3C)SiC/GaN IMPATT has better noise characteristics in the SDR structure, while (4H)SiC/GaN IMPATT has better noise characteristics in the DDR structure. This study provides a reference for the design and fabrication of IMPATT diodes.</description></item><item><title>Janus: A Flexible Processing-in-Memory Graph Accelerator Toward Sparsity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10540086</link><description>Graph application is ever-growing in relational data analysis. However, the memory access patterns become the performance bottleneck in graph analytics and graph neural network (GNN) suffering from single-side and dual-side sparsity, separately. Existing resistive random access memory (RRAM)-based processing-in-memory accelerators reduce data movements but fail to handle both types of sparsity in graph data. To address these issues, our work introduces Janus, a flexible highly compact architecture that is capable of being configured to enable single-sparse mode and dual-sparse mode, to accelerate graph analytics and GNN workloads in compressed mapping, respectively. Upon performing graph analytics with single-side sparsity, Janus employs a tandem-isomorphic-crossbar design both to remove zero-stored footprint, and to eliminate redundant search and sequential indexing. To address the challenge of dual-side sparsity in GNN, Janus still takes a random index access mechanism to gather data rapidly and uses a semi-SPM2 compute paradigm to boost the RRAM-based analog multiplication-and-accumulation in the compressed format. Compared with the state-of-the-art works, Janus outperforms them in both performance and energy efficiency for graph analytics and GNN, respectively.</description></item><item><title>OPT-GCN: A Unified and Scalable Chiplet-Based Accelerator for High-Performance and Energy-Efficient GCN Computation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10531075</link><description>As the size of real-world graphs continues to grow at an exponential rate, performing the graph convolutional network (GCN) inference efficiently is becoming increasingly challenging. Prior works that employ a unified computing engine with a predefined computation order lack the necessary flexibility and scalability to handle diverse input graph datasets. In this article, we introduce OPT-GCN, a chiplet-based accelerator design that performs GCN inference efficiently while providing flexibility and scalability through an architecture-algorithm co-design. On the architecture side, the proposed design integrates a unified computing engine in each chiplet and an active interposer, both of which are adaptable to efficiently perform the GCN inference and facilitate data communication. On the algorithm side, we propose dynamic scheduling and mapping algorithms to optimize memory access and on-chip computations for diverse GCN applications. Experimental results show that the proposed design provides a memory access reduction by a factor of  $11.3\times $ ,  $3.4\times $ , and  $1.4\times $ , and energy savings of  $15.2\times $ ,  $3.7\times $ , and  $1.6\times $  on average compared to HyGCN, AWB-GCN, and GCNAX, respectively.</description></item></channel></rss>
