To enhance the reliability of subsea input-series output-parallel (ISOP) dc converters, this article proposes a multilevel synergistic fault-tolerant strategy that takes into account the challenges of large input voltage fluctuations and limited electrical monitoring. Unlike conventional fixed-threshold methods, the proposed scheme leverages the dynamic voltage&#8211;current time-domain signatures of submodules during incipient faults for real-time monitoring and fault localization, thereby maintaining robustness against input voltage variations. Furthermore, a redundant bypass circuit based on current-limiting resistor multiplexing is incorporated to improve the traditional topology. When combined with a smooth redundancy switching mechanism, this approach effectively mitigates transient electrical stresses on healthy modules during fault transitions. These enhancements collectively ensure the operational safety of both the subsea converter and associated high-precision deep-sea equipment. Finally, a comprehensive fault-tolerant control scheme is developed to guarantee the reliable operation of the subsea dc power supply system following fault occurrences.</description></item><item><title>Compact Interleaved PCB Rogowski Coil Array for Chip Current Measuring in SiC MOSFET Power Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11182315</link><description>The use of printed circuit board (PCB) Rogowski coils to measure chip currents in power modules may significantly help address current imbalance problems that lead to derating or overcurrent failure. Compared to silicon-based power devices, silicon carbide (SiC) power modules feature smaller chips and more compact chip arrangements. This necessitates more compact current measuring probes. This paper proposes a novel design method for PCB Rogowski coil arrays that utilizes the interturn spacing to achieve an interleaved arrangement of Rogowski coils, thereby solving manufacturability problems while increasing the mutual inductance of the Rogowski coils. For a prototype SiC mosfet power module, given the same spatial constraints, the coil array with the interleaved arrangement exhibits an average mutual inductance that is 98% higher than that of a coil array with the conventional arrangement. The circuit of the Rogowski transducer, consisting of the Rogowski coil and an integrator, is presented. The packaging processes for integrating the interleaved PCB Rogowski coil array into the power module are also described. The sensitivity of the Rogowski transducer is evaluated, and the impact of capacitive coupling interference is assessed. The switching currents of the 12 SiC mosfet chips are measured using the interleaved PCB Rogowski coil array in a double-pulse test, which reveals the detailed commutation behavior within the power module. The interleaved PCB Rogowski coil array proves to be an effective current measurement tool for densely arranged branches, providing a foundation for measuring the internal chip current distribution of power modules.</description></item><item><title>Electro&#8211;Thermal Coupling Characteristics of GaN SBDs Under HPM Pulses: Effect of Dislocation Density and Deep Learning Predictive Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11181199</link><description>Gallium nitride (GaN) Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs), as essential devices in power-electronic systems, are particularly vulnerable to high-power microwave (HPM) pulses. HPM pulses can induce electro&#8211;thermal multiphysics coupling effects in the GaN SBDs, potentially leading to device damage or failure. Dislocation density, as a critical parameter of GaN materials, has a significant effect on the performance of GaN SBDs. In this article, we present an electro&#8211;thermal multiphysics coupling analysis of GaN SBDs under HPM pulses, with particular emphasis on the influence of dislocation density on this coupling. Furthermore, by integrating deep learning techniques with technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations, we propose a deep multihead attention residual network (DMARN) model that enables the rapid and accurate prediction of maximum electric field strength and temperature within GaN SBDs under varying dislocation density configurations and HPM pulse parameters. Through the validation of ablation and comparative experiments, an additional test set, and hardware experiments, the DMARN model demonstrates outstanding performance and generalization ability.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Lifetime Estimation and Supervised Voltage Regulation of Flying Capacitors in a Three-Phase Four-Level Three-Capacitor Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11190020</link><description>Three-phase four-level three-capacitor converter (3P4L3C) employs a single flying capacitor per phase, eliminating redundant switching states. However, this topology presents a significant challenge in capacitor voltage regulation, as conventional modulation techniques, including carrier-based SPWM and SVM, fail to maintain voltage balance. This article proposes a supervised voltage regulation method that dynamically adjusts duty ratios to compensate for capacitor voltage deviations, ensuring stable operation. Beyond regulation, a unified electrothermal lifetime evaluation framework is introduced to quantify how improved regulation impacts capacitor reliability. The framework integrates ripple-spectrum-based ESR loss calculation, hotspot temperature estimation, nonlinear damage accumulation, and Monte Carlo simulation under realistic mission profiles. Simulation and experimental results confirm that the proposed supervised voltage regulation achieves stable capacitor voltage regulation while reducing ripple current and thermal stress. As a result, the 3P4L3C converter demonstrates approximately 20% longer capacitor lifetime compared to the conventional 3P4L6C topology, highlighting the benefit of integrating control and reliability assessment within a single design framework.</description></item><item><title>Improved Fault Diagnosis Capability in CHBMCs: Counter Design for Multiple OC Switches via an E-SVM Unit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11193970</link><description>The cascaded H-bridge multilevel converter (CHBMC) is widely used in medium- and high-voltage applications due to its flexibility and scalability. However, its numerous switches make it prone to open-circuit (OC) faults, which lead to overshoot currents and increased harmonics, while unbalanced dc capacitor voltages can destabilize the system. To resolve the aforementioned issues, this article proposes an enhanced space vector modulation (E-SVM) unit that uses counters for multiple OC switch fault diagnosis and incorporates dc capacitor voltage balancing capability. In conjunction with the E-SVM unit, the zero level per power cell helps identify faulty switches, while redundant space vectors balance dc capacitor voltages. Switching losses are minimized by optimizing the switching transition, and a voltage balancing degree quantifies the boundary of the unbalanced loads. The E-SVM is software-based, level-independent, and control-agnostic by the control unit. It ensures seamless CHBMC operation. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by comparing the verification results with theoretical predictions.</description></item><item><title>VSC Converter Feedback Control Data Optimization Based IGBT Collector Emitter Saturation Voltage Monitoring Through Nonlinear Least Squares Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11197693</link><description>Power switching device insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) is a key component in the power conversion system (PCS). Fatigue-induced aging of its electrical characteristics can lead to serious degradation of PCS, such as increased losses and temperatures, fault shutdowns or equipment damage, even safety risks for the battery units. The collector-emitter saturation voltage Vce is an essential indicator of IGBT health status, and the monitoring this on-state saturation voltage can effectively assess its operational health. However, data-driven modeling-based monitoring algorithms are highly dependent on data quality and scale, and substandard data quality can cause significant deviations in the data model, besides extra sensors may not be feasible to be implemented on existing converters. To tackle these challenges, this article introduces a PCS feedback control data based nonlinear least squares curve fitting algorithm for the precise identification of the saturation voltage of IGBT. The PCS model has been established, which incorporate the IGBT dead-time switching character to enhance the accuracy. Additionally, for the collected feedback control data, a Kalman filter observer is constructed to reduce data deviations and noise interference, successfully mitigating the impact of sampling noise on identification accuracy. Finally, the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed IGBT on-state saturations voltage monitoring method are verified through MATLAB/Simulink simulations and experimental setup.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Flexible Thyristor Switch Modules Based AC Chopper for the Renewable Energy VSC-HVDC Transmission System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11145234</link><description>The renewable energy voltage sourced converter based high-voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) system has a broad application prospect, and the ac chopper (ACC) is the core equipment to realise the system fault ride-through (FRT). The traditional ACC consists of multiple three-phase energy-dissipation valves, which require a large number of thyristors, cover a large area, and are difficult to accurately match dissipated power, which restricts its further promotion and application. In this article, the flexible thyristor switch modules based ac chopper (FTSM-ACC) is proposed, which adopts diode bridges for rectification and combines with thyristor energy-dissipation switches to reduce the cost and volume while realizing the flexible casting and cutting of the FTSM-ACC, which provides a new way of thinking for the improvement of the technological and economic performance of ACC. Further, the FTSM-ACC control strategy and key parameter coordination method are proposed. And the system simulation is carried out to analyze the system FRT characteristics of FTSM-ACC. On this basis, a 4-kV/3.2 MW FTSM-ACC prototype is built, and the experimental results verify the effectiveness of FTSM-ACC and demonstrate its advantages over traditional ACC. Finally, the performance and economic efficiency of different ACCs are compared. Compared with the traditional ACC, the FTSM-ACC improves the performance by more than 50%, and the total cost and volume are reduced by 33% and 46%, which has a great performance and economic advantage.</description></item><item><title>Dual-Layer Energy Equalization for Series Battery Packs by Scheduling the Balancing Current With an Improved Model Prediction Controller</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11146528</link><description>This article designs a dual-layer hardware topology for series battery packs to realize the synchronous energy transfer among cells in the same module and cells across different modules. A bus-type flying-inductor structure is employed as the bottom-layer functional block, with sufficient dead-time gaps inserted between switches to mitigate mosfet heating caused by short-circuits. In order to maintain the energy throughput capability, auxiliary components are added for inductor current freewheeling, thereby facilitating the charge transfer between target cells. Then, a typical transformer is adopted as the top-layer functional block to directly balance the selected cells in different modules. Subsequently, considering constraints regarding the withstand voltage and maximum current of the tubes, the model prediction control is improved with multiobjective optimization gain-scheduling mechanism to determine the balancing currents for both layers, wherein the gain matrix is adjusted according to the remaining charge deviations between cells. Experimental verifications conducted on a pack consisting of nine cells divided into three modules indicate that compared with traditional methods, the proposed equalization scheme exhibits superior performance in terms of balanced energy transfer timeliness and efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Investigation of an Easy-Structured and Cost-Effective Energy-Storage System in the DC-Bus</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11150571</link><description>This article presents a new approach of an energy-storage technique for feedback-energy of drive-systems. A well-known state-of-the-art technology for high-power application, is to feed the energy back into the grid using a three-phase full-bridge. However, for smaller drive-systems this is not feasible due to cost and efficiency reasons. Here it is more advantageous to store the fed-back energy directly in the dc-bus. The simplest approach of storing energy directly in the capacitor of the rectifier is limited due to capacitance and voltage issues. Using additional large storage capacitors, such as ultracapacitors, directly in the dc-bus is limited by their voltage ratings. Therefore, a prior and bidirectional dc/dc-conversion is required, which has also disadvantages in terms of costs and efficiency. The new approach presented in this article allows storage capacitors to be operated directly in the dc-bus without prior dc/dc-conversion, which reduces costs, increases the efficiency, and results in an optimal cost-benefit ratio. The principal function of this new current-source-based energy-storage is shown by a detailed description of the topology, its modeling, and an evaluation using simulations and measurements. It turns out that the disclosed new approach is a promising alternative to the prior dc/dc-conversion.</description></item><item><title>Supercapacitor Internal Resistance Mitigation for Rapid Inertia Emulation of Renewable Power Generation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11150529</link><description>Inertia emulation control (INEC) using supercapacitors (SC) has become an appealing approach to effectively enhance the frequency stability of modern low-inertia power grids. However, considerable internal resistance (IR) existing in commercially available SCs may adversely degrade the speed and accuracy of SC-based inertial response, which has been neglected by existing INEC schemes. To tackle this issue, this article proposes an SC IR mitigation (SCIRM) for rapid INEC, consisting of an online IR identification module to obtain up-to-date IR value through fictitious frequency ramp injection and an IR mitigation control to compensate for the voltage deviation across the identified IR. The small-signal stability of the SCIRM-based rapid INEC scheme is strengthened through control parameter optimization. The effectiveness of the scheme in correcting SC inertial response as well as promoting power system frequency stability is evaluated through experimental verifications using a 10 kW testbed and simulation studies using a modified IEEE 39-bus New England system.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Multiport Hybrid DCCB Employing an LC Resonant Circuit for Enhanced Functionality</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11154850</link><description>Multiport hybrid dc circuit breakers (M-HCBs) are considered a suitable solution for protecting multiterminal direct current grids, as the expensive main breaker (MB) is shared among adjacent lines connected to a common bus. However, MBs in most M-HCBs still utilize expensive fully controlled semiconductor devices. In this article, a novel thyristor-based multiport HCB (T-MHCB) is proposed to solve this issue, and it has several other advantages. First, the fully controlled semiconductor devices in the MB are replaced with thyristors to inherit some advantages of thyristors. Second, an LC resonant circuit is employed in the proposed T-MHCB to turn off the thyristor in MB and avoid the overvoltage problem during the reverse recovery process. Third, through the LC resonant circuit, the capacitor can be restored to its initial state after the first current breaking process. As a result, the fast-reclosing protection function is provided with no need for additional power supply. Fourth, simple operation sequences reduce the control complexity and enhance its reliability. The topology introduction, operation principles, mathematical analysis, parameter design guidelines, simulation results, experimental results, and comparison study of the proposed T-MHCB are all presented.</description></item><item><title>A Combined PWM and Phase-Shift Control Method With Adaptive ZVS Boundary Regulation for Bridge-Arm Reused FSBB-LLC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11157837</link><description>The four-switch buck-boost (FSBB) converter cascaded with LLC resonant converter can achieve zero-voltage switching (ZVS) of power switches and wide-range voltage regulation. To improve the power density and reduce the costs, the bridge arms in the two converters can be reused, thereby forming the bridge-arm reused FSBB-LLC converter. However, the reuse of bridge arms reduces the degrees of control freedom, which is detrimental to the realization of ZVS. In this article, a combined PWM and phase-shift control method with adaptive ZVS boundary regulation for FSBB-LLC converter is proposed, which realizes ZVS of power switches while maximizes the reduction on inductor current ripple in the full range (full voltage and load range). First, the ZVS conditions of power switches along with the selection principle of the inductor are revealed. Then, the basic idea of the adaptive ZVS boundary regulation and its design method are proposed. Based on that, a combined PWM and phase-shift control method and its implementation for the FSBB-LLC converter are proposed, which not only realizes full-range ZVS but also maximizes the reduction on inductor current ripple. Finally, a prototype of a 500-W FSBB-LLC converter is built and tested in the lab. The experimental results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control method.</description></item><item><title>Overview of Efficient and Reliable Control Strategies for Three-Level NPC-Based DAB Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11159264</link><description>Dual-active-bridge (DAB) converter has been widely employed in isolated dc&#8211;dc power transmission applications due to its advantages of high power density, inherent soft-switching capability, galvanic isolation, high step-up ratio, and bidirectional power transfer. With the advancement of medium-voltage dc (MVDC) systems, some multilevel dc&#8211;dc converters, evolved from two-level DAB converter, have emerged to meet the high-voltage and high-power demands. Among various multilevel variants of DAB converter, the neutral-point-clamping (NPC)-based DAB converters have gained increasing attention in recent years due to simplified control structure, relatively low costs, and widespread commercialization. The overall performance of MVDC systems depends highly on the efficiency and reliability of DAB converters. Therefore, this article presents a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art control strategies aimed at enhancing efficiency and reliability in NPC-based DAB converters. The review covers modulation schemes designed to optimize converter efficiency, categorized by degrees of freedom, solution types, optimization objectives, and algorithms. Furthermore, control strategies to improve converter reliability, including neutral-point voltage balancing, fault diagnosis and tolerance, transient-state dc bias suppression, and power loss balancing, are exhibited in detail. Finally, the challenges remaining in prior efficiency- and reliability-oriented design are discussed, and corresponding potential research directions are identified to further advance the performance of multilevel DAB converters.</description></item><item><title>Fixed-Frequency K+2D Modulation of Modular Multilevel Resonant DC/DC Converter for All Submodule ZVS Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11162695</link><description>Modular multilevel resonant dc&#8211;dc converters (MMRDCs) are increasingly recognized as competitive solutions for medium-voltage to low-voltage (MV-LV) conversion with wide input ranges. However, these systems often face challenges of low conversion efficiency due to the inability to achieve sufficient soft-switching or excessive conduction loss. This article proposes a novel fixed-frequency K+2D control strategy, which combines submodule (SM) number K and 2 SMs adjusting width D. This approach ensures zero-voltage switching (ZVS) on for all SMs, thereby reducing switching losses. It also effectively reduces the loop resonant current, leading to lower conduction losses. The fixed-frequency control method simplifies the magnetic components design. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the performance under conditions of 9 to 18 kV input, 200 kW power, and 750 V output. Experimental results from a prototype further validate the feasibility and effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>Torque Preservation in DFIG Systems During Voltage Dips With Modulated Stator-Connected Dynamic Braking Resistor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11162680</link><description>This article proposes a novel approach to enhancing the low-voltage ride-through capability of doubly-fed induction generator wind turbines using a dynamically modulated braking resistor (DBR) connected in series with the stator windings. Unlike conventional DBR-based methods that focus primarily on mitigating electrical transients, the proposed approach emphasizes maintaining the generator&#8217;s electromagnetic torque at its prefault level during grid voltage dips. The DBR resistance is calculated in real time based on analytical expressions derived from the system&#8217;s model. By properly selecting the DBR resistance during the fault, the excess mechanical power that cannot be transferred to the grid is dissipated within the resistor, allowing the generator torque to remain constant during the fault, which helps maintain rotor speed and mitigate electrical transients. The proposed strategy is validated through both simulation and experimental results under symmetrical fault conditions, demonstrating superior torque stability, reduced current transients, and improved postfault recovery compared to fixed-resistance DBR schemes.</description></item><item><title>Passivity-Based Zero-Sequence LC Resonance Suppression Method for Parallel Inverters System With Modified LCL Filter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11172354</link><description>Parallel inverters system with modified LCL filters may trigger zero-sequence LC (ZSLC) resonances. Especially in high-power applications, lower switching frequencies are usually adopted to reduce switching losses. In this situation, conventional inverter-side circulating current feedback (ICCF) control cannot behave as expected and introduces new stability issues due to high control delays. To deal with this situation, a passivity-based ZSLC resonance damping method is proposed. First, the equivalent admittance model of ICCF control is established for the first time, which is decomposed into passive component and active component. The results show that the system stability is determined by the active component and the inverter output admittance ratio. Second, by analyzing the frequency-domain characteristics of active components, it is found that the control delay introduces a negative conductance that affects the stability of the ICCF control. Accordingly, a controllable admittance component is added to correspondingly reshape the inverter output admittance characteristics under high control delay conditions, which can mitigate the detrimental impact of control delay in the active component. Thus, the proposed control strategy can enhance the system stability and the circulating resonance current can be effectively attenuated in high-power applications. Finally, the feasibility and correctness of the proposed scheme are verified by the experiments.</description></item><item><title>Weak Grid Characteristic Analysis and Operating Mode Selection for Voltage Support Enhancement of Wind Farms Connected to MMC-HVDC During Asymmetric Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11176120</link><description>The voltage support functions have been mandated in grid codes to help wind turbines (WTs) ride through ac faults. In a modular multilevel converter-based high voltage dc (MMC-HVDC) system for wind farm integration, particularly in scenarios where there is no conventional synchronous generator at the sending end, the MMC adopts voltage-frequency control to form an ac grid. Such grid, however, is found to have a distinctive weak characteristic, which significantly alters the relationship between the point of common coupling voltage and the current injected by WTs and makes existing voltage support modeling methods and control strategies for grid-connected inverters inapplicable to the WTs connected to MMC-HVDC. To enhance the voltage support performance for the WTs, this article aims to elaborate on the weak grid characteristic of the voltage formed by the MMC. To streamline the analysis, the concept of generalized fault impedance is first proposed to eliminate the need for numerous models built for scenarios with different network structures, negative sequence controls, fault types, and transformer winding configurations. Additionally, this article categorizes the operating modes of the MMC and utilizes the piecewise modeling method to derive precise control equations in each operating mode, based on which the weak grid characteristic is thoroughly discussed. Subsequently, to avoid globally identifying the optimal voltage support point, an operating mode selection method prior to the voltage support realization is proposed. Finally, the above modeling method and analysis are verified through control-hardware-in-the-loop experiments.</description></item><item><title>25 kW/L 99.2% Efficiency Wide Output Three Phase PFC Based on Modular Inductive Switching Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11184856</link><description>The modular inductive switching network (MISN) power factor correction (PFC) converter, featuring effective modularization and a single dc bus, is a promising solution for high efficiency ac&#8211;dc conversion with improved power density. However, when applied to battery charging systems requiring wide dc bus voltage range (e.g., 550&#8211;900 V), existing implementations face significant challenges that the loss and volume of the MISN module increase significantly. This study develops a mathematical model to analyze the impact of dc bus voltage on the MISN module, focusing on loss and volume. It is revealed that the MISN module&#8217;s operating voltage and buffer energy is proportional to the dc bus voltage range, leading to increased switching losses and capacitor volumes. To address these issues, a modified MISN-PFC converter with 3level LF-bridge is proposed, which has lower voltage stress of the MISN module. A 10 kW prototype demonstrates 99% full-load efficiency across the entire voltage range while achieving 25 kW/L power density, representing more than twice improvement in power density compared to conventional MISN-PFC converter with 2level LF-bridge under similar efficiency constraints.</description></item><item><title>Global-Synchronized Optimized Pulse Patterns</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11190002</link><description>Optimized pulse pattern, a powerful technique to address harmonic issues for power converters at low switching frequencies, has been widely recognized in high power applications in both industry and academia.

In this work, we propose a global-synchronized optimized pulse pattern technique for power converter clusters. As an upper-layer optimization strategy, the proposal utilizes the additional switching pattern freedom provided by the neighboring power converters and achieves extreme power quality at the common interface, even with ultra-low switching frequencies. Moreover, a pattern extension mechanism is designed to ensure sustained synchronization among units throughout the optimization interval, releasing the inherent computational challenge in the optimization problem. Experimental data confirm its effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>Multiobjective Optimization for Dual Active Bridge Converter Under Variable-Frequency Single-Phase-Shift Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11192665</link><description>The dual active bridge (DAB) converter serves as a dc transformer in high-power applications. Efficiency and power density are significant optimization objectives for DAB converters, influenced by factors such as modulation strategy, converter parameter, magnetic components design, etc. Variable-frequency (VF) single-phase-shift (SPS) modulation has been employed to improve light load efficiency, which is suitable in scenarios where the input and output bus voltages remain constant. However, under this modulation strategy, converter parameters and magnetic components have received little optimization. This article presents a multiobjective optimization method for DAB converter under VF SPS modulation. To ensure rated power and light-load zero-voltage-switching (ZVS), the design range of inductance and switching frequency is determined while considering nonidealities. Pareto optimization is applied for magnetic components design under the specific modulation strategy, balancing efficiency and power density. Finally, the switching frequency is optimized under different loads for high efficiency. A 6.4 kW DAB prototype is developed for experiment, verifying the multiobjective optimization is reasonable. Compared with traditional SPS modulation, the measured efficiency of optimized VF SPS modulation increases by 1.7% and 1.2% under full load and 20% load conditions, respectively, proving the effectiveness of the proposed optimization method.</description></item><item><title>Low Device Count Three-Port DC-DC Converter Integrating Onboard Charger and Auxiliary Power Module for Light Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11150744</link><description>Increasing the power rating of onboard chargers (OBCs) and auxiliary power modules (APMs) is constrained by cost and size. Integrating OBC with APM mitigates these challenges. This article proposes a converter integrating OBC and APM using minimum active switches. The proposed integrated power converter (IPC) comprises two transformers and three bridge converters connected to dc-link of frontend rectifier, high voltage (HV) traction battery, and low voltage (LV) auxiliary battery. During OBC operation, simultaneous power transfer to HV and LV batteries leads to current cancellation, reducing rms current in one of the bridge legs common for both power flow paths. Current cancellation and converter power loss depend upon IPC design parameters, which are turns ratio and leakage inductances of two transformers. This article introduces three design approaches and compares IPC performance with these approaches analytically and experimentally. In addition, a control strategy is suggested to ensure desired power flow across different power paths. A laboratory-developed prototype integrating 1 kW OBC and 350 W APM for a light electric vehicle is fabricated to validate IPC performance with three design approaches. In addition to reduced device count, proposed IPC achieves 0.7 % improvement in efficiency compared to its nonintegrated version with similar circuit configuration.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Flexible Power Control for Three-Phase Buck Rectifier Under Unbalanced Grid Voltages and Wide Grid Frequency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11153897</link><description>For the three-phase pulsewidth modulation rectifiers under unbalanced grid voltages, flexible power control is often utilized to realize multiple control objectives, e.g., constant active power control, constant reactive power control, or balanced input currents control. However, in more electric aircraft application, it is difficult to apply flexible power control because of its wide variation of grid frequency from 360 Hz to 800 Hz. In this article, a novel flexible power control is proposed for the three-phase buck rectifier under unbalanced grid voltages and wide grid frequency. The input current references are constructed by detecting the amplitudes of the grid voltages in the &#945;&#946; frame. In addition, a parameter is adjusted to regulate the oscillating power between active power and reactive power to achieve flexible power control. The proposed control strategy can be implemented without phase-lock loop. It is thus suitable for the application under wide variation of grid frequency. Simulation and experimental results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.</description></item><item><title>Design of a High Performance Flying Capacitor Multilevel Inverter for Electric Vehicles With Stacked Printed Circuit Boards</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11160666</link><description>Drivetrain efficiency and weight represent significant barriers toward the development of future electric aircraft.

A slot-pole interaction analysis model is developed, incorporating nonlinear magnetic permeability modulation effects, to elucidate the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of electromagnetic forces and their resonance mechanisms with structural modes. A novel energy-based method for cogging torque calculation is introduced, achieving a 20% improvement in computational efficiency while maintaining numerical errors below 2% . Furthermore, a cylindrical shell vibration model based on nodal force mapping and a boundary element-based acoustic radiation prediction framework are established. Multiobjective optimization leveraging response surface methodology and a modified particle swarm optimization algorithm is employed to quantify the impact of temperature gradients on permanent magnet performance and nonlinear synergistic effects among parameters.

Conventional control methods, such as proportional-integral regulator, are widely used due to their simple structure and straightforward principles. However, these approaches heavily depend on the model accuracy, which may lead to suboptimal performance in the presence of parameter mismatches and disturbances. To overcome this limitation, this article proposes a comprehensive control framework for voltage closed-loop regulation and introduces an ultralocal model-free pulse-frequency modulation (UMF-PFM) approach. In this framework, the frequency and output voltage are used as variables in frequency modulation. This enables the identification of the unknown nonlinear term of the system, which encapsulates all relevant structural information. By adjusting the frequency, the controller&#8217;s performance remains robust, reducing its dependence on model accuracy. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that, the UMF-PFM shows better stability against parameter mismatches and perturbations on the primary side of the dc&#8211;dc converter compared to existing PFM and PSM methods, which are affected by less than 1 V of the output voltage under the same conditions.</description></item><item><title>A Novel 36-Pulse Rectifier With a Delta-Configured Pulse-Doubler Circuit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11152627</link><description>To enhance the harmonic suppression capability of the traditional 18-pulse rectifier, a delta-configured pulse-doubler circuit (DC-PDC) is proposed, and a new 36-pulse rectifier with DC-PDC is presented in this article. The DC-PDC consists of three dual-tapped converters and is installed on the dc side of the rectifier. The positive output terminals of three rectifier bridges serve as the input to the DC-PDC, and the output of the DC-PDC is connected to the load to supply power. The unique structure and connection method of the DC-PDC enable six auxiliary diodes to conduct cyclically, thereby increasing the output states of the rectifier bridges. This effect, in turn, increases the pulse number of the rectifier from 18 to 36, reducing the total harmonic distortion of the input current from 7.1% to 2.4% .

Stability analysis methods based on impedance modeling offer a theoretical framework to analyze and address this issue. However, under conditions of uncertainty regarding the internal structure and parameters of VSCs, existing impedance measurement techniques using frequency scanning are limited in terms of data acquisition and accuracy. In practice, the power output demand for VSCs in grid-connected operation tends to vary, making it challenging for frequency scanning schemes to account for changes in operating conditions. To address this challenge, this article proposes a sequence impedance prediction solution based on a bidirectional long short-term memory method, which requires only limited data to accomplish high-precision prediction of the overall impedance of VSCs under multiple operating points. Unlike the existing $dq$-based impedance prediction schemes, the sequence impedance method will greatly simplify the prediction process, and the physical meaning is clear. In addition, this article applies trained model to a small-scale VSC model through transfer learning for experimental validation. The process saves computational resources while maintaining prediction accuracy and demonstrates the adaptability of the proposed model.</description></item><item><title>Single-Stage Multiport Solid-State Transformer Based Medium-Voltage DC Interconnection System and Coordinated Control Strategies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11162697</link><description>Decentralized integration of distributed generation (DG) units and loads are increasing in the modern distribution grid.

This article proposes a dual-frequency dual-channel WPT system by introducing a third harmonic resonant channel alongside the fundamental power channel. The third harmonic current serves multiple roles: it enables communication-free synchronization via implicit phase feedback, contributes actively to power transfer, and extends the zero-voltage switching (ZVS) range of the primary-side inverter without increasing the switching frequency.

The corresponding control strategy is presented in this article, constraints and source voltage stress reduction are analyzed, and the effectiveness is verified by simulation and experimental tests. The proposed method can reduce system costs and downtime, thus enhancing the resilient operation of the entire system.</description></item><item><title>Power-Transfer Performance Improvement for S-S Compensation IWPT System Based on Self-Adaptive Impedance Matching</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11097020</link><description>Power-transfer performance has always been one of the main obstacles to restrict the widespread deployment of series&#8211;series (S-S) compensation inductive wireless power transfer (IWPT) system.

However, conventional modulation strategies face challenges in simultaneously eliminating power backflow and achieving balanced output power among cascaded units. In response, this article proposes a double-tier power matching (DPM) hybrid frequency modulation strategy for a nine-level ACHB inverter with a dc-link voltage ratio of 2:1:1. In the upper tier power matching scheme, an improved staircase modulation for the high-voltage unit ensures power balance between high-voltage unit and low-voltage units by regulating the pulse width of the high-voltage unit. In the lower tier power matching scheme, a novel level-shift modulation is employed for the low-voltage units, utilizing carrier rotation with intervals of half a fundamental period to achieve power balance within a single fundamental period. Additionally, in order to prevent power backflow, the proposed strategy undergoes further optimization. This optimization also leads to a substantial reduction in both the implementation complexity of the DPM strategy and the switching losses in the inverter. Ultimately, this strategy is validated by both simulation and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Nonlinear Automatic Power-Decoupling Control of a Differential Buck Grid-Tied DC&#8211;AC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11099551</link><description>A nonlinear automatic power-decoupling (APD) control strategy for a single-phase grid-tied differential buck dc&#8211;ac converter is proposed in this work.

However, this is not straight forward due to the nonlinear variation of the value of capacitance with operating conditions. The conventional sizing methodology determines the capacitance value by equating the energy demand with the energy predicted using the RC model. It assumes a constant capacitance value, which results in over sizing of the SC pack. To overcome this drawback, this article proposes a fractional order (FO) model (FOM) based method to accurately predict the stored energy in SC pack. Although FOM accounts for the nonlinear capacitance variation due to the charge redistribution in the porous SC electrodes, there are certain shortcomings. First, the identification of the FOM parameters is cumbersome due to their dependence on the charge/discharge history. Second, the scaling of the FOM parameters from cell to pack level for the performance analysis of SC systems is not clearly addressed so far. Considering these, a predictor-corrector methodology for SC pack sizing is proposed. A rough estimate of the number of SC modules for meeting the specified energy and power demand is determined in the prediction stage. The correction stage evaluates the power, energy and efficiency of the selected module with FOM parameters and adjusts the sizing. The proposed methodology is then validated with a case study on a supercapacitor-based city bus, where a 27% reduction in sizing is observed.</description></item><item><title>Transient Stability Analysis of Hybrid GFL-GFM System Considering Various Damping Effects</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11103749</link><description>As converter-based resources keep expanding in power systems, it is urgent to clarify the transient coupling mechanisms between different control types of converters. It has already been found that both the grid-following (GFL) control and the grid-forming (GFM) control could introduce significant damping effects on transient angle motions. However, the damping effects on the relative motion between different control types of converters remain unclear, which impedes the transient stability evaluation of systems containing various converters. To fill the gap, this article explores the transient damping effects present in a hybrid system containing both the GFL and GFM converters. Two distinct damping effects introduced by the GFL and the GFM algorithms are first identified. It is found that the damping terms can introduce negative damping effects during transients, which would deteriorate the system transient stability. To quantify the damping effects, a critical trajectory approximation (CTA) method for the GFL-type damping and a damping energy approximation (DEA) method for the GFM-type damping are proposed. On this basis, a transient stability criterion for the hybrid systems is developed to directly identify the critical fault-clearing point without any repetitive iteration. Simulations and hardware-in-loop experiments are both implemented for validation. The proposed method effectively evaluates the complex damping effects and quantitatively solves the transient stability boundary for hybrid GFL-GFM systems, which may provide some valuable insights for transient stability analysis of hybrid systems.</description></item><item><title>A Carrier-Based Multiswitch Virtual Space Vector Modulation With Dead-Time Effect Elimination for Multiport DC&#8211;AC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11112519</link><description>Multiport dc&#8211;ac converter has gained attention due to its power density and low cost. However, in virtual space vector pulse width modulation (VSVPWM) where common-mode voltage (CMV) reduction and power control are considered, there are multiple switching actions in a period, which can be called multiswitch-VSVPWM (MS-VSVPWM). This leads to complex vector synthesis rules, and dead-time effect (DTE) needs to be analyzed due to variable port voltages. To simplify computation, a carrier-based MS-VSVPWM with DTE elimination is proposed. First, according to volt-second balance and dwell time relations, variable and fixed modulation waves are derived. Then, final output sequences are obtained by using phase opposition disposition (POD) carrier. Second, shifted modulation wave is derived on this basis. The drive signals are obtained by the variable/fixed modulation wave and the shifted modulation wave, respectively. Thus, DTE is eliminated on the premise of avoiding shoot-through of power switches. In addition, a variable shift value strategy is investigated to obtain the maximum shift value. Finally, the proposed method is verified experimentally on photovoltaic (PV)-battery hybrid system prototype, showing its high efficiency and relatively low output harmonics based on CMV reduction and power control.</description></item><item><title>Step-Wave AC Collection System: A More Efficient Solution for Wind and Photovoltaic Power Transmission</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11095885</link><description>The sinusoidal alternating current (ac) synchronous generator-based power system has served as the backbone of electricity generation and distribution for over a century.

The newly developed DT is based on a time-domain mathematical modelling approach. Moreover, a novel optimal equilibrium optimizer (OEO) algorithm is employed to find the values of unknown parameters of developed DT. Initially, the system&#8217;s unknown parameters are estimated under healthy operating conditions through novel OEO algorithm. As the system operates, the DT continuously monitors and updates these parameters, identifying any deviations or degradation in system components. The internal resistances of critical components are estimated, enabling an accurate calculation of power losses within the system. To study the impact of component&#8217;s health degradation, power loss, total harmonic distortion (THD) and magnitude of dc-link voltage fluctuation are analyzed in details for different test scenario. Additionally, a novel reduced loop circular limit cycle oscillator (RL-CLO) based hysteresis current control (HCC) control technique is used to achieve the optimal performance of the entire system. Finally, the results are validated through experimental prototype developed in the laboratory, confirming the reliability and accuracy of the proposed approach. This research offers a powerful approach for parameter estimation, power loss calculation, and performance optimization of grid-connected PV systems.</description></item><item><title>Grid-Forming Cascaded-Bridge Converters With Parallel Connectivity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11091577</link><description>Grid-forming converters (GFMCs) offer a range of desirable features, such as grid formulation, inertia and damping emulation, voltage/frequency support, and better stability in weak grids. In parallel, cascaded-bridge converters (CBCs), such as cascaded H-bridge converters (CHBs), enjoy the advantages of modularity and expandability, thus being promising candidates in high-voltage GFMCs. Although the serial connection of submodules enables high-voltage stresses, CHB submodules fail to jointly share the current. Therefore, conventional CHBs can hardly comply with short-term overload requirements, which remain a tricky problem for GFMCs. By leveraging the parallel capacity of symmetrical half-bridge submodules, this article proposes grid-forming CBCs with parallel connectivity, which benefits from: 1) implementation of multilevel converter GFM functionality and customized grid-supportive services; 2) increased current capacity; 3) minimization of sensor usage and control complexity; and 4) GFM capability sustainment under submodule faults. Simulation and experimental results confirm the validity of the proposed converter and control schemes, leading to a 30.7%&#8211;64.8% improvement of current capacity while realizing grid-forming functions, such as virtual inertia and damping synthesis.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Line Resistance Estimation Through Multiple DC Grid-Forming Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11099553</link><description>In dc microgrids, line resistances provide pivotal information for power quality evaluation, stability analysis, and converter control. As such, the prior knowledge of line resistances is very helpful for achieving the coordinated regulation of multiple dc&#8211;dc converter-interfaced distributed generators (DGs). Nevertheless, line resistances are difficult to estimate, particularly when only local measurements are available. To fill the research gap, this article proposes a novel method to estimate line resistances by applying a disturbance to the output voltage of each DG sequentially. Notably, each DG simply measures its local output current and performs simple calculation with measured parameters. Different from existing methods, the proposed method allows impedance estimation without any additional hardware or communication link. Furthermore, the proposed method can be extended to heterogeneous systems, where DGs feature different parameters and/or line impedances. In this case, we employ a particle swarm optimization algorithm for accurate estimation. Finally, simulation and experimental results validate that the proposed method achieves an approximately 3% improvement of line resistance estimation accuracy as compared with the conventional estimation methods in homogeneous and heterogeneous systems.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Simulation Method for High-Frequency Power Electronic Converters With Blocking Mode</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11112543</link><description>For the bridge-based high-frequency power electronic converters (BHPECs) using the Ron/Roff model, the identification of blocking mode is crucial for the real-time simulation to avoid oscillation and ensure model accuracy. This article presents a predictive correction method that identifies the blocking mode of the half-bridge arm with low computational amount. The proposed method ensures model stability by the backward Euler method and achieves decoupling between half-bridge arms. Besides, by correcting the predicted state variables at the diode status-changing time point, this method significantly reduces the computational amount compared to the existing blocking mode identification methods without iterative operations. Finally, a series load resonant (SLR) converter with 100 kHz switching frequency and an LLC resonant converter with 200 kHz switching frequency were implemented on a field programmable gate array (FPGA), achieving simulation time steps as low as 20 ns. Comparisons with existing methods confirm the advantages of the proposed method in terms of timing and resource consumption.</description></item><item><title>Development, Control, and Application of a Parallel-Type Hybrid-Actuated 6-$\underline{\mathrm{P}}$SS Precision Stage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11103746</link><description>Six degree-of-freedom (DOF) precision stage is crucial in optical engineering applications, which necessitates rapid velocity, submicrometer resolution, extensive workspace, and power-off self-locking functionality. Conventional multi-DOF precision stages may excel in certain motion performances while underperforming in others. This study introduces a hybrid concept of a 6-$\underline{\mathbf{P}}$SS precision stage actuated by frictional and electromagnetic forces in a parallel arrangement, with the frictional force generated by a multimode piezo-motor and the electromagnetic force produced by a voice coil motor. Unlike the conventional macro/micro precision stage, the proposed one features parallel-type actuation, avoiding some drawbacks such as complex kinematics and internal interference. The theoretical model of the system is established. A controller integrating proportion integration differentiation (PID) and sliding mode controller incorporating a disturbance compensator (SMC-DC) is developed to mitigate shock interference from the two forces, allowing the precision stage to attain optimal performance in resolution, stroke, and velocity, while also incorporating a power-off self-locking feature. The experimental setup is established to assess the feasibility of the suggested design. To further display the superiority in versatile actuation, the proposed 6-$\underline{\mathbf{P}}$SS stage is employed to align the single-mode fiber. The spatial optical coupling achieves 81% efficiency in just 32 s. The proposed methodology can be extended to further precision positioning applications.</description></item><item><title>Reinforcement Learning-Based Control for Electrohydraulic Actuators: A Case Study on an Inverted Pendulum Testbench</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11099537</link><description>Electrohydraulic actuators (EHAs) are critical in applications demanding compact designs, high power density, and precise motion control. However, their nonlinear dynamics and inherent uncertainties pose considerable control challenges. This study develops a reinforcement learning (RL)-based control framework, integrating an actor&#8211;critic algorithm [deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)] and a novel reward-shaping method to address these challenges without requiring prior expert knowledge. The proposed approach is validated on a heavy-duty EHA-driven inverted pendulum testbench, as a benchmark system for nonlinear and unstable dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate the RL controller&#8217;s effectiveness in achieving the dual-control goal: swing-up and balancing of the EHA-driven pendulum. Furthermore, a comparative analysis with the classical linear quadratic regulator (LQR) highlights the strengths and limitations between RL-based control and model-based control. This study serves as fundamental research, offering practical and theoretical contributions to the application of RL in advanced motion control for EHAs and other complex systems.</description></item><item><title>Model Predictive Control for Dual-Motor Driving System With Unknown Backlash Nonlinearity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11099555</link><description>The unmeasurable gear backlash nonlinearity caused by mechanical wear in multimotor driving systems (MDSs) is inevitable, imposing challenges for the modeling and controller design. As a remedy, this work proposes a model predictive controller (MPC) to handle the unmeasurable backlash often encountered in dual-motor driving systems (DDSs). First, a control-oriented model with an observer is established to estimate the backlash torque. Accordingly, a constrained MPC is developed to minimize both the tracking error and vibrations. Therein, delay compensation is leveraged to decrease prediction lag. PI feedback is introduced to compensate for the steady-state error caused by the offset of the external observer. Based on the output of the proposed MPC, which is the sum of the torques for two motors, a time-varying-bias-torque (TVBT) scheme to save energy consumption is designed to compute the torque for each motor. Finally, experiments are conducted on DDSs to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the present MPC-TVBT.</description></item><item><title>Noninvasive DC Current Monitoring for High-Sensitivity With Temperature Compensation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11099536</link><description>DC microgrids, which are being widely applied in renewable energy distribution management and enhancing energy efficiency in smart buildings, are facing significant challenges in maintaining system stability and reliability, as well as effectively managing complex communication and control. In this article, a noninvasive dc current galvanometer is proposed for high-sensitivity with temperature compensation via a differential passive sensing&#8211;wireless transmitting scheme. An integrated configuration, mainly consisting of a magnetic cantilever and a dual-frequency microstrip patch, is used to synchronously realize both sensing and transmitting. A sensitivity of 503.88 ppm/A, obtained with a fabricated prototype, 41 times greater than that of previous one, is increased to 1024.75 ppm/A by introducing an array design, achieving an improvement of two orders of magnitude. A measurement error is analytically reduced by 48%, if a temperature compensation is introduced via the proposed differential scheme. The proposed noninvasive dc current galvanometer is expected to provide a new solution for system stability, reliability, and early warning in dc microgrids, paving the way for more efficient real-time monitoring.</description></item><item><title>Coupling-Insensitive Inductive Power Transfer System Driven by Single-Switch Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11099552</link><description>This article is devoted to improving the coupling insensitivity of inductive power transfer (IPT) systems. Unlike previous studies that focused on establishing a stable source on the primary side (e.g., through a full-bridge inverter), this article leverages the load-sensitive characteristics of a single-switch resonant inverter to achieve a more stable system under varying coupling conditions. In addition, instead of designing the inverter and compensated coupler in a decoupled manner, the whole system is viewed as an ultrahigh-order resonant converter. Through simplification, the existing analytical inverter model is modified to fully explore the design potential for coupling-independent zero voltage switching and high robustness under parameter variations. The modified model also fills the gap in the holistic modeling of single switch IPT systems. In the experiment, a 60 W prototype is designed, when the coupling coefficient varies from 0.085 to 0.17, the output power maintains a fluctuation of 12%, with peak efficiency reaching 89.12%.</description></item><item><title>An RL-Based Strategy for Optimal Power and Gas Flow Calculation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10945737</link><description>Operating the integrated power and gas systems necessitates solving optimal power and gas flow (OPGF) problem, which is notably challenging due to the inherent nonlinearity and complexity of both systems. This study introduces a novel approach to address the OPGF problem by integrating problem decomposition with reinforcement learning (RL)-based cutting plane techniques. The proposed strategy divides the original OPGF problem into a simplified OPGF (SOPGF) sub-problem and a power and gas flow (PGF) calculation sub-problem. In the constraint set of the SOPGF sub-problem, linear inequality constraints (i.e., cutting planes or cuts) are introduced, bounding the feasible region of the SOPGF sub-problem and thereby obtaining the optimal solution to the original OPGF problem. The cuts are determined using an RL algorithm, and the RL agent is trained to maximize the rewards estimated by the PGF calculation. To enhance the efficiency of the agent training, action selection method is utilized in the RL-based cutting plane approach. Case studies are performed to assess the proposed strategy in comparison to conventional methods across diverse test conditions, verifying that the new approach surpasses conventional approaches in both computational efficiency and feasibility.</description></item><item><title>Modelling of AC-DC Voltage Control Coupling and Adaptive Fault Ride-Through Method for VSC-HVDC Integrated Wind Farms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948156</link><description>During grid fault, the voltage source converter-based high voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) integrated wind farms should effectively support the grid voltage while ensuring the integrated system security. Existing studies have neglected the AC-DC voltage control coupling caused by the sudden change in the grid's complex impedance due to the fault transition impedance, which may lead to transient DC overvoltage, poor elevation of grid voltage, or active power loss of wind farms. A faulted grid equivalent model based on the virtual fault is established, and the mechanism of AC-DC voltage control coupling of the integrated system caused by the complex impedance of the faulted grid is found. A coupling model of the grid-connection bus voltage of the integrated system, maximum DC voltage deviation, and active power of the wind-end converter is established, and the quantification method for the maximum grid voltage support capability of the integrated system is proposed. Finally, the adaptive symmetrical fault ride-through method balancing between AC-DC voltage control is proposed. Through simulation verification, the proposed method can maximize the grid voltage elevation and minimize the active power loss of wind farms while avoiding DC overvoltage and the steady-state AC overcurrent of grid-end converter under the premise.</description></item><item><title>Performance-Aware Control of Modular Batteries for Fast Frequency Response</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947730</link><description>Modular batteries can be aggregated to deliver frequency regulation services for power grids. Although utilizing the idle capacity of battery modules is financially attractive, it remains challenging to consider the heterogeneous module-level characteristics such as dynamic operational efficiencies and battery degradation. In addition, real-time decision making within seconds is required to enable fast frequency response. In order to address these issues, this paper proposes a performance-aware scheduling approach for battery modules to deliver fast frequency response (FFR) support. In particular, the conduction loss and switching loss of battery packs as well as converters are captured within a mix-integer quadratic constrained program (MIQCP). The cycle-based aging model identifies the aging cost of battery modules during frequent cycling by introducing the aging subgradient calculation and linearization. Case studies based on real-world battery data show that the proposed scheduling approach can effectively reduce power loss cost by nearly 28%&#8211;57% and battery aging cost by 4%-15% compared to conventional methods, which can also enhance the SoC balance.</description></item><item><title>Meta Reinforcement Learning Based Adaptive and Interpretable Energy Storage Control Meets Dynamic Scenarios</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948374</link><description>As renewable energy becomes more widespread, energy storage systems (ESSs) play an important role in managing energy distribution and economic arbitrage. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL)-based scheduling methods face performance degradation or failure in highly dynamic environments due to their limited generalization capability, especially amid increasing fluctuations in renewable energy output, electricity prices, and load demands. This paper proposes a novel ESSs control framework based on Meta-Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL), comprising offline training and online adaptation phases. The offline training phase features a dual-loop update framework, acquiring a model with highly generalizable initial parameters through a multi-task learning approach. In the online adaptation phase, the model can make adaptive adjustments rapidly in response to environmental changes. Lastly, a Shapley Value-based Meta-RL (SMRL) method is proposed to perform an in-depth analysis of decision-making outcomes. Multiple dynamic microgrid (MG) scenarios were simulated using real data with added fluctuation factors for model training and testing. The proposed Meta-RL based model exhibits significantly better adaptability in various scenarios, achieving approximately 20% to 50% performance improvement compared to the traditional RL model. A detailed analysis of the contribution of features behind scheduling decisions shows alignment with human intuition.</description></item><item><title>Periodic-Enhanced Informer Model for Short-Term Wind Power Forecasting Using SCADA Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10955286</link><description>Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems can collect abundant information about wind farm operation and environment. To better make use of SCADA data, a periodic-enhanced informer model for short-term wind power forecasting using scada data is proposed. Firstly, to effectively filter out noise in SCADA data, a v-p curve-based method is adopted by incorporating a quartile approach to remove sparse outliers; a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is then employed to eliminate stacked outliers from the power curve. Secondly, a multi-feature input set selection method based on Maximization Information Coefficient is introduced to make better use of the SCADA system data by reducing the number of features. Thirdly, a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) is designed to extract the scalar projection of the input set, followed by fusing the local time stamp and global time stamp to build the periodic information enhanced prediction model embedding layer. Subsequently, the enhanced input set is fed into an informer model to predict future wind power. Finally, considering the multiple temporal scales structure characteristics present in the dataset, a multi-scale deep fusion module is established in the informer model to deeply integrate the features of different scales. It can simultaneously avoid the resource waste and overfitting problems caused by increasing the network depth. The experimental results, which are obtained from several deep learning methods on real SCADA data, demonstrate that the suggested approach has good predictive capability.</description></item><item><title>Computationally Efficient Model Predictive Control for Enhanced Primary-Level Management of Standalone Microgrids With Hybrid Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10955859</link><description>This paper proposes a highly efficient model predictive control (MPC) technique for primary-level control of a hybrid storage system (HSS) in a microgrid with renewables. Generally, active set (AS)-based MPCs are used to control HSS-based microgrid systems, which are computationally complex. The high-complexity prevents making control decisions within the sampling time, which negatively affects the robustness of the control system. Moreover, high complexity necessitates powerful controllers, which increase the system's overall cost and energy consumption. On the other hand, less complex controls, such as supervisory control, reduce the storage system's stability, reliability, and lifetime. The proposed method is a closed-form AS-based MPC that shares the mutual advantages of both AS-based MPC and supervisory controllers with additional robustness. It thus significantly reduces the computational complexity while being stable and reliable, improving storage lifetime, and having higher robustness compared to MPC and supervisory controllers. The proposed method is compared to modified AS based MPC, Hildreth quadratic programming (HQP), and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) based MPC recently employed for an HSS microgrid application. The analysis showed that the proposed method could significantly outperform the conventional MPC methods in computational complexity and robustness, as well as the supervisory controller in terms of reliability, stability, enhanced battery lifetime, and robustness.</description></item><item><title>Analysis of a Disturbance Event With Inverter-Based Resources Using EMT Simulations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964428</link><description>Increasing penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) necessitates newer methods of planning and analysis of disturbances. The existing phasor-domain transient stability (TS) analysis may not capture the dynamics of IBRs during fault events. In this paper, electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations using high-fidelity detailed model of power grid and one of the affected photovoltaic (PV) plants during the Angeles Forest disturbance in 2018 are performed. In these simulations, the processes to develop EMT models of power grid from traditional phasor-domain TS data and PV plant from collected data are described. Thereafter, using these simulations, the response of the PV plant during the fault event in 2018 is replicated and a sensitivity analysis is performed. The sensitivity analysis consists of making changes to the components within the PV plant and in the power grid to evaluate the impact they have on the response observed by the PV plant during the fault event. This analysis provides an understanding of the components that impact the operation of a PV plant during fault events and provide guidance to system planners on the studies that need to be performed to maintain a reliable power grid as new IBR plants are integrated.</description></item><item><title>Categorical Spatial Interpolation of Solar Irradiance for Regional Distributed Photovoltaic Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964342</link><description>High-spatial-resolution (HSR) solar irradiance forecast data is important for regional distributed photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting. Distributed PV sites are widely geographically distributed and the cost of obtaining HSR irradiance forecast data with full regional coverage is very high. Improving spatial resolution through interpolation based on limited sparse irradiance forecast reference points is a low-cost and feasible approach. However, existing irradiance spatial interpolation methods would produce large errors under variable weather conditions (e.g., cloudy) with limited reference points, because local abrupt changes in irradiance usually occur under such weather conditions due to cloud movement. This paper proposes a categorical spatial interpolation method to improve the accuracy of distributed PV power forecasting with limited sparse irradiance forecast data. The method first converts satellite-derived shortwave radiation images into binary irradiance maps through adaptive thresholding, then trains a 3D U-net model to predict future irradiance category probabilities for each grid. These probability maps dynamically govern two parallel interpolation processes: one using reference stations in predicted clear-sky regions, another utilizing stations in cloudy zones, with final irradiance values determined by probability-weighted fusion. Case studies on a real dataset verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Centralized Control for Paralleled VSCs With Grid-Forming and Oscillation Suppression Capability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10965541</link><description>Paralleled multiple voltage source converters (VSCs) are adopted in photovoltaic (PV) or energy storage systems, and may suffer from oscillation and fault disturbance issues under various grid conditions. In this paper, a centralized control frame is proposed to suppress the active power oscillation and support the grid voltage/frequency via grid-forming (GFM) control. A virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control is applied as the centralized controller, which communicates with local controllers. The mutual damping and power angle feedback are adopted in the local controller to achieve an accurate active power sharing. The influence of key parameters such as the communication delay and mutual damping are analyzed. Finally, the proposed control is verified though the simulation and hierarchical controller-hardware-in-loop (CHIL) experiments.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Pseudo-Decentralized Control of Wave Energy Arrays</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10965503</link><description>In control of wave energy converter (WEC) arrays, since the dynamics of different devices are coupled by radiation effects, there has always been a dilemma between using centralized control, with optimal energy production but usually overwhelming computation, or decentralized control, with acceptable computation but performance degradation. This paper proposes a pseudo-decentralized control strategy that is effective in energy production but efficient in computation. In this method, a centralized estimation-forecasting scheme is applied to provide global information on the wave excitation force (WEF) experienced by each device. Then, the optimal unconstrained array motion is calculated from the WEF information, to serve as an initial guess of the optimal constrained motion. Finally, the constrained control moves of each WEC are optimized decentralizedly using model predictive control (MPC). However, in contrast to conventional decentralized control, each local controller not only maximizes its own energy production, but also takes into account the energy it contributes, through radiation, to other WECs, given their anticipated motion. In this way, the proposed controller enjoys the same computational simplicity as decentralized control, but is demonstrated, through comprehensive testing, to be capable of achieving performance close to the ideal centralized control across a wide range of sea states.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Energy Storage Configuration for Primary Frequency Regulation Performance Considering State of Charge Partitioning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10965852</link><description>The proportion of renewable energy in the power system continues to rise, and its intermittent and uncertain output has had a certain impact on the frequency stability of the grid. Therefore, a multi-type energy storage (ES) configuration method considering State of Charge (SOC) partitioning and frequency regulation performance matching is proposed for primary frequency regulation. Firstly, the Automatic Generation Control (AGC) signal is decomposed and reconstructed using the variational mode decomposition (VMD) method. Specifically, by combining the charge and discharge characteristics of Li-ion battery and flywheel energy storage (FES), component signals of different frequencies are allocated to different ES systems. Secondly, a multi-type ES capacity allocation optimization model considering SOC partitioning is developed, with the objective function being the minimization of the whole life-cycle planning cost of ES. Finally, based on actual data from a region in North China, the proposed method is verified by analyzing case studies under different scenarios. The results demonstrate that the method can effectively reduce computation time, optimize ES operating conditions, and thus lower the whole life-cycle planning cost of ES.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Grid-Interactive Power Performance Enhancement Method for D-PMSG-Based Virtual Synchronous Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10966203</link><description>Virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control is widely applied in grid-interactive inverters due to its similarity to synchronous generators. The VSG frequency variation is delayed by the synchronous swing equation to provide additional inertia support, which also leads to a slower power response. When applied to wind turbines (WTs), VSG reduces their power tracking ability, compromises the wind power capture efficiency, and affects the dispatch commands execution. The response to external frequency causes more power changes in WTs, making it difficult for wind power capture to keep up due to the mass of the rotor and blades, bring extra operational risks for WTs. To address these issues, this paper proposes a hierarchical grid-interactive power performance enhancement method for D-PMSG-based virtual synchronous wind turbines (VSWTs). The power performance is enhanced by coordinating the synchronous swing equation and voltage excitation equation parameters. The grid-forming power flow and electromechanical status of the VSWT are integrated to extend the kinetic energy (KE) utilization limits to ensure the efficiency and safety of the VSWT during the KE utilization-based wind power capture regulation. The proposed method comprehensively improves the grid-interactive power performance of VSWTs, and the effectiveness has been validated through comparative simulations.</description></item><item><title>Novel Voltage Support Strategies for DGs in Hybrid AC/DC Distribution Networks Under Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10970419</link><description>According to the grid codes, the higher the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC), the longer duration that the voltage-source converters (VSC) can stay connected to the grid. In hybrid AC/DC distribution networks (HADNs), owing to the low capacity, VSC-based distributed generator (DG) closest to the fault point may fail to significantly support the voltage at the PCC through current injection. Therefore, other large-capacity converters such as flexible AC/DC converters (FACs) should also inject currents to help it. However, in resistive-inductive HADNs, the voltage support effect is related to the current phases of converters, and the fault conditions. In this paper, circumstances under two fault position categories (upstream and downstream fault positions of DG) for double line-to-ground fault and three-phase short-circuit fault are analyzed. The interconnected sequence networks of HADNs under these two fault positions are proposed. Based on the proposed networks, the optimal current phase angles of DG and FAC for maximumly supporting voltages at the PCC of the DG are proposed. Moreover, the line sequence impedance calculation method is proposed. The simulation results verify the proposed strategy. The proposed strategy is suitable for low-capacity DGs in resistive-inductive HADNs to achieve voltage support and fault ride-through.</description></item><item><title>Learning-Accelerated ADMM for Stochastic Power System Scheduling With Numerous Scenarios</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10971244</link><description>The increasing share of uncertain renewable energy sources (RES) in power systems necessitates new efficient approaches for the two-stage stochastic multi-period AC optimal power flow (St-MP-OPF) optimization. The computational complexity of St-MP-OPF, particularly with AC constraints, grows exponentially with the number of uncertainty scenarios and the time horizon. This complexity poses significant challenges for large-scale transmission systems that require numerous scenarios to capture RES stochasticities. This paper introduces a scenario-based decomposition of theSt-MP-OPF based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Additionally, this paper proposes a machine learning-accelerated ADMM approach (ADMM-ML), facilitating rapid and parallel computations of numerous scenarios with extended time horizons. Within this approach, a recurrent neural network approximates the ADMM sub-problem optimization and predicts wait-and-see decisions for uncertainty scenarios, while a master optimization determines here-and-now decisions. Additionally, we develop a hybrid approach that uses ML predictions to warm-start the ADMM algorithm, combining the computational efficiency of ML with the feasibility and optimality guarantees of optimization methods. The numerical results on the 118-bus and 1354-bus system show that the proposed ADMM-ML approach solves the St-MP-OPF with 3-4 orders of magnitude speed-ups, while the hybrid approach provides a balance between speed-ups and optimality.</description></item><item><title>Finite-Time Stabilization of Floating Offshore Wind Turbines Under Wind and Wave Disturbances by Adaptive Barrier-Function Fractional-Order Sliding Mode Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10972122</link><description>Floating offshore wind turbines harness more vigorous and more stable winds, making them a promising solution for clean energy. However, their stability is compromised by sea waves and sudden winds, reducing power extraction. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a finite-time fractional-order adaptive SMC for tension-leg platform wind turbines to enhance stability and efficiency. A fractional-order model ensures accurate system representation, while a barrier-function-based adaptive control strategy guarantees rapid, finite-time convergence, mitigates chattering, and suppresses external disturbances through real-time estimation. The proposed controller effectively stabilizes the system, helping to maximize power extraction. Simulation results in the MATLAB-Simulink environment demonstrate superior performance compared to conventional methods in terms of disturbance rejection and convergence speed. Furthermore, hardware-in-the-loop validation using a Speedgoat platform confirms the method's real-time feasibility and robustness under realistic operational conditions. The proposed approach offers a significant advancement in floating offshore wind turbines stability and control, ensuring efficient energy harvesting even under severe environmental disturbances. These findings contribute to the development of more reliable and resilient floating wind energy systems, supporting the transition toward sustainable offshore wind power.</description></item><item><title>A Distributed Dispatch of Bi-Directional Power and Hydrogen Systems for Enhancing the Renewable Energy Integration in Grid-Connected Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10977964</link><description>The accelerating transition to renewable-based power grids is critical for carbon neutrality.

However, most existing methods face challenges in dealing with data scarcity and random fluctuations. This paper proposes an ultra-short-term distributed PV power forecasting method based on Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). Firstly, virtual distributed PV power data is generated with different spatial resolutions. Next, the generated data is used to pre-train a Transformer-based model for predicting PV power from 15 minutes to 4 hours. Finally, the model is fine-tuned on real PV stations with a small data volume. The attention mechanism can learn correlations from lots of historical power data by pre-training. Fine-tuning can realize lightweight deployment and accurate prediction on newly built PV stations, effectively dealing with data scarcity. Models with 12.63M and 103M parameters are pre-trained using virtual data, respectively. The experimental results on datasets from 3 locations show that when there is 1 mo real data, the average RMSE decreases by 37.22%, 32.92% and 10.87% compared with the LSTM, linear model, and Transformer-based model, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Allocation and Two-Level Control of Reactive Power for Balancing Voltage and Power Factor of Renewable Energy Stations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10980477</link><description>Renewable energy stations(RES) must satisfy voltage security and power factor requirements for safe and efficient operation.

Building on the analysis, an optimal allocation and two-level control (TLC) of reactive power is proposed. It integrates the optimization of reactive power compensator (RPC) with the coordinated control of reactive resources, thereby balancing voltage regulation and power factor. From the allocation perspective, an RPC optimization method is proposed to maximize the feasible voltage range of RES under varying active power conditions of RES. From the control perspective, a TLC scheme is proposed, combining station and unit control. At the station level, the controller features a mode-switching function and calculates the overall reactive power reference value. At the unit level, the controller coordinates the converter-interfaced generations (CIGs) and RPC. Case studies are conducted on a real RES project in Bazhou, Xinjiang, China. Matlab/Simulink and Opal-RT real-time simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method enhances both voltage security and economic efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Autonomous Voltage Regulation for Smart Distribution Network With High-Proportion PVs:A Graph Meta-Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10982124</link><description>Smart distribution grids with a high percentage of distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems often face severe voltage quality problems. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) presents great potentials in achieving optimal voltage level control in distribution grids with the advantage of learning without explicit modeling. However, when DRL is applied to active voltage regulation in distribution grids with a high proportion of distributed photovoltaic (PV) power generation, it encounters several challenges, such as uneven learning among controllable devices and environmental instability, which impede the convergence of DRL. In addition, traditional reinforcement learning represents the distribution network with vectors and ignores topology information. In this paper, we transform the voltage control problem into a partially observable Markov decision process, and propose a multi-agent meta-reinforcement learning algorithm based on graph convolutional networks to improve voltage quality by combining DRL with meta-learning (ML). By integrating ML, our approach allows agents to better predict the actions of other agents, thus mitigating the instability of the environment. To address the problem of uneven learning among agents, we incorporate a self-concern mechanism and a value decomposition method into the critique network. The proposed algorithm is validated through experiments on IEEE 33-bus, 141-bus, and 322-bus systems and compared with five other multi-agent DRL methods and model-based model predictive control algorithms.</description></item><item><title>FDCA-DSTGCN: A Wind Farm Cluster Power Day-Ahead Prediction Model Based on Frequency Domain Information Gain and Dynamic Trend Sensing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10982214</link><description>Accurate wind farm cluster power prediction (WFCPP) is of vital significance for new power systems with large-scale wind power integration. The current WFCPP modeling method ignores the important role of wind direction and frequency domain information, resulting in insufficient use of spatial information and difficult to improve the prediction accuracy. In order to solve the above problems, a day-ahead power prediction model for wind farm cluster power is proposed based on information gain in frequency domain and dynamic trend sensing. Firstly, a cluster division method based on graph theory and progressive fusion of multiple information is proposed, and a virtual information node is set up. Secondly, a method to identify prevailing wind direction under time window is proposed for subsets, and a dynamic weighted directed graph structure is designed based on prevailing wind direction and wind speed. Thirdly, a dynamic spatio-temporal graph convolutional network model with frequency domain gain channel attention mechanism (FDCA-DSTGCN) is proposed to integrate the above information and complete the prediction. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a wind farm cluster in Inner Mongolia of China. Compared with the existing and traditional prediction methods, the normalized root mean square error of the proposed method is reduced by 1.13%&#8211;2.15%, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Assessing the Impact and Quantifying the Value of Flexibility in Transactive Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10989551</link><description>Distributed Flexibility (DF) is seen as a key tool in managing future distribution networks, but there are no comprehensive methods to quantify its value to stakeholders and impact on the network. Consequently, the potential costs and benefits of DF are uncertain, delaying the rollout of the concept onto real networks. This paper proposes a method to address that gap: a network-aware framework for modelling the interaction of DF with local and whole system markets to analyse the system performance in detail. The paper provides a set of mathematical models and algorithms to derive realistic supply and demand curves for flexibility in a distribution system, find the global equilibrium of multiple markets and services, model their impacts on networks, and perform cost-benefit analysis for stakeholders. The framework has been applied to a case study comprising a real network in England, forecast data of flexible demand and distributed generation, and the prices expected in the electricity system. The numerical study showed that DF can bring real value to all stakeholders when procured through markets; however, to maintain positive and consistent benefits to networks and stakeholders, appropriate price signals (i.e., tariffs and charges) must be designed for each network individually.</description></item><item><title>Coordinated Control of Grid-Forming Wind Turbines and Grid-Forming Energy Storage Systems for Power System Restoration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002600</link><description>Grid-forming wind turbines (GFM-WTs) provide a promising solution for the restoration of wind-integrated power systems owing to their fast restart and grid support capabilities. However, individual GFM-WTs rely on external GFM sources for self-start, and their GFM support capability may be hindered by wind power shortages, potentially causing restoration failures. To address these challenges, this paper combines GFM-WTs and GFM energy storage systems (ESSs) to construct a black-start source for power system restoration. The GFM-ESS can provide self-start conditions for the GFM-WT while also improving its GFM support capability to withstand wind power shortages and load restoration transients. To ensure the stability of the restored system, a coordinated control strategy is proposed. First, a pre-synchronization control is designed to enable the GFM-WT to seamlessly connect with the GFM-ESS. Second, a power system stabilizer is developed to mitigate the power oscillation between the parallel GFM-WT and GFM-ESS. Third, to coordinate their power outputs during the load restoration, a model predictive secondary frequency control considering the stability of the WT rotor speed and system frequency is presented. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can improve the stability and security of the system restoration process under wind power shortages.</description></item><item><title>Rotor Thrust Control for Large-Scale Wind Turbine in Near-Rated Wind Speed Region</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11003805</link><description>To limit the maximum rotor thrust in the near-rated wind speed region, this paper proposes a novel rotor thrust control scheme for large-scale wind turbines operating. It contains a rotor thrust identificator, a rotor thrust control loop, and a feedforward blade pitch controller. A simplified blade model is first proposed to achieve rotor thrust identification. Based on blade element momentum theory, the rotor thrust can be identified by the blade root out-of-plane bending moments. The rotor thrust control loop is then designed with the identified rotor thrust. Then, a feedforward blade pitch saturator is designed, called Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion based minimum Pitch Saturator (NDI-PS). It is realized by nonlinear dynamic inversion of the thrust coefficient curve. The simulation results exhibit outstanding performance of the proposed control scheme. Compared with existing controllers of NREL and Goldwind, power output is increased by 1% to 1.5%, while blade root and tower bottom loads are mitigated by about 4% .</description></item><item><title>Feature-Driven Microgrid Economic Dispatch via Solar-Induced Contingent Balancing Satisficing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11005474</link><description>For the multiple energy microgrid (MEMG), this paper builds an adaptive Wasserstein distance-based ambiguity set instead of characterizing its size for solving the economic dispatch (ED) problem considering uncertain solar outputs. With the ambiguity set, an electrothermal balancing satisficing (EBS) framework is proposed by defining a solar-induced contingent electrothermal balancing risk measure (SCEB-RM) to interpret the risk level for maintaining electrothermal balance under solar uncertainty. For comprehensive contingent cost targets, a multi-objective EBS is extended to refine the solar impact on electric and thermal energy resources, respectively, and provide the corresponding out-of-sample cost bounds. Using the realized solar data, a feature-driven EBS model is formulated by incorporating soft dynamic time warping-based k-means clustering into the ambiguity. A tractable counterpart is obtained by developing a solution approach on bilateral responsive affine resource adaptation, where satisfactory targets are specified by comparing with sample robust optimization as the baseline, serving as an instance. Using real-world datasets, combinations of IEEE test systems and thermal networks validate that EBS eliminates the risky condition of uncertainty while revealing the connection between targets and solutions. It is shown that cluster-wise information makes EBS withstand greater uncertainty as effectively as the state-of-the-art in most cases and sometimes better.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Mean-Corrected Recursive Estimation-Based Optimal DER Dispatch for Distribution System Voltage Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11004617</link><description>Recent advances in smart inverters offer opportunities to mitigate adverse grid impacts caused by high penetrations of distributed photovoltaics (PV) in distribution grids, such as voltage violations. This paper proposes a novel measurement-driven optimal power flow (OPF)-based distributed energy resource management system (DERMS) voltage regulation via recursive sensitivity estimation informed coordinated control of distributed PV inverters. The proposed approach leverages available grid and controllable DER measurements, eliminating reliance on system model information while being adaptive and robust to volatile operating conditions. A mean-corrected recursive ridge regression (MCRRR) algorithm is proposed for sensitivity estimation, continuously refining the sensitivity model through a closed-form solution. It effectively manages varying grid operating conditions, such as changes in power injections and topology reconfiguration, to facilitate a time-varying update of the Load Sensitivity Factors (LSF). The proposed approach is formulated as a linear programming (LP) problem and is thus scalable to larger-scale distribution systems. Its effectiveness and efficiency are demonstrated on a realistic distribution feeder with high PV penetrations in Southern California, USA</description></item><item><title>Voltage and Frequency Stability Constrained Unit Commitment for Power Systems With Heterogeneous Regulation Resources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11005481</link><description>The growing integration of converter-based renewable energy sources (RESs) and the retirement of conventional units are pushing modern power systems closer to their stability limits. Imposing stability constraints in scheduling models is crucial to maintaining secure operations. This paper develops a novel voltage and frequency stability constrained unit commitment (UC) model for power systems with heterogeneous regulation resources, including synchronous generators (SGs), synchronous condensers, condenser retrofitted SGs, and wind power generators with grid-following or grid-forming converters. The frequency stability constraints encompass critical metrics across the entire frequency response process, effectively capturing the unique dynamics of diverse resources. The voltage stability constraints prioritize the long-term stability of buses with low stability margins, particularly those heavily penetrated by RESs. Furthermore, the proposed model captures the inherent coupling between frequency and voltage stability, offering extensibility for broader applications. To ensure computational efficiency, nonlinear terms in the constraints are linearized using a piecewise linearization algorithm. The proposed two-stage UC model optimizes operational costs while maintaining system stability. Case studies on the modified IEEE 9-bus system and the IEEE RTS-79 system validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Damping Evaluation Method of the Power Systems Integrated With Wind Farms During the Sub-Synchronous Control Interaction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11005697</link><description>This paper proposes a distributed damping evaluation method (DDEM) to assess the damping distribution0 in doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind farms during sub-synchronous control interactions (SSCI). The proposed DDEM identifies sensitive control parameters of the DFIG wind turbines at oscillatory frequencies through the explicit expression of the system's damping loss factor (DLF). It also evaluates the damping contribution by calculating the distributed damping loss factor (DDLF) for each element or subsystem in real-time. Initially, this paper presents the DLF concept for basic vibration systems and extends it to oscillatory power systems. Subsequently, an analytical expression of the DLF in DFIG-based wind farms is derived by calculating the dissipated energy and the maximum transient energy at the sub-synchronous frequencies. The DLF is then decomposed into DDLFs according to the physical structure of the oscillatory system, facilitating the development of the DDEM to evaluate the damping contributions. The efficacy of the DDEM is demonstrated through two case studies: the modified IEEE first benchmark model on sub-synchronous resonance (SSR) and the Guyuan wind power system model in North China.</description></item><item><title>A Secure Distributed Computation of Combined Heat and Power Dispatch Based on Transformation Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11008674</link><description>The widespread utilization of combined heat and power (CHP) units creates a tight couple between the power transmission system (PTS) and district heating systems (DHS). Since PTS and DHS are always managed by different operators with information security concerns, there has been a growing interest in implementing distributed solutions for combined heat and power dispatch (CHPD). However, existing distributed algorithms require an exchange of information, such as CHP output and dual multipliers, between PTS and DHS, posing a potential risk of information leakage. To address this issue, we introduce a transformation-based method to mask the CHPD model, thereby masking the real economic and physical coefficients using random nonsingular matrices. We discuss the selection principle for encryption matrices to diminish the additional computational burden caused by transformation. Then, we develop an improved Benders decomposition method by introducing valid inequalities and strengthening Benders cut to efficiently solve the masked CHPD problem in a distributed manner. The proposed secure analysis proves that the proposed method can resist two common threat models in information security, including semi-honest adversaries and external eavesdroppers. Numerical simulations are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Capacity Planning of Hybrid Renewable Energy - CCHP System Considering Inter Seasonal Borehole Thermal Energy Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11008841</link><description>Combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) systems are recognized for their high energy efficiency, with utilization rates exceeding 80%. However, traditional CCHP systems often rely on microgas turbines, contributing to carbon emissions. In this paper, we design a hybrid renewable energy - CCHP system, where the electric load is provided by photovoltaic and wind power, and the heating/cooling loads are supplied by converting power to heat by heat pumps. Considering the seasonal variability of renewable energy generation, we introduce borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) into the CCHP system, transforming the ground into a thermal storage that stores excess energy during summer for use in winter. We formulate the problem as a two-stage robust model with decision-dependent uncertainty. Then, we develop a customized algorithm based on Benders decomposition to effectively solve this model and discuss the algorithm improvement techniques. Our approach is validated through a case study of an actual system in Ordos, China, where the effects of BTES integration, uncertainty budget value, and varying ratios of renewable energy are analyzed.</description></item><item><title>A Quantum Annealing-Based Three-Stage Scheduling Strategy for Multi-Stack Fuel Cell Hybrid Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11014234</link><description>Fuel cell hybrid power systems (FCHPS) face significant challenges due to the non-convex nature of their optimization problems, especially in high-power applications with multi-stack configurations that involve numerous start-stop decisions, introducing a high number of binary variables. To address these issues, this paper presents a quantum annealing (QA)-based three-stage scheduling strategy for multi-stack solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)-based fuel cell hybrid power systems (FCHPS). The proposed method decouples the decision-making process across different timescales&#8212;day-ahead, intra-day, and real-time&#8212;tailoring decisions to the dynamics of various power sources within the FCHPS. In the day-ahead stage, global predictions inform the startup and shutdown of SOFCs; in the intra-day stage, short-term predictions refine power outputs; and in the real-time stage, adjustments are made to respond to immediate operational conditions. Quantum annealing is introduced to expedite the solution of the large-scale, binary optimization problems inherent in multi-stack configurations. A OPAL-RT-based experimental platform is used to validate the proposed strategy. In addition, a comparison between the proposed method and conventional methods is conducted, indicating that the proposed QA-based approach significantly speeds up the computation process&#8212;being 49.89 times faster than the dual model (DMPC) predictive control method and 22.25 times faster than the Gurobi-based method. It also optimizes the overall operational cost, achieving a reduction in the total objective function value by approximately 10.62% compared to the Gurobi-based method, and by 14.66% compared to the DMPC method.</description></item><item><title>Statistically Feasible Joint Chance-Constrained Scheduling of Integrated Distribution Network and District Heating System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11021270</link><description>This paper proposes a statistically feasible joint chance-constrained scheduling framework for integrated power distribution networks (PDN) and district heating systems (DHS). The proposed method constructs data-driven uncertainty sets directly from samples, eliminating the need for prior distribution assumptions. It integrates joint chance-constrained programming (JCCP) with robust optimization (RO) to reformulate the original problem. The resulting model is both tractable and computationally efficient. Additionally, we introduce a novel constraint-specific uncertainty set reconstruction technique. This technique refines the uncertainty set by incorporating optimization-relevant information. It significantly reduces conservatism while ensuring system violation probability requirements. Comparative studies with state-of-the-art uncertainty optimization methods demonstrate the advantages of our approach. The proposed method improves computational efficiency by two orders of magnitude. It also achieves more cost-effective solutions than the best-performing benchmark method.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Short-Term Solar Power Prediction Using Sky Image Sequences by a Residual Vision Reformer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11021656</link><description>The unpredictable nature of solar power generation, largely influenced by fluctuating cloud cover, poses a challenge to the stability of renewable energy systems. Considering this, accurate forecasting of solar power can lead to better grid management and operation. With the advent of deep learning models, various models have been suggested to enhance the ultra-short-term solar power forecasting performance. Given that cloud images offer more direct and comprehensive information about cloud patterns compared to the numerical weather prediction data, analyzing cloud images allows for more precise and efficient cloud change predictions, leading to a more accurate ultra-short-term solar power forecasting. In this way, aiming to enhance the forecasting performance, in this paper, we introduce a deep learning-based model, including three main blocks. In the first block, a Multi-Stream Video Vision Transformer (MS-ViViT) model is proposed for extracting different types of spatio-temporal features from the input image sequences. The output features from the first block are input to the second block, Fused Improved Reformer (Fused I-Reformer), including three Improved Reformer (I-Reformer) models equipped with a Fused Encoder as well as a new loss function for sequence learning. Finally, an Attentive Residual Fully Connected (ARFC) model is proposed for solar power value prediction. The comparison results with 36 comparative models on six real-world datasets using seven evaluation metrics confirm the effectiveness of the proposed ultra-short-term solar power forecasting model.</description></item><item><title>Dual Agent Framework for Scheduling Networked Microgrids Using DRL to Improve Resilience</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11021619</link><description>The widely reported increase in the frequency of high impact, low probability extreme weather events pose significant challenges to the resilient operation of electric power systems. This paper explores strategies to enhance operational resilience that addresses the distribution network&#8217;s ability to adapt to changing operating conditions. We introduce a novel Dual Agent-Based framework for optimizing the scheduling of distributed energy resources (DERs) within a networked microgrid (N-MG) using the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) paradigm. This framework focuses on minimizing operational and environmental costs during normal operations while enhancing critical load supply indices (CSI) under emergency conditions. Additionally, we introduce a multi-temporal dynamic reward shaping structure along with the incorporation of an error coefficient to enhance the learning process of the agents. To appropriately manage loads during emergencies, we propose a load flexibility classification system that categorizes loads based on its criticality index. The scalability of the proposed approach is demonstrated through running multiple case-studies on a modified IEEE 123-node benchmark distribution network. Furthermore, validation of the method is provided by means of comparisons with two metaheuristic algorithms namely particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA).</description></item><item><title>Sample-Wise Graph-Based Multivariate Short-Term PV Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11024230</link><description>Reliable short-term photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting is of crucial significance for the rational dispatching of power sources and the effective control of operating costs for the power grid. However, temporal misalignment and regression accuracy imbalance of PV power data pose significant challenges to the reliability of forecast results. In this study, multivariate PV power forecasting is investigated from the perspective of forecast model samples. Firstly, the extent of misalignment of a sample is parameterized by a time-delay vector. Subsequently, the sample-wise graph is defined to relate the time-delay vector with PV power data. Then, the time-delay vector is estimated by minimizing the smoothness metric of the sample-wise graph. Finally, a sample-wise graph-based sample weighting strategy is introduced to address the issue of regression accuracy imbalance. The efficiency of the proposed PV power forecasting scheme is validated through extensive experiments on real-world datasets. Comparison experiments suggest that the proposed scheme can achieve remarkably improved short-term PV power forecasting.</description></item><item><title>Error-Based Active Disturbance Rejection Power Control for Large-Scale Wind Turbines Under Pitch Actuator Performance Degradation Failure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11027442</link><description>This study addresses the critical challenge of constant power control for large-scale wind energy conversion system under the combined effects of pitch actuator degradation and multiple disturbances. In the paper, a novel fault-tolerant control strategy based on error-based active rejection control (E-ADRC) is proposed. The approach incorporates a composite control architecture, comprising a disturbance rejection tracking loop and a fault-tolerant compensation loop. Within the tracking loop, an enhanced E-ADRC algorithm is suggested which not only retains the robustness and ease of implementation of traditional E-ADRC but also significantly improves the attenuation of low-frequency wind disturbances&#8212;the turbine&#8217;s primary disruption. The fault-tolerant compensation loop applies independent control signals, derived from pitch angle residuals, to each faulty actuator, mitigating the extra fault disturbances in rotor speed tracking dynamics. This dual-loop structure enables the turbine to restore high-stability power output after a fault. Furthermore, the fault-tolerant compensation mechanism ensures that, even in cases of part of the three actuators failure, the previously misaligned pitch angles are synchronized, effectively suppressing the detrimental aerodynamic imbalance and reducing adverse loads. The superiority of this approach in enhancing power output stability and reducing structure fatigue damage have been validated through a refined hardware-in-the-loop test.</description></item><item><title>Grid-Forming IBRs Under Unbalanced Grid Conditions: Challenges, Solutions, and Prospects</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11027640</link><description>The penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) into the grid is experiencing significant growth. Their control behavior during unbalanced grid conditions can impact system stability and protection. This paper evaluates the performance of prevalent grid-forming control-based IBRs (GFM-IBRs) under unbalanced grid conditions and proposes novel insights in a novel framework. First, we investigate the potential impacts of grid-forming control-based IBRs (GFM-IBRs) on system dynamics, protection, and fault ride-through (FRT) capability under unbalanced grid conditions based on extensive literature review and through EMT simulations in benchmark systems with IBRs. To discover these impacts and accommodate unbalanced grid conditions, we implement a generic control structure for full converter-based GFM-IBRs under FRT mode, then perform a comparative analysis of existing solutions that include sequence decomposition methods, positive sequence current-limiting methods, negative sequence controls, and current coordination methods, to identify their capabilities and limitations through literature review and EMT simulations in a large-scale power system.

First, the large-scale AWE system is divided into multiple modules to reduce the variable dimension of the optimization problem. Then, a simplified module-level optimal efficiency model is developed based on the efficiency characteristics of AWE units. Subsequently, multi-objective optimization models are constructed at the module and unit levels, comprehensively considering hydrogen production volume, lifespan degradation, and utilization balancing. Finally, a finite-horizon rolling optimization mechanism is introduced to solve the two-stage optimization problem, improving the continuity and rationality of scheduling decisions at the end of each optimization horizon. Annual case study results demonstrate that, under the non-battery scenario, PSROS improves system efficiency by 9.92%, 11.12%, and 3.81%, and reduces the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) by 4.14, 5.43, and 2.35 CNY/kg compared with the simple start-stop strategy (SSSS), array rotation strategy (ARS), and rolling optimization strategy (ROS), respectively. With battery integration, the system efficiency is further improved by 0.77%, and the LCOH is further reduced by 0.49 CNY/kg.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Scheduling of Integrated Electric-Hydrogen-Thermal Systems Considering Hydroelectric Power Plant Peaking for Hydrogen Vessel Navigation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11030854</link><description>Transporting hydrogen by vessels may be more cost-effective than hydrogen trailers and hydrogen tankers, but it is also more sensitive to environmental factors (e.g., river levels). In order to capitalize on the advantages of based-vessel waterway hydrogen chains, a new short-term scheduling strategy of integrated electric-hydrogen-Thermal systems considering the hydroelectric power plant peaking for hydrogen vessel (HV) navigation is proposed in this paper. First, a temporal-spatial operational model of waterway hydrogen chains is developed. In this model, the relationship between the electrolysis temperature, hydrogen production efficiency, and maximum available operational power of the reversible solid oxide fuel cell (RSOC) is modelled. The impact of the hydroelectric power plant underflow on HV transfer is also evaluated. On this basis, a flexible multi-day collaborative scheduling strategy of the electric-hydrogen integrated system is designed, where the main power source, i.e., thermoelectric plant (TEP), is allowed to operate in pure power generation mode or cogeneration mode to release the operation flexibility. This scheduling model is first linearized as a mixed-integer second-order conic programming (MISOCP) problem and then solved efficiently through a two-layer method. Finally, case studies on a modified IEEE 118-node power system verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Region of Attraction Estimation for Power Systems With Multiple Integrated DFIG-Based Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11031118</link><description>The lack of suitable modeling methods for power systems with multiple doubly-fed induction generator-based wind turbines (DFIGWTs) integrated has left the analytical description of the boundary of the region of attraction (ROA) of such systems largely unexplored. To address this gap, this paper derives an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model for a power system with multiple DFIGWTs integrated. The proposed electromechanical model is validated in a single-machine-infinite-bus (SMIB) power system and a modified 3 machine 9 bus power system with root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of less than 9.5% for trajectory comparisons with the full model, demonstrating that it accurately captures the low-frequency dynamics of the full DFIGWT model. Subsequently, the ODE model is transformed into a polynomial differential-algebraic equation (DAE) model using a nonlinear coordinate transformation. To estimate the ROA, an enhanced expanding interior algorithm (EIA) based on sum of squares (SOS) programming is applied. The feasibility of the proposed model, along with the appropriate conservativeness of the improved EIA, is validated using two test systems that include multiple DFIGWTs and synchronous generators (SGs). By comparison, it is found that the time cost of the improved EIA is reduced by around 17% while maintaining the accuracy. These results demonstrate that the proposed approach has significant practical implications for the integration of wind farms into power systems, and offers an efficient tool for transient stability analysis.</description></item><item><title>Extreme Probabilistic Solar Power Prediction via Localized Sample Structure Recognition and Generalized Error Estimation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11033220</link><description>The fluctuations and uncertainty of solar power constantly threaten the secure operation and economic dispatch of power systems. Existing end-to-end point or probabilistic solar power prediction methods mostly lack effective integration of the two approaches, and the latent error caused by machine learning (ML) techniques is rarely taken into consideration. Hence in this paper, a combined extreme probabilistic solar power prediction (EPSPP) scheme is proposed, by integrating point forecasting with extreme error estimation. Firstly, the localized sample structure recognition (LSSR) is conducted to determine the neighborhood of meteorological conditions, where feature weights of Euclidean distance measurement are allocated with respect to the valid mutual information (MI) derived by two-dimensional diffusion kernel density estimation (2D-DKDE). Secondly, with the neighborhood generated by LSSR, an improved localized generalization error estimation (ILGEE) algorithm is put forward to infer the real-time maximal second-order origin moment of solar power point forecasting error corresponding to designated confidence levels. Finally, the solar power at each temporal moment is deduced as distinct Gaussian distributions, by modifying the mean value and variance according to statistical principles. For the sake of the so-called &#8220;extreme&#8221;, the proposed scheme could maintain reliability even under circumstances of the worst ML model precision. Cases from a real-world solar power station in Oregon, USA, are used to validate its effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>A Mechanism-Based Convex Model of Fuel Cell Systems Considering the Effect of Auxiliary System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10976439</link><description>Fuel cell systems (FCS) are recognized as promising electric sources of power systems. However, existing FCS models are either nonconvex or inaccurate when the FCS is under heavy load. This letter proposes a mechanism-based FCS feasible operational area (FCSFOA) model, taking into account the decline in fuel cell efficiency and the dynamic power consumption of the auxiliary system. Therefore, the FCSFOA model is accurate both under light load and heavy load, and the average error is only 5.4% compared with the actual data. In contrast, the FCS linear model, the most commonly used in the dispatch of power systems, has an average error of 24.4% . Besides, the FCSFOA model is also convex, which is favorable for the dispatch of power systems.</description></item><item><title>Mutual Information-Enhanced NARX-NN Digital Twins for Power Electronics in Smart Grid Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11131160</link><description>This paper presents a systematic and innovative data&#8211;driven framework for constructing Mutual Information&#8211;enhanced NARX&#8211;NN Digital Twins (DTs) of power electronic converters, demonstrated on a DC&#8211;DC boost converter in continuous conduction mode under closed&#8211;loop voltage control. A Digital Twin Instance (DTI) of the inductance current is built via time&#8211;delay embedding of hidden dynamic attractors. Sampling frequency is optimized using self&#8211;Mutual Average Information (sMAI) to capture intra&#8211;cycle Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) dynamics. Input preselection uses correlation analysis and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), followed by delay assignment via sMAI and cross-MAI (cMAI). The False Nearest Neighbours (FNN) criterion determines the minimal embedding dimension. Two NARX&#8211;NN configurations (4D and 5D) are trained on a high&#8211;fidelity MATLAB&#8211;SIMULINK model including parasitics, filtering, and non&#8211;idealities. Although thermal and voltage variations are excluded to isolate modelling effects, the 5D model outperforms the 4D under both nominal and perturbed loads. In the frequency domain (up to 50 kHz), it improves amplitude tracking. Experimental validation via offline transfer learning reduces steady&#8211;state error to approximately  $\pm \,1\%$  and transient errors to a few percent, peaking at -13% in unseen saturation case. The resulting DTIs are lightweight (&lt;1 GFLOPS), delay-aware, and interpretable, enabling scalable real&#8211;time integration into converter&#8211;centric smart grid digital twin architectures without solving differential equations.</description></item><item><title>RoCoF and Nadir of Frequency Optimization Control for Cluster-Oriented Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142799</link><description>The cluster-oriented microgrids can better manage large-scale renewable energy integration systems compared to individual microgrids, the operation control of microgrid clusters (MGCs) under disturbances still face numerous challenges. Apart from the mainstream steady-state requirements, the transient performances of nadir of frequency (NoF) and the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) exhibit more practical significance. To this end, this paper proposes a multi-index optimization approach to provide an optimal control-design solution for MGCs, enhancing the system robustness and security. Firstly, steady-state stability conditions directly related to two-layer cooperative (TLC) control parameters are derived using a quasi-invariance property. Secondly, the control parameter related sufficient conditions to guarantee the NoF and RoCoF transient performance indexes are analyzed and formulated through a matrix inequality. Lastly, a multi-index objective function is designed to integrate all these conditions, yielding optimal control parameters that make all constraints hold. Real-time simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Secondary Control for DC Microgrids With Near-Infinite Constant Power Load Accommodation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11151627</link><description>In DC microgrids, constant power loads (CPLs) inherently exhibit negative impedance characteristics, which are widely believed to degrade system stability as their penetration level increases. Consequently, extensive research has aimed to establish safe upper bounds for CPL penetration. However, these upper bounds are typically derived as sufficient conditions, making them overly conservative. Moreover, when multiple DC sources are connected in parallel to a common DC bus, the simultaneous need for current sharing and DC bus voltage regulation further complicates system control. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel distributed secondary control method based on the dynamic averaging of virtual voltage drops (VVDs). The proposed method offers two key advantages: 1) It ensures both precise current sharing and voltage regulation in single-bus DC microgrids, even in the presence of mixed ZIP loads, i.e., constant resistive loads (Z), constant current loads (I), and constant power loads (P). 2) Unlike existing approaches that impose conservative limits on CPL penetration, the proposed method theoretically demonstrates that the safe upper bound for CPLs can be arbitrarily large, enabling the DC microgrid to accommodate an almost infinite number of CPLs without compromising stability. Both Simulation and experiment studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Safety-Guaranteed Voltage Regulation of Distribution Networks Using a Learning-Assisted Switching Tube Model Predictive Control Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11124582</link><description>This article proposes a learning-assisted switching tube model predictive control (S-TMPC) approach to achieve absolutely safety-guaranteed voltage regulation in distribution networks (DNs). In order to model time-varying operation modes, the switching dynamics have been introduced based on respective equilibrium points in DNs. Then, to quantify the safe operation region of each mode, an active learning algorithm with a reliable oracle is developed to estimate the safety-guaranteed reachable set, which simplifies the conventionally linear-matrix-inequalities-based (LMI-based) computation. Next, considering power disturbances of renewable energy generation, a tube model predictive control approach for safe voltage regulation is introduced, and its exponential stability condition is given. Once the voltage deviation exceeds the boundary of the operation mode, a learning-assisted switching mechanism, of which the switching action is enabled by admissible minimum dwell-time analysis of switches among safe reachable sets (i.e., pre-learned tubes) is developed to absolutely ensure a safe voltage regulation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed voltage regulation method is verified by representative simulations and experiment tests.</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid Imitation&#8211;Reinforcement Learning Framework for Optimal Operation of Soft Open Points in Unbalanced Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11131604</link><description>This paper proposes a hybrid actor-critic framework for the optimal operation of a phase-changing soft open point (PCSOP) in an unbalanced distribution network. The framework combines algorithmic features of off-policy reinforcement learning and imitation learning. The reinforcement learning component comprises a policy-guiding module based on the PCSOP physics and an adaptive dynamic experience replay buffer. The policy-guiding module facilitates the agent&#8217;s navigation of the complex action space of the PCSOP. The dynamic experience replay accelerates agent training by leveraging expert demonstrations through imitation learning. As part of the design process, the paper also proposes a data-driven linearization of operational power losses in PCSOPs to enhance the convergence of nonlinear AC optimal power flow calculations without compromising accuracy. The proposed framework was trained and tested on a modified three-phase IEEE-33 bus and the multiphase IEEE-123 bus test feeders. Results demonstrate the superiority of our framework compared to three different methods, including the conventional nonlinear AC optimal power flow.</description></item><item><title>An Optimal Scheduling Framework for Integrated Energy Systems Using Deep Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning Prediction Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11127129</link><description>Model-free deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a promising method for addressing the scheduling challenges in integrated energy systems. However, uncertainty in system states continues to hinder optimization efforts. This paper proposes a hybrid framework that integrates deep learning prediction models with deep reinforcement learning scheduling models. Initially, Gaussian process regression is employed to extract interval information from stochastic variables, organizing the input data into structured time series segments. Subsequently, a hybrid prediction model, combining Transformer and long short-term memory networks, is constructed for multi-step interval prediction of these stochastic variables. Finally, a synchronized training mechanism couples the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient method with the hybrid prediction model, fully exploiting trends in system state changes to enhance scheduling performance. Experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework using open-source data to analyze the influence of different prediction methods on scheduling. Results show that the proposed approach improves overall performance by 22.4% compared to the baseline method.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Sizing for Large-Scale In-Situ Direct Seawater Electrolysis System to Minimize Levelized Cost of Hydrogen</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11131276</link><description>In-situ direct seawater electrolysis (ISDSE) systems are a promising solution for large-scale hydrogen production, leveraging seawater as a readily available resource. This article proposes a mixed-integer linear fractional programming (MILFP) model for optimizing the size of large-scale ISDSE systems powered by offshore wind farms. The model considers key system components, including novel seawater desalination, dynamic electrolysis, battery energy storage, and hydrogen storage, to minimize the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH). Further, to address the computational challenges of the proposed MILFP model, a model equivalent decomposition (MED) method is employed to reduce problem size, followed by a bounded Dinkelbach algorithm (BDA) to formulate and solve the resulting mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) subproblems. Finally, three real-life cases in China are studied to verify the effectiveness of both the model and solution method. This work highlights the importance of sizing optimization in enhancing the economic feasibility and production potential of large-scale ISDSE systems.</description></item><item><title>Weather Routing-Based Multi-Energy Ship Microgrid Operation Under Diverse Uncertainties: A Risk-Averse Stochastic Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11145936</link><description>The voyage environment, such as weather conditions, directly influences the propulsion load of a ship and even poses challenges to its safe journey. In this context, this article proposes a novel weather routing based operation approach for a multi-energy ship microgrid (MESM), which not only coordinates the heterogeneous onboard energy flows (e.g., electricity, thermal energy, green hydrogen, and freshwater) while also optimizing voyage route and speed based on dynamic weather conditions. In particular, a detailed weather-based route selection model and a weather-dependent propulsion load model are formulated, accounting for key environmental factors such as wind, waves, and drifting ice. To mitigate the risk against the uncertainties in environmental factors and cold ironing prices, a risk-averse two-stage stochastic programming integrated with a rolling horizon method is employed. In model solving, a tailored progressive hedging (TPH) algorithm is developed to enhance computational efficiency. Case studies based on a real cruise voyage in a Nordic country validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and the efficiency of the developed solution methods.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Reduction Method for Available Time Intervals of Large-Scale Demand-Side Resources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11121918</link><description>Incorporating demand-side resources (DRs) via virtual power plants into power system dispatch has become increasingly prevalent to increase power balancing flexibility. Nonetheless, diverse available time intervals for DRs impose substantial computational burdens for aggregation and may lead to infeasible dispatch after disaggregation. This work proposes an efficient reduction method for aggregating DRs with diverse time intervals and demand requirements while ensuring feasible dispatch. The method determines how to reduce the time interval ranges of all DRs to alleviate dispatch complexity. We reformulate an equivalent ILP problem with an available time interval matrix to reduce the problem scale. To further alleviate the computational burden, a fast approximation algorithm that combines interval clustering and weight selection is designed for large-scale DR aggregation. Numerical tests show that the proposed method maintains larger aggregated feasible regions to provide more flexibility than other inner-approximation methods, while maintaining feasible dispatch. Overall, the reformulated problem and fast approximation algorithm effectively reduce the computational time with a limited reduction in dispatch optimality.</description></item><item><title>Learning-Enabled Adaptive Power Capping Scheme for Cloud Data Centers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11123584</link><description>The rapid growth of the digital economy and artificial intelligence has transformed cloud data centers into essential infrastructure with substantial energy consumption and carbon emission, necessitating effective energy management. However, existing methods face challenges such as incomplete information, uncertain parameters, and dynamic environments, which hinder their real-world implementation. This paper proposes an adaptive power capping framework tailored to cloud data centers. By dynamically setting the energy consumption upper bound, the power load of data centers can be reshaped to align with the electricity price or other market signals. To this end, we formulate the power capping problem as a partially observable Markov decision process. Subsequently, we develop an uncertainty-aware model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) method to perceive the cloud data center operational environment and optimize power-capping decisions. By incorporating a two-stage uncertainty-aware optimization algorithm into the MBRL, we improve its adaptability to the ever-changing environment. Additionally, we derive the optimality gap of the proposed scheme under finite iterations, ensuring effective decisions under complex and uncertain scenarios. The numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method using a cloud data center operational environment simulator built on real-world production traces from Alibaba, which demonstrates its potential as an efficient energy management solution for cloud data centers.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Preserving Economic Dispatch in Microgrids via Robust Gradient-Tracking Over Directed Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11126159</link><description>Existing differentially private optimization algorithms for the distributed economic dispatch problem (EDP) often involve a trade-off between privacy performance and optimization accuracy. This paper presents a robust gradient-tracking based differentially private distributed algorithm to enhance both privacy performance and optimization accuracy for EDP. In particular, we employ solely row stochastic weight matrices to enable each agent to locally allocate weights to received messages. Moreover, unlike most existing approaches that rely on decaying noise, our algorithm integrates persistent noise into the exchanged information to enhance privacy performance. To mitigate the impact of persistent noise, we incorporate robust gradient-tracking techniques and introduce noise attenuation factors. By carefully selecting the step size and noise attenuation factors, we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves almost sure convergence while simultaneously ensuring  $\epsilon $ -differential privacy. Finally, simulation experiments conducted on the modified IEEE 14-bus microgrid system and IEEE 118-bus power system validate the effectiveness of our algorithm in terms of both convergence and privacy performance.</description></item><item><title>End-to-End Stochastic Predict-Then-Optimize for Cost-Efficient Water-Energy Resource Scheduling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142824</link><description>Compared to other energy-intensive industries, urban water supply systems are unique due to the strong temporal coupling with the power grid, which intensifies grid stress during peak hours. This paper addresses the water-energy nexus by developing a water-energy resource scheduling model for whole-process water supply that incorporates electricity cost prediction uncertainties. Meanwhile, to minimize the scheduling cost in an end-to-end approach, we propose the Stochastic Predict-then-Optimize (SPTO), which aligns prediction distribution with the optimality gap by integrating probabilistic forecasting with stochastic optimization. Unlike traditional two-stage approaches, SPTO establishes a closed-loop feedback between forecasting and optimization, reducing cumulative errors and improving real-time adaptability. To enable end-to-end training, we derive the SPTO+, a differentiable convex upper-bound surrogate function based on Lagrangian duality, which provides surrogate gradient computation for end-to-end training. Experiments on real-world systems demonstrate that SPTO significantly reduces operational cost and decision regret, effectively coordinating water operations with dynamic grid conditions to support cost-efficient and grid-responsive scheduling.</description></item><item><title>Disaggregating Distributed PV Power From Aggregate Measurements in Transmission Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11135456</link><description>The growing integration of Photovoltaic (PV) systems into distribution networks has limited visibility for system operators, as the power output of low-power PV systems is not typically monitored. The study presented in this paper introduces a novel approach for disaggregating PV generation from net-load measurements recorded at the transmission system level. The proposed technique is applied to actual data from an existing transmission line feeder to identify PV generation from net demand measurements. The developed methodology incorporates Geographical Information Systems (GIS) for detecting PV panels based on an algorithm that provides an accurate estimate of solar PV capacity. These estimations are validated against actual data from a local utility, showing a close match between the two. This information is then utilized in reliable software tools to simulate PV power generation in the studied region, which is then used to estimate and disaggregate the generated power from net-load data by applying multiple Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. The results demonstrate that, with the proposed approach, it is feasible to adequately disaggregate PV power generation from transmission feeder net-load measurements with minimal or no additional sensor infrastructure.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Objective Energy Management Strategy for Distribution Network With Distributed Renewable Based on Learning-Driven Model Predictive Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11130449</link><description>This paper investigates the energy management of distribution network with distributed renewable.

A battery energy storage system (BESS) is commonly used to manage these demand charges. Economic model predictive control (EMPC) with a reference trajectory can be used to dispatch the BESS to optimize the microgrid operating cost. Since demand charges are incurred monthly, EMPC requires a full-month reference trajectory for asymptotic stability guarantees that result in optimal operating costs. However, a full-month reference trajectory is unrealistic from a renewable generation forecast perspective. Therefore, to construct a practical EMPC with a reference trajectory, an EMPC formulation considering both non-coincident demand and on-peak demand charges is designed in this work for 24 to 48 h prediction horizons. The corresponding reference trajectory is computed at each EMPC step by solving an optimal control problem over 24 to 48 h reference (trajectory) horizon. Furthermore, BESS state of charge regulation constraints are incorporated to guarantee the BESS energy level in the long term. Multiple reference and prediction horizon lengths are compared for both shrinking and rolling horizons with real-world data. The proposed EMPC with 48 hour rolling reference and prediction horizons outperforms the traditional EMPC benchmark with a 2% reduction in the annual cost, proving its economic benefits.</description></item><item><title>Two-Tier Aggregation of Distributed Energy Storage Units Considering Network Access Purchase</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11131318</link><description>The number of distributed energy storage units (ESUs) within a distribution network is expected to increase because of the rapid deployment of 5G base stations, and they can be aggregated and formulated into a bid model of polytopic shape, which is consistent with market rules. However, it is challenging to design such a polytope that best captures their aggregate flexibility and satisfies distribution network constraints. This paper proposes a two-tier inner approximation aggregation model that aggregates the flexibility of ESUs first to the corresponding network buses and then to the substation. The uncertain power load of the 5G base station affects the minimum reserved energy of its backup battery. Therefore, with the aid of distributionally robust chance-constrained programming, a customized affine transformation-based method for inner approximation of the flexibility set is proposed to capture the charge/discharge logic and to handle uncertainty. In addition, the acquisition of network access limits is integrated into the optimal flexibility design of the aggregator by deriving the approximate form of the cost function in an auction framework. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of economy and uncertainty handling.</description></item><item><title>Cybersecurity by Design for Resilient Voltage Regulation in Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11131258</link><description>The transition to smart grids is advancing through the integration of grid-connected devices such as distributed energy resource (DER) inverters, distribution static synchronous compensators (D-STATCOMs), and electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, all of which play a vital role in voltage regulation within active distribution networks (DNs). Yet, these devices face growing exposure to cyber threats. This paper proposes a cybersecurity framework embedded directly within their control systems to address these risks by design. Drawing on the widespread deployment of distribution phasor measurement units (D-PMUs) for voltage monitoring, the framework incorporates a digital twin for real-time assessment, supported by data fidelity tests. This approach enables the timely detection and mitigation of false-data injection (FDI) and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, preserving voltage stability without requiring hardware modifications. Simulations on the IEEE 33-node test feeder confirm the framework&#8217;s effectiveness in strengthening the resilience and security of grid-connected systems, representing a meaningful step forward in the protection of smart grids.</description></item><item><title>Reliability Analysis of Virtual Power Plants for Peak-Regulation Service Using Phased Mission System Framework</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11133693</link><description>This paper proposes a reliability analysis method of virtual power plants (VPPs) for peak-regulation service by adopting the phased mission system (PMS) framework.

Besides, the single-phased binary decision diagram (BDD) model is proposed to evaluate the VPP&#8217;s performance of single-phased mission with the consideration of prime and auxiliary approaches for different tasks. Moreover, the whole-phased BDD model is proposed to analyze the VPP&#8217;s reliability for peak-regulation service by integrating the single-phased BDD model. Next, two reliability indices of VPP towards peak-regulation services are novelly proposed to represent the success rate and the insufficiency of peak-regulation service. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through extensive numerical tests on a verified IEEE test system.</description></item><item><title>Quantum Optimization for Optimal Power Flow: CVQLS-Augmented Interior Point Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11137411</link><description>This paper presents a quantum-enhanced optimization approach for solving optimal power flow (OPF) by integrating the interior point method (IPM) with a coherent variational quantum linear solver (CVQLS). The objective is to explore the applicability of quantum computing to power systems optimization and address the associated challenges. A comparative analysis of state-of-the-art quantum linear solvers&#8212;Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL), variational quantum linear solver (VQLS), and CVQLS&#8212;revealed that CVQLS is most suitable for OPF due to its stability with ill-conditioned matrices, such as the Hessian in IPM. To ensure high-quality solutions, prevent suboptimal convergence, and avoid the barren plateau problem, we propose a quantum circuit parameter initialization technique along with a method to guide the IPM along the central path. Moreover, we design an ansatz tailored for OPF, optimizing the expressibility and trainability of the quantum circuit to ensure efficient convergence and robustness in solving quantum OPF. Various optimizers are also tested for quantum circuit parameter optimization to select the best one. We evaluate our approaches on multiple systems to show their effectiveness in providing reliable OPF solutions. Simulations for the 2-bus system are conducted on a commercial IBMQ quantum device, while simulations for the other larger cases are performed using the IBM quantum simulator. While promising, CVQLS is limited by current quantum hardware, especially for larger systems. We use a quantum noise simulator to test scalability.</description></item><item><title>Aggregation of Heterogeneous DERs by the Subgradient Vertex Search Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11141502</link><description>The exploitation of distributed energy resources (DERs) is essential for the advancement of smart grids. However, the heterogeneity and scale of DERs pose major challenges to their aggregation, which is necessary to maximize their potential. This study adopts a linearized model that integrates a diverse array of DERs including power generation, energy storage, and flexible loads with varying dissipation rates. We used the model to analyze the compact form and mathematical implications of aggregation, for which we propose the subgradient vertex search method to solve. This method efficiently identifies vertices of the aggregate feasible region, which are used to construct its convex hull. Unlike traditional hyperplane-based methods, this method not only provides an inner approximation efficiently but also can converge to the exact solution. Numerical simulations validated its accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an energy flowchart to visualize high-dimensional space of energy change processes and provide a case study involving two vehicle-to-grid (V2G) charging piles to explain the mechanism of feasible region scaling, demonstrating the practical significance of precise aggregation.</description></item><item><title>Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning for Resilient Self-Proactive Distribution Grids Against Wildfires</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142361</link><description>With the growing risks and frequency of wildfires, power distribution systems (PDS) face significant challenges in maintaining reliability and security. Existing literature primarily focuses on post-event service restoration using stochastic optimization methods. Nevertheless, such approaches fall short in managing the dynamic and uncertain nature of wildfires, particularly when it comes to taking proactive measures to mitigate power outages. To address this problem, this paper introduces a wildfire smart resilience controller (WF-SRC) that utilizes a model-assisted safe Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) mechanism to reduce the impacts of wildfire-induced disruptions. The WF-SRC continuously monitors and analyzes both the status of the PDS and the spatiotemporal dynamics of wildfires, then executes preemptive actions to prevent wildfires from compromising distribution lines. These actions include optimally dispatching stationary and mobile distributed energy resources (DERs) that operate under a master-slave control scheme. While recent works assume full observability and formulate the PDS resilience problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), this approach leads to an impractically large state space and limited realism. In contrast, our approach models the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). This explicitly captures real-world sensing limitations, such as noisy measurements that arise during extreme events. The POMDP is tackled using an LSTM-TD3 DRL agent, enabling effective sequential decision-making in environments with incomplete information. Using real-world data from Alberta wildfires, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution in reducing wildfire impact, optimizing energy distribution, and enhancing robustness to uncertainties, ultimately contributing to a more resilient and proactive power grid.</description></item><item><title>Synergising Hierarchical Data Centers and Power Networks: A Privacy-Preserving Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142335</link><description>In the era of digitization, data centers have emerged as integral contributors sustaining our interlinked world, bearing responsibility for an increasing proportion of the world&#8217;s energy consumption. To facilitate the their fast rollout while progressing towards net-zero energy systems, the synergy of hierarchical data centers (cloud-fog-edge) and power networks can play a pivotal role. However, existing centralized co-dispatch manners encroach on the privacy of different agents within the integrated systems, meanwhile suffering from the combinatorial explosion. In this research, we propose a near-optimal distributed privacy-preserving approach to solve the non-convex synergy (day-ahead co-dispatch) problem. The synergy problem is formulated as a mixed integer quadratically constrained quadratic programming considering both communication and energy conservation, where Lyapunov optimization is introduced to balance operating costs and uncertain communication delays. To mitigate impacts of the highly non-convex nature, the normalized multi-parametric disaggregation technique is leveraged to reformulate the problem into a mixed integer non-linear programming. To further overcome non-smoothness of the reformulated problem, the customized  $\ell _{1}-$ surrogate Lagrangian relaxation method with convergence guarantees is proposed to solve the problem in a distributed privacy-preserving manner. The effectiveness, optimality, and scalability of the proposed methodologies for the synergy problem are validated via numerical simulations. The results also indicate that computing tasks can be migrated within the hierarchical data centers, demonstrating the flexible resource allocation capabilities of the hierarchical architecture, further facilitating peak load balancing in the power network.</description></item><item><title>Performance-Integrated Virtual Power Plant Management in the Frequency Regulation Market</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11146637</link><description>Renewable integration in power systems causes a surge of frequency fluctuations, primarily due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy. To address this challenge, distributed energy resources (DERs) pave one promising way for frequency regulation by their aggregation as a virtual power plant (VPP). For a VPP participating in the frequency regulation market, its regulation performance is critical for interaction with the system operator. This paper explores a performance-integrated management scheme for a VPP to optimize the utilization of heterogeneous DERs in the frequency regulation market. The relationship between the regulation performance and the DER reserve portfolio is first revealed through a data-driven method, which has rarely been studied in current work. This facilitates the integration of the mapped frequency regulation performance into the aggregation and disaggregation processes in the VPP management. Furthermore, in the aggregation process, the VPP&#8217;s feasible operation region associated with the high-dimensional variables and constraints is characterized through a cluster-based aggregation method. Given the massive heterogeneous DERs, this proposed method ensures satisfactory accuracy within the reduced computation time by efficiently capturing the representative DER characteristics. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified using real-world DER data from the Dataport database.</description></item><item><title>Assessment, Cause Localization, and Mitigation for Small-Signal Stability Risks in Multi-Parallel Grid-Forming Converter Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11151621</link><description>This article addresses small-signal stability issues for multi-parallel grid-forming converter systems based on a newly developed extended passivity theory.

The objective is to unify and simplify the tasks for (i) clustering visualisation, (ii) outlier detection and (iii) generative profile modelling under one concept. The lower dimensional projection of standardised MV load profiles unveils a latent distribution in a three-dimensional sphere. This spherical structure allows us to detect outliers by fitting probability distribution models in the spherical coordinate system, identifying measurements that deviate from the spherical shape. The same latent distribution exhibits an arc shape, suggesting an underlying order among load profiles. We develop a principal curve technique to uncover this order based on similarity, offering new advantages over conventional clustering techniques. This finding reveals that energy consumption in a wide region can be seen as a continuously changing process. Furthermore, we combined the principal curve with a von Mises-Fisher distribution to create a model capable of generating profiles with continuous mixtures between clusters. The presence of the spherical distribution is validated with data from four municipalities in the Netherlands. The uncovered spherical structure implies the possibility of employing new mathematical tools from directional statistics and differential geometry for load profile modelling.</description></item><item><title>Power-SAM: An Advanced Abnormality Change Detection Algorithm for Intelligent Monitoring in Power Equipment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11126170</link><description>Timely detection and management of abnormalities are critical to ensuring the safe and stable operation of the smart grid. To address this, a novel abnormal change detection (ACD) model, termed Power-SAM, is proposed for smart grids based on Artificial Intelligence. Firstly, integrate the strong generalization capabilities and efficient image segmentation performance of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) while employing fine-tuning strategies to enhance its applicability for processing images in power scenarios. Secondly, the Time Difference Feature Generator (TDFG) was designed to generate feature vectors suitable for ACD, allowing SAM to adapt to power ACD tasks. Thirdly, a feature fusion network, which combined feature aggregation with differential computation, was adopted, enhancing the model&#8217;s ability to detect subtle changes in power scenes.

In this paper, a charging station load uncertainty prediction method based on multi-dimensional quantile spatial-temporal traffic flow forecast is proposed. First, considering the complex spatial-temporal correlation characteristics of traffic flow, a traffic flow forecast model based on multi-dimensional spatial-temporal graph convolutional network is designed. The model can deeply explore spatial-temporal correlation characteristics and effectively capture both the static spatial correlations with fixed topological structures and the dynamic spatial correlations of real-time traffic flow. Second, taking into account the importance of prediction results under different confidence levels, this paper combines the forecast model with a weighted quantile regression model and introduces a novel weighted loss function, which can achieve traffic flow uncertainty prediction without the need to predefine the uncertainty probability density distribution and meet the differentiated requirements for uncertainty prediction in grid operation and business decision-making. Furthermore, considering the influence of factors such as road congestion and electricity prices on charging load, a charging station load uncertainty prediction model based on an enhanced queuing model is proposed, which can more accurately convert traffic flow uncertainty into load uncertainty, and thus more accurately simulate the charging station loads. Finally, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Learning-Accelerated Distributed Economic Dispatch in Vehicle-to-Grid Integrated Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119663</link><description>Next-generation smart grids require decentralized optimization frameworks to coordinate diverse energy assets, including renewables, dispatchable generators, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G)-enabled electric vehicles (EVs). A critical challenge lies in reducing the overall communication overhead and computational burden for distributed economic dispatch through learning-accelerated optimization, while addressing uncertainties in EV charging patterns, time-varying communication networks, and battery longevity constraints. This paper proposes a learning-accelerated distributed optimization framework for V2G-integrated microgrids. A novel alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) enhanced by deep neural networks, termed learning-accelerated ADMM (LA-ADMM), is developed to predict optimal dual variables, with theoretical convergence under dynamic network conditions rigorously proved. For handling EV uncertainties, the framework incorporates model predictive control (MPC) architecture with dispatch package strategies that minimize computational overhead through adaptive reuse of historical solutions during steady-state operations. Battery lifespan preservation is achieved through tight coupling of operational constraints with a universal constant current-constant voltage (CC-CV) charging protocol.

Electric vehicles (EVs), with their rapid response capabilities and growing penetration, offer promising potential for providing virtual inertia services. In this paper, a novel fast frequency response framework with virtual inertia of EVs is proposed in a coupled power-transportation network. The proposed framework addresses the complex coordination required across multiple stakeholders through a hierarchical approach encompassing grid operators, charging stations (CSs), and EV users. At the grid level, the optimal inertia scheduling is developed to reduce system costs, considering the spatial-temporal characteristics of EVs and power fluctuations. For coordination between CSs, a game-theoretic incentive mechanism is designed to maximize collective benefits while encouraging EV participation in inertia services. In each CS, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based inertia control strategy can achieve the optimal inertia distribution, considering both EV battery conditions and user requirements. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. This approach provides a feasible operation solution for providing EV-based inertia in modern low-inertia grids.</description></item><item><title>Risk-Averse Decision-Dependent Distributionally Robust Optimization for the Resilient Cyber-Physical Distribution System Against Contingencies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11126174</link><description>The cyber-physical deep coupling brings the distribution system the possibility of superposition vulnerability on cyber and physical spaces, which will potentially raise the unobservability and uncontrollability issues of the system, readily causing power outages during contingencies. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a resilience-oriented design for the cyber-physical distribution system based on a risk-averse decision-dependent distributionally robust optimization (DD-DRO) model. Firstly, observable and controllable intentional islands, as a promising way, are formed against contingencies by remote-controlled switch deployment, wireless communication configuration, and local controller activation. To this end, the cyber-physical coupling mechanism is investigated by hybrid wired/wireless communication modeling and fault propagation modeling, ensuring the cyber system&#8217;s observation and control. Secondly, reinforcement measures are adopted to mitigate the risk of uncertain contingencies, however, triggering decision-dependent uncertainty. To handle this uncertainty, the adaptive moment information method is developed to construct an N-k decision-dependent ambiguity set. Therefore, the proposed DD-DRO model is formulated and then recast to a mixed-integer linear programming problem by linearization techniques, which is solved by a customized nested column-and-constraint generation algorithm. Finally, numerical results on the modified IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 69-bus test systems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and method.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Sensing, Transmission and Control for QKD-IoT Empowered Power-Communication Coupling Smart Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11126162</link><description>Quantum-classical hybrid encryption has elevated security levels of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled distributed power control. However, the decoupled design of communication and power systems introduces substantial technical challenges. Outdated or tampered state data propagating from communication to power domains trigger cascading control failures, as demonstrated in the 2015 Ukraine grid cyberattack. This motivates us to investigate the fundamental question of how to achieve power-communication collaborative control optimization by proposing a cross-domain gap driven optimization framework of integrated sensing, transmission and control. Our novel framework addresses these limitations through three synergistic innovations: (i) accurate false data injection (FDI) attack sensing based on temporal correlation, (ii) secure data transmission based on hierarchical cooperative learning, and (iii) trust and delay-weighted consensus control. Its superiority is validated through simulations across diverse attack scenarios, grid topologies, and network scales. It exhibits strong scalability and robustness in large-scale complex grids. Key finding revels that blocking propagation paths of outdated and tampered consensus variables effectively mitigates control deviations and oscillations.</description></item><item><title>Self-Organizing Post-Contingency Distribution Network via Drone-Assisted Resilience-Oriented Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142358</link><description>Distribution networks with inverter-based distributed energy resources may increasingly face extreme events. While localized and islanded energy supply can enhance grid resilience, post-contingency distribution networks may struggle with efficient communication capabilities and energy sources owing to inevitably tight cyber-physical interdependence. Currently, post-contingency distribution networks do not comprehensively integrate cyber-physical self-organization capabilities using mobile resources. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a drone-assisted distribution network self-organization framework to enable operational data collection and control implementation, further maximizing the system resilience margin. Specifically, post-contingency communication services, i.e., data collection and control actuation, are scheduled via a multi-drone flight trajectory optimization considering drone recharging needs. Due to recharging periods with no emergency communication services, a resilience-oriented optimization is developed to co-optimize power injections and generator parameters for both static optimality and dynamic stability. This involves a compromised objective function that balances long-term energy consumption with short-term tolerant power imbalance. Finally, the proposed communication-control service provision framework is demonstrated through comprehensive case studies.</description></item><item><title>Exploring Smart Grid Vulnerability Against Intelligent Inverter Parameter Tampering Attack</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11159533</link><description>The integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) with inverter-based resources (IBRs) significantly improves remote management and monitoring capabilities of power electronic devices in modern power systems. Nevertheless, this integration presents significant security vulnerabilities, rendering smart inverters susceptible to various cyber threats. To this end, this paper develops a novel vulnerability exploration method for smart grids against IBR parameter tampering attacks. In particular, a zero-knowledge Destabilising Attack based on Fuzzing-Assisted Reinforcement Learning, named DAFARL, is proposed with the following steps. First, search engines are employed to explore vulnerable IBRs accessible via the Internet. Subsequently, smart grid stability sensitivity to parameter alterations in inverters is evaluated through the proposed fuzzing-assisted reinforcement learning approach, enabling the identification of critical parameters without prior knowledge of the system model. On this basis, an optimal attack strategy is then formulated, considering attack difficulty, risk, and computational efficiency to achieve the cost-benefit trade-off. Furthermore, the corresponding active and passive defense mechanisms are designed to mitigate the negative impact of attacks. In addition, electromagnetic transient simulations conducted on a modified IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate that inverter-level parameter manipulations can lead to severe system-wide stability degradation. These results substantiate both the effectiveness of our proposed sensitivity analysis methodology and the stealth characteristics of DAFARL.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Agent Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning for HVAC Control With Flexible DERs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11123597</link><description>As electricity consumption in commercial and residential buildings continues to rise, reducing energy costs presents an increasing challenge. Heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, which typically account for 40%&#8211;50% of a building&#8217;s energy use, are prime targets for energy savings. Intelligent control of HVAC temperature through the exploitation of HVAC load flexibility brings significant potential to reduce energy consumption and electricity expenses. The nonlinear models of HVAC systems challenge traditional control methods, while the uncertainty introduced by HVAC load flexibility complicates distributed energy resource (DER) management using conventional optimal dispatch techniques. In response to these challenges, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach. The lower-level agents focus on balancing comfort and energy conservation, while the upper-level DRL agents optimize the use of DERs to reduce peak demand based on the control outcomes of the HVAC by the lower-level agents. In the upper-level agents, we incorporate a multi-agent structure based on ensemble learning, which acts based on historical and current data without relying on precise load forecasting to address the delayed rewarding issue in DRL. This allows for the effective reduction of energy costs. The proposed method is tested using a real-world microgrid comprising 413 buildings in Southern California, and the results demonstrate that our approach can significantly reduce overall electricity bills while ensuring the comfort of consumers and residents.</description></item><item><title>EdgeHEM: Sparse Federated Reinforcement Learning for Home Energy Management at the Edge</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11126167</link><description>With the growth of energy demand and the popularization of distributed energy resources, home energy management (HEM) has emerged as a crucial technology to improve energy efficiency and reduce electricity costs. HEM systems at the edge can provide more efficient and personalized energy services for households through real-time intelligent analysis.

Network partitioning method can reduce such complexity by dividing the MGC into self-adequate partitions. However, existing dynamic network partitioning methods normally update the network partitioning results at fixed time intervals, which limits the ability to adapt to spatiotemporal variations in output of renewable energy sources (RESs), load demand, and grid topology. To address this, a dynamic network partitioning method based on an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) combined with depth-first search (DFS) is proposed. IGA is employed to optimize the partitioning index, and DFS is subsequently applied to obtain the network partitioning result. Furthermore, a dynamic update mechanism is designed to adaptively update the partitioning results according to spatiotemporal variations in system conditions. Simulation results on the modified IEEE 123-bus system show that the proposed method achieves better partitioning quality than the genetic algorithm (GA), spectral clustering, and Louvain algorithms while maintaining computational efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Tuning Friendly Deep Reinforcement Learning Method for Inverter-Based Volt/Var Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119650</link><description>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have been applied to power system problems in active distribution networks, including the inverter-based volt/var control (VVC).

This has become a major trend in the development of urban rail transit, particularly for connecting central urban areas with suburban regions and surrounding towns and cities. However, the issue of excessive capacitive reactive power in the AC metro power supply system, primarily caused by the use of cables linking various electrical systems, is especially pronounced during nighttime and initial operational phase. To address this, this paper proposes a reactive power optimization scheme for AC metro power supply system considering the trade-off between investment and benefits. First, the topology and operational mode of the metro power supply system are introduced, followed by the establishment of a reactive power flow model for the system. Subsequently, a series of evaluation indices are proposed to assess the reactive power level. Finally, a multi-objective optimization method for reactive power management, based on an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm, is presented. This method integrates both investment and benefit considerations. Using an AC metro system in a southern Chinese city as a case study, the results demonstrate that the proposed reactive power optimization method effectively mitigates the issue of excessive reactive power in the power supply system.</description></item><item><title>Online Task Allocation Based on Lyapunov Optimization and Fuzzy Control System in Vehicular Mobile Crowdsensing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11037266</link><description>As a powerful and promising paradigm, vehicular mobile crowdsensing (VMCS) recruits sensing devices on vehicles to collect sensory data, offering advantages such as low cost, wide coverage, and high data quality. Task allocation plays a crucial role in determining the efficiency and performance of vehicular mobile crowdsensing systems. However, existing task allocation methods are mostly designed for offline, single-task crowdsensing scenarios and rarely consider privacy protection, which cannot meet the dynamic and complex requirements of real-world applications. Therefore, we propose an online task allocation and privacy preservation scheme called Lya-FCGA (Lyapunov optimization with Fuzzy Controller-based Genetic Algorithm). To maintain long-term system stability, we utilize Lyapunov optimization to transform long-term objectives into per-time-slot queue control problems. Additionally, we introduce a fuzzy control system to adaptively adjust the genetic algorithm parameters, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of task allocation. Moreover, differential privacy technology is employed to protect workers' privacy and increase their participation willingness. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that our scheme reduces sensing costs while ensuring long-term system stability and effectively protecting privacy, showcasing great advantages and potential.</description></item><item><title>Nonlinear Observer-Based Air Supply Subsystem Control via a High-Order Fully Actuated Approach for Fuel Cell</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11039736</link><description>In the air supply subsystem of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), airflow rate and cathode pressure are key state variables and require precise coordinated control to improve the service life of the proton exchange membrane and enhance the air supply subsystem efficiency. However, the airflow rate and cathode pressure have strong nonlinearity and highly coupled characteristics, making it particularly difficult to precisely coordinate control. To tackle these challenges, this study presents a high-order fully actuated system (HOFAS) approach for PEMFCs to achieve accurate cooperative control of the airflow and cathode pressure. First, a HOFAS model for the air supply subsystem is developed based on the fully actuated system approach. The accuracy of this HOFAS model is then validated by the detailed comparison with the high-fidelity model. A nonlinear observer is constructed to estimate unknown disturbances, with its global stability rigorously proven. Second, a low-gain controller is designed utilizing the unique structure and advantages of the HOFAS approaches, with its stability rigorously verified using the Lyapunov method. Finally, the verification is performed on a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platform, demonstrating the effect of the proposed controller.

The proposed technique utilizes purposefully designed curved containers where a lens can freely slide with gravity, serving as a versatile add-on for existing aerial devices. In a basic configuration with a cylindrical container and a centered half-wavelength dipole antenna, directivity increases by 3.1 dB, enabling 360&#176; beam steering. In a more application-based set up using dielectric resonator antennas (DRAs) with semi-cylindrical/ semi-spherical lenses 1D/ 2D beam steering is achieved, effectively covering half-space areas. A continuous beam steering of &#177;35&#176; is demonstrated for these applications. Both solid and liquid lenses have been employed flexibly, offering a broader range of options in practical applications, and extending the viability of the proposed concept. Furthermore, only a small volume of material (&lt; 7 cm3) is needed for the lens. A good agreement between the simulated and measured results for both liquid and solid lenses has been observed, proving the feasibility of the idea. This study provides a potential low cost, energy efficient, light weight solution for inclined static platforms such as aerial vehicles, communication balloons, or simply in vehicular scenarios involving anticipated tilts or rotations.</description></item><item><title>FBL Driven Battery-Assisted Energy Harvesting Full-Duplex Cooperative NOMA With SIC and CSI Imperfections</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11036687</link><description>This paper explores a cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network that includes a multi-antenna base station (B), a nearby Internet-of-Thing (IoT) user (NU) with full-duplex capabilities, and several distant IoT users (FU). The NU employs a time-switching (TS) energy harvesting (EH) protocol, supplementing the harvested energy with a small amount from its battery to enhance the performance of FU. The study introduces a novel cooperative NOMA/non-cooperative (C-NM/NC) switching scheme, considering factors such as imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC), channel state information (CSI) errors, and nonlinear EH. Closed-form expressions for average blocklength error rates (BLER) for both users are derived within the finite blocklength regime. These BLER expressions are used to analytically express key performance metrics such as goodput, reliability, latency, and energy efficiency (EE). The study emphasizes the significant performance degradation caused by CSI errors for both users. It is shown that the novel C-NM/NC switching allows FU to consistently achieve performance on par with the C-NM mode, even when meeting a specific NU throughput requirement. Maximizing FU goodput is demonstrated to be possible through careful adjustment of TS parameters and battery energy. Moreover, C-NM/NC switching not only enhances EE but also improves self-interference immunity. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to validate the accuracy of the analytical results.</description></item><item><title>RIS-Aided Communication in CF-mMIMO System With Co-Existing Aerial and Ground Users: Performance Analysis and Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045816</link><description>Future wireless networks will seamlessly integrate uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ground user equipment (GUEs). However, UAVs in terrestrial networks often experience poor signal reception due to access point (AP) antenna down-tilt, optimized for GUEs. To address this, we propose a downlink (DL) transmission framework leveraging reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) system with co-existing UAVs and GUEs. The framework enhances UAV communication while maintaining GUE quality-of-service (QoS). Using signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINR) as the performance metric, we formulate a max-min SINR optimization problem to jointly optimize power allocation and RIS phase-shifts. Two novel algorithms are developed to solve this problem. Simulation results demonstrate significant UAV DL performance gains compared to benchmark schemes and reveal the impact of RIS parameters, such as tilt and element arrangement, as well as UAV density, on system performance. These findings offer valuable insights into the deployment and optimization of RIS in UAV-integrated CF-mMIMO systems.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Dimensional Optimization Framework for AUV Cooperative Coverage Path Planning in Dynamic Underwater Environments</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11039747</link><description>Efficient and robust coverage path planning for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is essential for applications such as ocean exploration, environmental monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. This paper proposes a multi-dimensional optimization (MDO) framework for AUV cooperative coverage path planning, which improves coverage efficiency through the joint optimization of communication, path planning, and obstacle avoidance. First, a dynamic communication topology model is developed to adjust the communication radius of AUVs based on the number of neighboring vehicles. This model prevents network congestion and ensures real-time support for global path planning. Second, building on this communication model, an improved whale optimization algorithm is developed to determine optimal waypoints for area coverage. The algorithm integrates a convergence factor, a continuous optimization mechanism, and a random search strategy, thus enhancing path coverage uniformity and reducing energy consumption. Finally, to ensure safe navigation, the MDO framework incorporates an adaptive Tangent Bug algorithm for collision avoidance. This algorithm dynamically adjusts the detection range and heuristic distance to generate a smoother and safer collision avoidance path. Simulation results demonstrate that the MDO framework significantly improves coverage rate, energy efficiency, and obstacle avoidance performance, offering an effective solution for cooperative coverage path planning in dynamic underwater environments.</description></item><item><title>Joint Beam-Target Assignment and Communication-User Association as Well as Power Allocation in a Radar-Communication Coexistence Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11063222</link><description>The increasingly congested frequency spectrum necessitates efficient resource allocation in radar-communication coexistence (RCC) networks. This paper proposes a power-saving-based joint beam-target assignment (BTA), communication-user association (CUA), and power allocation strategy to minimize total power consumption while meeting radar tracking accuracy and communication quality requirements. The posterior Cram&#233;r-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) and communication data ratio (CDR) are employed to quantify radar estimation performance and communication efficiency, respectively. To address the NP-hard mixed-integer programming problem, we develop a two-stage cyclically iterative expansion optimization method. This method iteratively expands feasible BTA and CUA domains via convex relaxation while solving power allocation through convex optimization, yielding a suboptimal solution with reduced complexity. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed strategy achieves over 17% lower power consumption compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks while ensuring PCRLB and CDR thresholds. In addition, the framework dynamically prioritizes targets and users with optimal channel conditions, enhancing resource utilization efficiency. The results validate the method's superiority in balancing computational efficiency and performance for extensive simulations.</description></item><item><title>Performance of Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems With Channel Aging and Phase Noise Over Rician Fading Channels</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045838</link><description>The cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) is considered as a key technology for sixth-generation (6 G) wireless networks. However, the system performance is affected by low cost transceivers and the mobility of the user equipment (UE) which can lead to the hardware impairment and channel aging. In this paper, we investigate the downlink spectral efficiency (SE) of the hardware-impaired CF mMIMO networks over Rician fading channels. More specific, the impact of the oscillator phase noise and channel aging as well as the correlation between the two factors are studied. Two downlink transmission modes, i.e., the coherent and non-coherent transmission are considered. Closed-form expressions are derived and verified by the simulations. In addition to the theoretical analysis, two strategies are presented in order to improve the downlink SE, namely, statistical channel cooperation power control and rate-splitting (RS), which have been shown to be able to improve downlink SE significantly. This paper also reveals that channel aging is the major factor that impacts the system performance compared with the oscillator phase noise caused by the hardware impairment.</description></item><item><title>UAV-Assisted Mobile Edge Computing With Digital Twin</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11214475</link><description>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) is a promising technology for providing timely and seamless computing services to mobile users by taking advantage of the flexible mobility.

Considering that the computing tasks arrive more frequently than the UAV makes flight decisions, we propose a two-timescale optimization framework, where the UAV's trajectory is planned on a large timescale, while the offloading decision and computing resource allocation are jointly optimized on a small timescale. With an objective to minimize the system delay while accounting for the constrained computing resources and energy of the UAV, we formulate a two-timescale Markov decision process, followed by developing a customized proximal policy optimization algorithm. To guarantee that the computing resource constraints are always satisfied, we further propose a safe projection method that directly maps the output of the policy network to feasible actions.

However, the considerable energy requirements during the rendering process present a formidable challenge, demanding a precise balance between energy efficiency and latency. Additionally, UAV-enabled systems may face significant security risks in untrusted environments. To solve these issues, we present a secure optimization framework for AR applications, where the blockchain is integrated into the system to provide distributed management and control functions. The critical information during the AR rendering process can be recorded in blockchain promptly to enhance security and privacy. In the proposed framework, a joint optimization problem is formulated to achieve the optimal trade-off between energy consumption and content delivery latency, where the rendering decision, resource allocation, and UAV placement are jointly optimized. Due to the tight coupling variables, the optimization problem is non-convex and difficult to be tackled by adopting the traditional method. To this end, we decouple the formulated problem and design a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based optimization algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, we innovatively combine the Lagrangian multiplier iterative (LMI) method and the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to enhance the solving efficiency by implanting the LMI method into the learning environment of DRL. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can perform well for AR applications compared to other baseline solutions and traditional DRL approaches.</description></item><item><title>Uplink RSMA in LEO Satellite Communications: A Perspective From Generative Artificial Intelligence</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11036686</link><description>Consider an uplink rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) transmission in low earth orbit (LEO) terrestrial-satellite networks, by jointly optimizing the user access, transmit power splitting and receive beamforming. Despite advantages of deep reinforcement learning in online optimization, some issues still remain, i.e., the hybrid nature of discrete and continuous actions, low sample quality, and intractable representation of irregular environments. To circumvent these issues, we first formulate a parameterized Markov decision process (PAMDP) to represent the environment evolution, by parameterizing each discrete action as a continuous real vector, upon which the hybrid proximal policy optimization (PPO) is applied. Then, generative diffusion models (GDMs) are embedded into hybrid PPO to output the optimal action distribution, by adding the pure Gaussian noise with states into denoising networks. Experiments results corroborate that GDMs-assisted hybrid PPO achieves larger rewards with stability and faster convergence. Further, the proposed method dominates other benchmarks, under different terminal numbers, transmit power budgets and noise levels.</description></item><item><title>Optimization of Weighted Energy Efficiency for RSMA-RIS-Assisted ISAC System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11036692</link><description>To release the potential energy efficiency (EE) improvement via the interplay between reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, this work maximizes the weighted energy efficiency (WEE) of the RSMA-RIS-ISAC system by jointly optimizing active beamforming at base station, passive beamforming at RIS and common rate with constraints of transmit power and unit-modulu reflection of RIS.

However, in complex urban environments, the network performance may be severely restricted by transmission blockages. With the help of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), this paper leverages a virtual line-of-sight link to guarantee the quality-of-service (QoS). First, a three-dimensional geometry-based stochastic channel model is developed to characterize the IRS-empowered ISAC networks with RSMA. Based on the proposed channel model, we formulate an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem, subject to transceiver beamforming constraints, IRS phase shift constraints, and QoS constraints. The impact of some important system parameters on the EE is numerically investigated using the proximal policy optimization method. One key observation of our results is that the system EE degrades significantly at higher frequencies even for double-Rayleigh fading channels, which may make it difficult for the subsequent sensing link establishment.</description></item><item><title>Optimized Beamforming for Multi-Antenna Downlink NOMA With Low-Resolution DACs and ADCs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045220</link><description>Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has emerged as a promising technique for enabling massive connectivity and enhancing spectral efficiency. However, the adoption of low-resolution digital-to-analog converters and analog-to-digital converters in practical systems introduces significant quantization errors, posing challenges for system performance. This paper proposes a novel beamforming design for downlink NOMA systems that accounts for quantization errors caused by low-resolution converters. Leveraging the additive quantization noise model, we derive an expression for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of each user and formulate a power minimization problem under SINR-based quality-of-service constraints. To simplify the problem, we introduce a relaxation method that enables a solution using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, leading to near-optimal beamforming vectors.

The carrier recombination lifetime of cells is derived from measured Suns-Voc data based on sample-specific inputs of substrate thickness and resistivity. This work presents a sensitivity analysis of the carrier recombination lifetime measurements on silicon photovoltaic cells due to uncertainty in input thickness and resistivity and proposes best practices to reduce these uncertainties to achieve results with a high level of confidence. J0e uncertainties less than 1 fA/cm2 can be achieved with measurement or knowledge of input parameters beyond what is given on a specification sheet.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Photovoltaic Power Forecasting Using the LGB Model and Synthetic Features</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10969139</link><description>Over the past decade, the growing demand for sustainable energy has led to significant interest in photovoltaic (PV) power generation. Due to its intermittent nature, accurate PV power forecasting is essential for the efficient management and monitoring of PV systems. In this context, the accuracy of meteorological data is critical. However, it is not always possible to obtain such data on a local basis, and often some information, such as irradiance, is obtained from models whose characteristics are not known in detail. To overcome this limitation, this study evaluates five synthetic features that combine clear-sky global horizontal irradiance and cloudiness data to estimate total irradiance in the absence of direct measurements. A light gradient boosting model is used to evaluate the predictive performance of a model using these synthetic features compared to a model based on conventional meteorological inputs, including irradiance. The results, evaluated over a reference week, show that the feature labeled $\chi _{5}$ slightly improves model accuracy (passing from an RMSE of 84.013 to 87.232 W/kWp and $R^{2}$ from 0.888 to 0.875). These results show that synthetic features can achieve comparable results and in some cases even improve prediction performance.</description></item><item><title>Study of Photovoltaic Parameters of Efficient Bulk-Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells for Indoor Applications Under Varied Intensities and Indoor LED Lighting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11123166</link><description>Bulk-heterojunction devices with D18 and Y12 as active material were fabricated with an inverted ITO/zinc oxide/active material/molybdenum (III) oxide/Ag structure. Donor D18 and acceptor Y12 have complementary absorption spectra covering the visible range (300&#8211;800 nm). Furthermore, the energy layer alignment of these materials also makes it easier for charge generation and transport. All these factors lead to exploiting the possibility of using these organic solar cells (OSCs) for indoor photovoltaic (IPV) applications. The devices prepared previously were soaked in light (AM1.5 G) and illuminated under three types of white LED: warm white, standard white, and cool white. The intensities of the lights were varied, and the photovoltaic parameters of the cells were recorded. The variation of photovoltaic parameters with the intensity and color-correlated temperature (CCT) of different lights was thoroughly studied in this work. The external quantum efficiency of devices was also recorded. Here, we obtained cells with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.88% in AM1.5 G, which went up to 27.58% in indoor lighting. All the devices were prepared without the nitrogen glovebox and were characterized in ambient conditions, which is the first step toward commercializing and integrating the cells in the Internet of Things (IoTs). IPV, being an emerging field, the study of photovoltaic parameters under varied intensity of light and different lights reveals a lot of information about the behavior of cells. Such a study has never been performed before, and the correlation between intensity and CCT of light with photovoltaic parameters and PCE unveils invaluable information about indoor OSCs. The results of this study could potentially aid in optimizing and developing OSC for self-sustaining IoTs in the near future.</description></item><item><title>Uncovering Structure&#8211;Performance Relationships in Organic Photovoltaics: Interpretable Machine Learning Model for Predicting the Power Conversion Efficiency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11123139</link><description>Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) represent a promising photovoltaic technology, but the design of candidate molecules has traditionally followed a trial-and-error approach, which is inefficient. However, machine learning provides a data-informed strategy by learning from large OPV material datasets, supporting the accelerated discovery and optimization of high-performance OPV materials. In this study, we use an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model to predict the density functional theory-calculated power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OPV donor materials using structural features extracted from the Harvard Photovoltaic Dataset (HOPV15) dataset. To enhance predictive performance, we select the most informative molecular fingerprints based on the averaged feature importance scores from both random forest and XGBoost. Our XGBoost model achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy on HOPV15 with $R^{2}$ = 0.918 and RMSE = 0.302%, outperforming prior methods. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations, we identify key Morgan and PubChem substructures that influence PCE, offering interpretable insights. This framework supports accurate, explainable OPV prediction and holds promise for high-throughput screening.</description></item><item><title>Color Engineering in CIGS Solar Cells: An Electro-Optical Modeling Perspective</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11126070</link><description>Photovoltaic panels are typically black or dark blue, which can limit their integration into the surrounding environment. Enhancing their appearance through color modifications can promote broader adoption, particularly for building integrated applications. Optimizing the performance of colored Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) cells requires a thorough understanding of how layer thickness influences both color hue and efficiency. We analyze colored CIGS solar cells using a self-consistent electro-optical simulation approach. Unlike previous studies that focus solely on optical properties, our approach integrates both optical and electrical modeling to provide a more accurate assessment of device performance. By accounting for light behavior, charge generation, recombination processes, and electrical transport, we analyze how variations in layer thickness influence both color and efficiency. In addition, we examine the effects of installation angle and lighting conditions on color perception and power output. This study offers deeper insights into the mechanisms governing colored CIGS solar cells, contributing to a more precise assessment of their practical implementation across different applications. A color&#8211;geometry&#8211;performance map is developed to evaluate whether the manufactured colored CIGS solar cells meet both aesthetic and performance criteria as well as to explain the observed behavior.</description></item><item><title>Postannealing in Metal&#8211;Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition Reactor: A Scalable Method for Improving InGaAsP Solar-Cell Efficiency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11173713</link><description>InGaAsP solar cells with a bandgap of approximately 1.05 eV, which are lattice matched to InP substrates, generally exhibit relatively lower crystal quality and energy conversion efficiency compared with other III&#8211;V compound semiconductor solar cells, such as the GaAs solar cell. This is mainly owing to the challenges in achieving a uniform chemical composition and reducing nonradiative recombination defects during the growth process. In this study, we effectively addressed this challenge by directly performing postannealing within the metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition system. Following annealing, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current density (JSC) of the solar cells were improved by 38 mV and 3.84 mA/cm2, respectively. The analysis of voltage losses, along with time-resolved photoluminescence results, revealed that the improvements in VOC and JSC were attributed to the reduction of nonradiative recombination defects and enhancement of carrier lifetime, respectively. X-ray diffraction analysis showed a reduction in the full width at half maximum of the peak in annealed InGaAsP samples, indicating that annealing significantly enhanced the compositional uniformity of the material, which was likely driven by the redistribution of group-III atoms (In and Ga in InGaAsP) during the thermal annealing process. In addition, low-temperature photoluminescence results confirmed a reduction in nonradiative recombination defects, further corroborating the findings from the voltage-loss analysis. Postannealing treatments have significantly enhanced the crystal quality of InGaAsP, leading to a notable 32% improvement in the efficiency of InGaAsP solar cells in the best cases. Thus, this study highlighted annealing as an effective and scalable approach to optimizing the growth process for InGaAsP-based solar cells.</description></item><item><title>New Model for Estimating the Temperature and Solar Irradiance of Photovoltaic Panels Based on Maximum Power Point Tracking Measurements</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11165153</link><description>This article proposes a new method for estimating the temperature and irradiance of a photovoltaic module using current and voltage measurements within a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control system. Unlike traditional methods that depend on external data, such as those provided by complex irradiance and wind speed sensors and equipment, this approach relies solely on panel-specific I&#8211;V measurements needed for MPPT, enabling accurate estimations through a simpler and real-time method. A comparative evaluation of various panel temperature estimation techniques confirms that the proposed method outperforms existing ones, resulting in mean absolute estimation errors below 1 &#176;C for temperature and 4 W/m2 for irradiance. The method effectively addresses temperature variations, particularly under low irradiance conditions, where the proportional relationship between current and irradiance becomes less reliable. Results indicate that incorporating the estimated panel temperature significantly enhances irradiance predictions, especially in real-world operating conditions. Furthermore, the method remains valid even as the panel ages, making it a valuable tool for optimizing photovoltaic system performance. Given its simplicity and its low cost, this technique is well suited for real-time monitoring and optimization of solar energy installations.</description></item><item><title>Experimental Investigations on Performance and Safety of c-Si PV Modules Installed in Hot Semiarid Climatic Conditions in India</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11153737</link><description>In this study, field testing of multicrystalline-Si photovoltaic (PV) modules was carried out in a 760-kWp grid-interactive solar PV (SPV) power plant at Manesar, Haryana. This study assesses the field-level defects and their impact on PV modules after the infant stage in a hot semiarid climatic condition, which was not reported earlier in any other works. The test methodology involved insulation resistance (wet leakage current test), visual inspection, infrared imaging, and I&#8211;V measurements in the field. The safety and performance tests were carried out for a period of 1 month, and the results were analyzed in accordance with the relevant IEC standards, i.e., IEC 62446-2:2020, IEC 61215-1-1:2021, IEC 60904-1-2020, and IEC 60891-1-2021. The results indicate that out of 125 tested PV modules, 83 (66.4%) failed in the wet leakage current test, 122 (97.6%) had hotspot issues, and all the modules exhibited visual defects, such as delamination, ingression of water, moisture and dust particles, snail trail, edge sealant degradation, corrosion of PV cell metallic contacts, visible cell cracks, and burn marks, in PV cells. For the PV modules tested, an average annual power degradation of 2.46% was observed with maximum and minimum degradation of 6.15% and 1.25% per year, respectively. The failure mode and effects analysis outcomes suggest that the maximum risk level for PV modules under investigation is edge seal degradation and delamination with the highest risk priority numbers (RPNs) (RPN = 360 and 350, respectively). The results presented in this article provide new insight on various aspects such as degradation rate and safety considerations specific to similar climatic conditions and will be beneficial for all stakeholders of SPV power plants including module manufacturers.</description></item><item><title>Computational Intelligence-Based Modeling of a UAV-Integrated PV Module in Icing Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11152334</link><description>Solar UAVs utilize solar energy to extend flight endurance and reduce maintenance compared to traditional UAVs. However, in-flight icing presents significant challenges, impacting both aerodynamic performance and the operational reliability of UAV-integrated photovoltaic (PV) systems. Ice accumulation on wings degrades mechanical properties, while icing on PV modules obstructs sunlight, adversely affecting their parameters. Partial shading from ice is more harmful than uniform shading, complicating PV module behavior analysis. This study presents a novel approach to model the behavior of UAV-integrated PV modules incorporating the impact of nonuniform in-flight icing into irradiance calculations. By analyzing how ice formation acts as an obstacle and considering its effect on the PV module governing equations, this research develops a computational framework alongside with segmenting the PV module's operational curve into two zones: ice-covered and normal. The parameters for these zones are determined using advanced computational intelligence methods. The proposed method enables predictions of PV module performance using trained machine learning models, enhanced by the minimum redundancy maximum relevance technique, under dynamic and adverse conditions such as movement-induced sunlight variations and partial shading. The trained models&#8217; performance is validated through experimental tests, demonstrating the reliability and effectiveness of the approach.</description></item><item><title>Wireless Sensor Network-Based Fault Detection and Localization for Solar Stations: An Experimental Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11107362</link><description>This article introduces a wireless sensor network (WSN) system that enhances photovoltaic (PV) performance during shading through real-time fault detection and adaptive optimisation.

In this context, this article proposes a new three-stage optimization-based framework for the grid-connected sizing of a PV power plant. In Stage 1, the $k$-means clustering algorithm is utilized to determine the placement and dimensions of the inverters, as well as the number of strings and the arrangement of PV modules in strings. During Stage 2, the DC wiring is sized to facilitate the connection between the PV strings and the inverters. Finally, in Stage 3, the AC wiring is sized to connect the inverters to the power substation. Stages 2 and 3 are formulated as mixed-integer linear programming problems to minimize investment costs and reduce AC power losses. The framework is implemented using different tools and libraries, including Quantum Geographic Information System for geospatial panel placement, Python libraries such as scikit-learn for clustering, and Pyomo for modeling the optimization problem of Stages 2 and 3 with the Gurobi solver. A real-world case study of a PV power plant located in Brazil, which covers an area of 13 000 m$^{2}$ and a nominal power of 1.2 MW, is used to validate the proposed framework. The results demonstrate the robustness, feasibility, and scalability of the proposed methodology.</description></item><item><title>Smarter PV Single Axis Tracking: A Study on Diffused Light Capture</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11141479</link><description>Solar trackers are advantageous for photovoltaic (PV) systems, typically generating more energy than those mounted on fixed racks. However, this is not always the case, when the sun is obscured by clouds, it is often more efficient to position the PV panel in a fixed horizontal position toward the zenith in order to collect the most diffuse irradiance. This study introduces a hybrid single-axis tracking (SAT) algorithm, named Sundelay, which utilizes sky images to determine the optimal moments for switching between sun tracking and a fixed horizontal position. Sundelay is evaluated through simulations conducted in two distinct locations: Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Eugene, Oregon. The simulations leverage a novel dataset comprising minutely recorded $180^{\circ }$ direct irradiance measurements obtained from a multiplanar irradiance sensor (MPI) and images captured by an all-sky camera. Our findings indicate energy gains of up to 4.3% with a 61% reduction in the movement of the SAT system over a month, while maintaining minimal impact on irradiance and movement during clear sky conditions.</description></item><item><title>An Interpretable Deep Learning Model for Solar Power Generation Forecasting in a Grid-Connected Hybrid Solar System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11214301</link><description>Solar energy adoption is rapidly growing as a sustainable option, with solar panels used on residential buildings, commercial properties, and large-scale farms. However, the unpredictable nature of solar power can lead to suboptimal energy generation from photovoltaic (PV) panels. Despite the high effectiveness of deep learning (DL) models in forecasting PV power, they often struggle with the perception of being &#8220;closed boxes&#8221; that lack clear explanations for their prediction results, which fail to highlight the key features for PV prediction. To address the critical issue of full transparency, this study explores a well-known DL model named lightweight deep neural network (LWDNN) in PV power forecasting, along with the application of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) tools like Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). Real-time data collected from a grid-connected solar PV system located in Dhaka were utilized to perform the prediction. By enabling XAI model interpretation, we identified feature contributions and explained individual predictions, reducing training computational demands without compromising accuracy. The reliability of the LWDNN model is assessed using both complete and reduced feature sets through performance metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2). The test results show that the proposed LWDNN model based on SHAP analysis outperforms conventional schemes by achieving RMSE = 6.180 kW, MAE = 1.939 kW, and R2 = 0.988. Finally, the model was implemented on a Raspberry Pi for low-power solar forecasting, demonstrating the feasibility of edge deployment.</description></item><item><title>Impact of Wind Speed and Direction on Cooling of a Pontoon-Based Floating Photovoltaic System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11196060</link><description>Floating photovoltaics (FPVs) are gaining traction as a land-saving alternative to ground-mounted photovoltaics (GPV). A commonly cited advantage of FPVs is their potential for lower operating temperatures due to the cooling effect of water. However, existing literature shows that the thermal performance of FPV systems may not consistently exceed that of GPV systems, as it is influenced by technology and location. Consequently, studying the thermal properties of a range of FPV systems is crucial to optimize power output and enable accurate energy yield modeling for new sites. This work investigates the thermal properties and calculated heat loss coefficients, or U-values, associated with the Faiman model for an FPV system using Ciel &amp; Terre's Hydrelio Air floats, located in a pond in South Africa. A dependence of U-values on wind direction was observed, with improved cooling when the wind approaches from the rear side of the system. The estimated U-value components were U0 = 21.6 W/m2&#183;K and U1 = 3.60 W&#183;s/m3&#183;K for wind from the front and U0 = 19.4 W/m2&#183;K and U1 = 7.10 W&#183;s/m3&#183;K for wind from the rear side. The impact of the observed cooling variation due to wind direction on system performance was also evaluated, revealing a 1.7% increase in median performance ratio when the wind originates from the rear side.</description></item><item><title>An Anomaly Detection Method for the Output Power of Photovoltaic Arrays Based on TKAN</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11137363</link><description>One of the greatest challenges facing photovoltaic (PV) power generation systems today is maintaining their operation at the desired power generation efficiency. To achieve this goal, the anomaly detection of the output power of PV arrays is crucial for ensuring reliability and safety. This article proposes an anomaly detection for the output power of PV arrays based on temporal Kolmogorov&#8211;Arnold networks (TKANs). First, a dataset of PV array parameters is constructed by selecting the time series of output power, ambient temperature, component temperature, and irradiance of the PV array as input features. Second, the PV array parameter dataset undergoes feature normalization by obtaining the boundary values of environmental information and operating parameters, and scaling them to the range of 0&#8211;1. Then, the processed dataset is trained using the TKAN neural network to obtain the anomaly detection model of the output power of the PV array. Finally, the proposed method is compared and analyzed with three other methods, such as Isolation Forest, $K$-means, and long short-term memory, verifying its reliability and superiority. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in a self-built PV power plant.</description></item><item><title>Is the Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) a Sufficient Indicator to Describe the Efficiency of Agrivoltaic System?</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11192315</link><description>The land equivalent ratio (LER) is a widely used coefficient by researchers in studies related to agrivoltaic systems.

The coefficients presented can help assess the validity of agrivoltaic implementation and to make the decision whether, considering given conditions, it is more desirable to realize a conventional photovoltaic power plant or an agrivoltaic one.</description></item><item><title>A 57.2 nW, 1.3&#8211;5 V VIN, &#8211;85 dB PSRR, 50 &#956;s Start-Up Time, Bandgap Reference Circuit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11127192</link><description>This article presents a low-power bandgap reference (BGR) featuring high power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) and fast start-up capability, operating across a wide supply voltage range of 1.3&#8211;5 V. A novel prebiased pulse current injection technique is proposed in the start-up circuit, achieving a 1% settling time of  $50~\mu $ s and a  $25\times $  speed gain during start-up. To enhance supply noise immunity, the proposed BGR employs a preregulated (PR)-based amplifier that effectively decouples the reference voltage from supply voltage fluctuations. Fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu $ m BCD process, the proposed reference occupies an active area of 0.0394 mm2. Under a 5 V supply, the circuit generates a 1.2 V reference voltage while consuming only 48 nA quiescent current. Operating down to a minimum supply voltage of 1.3 V, it maintains a low power consumption of 57.2 nW at room temperature. The reference exhibits an average temperature coefficient (TC) of 5.95 ppm/&#176;C across a wide temperature range ( $- 40~^{\circ }$ C to  $125~^{\circ }$ C) and achieves an outstanding line sensitivity (LS) of 0.00308%/V over the 1.3&#8211;5 V supply range.

Although duty cycling minimizes power consumption, synchronization with a base station or other devices requires periodic activation. Inaccuracies in the wake-up timer extend the active duration around the expected synchronization time, leading to increased energy consumption, which is especially critical in high-duty-cycle operations. This article presents a low-power digital compensation method to enhance the accuracy of a crystal oscillator (XO)-based wake-up timer over varying temperatures. The proposed approach dynamically adjusts the digital counter threshold value at each wake-up to compensate for XO frequency shifts caused by temperature changes. Delta-sigma ( $\Delta \Sigma $ ) modulation further reduces quantization noise for fractional time corrections. This work demonstrates the proposed technique on an existing low-power, miniature IoT system incorporating an exponential temperature sensor and employs two key strategies: 1) approximating the compensation curve as linear segments for simpler calculations and 2) replacing division-heavy operations with a successive approximation (SAR) method. These methods reduce the system&#8217;s time-shift error from 64.7 to 3.6 ppm using a single-point room-temperature calibration combined with adaptive temperature compensation, with a power overhead of only 7.92% (8.22 nW compensation +5.58 nW XO). Furthermore, a custom digital circuit for compensation minimizes the system power overhead to 5.07% (3.24 nW compensation +5.58 nW XO). Compared to state-of-the-art temperature-compensated XOs (TCXOs) using analog approaches, the proposed design reduces the power consumption by a factor of  $2.37\times $  while meeting the required time-error specification.</description></item><item><title>A 35.2-kHz, 75.4-dB Bulk-Driven OTA Using Degenerative Current Tram Structure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11147155</link><description>This article reports on the design of a high-performance operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) based on a degenerative current translation and mirroring (DI-Tram) circuit.

Traditional DPD solutions are primarily designed for scenarios where PAs operate at a constant average power level (PL) and thus cannot be directly applied, as the PA is a dynamic nonlinear system significantly influenced by PLs. To address this issue, a self-adaptive residual long short-term memory (SAR_LSTM) neural network (NN) is proposed in this article for wide dynamic power range quadrature switched-capacitor PAs (SCPAs). The proposed model adopts a two-stage approach comprising a power variation module (PVM) and a residual LSTM (R_LSTM). In the first stage, the PVM generates a power variation-dependent feature vector, which is then multiplied with the original input signal. In the second stage, the adjusted input signal passes through the R_LSTM to perform the corresponding predistortion calibration. This process tightly integrates the underlying causes of power variation in the SCPA circuit with our model, enabling highly accurate self-adaptive calibration across a wide dynamic power range without requiring parameter updates. In the measurement, a 15-bit transformer-based quadrature SCPA chip with Class-G and IQ-cell-sharing techniques is implemented in a 28-nm CMOS process and employed to verify our method. For the 802.11ax 40-MHz 64-QAM signal at 2.4 GHz, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior linearization performance compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, with an average adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) of &#8722;39.5 dB and an average error vector magnitude (EVM) of &#8722;41.6 dB over a 30-dB dynamic power range.</description></item><item><title>Independently Reconfigurable Multiband All-Digital Transmitter Using SMASH Delta-Sigma Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11218024</link><description>A multiband reconfigurable all-digital transmitter (ADT) employing a sturdy multistage noise-shaping (SMASH) delta-sigma modulation (DSM) is proposed in this article. The N-stage SMASH DSM is presented digitally using unit signal transfer functions across cascaded stages, which supports arbitrary-stage extension for multiband transmission. Each stage is associated with a specific passband. By activating different stage numbers and adjusting only two parameters per stage, the numbers and frequencies of passbands are reconfigured simply and independently. Consequently, computational resources are significantly reduced, which is especially beneficial for four or more bands. Furthermore, the DSM outputs are directly extracted from individual stages to simplify the ADT architecture while the high efficiencies of subsequent power amplifiers (PAs) are maintained. By using the SMASH DSM, an ADT with multiband reconfigurable characteristics is proposed. With a resource-performance tradeoff, an ADT prototype based on a 2&#8211;2 SMASH DSM is implemented on a field programmable gate array (FPGA), which uses only 256 DSP48 slices. The transmissions are switched between single-band and dual-band configurations with carrier frequencies (CFs) independently tunable over 0&#8211;3.2 GHz. Measured adjacent channel leakage ratios (ACLRs) for 10- and 20-MHz dual-band signals are below &#8722;45 and &#8722;39.5 dBc, respectively, with error vector magnitudes (EVMs) below 1.6%. These results verify the agile multiband reconfiguration and excellent performance of the proposed SMASH DSM-based ADT.</description></item><item><title>High-Performance Gemmini-Based Matrix Multiplication Accelerator for Deep Learning Workloads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11153792</link><description>Transformer models have recently gained considerable attention in computer vision applications due to their capacity to capture relations among features, resulting in enhanced performance. Moreover, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been extensively researched due to their superior performance and applicability in several domains, including image classification, detection, and recognition.

First, this work proposes a multiplier-optimized SA (MOSA) by integrating a novel multiplier. The multiplier is designed using a single-stage stacking-based 3:2 and 4:2 compressors. The proposed MOSA achieves significant improvements, with area savings ranging from 12% to 92% for 8-bit designs and 87%&#8211;89% for 16-bit designs across  $8 \times 8$ ,  $16 \times 16$ ,  $32 \times 32$ , and  $64 \times 64$  SAs. The proposed multiplier is employed to present a high-performance Gemmini SA for WS and OS dataflow; further modifications to the processing element (PE) are presented to achieve better performance over the existing Gemmini accelerator. In particular, the proposed WS PE achieves power-delay product (PDP) savings of 56%&#8211;59% and area-delay product (ADP) reductions of 45%&#8211;51%, while the OS PE shows PDP savings of 10%&#8211;46% and ADP reductions of 6%&#8211;42%. The analysis is further extended to both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers by integrating the proposed SA into complete inference pipelines, including AlexNet, MobileNetV2, and ResNet-50 for CNNs, and the self-attention mechanism of TinyBERT for Transformers. The MOSA-32 design delivers a GOPS improvement of 12%&#8211;91% across different CNN models and up to  $5.24\times $  for Transformer workloads. Similarly, MOSA-64 achieves up to 98% improvements across CNNs and up to  $6.14\times $  gains for Transformers. These improvements validate the effectiveness of the proposed energy-efficient PE design and its seamless integration into Gemmini SA, making the proposed architecture suitable for next-generation AI and Transformer accelerators for edge computing applications.</description></item><item><title>SteROI-D: System Design and Mapping for Stereo Depth Inference on Regions of Interest</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11180152</link><description>Machine learning algorithms have enabled high-quality stereo depth estimation to run on augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) devices. However, high energy consumption across the full-image processing stack prevents stereo depth algorithms from running effectively on battery-limited devices. This article introduces SteROI-D, a full-stereo depth system paired with a mapping methodology. SteROI-D exploits region-of-interest (ROI) and temporal sparsity at the system level to save energy. SteROI-D&#8217;s flexible and heterogeneous compute fabric supports diverse ROIs. Importantly, we introduce a systematic mapping methodology to effectively handle dynamic ROIs, thereby maximizing energy savings. Using these techniques, our 28-nm prototype SteROI-D design achieves up to  $3.92\times $  reduction in total system energy compared with a baseline application specific integrated circuit (ASIC).</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid-Structured Lossless Compression&#8211;Decompression Engine for Intermediate Feature Maps in Vision Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11192557</link><description>With the continuous evolution of vision neural networks, the off-chip transmission and storage of intermediate feature maps have become a major bottleneck during inference, especially in resource-constrained edge devices. Lossless compression of the intermediate feature maps exhibits the plug-and-play feature without requiring additional evaluation or retraining. However, previous lossless compression hardware engines face challenges in the tradeoff between hardware complexity and compression ratio. To address this issue, this article proposes a hybrid-structured lossless compression and decompression engine of intermediate feature maps in vision neural networks. The proposed work combines multidimensional prediction, run-length encoding (RLE), and extended encoding (EE). In the predictive stage, delta and contextual prediction are employed to enhance sparsity for compression efficiency. In the encoding stage, RLE minimizes redundancy between adjacent bytes, and EE is used to select various compression methods to decrease bit-level redundancy dynamically. The average compression ratio of widely used vision neural networks is 48.42%, which is better than that of Huffman coding. Compared with the state-of-the-art works, it improves the average compression ratio by 20.90%. For hardware implementation, hardware reuse and data reuse are employed to achieve 17.95% and 21.18% reduction of the gate count and the power, respectively. Experimental results show that we achieve a throughput-per-area of 1.10 [(bits/cycle)/K GCs] and a throughput-per-power of 1.19 [(bits/cycle)/mW] in the 28-nm process node.</description></item><item><title>Resource Optimization in Polyphase-Filter STFT Based on Time-Multiplexed Constant Multiplication</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11165182</link><description>Real-time spectrum analysis is widely used in applications such as embedded audio analytics, digital acquisition instruments, electronic warfare, and micro-Doppler radar. These applications heavily rely on the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) engine, which delivers high throughput and leads to strict area and power budgets. However, current STFT architectures implemented on hardware still rely on massive arrays of generic multipliers or on-chip memories that store precomputed window coefficients, thereby limiting flexibility and increasing latency and resource consumption. The optimized windowing unit of the polyphase-filter STFT architecture proposed in this article is redesigned by time-multiplexed single and multiple constant multiplication (Tm-SCM/MCM) that are created from directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). The Tm-SCM-based design can replace the original generic multiplier. The Tm-MCM-based design can reduce the adders and multiplexers (MUXs) by analyzing the window function coefficients among different channels. Both methods can minimize the redundant adders and MUXs compared with the existing algorithms and remove all DSP generic multipliers. Experiments on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and ASIC show that the proposed Tm-SCM/MCM Hann window core reduces area and delay and lowers dynamic power. When the same cores are integrated into a 32-point STFT, overall slice count drops, all BRAM blocks in the windowing unit are removed, latency stays low, output SQNR matches recent polyphase and fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based designs, and figure-of-merit analysis confirms that the proposed architecture delivers the best overall balance of resources, speed, and power among the compared solutions. These findings show that optimization of windowing units by constant multiplication offers a cost-effective solution for upcoming high-overlap, real-time STFT applications by concurrently reducing resource footprint and maintaining spectral fidelity.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Polynomial Multiplication Accelerator for Lattice-Based Cryptography With a 2-D Winograd-Based Divide-and-Conquer Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11151218</link><description>Polynomial multiplication over rings constitutes one of the most computationally expensive operations in lattice-based cryptography. To accelerate it, the algorithm based on divide-and-conquer has received extensive attention because it has no strict parameter restrictions compared with the number theoretic transform (NTT). Among divide-and-conquer algorithms, apart from algorithms like Karatsuba and Schoolbook, the Winograd-based method has emerged as a new approach. This is because it can reduce the amount of computation while maintaining the scalability of parallelism. However, the parameters of the existing Winograd-based polynomial multiplication algorithm are conservative, and there is potential for further reducing the computational load. Therefore, we propose a novel and efficient 2-D Winograd-based polynomial multiplication (2-D WPM) algorithm. In this algorithm, we adopt the 2-D Winograd to alleviate the large denominator divisions and large-number multiplications that occur in the conventional 1-D Winograd as the parameter increases. We also propose a division elimination method to eliminate the inevitable divisions in the 2-D Winograd. When the polynomial length is 1024, compared with Schoolbook, 2-D WPM ( ${m} =3$ ,  ${r} =3$ ) can reduce the number of basic multiplications by 69%. In addition, an efficient polynomial multiplication accelerator for lattice-based cryptography named EPMA is proposed. In EPMA, we design reconfigurable modular arithmetic units to support both prime moduli and power-of-2 moduli. Keeping the full pipelined structure of EPMA, we also fully reuse the input data and the Winograd transformation results to achieve the conservation of hardware resources. EPMA is implemented on Xilinx FPGAs. Compared with previous works on FPGAs, under the same platform and parameters, the area efficiency of EPMA achieves an improvement of  $1.22\times $  to  $18.02\times $ . Compared with previous works on CPUs and GPUs, the computing speed of EPMA achieves an improvement of 9.25 to  $1294.51\times $ .</description></item><item><title>Coordinating Binary Trait: Accurate and Lightweight Runtime On-Chip Power Meter Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11135453</link><description>As heterogeneous platforms scale, power management issues grow increasingly critical. On-chip power awareness is fundamental to effective power management on such platforms. However, the integration of diverse components leads to higher power consumption and more complex power patterns, complicating the perception of power distribution. To address this challenge, this article presents COordinating BInary Trait (COBIT), which focuses on the design and optimization of on-chip power meters (OPMs) for heterogeneous design, enabling power management in large-scale systems. COBIT extracts essential bitwise wires as features, learns a boosting model based on binary trees, and implements the OPM for runtime power prediction. Additionally, multiobjective optimization algorithms are employed in the design space exploration of the power meter to ensure an accurate and low-overhead integration. Experimental results demonstrate the capabilities of COBIT on heterogeneous hardware. Using only 0.028% bitwise power proxies of all RTL wires in the NVIDIA deep learning accelerator (NVDLA) and 0.036% in the Berkeley out-of-order machine (BOOM) processor core, the per-cycle models achieve a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.69% and 2.49%, respectively. Regarding the success rate of predictions on power peaks in NVDLA, COBIT achieves a maximum performance improvement of 12.93% and an average improvement of 8.11% over existing methods. Moreover, the gate-area/power overhead of our OPM on BOOM and NVDLA is 1.25%/0.217% and 0.49%/0.097%, respectively, while performing per-cycle power prediction in just three cycles. Unlike previous approaches, which struggle with balancing accuracy and efficiency, COBIT effectively addresses both challenges, delivering unprecedented benefits for large-scale systems.</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid Stochastic-Binary Computing Batch Normalization Engine for Low-Power On-Chip Learning Spiking Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11148273</link><description>Batch normalization (BN) has proven to be a critical component in speeding up the training of deep spiking neural networks in deep learning. However, conventional BN implementations face significant challenges in terms of excessive off-chip memory bandwidth requirements and complex circuit designs, hindering their applicability for on-chip training in spiking neural networks (SNNs). This article introduces a novel hybrid stochastic-binary computing BN engine (HBN) that strikes an optimal balance between computational efficiency and hardware resource utilization, enabling efficient on-chip learning for SNNs. While conventional binary-mode BN engines offer temporal efficiency, they demand substantial hardware resources. In contrast, stochastic computing (SC)-based BN approaches reduce hardware overhead but introduce latency penalties and necessitate additional random number generation (RNG) circuits. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid architecture that seamlessly integrates binary and stochastic computing (SC) paradigms. Our co-designed methodology effectively balances computational latency and hardware footprint. This is achieved by a rounding-free SC multiplier unified with binary-circuit map ping, which eliminates latency and RNG overheads. Extensive validation across both static image datasets and neuromorphic datasets demonstrates that HBN maintains algorithmic fidelity while achieving unprecedented computational efficiency. Simulation results reveal 98.7% reduction in floating-point operations (FLOPs), 98.5% latency improvement, and 98.2% energy consumption reduction compared with conventional BN implementations. FPGA implementation on the ZCU102 platform demonstrates practical hardware advantages, including 74.9% reduction in look-up table (LUT) utilization, 83.6% decrease in flip-flop (FF) count, and 13.7% reduction in block RAM (BRAM) allocation. Notably, the design achieves 63.7% power reduction compared with state-of-the-art implementations while maintaining complete DSP-free operation.</description></item><item><title>Bitline-Paired 2T SOT-MRAM Cell for Energy-Efficient Memory Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11145964</link><description>Spin-orbit torque magnetic random access memory (SOT-MRAM) has recently gained great attention due to its various benefits on memory implementation. However, SOT-MRAM suffers from high read and write energy consumption, making it difficult to replace conventional CMOS-based memories. This article presents a novel bitline (BL)-paired 2T SOT-MRAM cell structure, where the read and write path can be decoupled without causing bit-cell area overhead. Thanks to the separation of the read and write path, the BL parasitic capacitance can be reduced, which ultimately reduces read energy consumption. In addition, the read scheme tailored to the bit-cell structure is proposed to further enhance the read energy. The proposed cell also shows considerable write energy improvement when applying the write termination techniques that require simultaneous read and write operations. The HSPICE circuit simulations using the 28-nm CMOS technology show that the proposed BL-paired 2T SOT-MRAM cell with BL sharing achieves an average of 42.9% read energy savings, and an average of 56.8% write energy reduction compared to the conventional 2T cell in a  $512\times 512$  array. The system simulations using the gem5 simulator also show that, compared to the conventional 2T cell, an average of 47.1% of dynamic energy can be saved in various SPEC2006 benchmarks when the BL-paired 2T cell is employed in L2 cache.</description></item><item><title>ASNA-Flow: An Efficient Asynchronous Neuromorphic Accelerator for Real-Time Event-Based Optical Flow</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142472</link><description>Optical flow estimation constitutes a fundamental computational challenge in computer vision, with critical applications object trajectory prediction, depth reconstruction, and autonomous navigation systems. The emergence of neuromorphic vision systems, integrating event-driven cameras with spiking neural networks (SNNs), has recently gained attention as a promising paradigm for edge deployment of optical flow estimation due to their advantages in ultralow power and resource efficiency. However, current neuromorphic computing platforms lack specialized architectures optimized for this problem domain. Existing implementations either prioritize configurable architectures at the expense of energy efficiency or employ intricate hardware control mechanisms to manage the asynchronous and sparse computing patterns inherent in SNNs. To address these limitations, we present ASNA-Flow, an event-driven asynchronous neuromorphic accelerator featuring a pioneering algorithm&#8211;hardware co-design framework specifically tailored for event-based optical flow estimation. Our methodology encompasses three key innovations: 1) a hardware-aware algorithm optimization that maintains computational fidelity while enhancing implementation efficiency; 2) systematic data pattern analysis to inform architectural decisions; and 3) novel exploitation of optical flow&#8217;s spatial locality characteristics to enable efficient sparse computing. Implemented in TSMC 28-nm CMOS technology, ASNA-Flow achieves real-time performance of 104 frames per second (FPS) with ultralow power consumption of 7.9 mW, demonstrating superior energy efficiency of 0.3 pJ per synaptic operation (SOP). This work establishes the first dedicated neuromorphic computing solution that simultaneously addresses the temporal sparsity, event-driven processing, and energy constraints inherent in optical flow estimation tasks.</description></item><item><title>Unlimited Vector Processing for Wireless Baseband Based on RISC-V Extension</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11152337</link><description>Wireless baseband processing (WBP) serves as an ideal scenario for utilizing vector processing, which excels in managing data-parallel operations due to its parallel structure. However, conventional vector architectures face certain constraints such as limited vector register sizes, reliance on power-of-two vector length (VL) multipliers, and vector permutation capabilities tied to specific architectures. To address these challenges, we have introduced an instruction set extension (ISE) based on RISC-V known as unlimited vector processing (UVP). This extension enhances both the flexibility and efficiency of vector computations. UVP employs a novel programming model that supports non-power-of-two register groupings (RGs) and hardware strip mining, thus enabling smooth handling of vectors of varying lengths while reducing the software strip-mining burden. Vector instructions are categorized into symmetric and asymmetric classes, complemented by specialized load/store strategies to optimize execution. Moreover, we present a hardware implementation of UVP featuring sophisticated hazard detection mechanisms, optimized pipelines for symmetric tasks such as fixed-point multiplication and division, and a robust permutation engine for effective asymmetric operations. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that UVP significantly enhances performance, achieving up to  $3.0\times $  and  $2.1\times $  speedups in matrix multiplication and fast Fourier transform (FFT) tasks, respectively, when measured against lane-based vector architectures. Our synthesized register transfer level (RTL) for a 16-lane configuration using SMIC 40-nm technology spans 0.94 mm2 and achieves an area efficiency of 21.2 GOPS/mm2.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Parallel Testing and Implicit Cost-Driven Tuning of RF-MIMO Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11204724</link><description>Modern wireless communications systems deploy massive MIMO systems with large numbers of transmit and receive antennas and analog-digital RF transceiver architectures that admit RF beamforming. These systems need to be tested and tuned postmanufacture to ensure signal quality. In analog architectures, this poses a problem due to the lack of observability of internal circuit nodes and due to the convergence of multiple RF beamforming chains into a combined baseband signal from which it is difficult to de-embed individual RF chain behaviors. Existing test techniques estimate nonlinearities in RF chains up to the third order and require significant frequency bandwidth to test multiple RF chains in a MIMO system in parallel, thereby reducing the overall test time. In this research, to improve testing efficiency, overlapping test tones over a minimal frequency range are applied to each of the MIMO RF chains in parallel, allowing specifications of individual RF chains up to fifth-order distortion to be determined accurately. For postmanufacture tuning, a response feature clustering approach followed by an implicit cost-driven tuning procedure is proposed. Tuning for error vector magnitude (EVM) and signal-to-interference ratio (SiNR) is performed under power constraints. Experimental results show that the proposed parallel testing methodology is  $1.7\times $  more frequency-efficient than existing techniques, and the proposed postmanufacture tuning algorithm can tune a receiver with four RF chains in 1.8 ms.</description></item><item><title>POCA: First Power-on Chip Authentication and Key Exchange for Secure Provisioning in System-on-Chip</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11153572</link><description>In a horizontal business model, the manufacturing and testing of system-on-chip (SoC) design at offshore facilities has proven to be a cost-effective strategy for fabless design houses. This, however, has led to growing concerns about the security and reliability of chips manufactured by outsourced semiconductor foundries, assembly, and test entities. As such, untrusted entities have access to the entire chip design; they may exploit opportunities for IP piracy, overproduction, cloning, shipping defective or out-of-specification chips, and insecure boot. Design houses must address these concerns by securing the die/packaged chips and their assets in such an untrusted environment. Unfortunately, this cannot be accomplished by any of the current security primitives [e.g., physical unclonable functions (PUFs)] due to their inherent limitations at this stage. Furthermore, provisioning the security assets requires a secure key exchange protocol, which is difficult to accomplish with untrusted entities (tester and software proxies) existing between the die/chip under test and the secure cloud server. This article introduces a novel security primitive and a power-on chip authentication protocol called POCA, which enables the secure provisioning of security assets during wafer sort. POCA incurs a low area overhead and is resilient to any attacks known today.</description></item><item><title>Toward Reliable Onboard AI in Space: A Fault-Tolerant Soft GPU-Based System-on-Chip</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11130453</link><description>Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly relevant for space applications, reducing reliance on high-bandwidth downlinks. Its use, however, has primarily been demonstrated in low Earth orbit (LEO) using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. Extending its use to deep-space and long-duration missions requires computing platforms capable of operating in harsh radiation environments without incurring prohibitive costs. This is particularly important for systems implemented on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), which are widely used in space applications due to their scalability and support for various radiation-hardening profiles. This flexibility makes them preferable to application-specific integrated circuits, whose low production volumes often do not justify their use in space systems. This article details our efforts to develop a novel system-on-chip (SoC) featuring GPU@SAT, a soft graphic processing unit IP provided by IngeniArs S.r.l., with a focus on enhancing its robustness when implemented on the Xilinx radiation-tolerant XQRKU060 FPGA. This approach leverages FPGA reconfigurability and radiation tolerance alongside the high-performance capabilities of graphic processing units (GPUs), unlocking significant potential for accelerating compute-intensive tasks in edge-space applications. Building on this foundation, we employ a classification-based methodology to improve the fault tolerance of GPU@SAT, analyzing trade-offs on performance, power, and area. Additional IP cores, such as a watchdog timer (WDT), a dual RISC-V lockstep with rollback, and the Xilinx Soft Error Mitigation IP, are employed to further improve the SoC robustness. Fault injection on an FPGA prototype targeting essential configuration bits validates the approach, showing a  $15.4\times $  improvement in mean injections before failure over the baseline architecture, with only a  $1.2\times $  increase in hardware complexity.</description></item><item><title>A Time-Domain Integration Comparison Scheme With Noise Immunity for Wake-Up Receivers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11123760</link><description>Traditional wake-up receiver (WuRX) systems based on voltage-domain comparators for weak signal detection can readily suffer from false triggering due to noise. To address this issue, this work analyzes the mechanism of noise-induced failure in traditional voltage-domain comparator and proposes a time-domain comparator (TDCMP) scheme based on time-domain integration. By temporally integrating the input signal, the noise immunity of the comparator is significantly enhanced. To suppress process, supply voltage, and temperature (PVT) drift in the TDCMP, this work designs a frequency-locked loop (FLL) that employs a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) isomorphic to the TDCMP&#8217;s voltage-controlled delay line (VCDL) for drift calibration while simultaneously providing the clock signal for the WuRX. Implemented in a 65-nm CMOS process, the core chip area is 0.23 mm2, with a total system power consumption of 20.9 nW. The measurement results demonstrate that the proposed TDCMP enhances the WuRX sensitivity by 4 dB.</description></item><item><title>Camouflaged Logic Gates Using Threshold-Voltage-Defined Memory Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11145962</link><description>This brief proposes two types of camouflaged logic gates using threshold-voltage-defined memory cells (TVD-MCs). The proposed multiplexer-select TVD-MC (MS-TVDMC) gate consists of a target logic gate, several camouflage logic gates, a multiplexer (MUX), and TVD-MCs. All logic gates and MUX are implemented with standard threshold-voltage transistors. The TVD-MC is composed of two cross-coupled inverters with low- or high-threshold-voltage transistors. When its supply voltage increases from ground to  ${V} _{\text {DD}}$ , its data become &#8220;0&#8221; or &#8220;1&#8221; according to the threshold voltages of transistors in two inverters. The target logic gate is selected with the MUX by the data stored in the TVD-MCs. The data are defined by the threshold voltages of transistors, so that it is difficult to distinguish the target logic gate from the other camouflage logic gates. The proposed logic-merged TVD-MC (LM-TVDMC) gate merges all logic gates and MUX in the MS-TVDMC gate at the transistor level. The proposed camouflaged gates significantly reduce the delay, power consumption, and leakage current compared to the conventional dynamic enhanced-TVD (DE-TVD) camouflaged gate requiring the dynamic power and delay overheads and the conventional threshold-voltage-defined (TVD) switch camouflaged gate with large on-resistances in switch transistors.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Challenge Cross-Selection Physical Unclonable Function Based on MRAM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11134498</link><description>The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has triggered massive data transmission. Meanwhile, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) introduce new security vulnerabilities in device interactions. These challenges demand lightweight yet robust security solutions. In this context, physical unclonable functions (PUFs) serve as critical hardware security primitives, enabling reliable authentication for edge devices. Nevertheless, PUF is increasingly susceptible to novel threats, notably machine learning attacks. To address this security vulnerability to attacks, we propose a novel double-layer dynamic challenge cross-selection magnetoresistive random access memory PUF (MPUF). This design leverages the inherent process variation in spin-transfer torque magnetoresistive random access memory (STT-MRAM) as an entropy source. The proposed structure incorporates an obfuscation decode circuit (ODC) that combines xor gates and shift registers. It dynamically obfuscates interlayer relationships between two PUF arrays to enhance circuit nonlinearity. The simulation results demonstrate uniformity of 50.16%, uniqueness of 49.94%, a worst bit error rate (BER) of 2.34% for  $- 25~^{\circ } $ C to  $125~^{\circ } $ C and 1.56% for  $0.5\sim 1.1$  V. In addition, four common machine learning models are used to attack this PUF, achieving accuracies of 50.49%, 50.49%, 50.48%, and 58.41%, which are close to a random guess. Compared with traditional PUF implementations, this work exhibits higher reliability and enhanced security while maintaining low power consumption of approximately 9.975 fJ/bit.</description></item><item><title>A Fast and Energy-Efficient Level Shifter With Complementary Output Buffer for Energy-Constrained Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11132353</link><description>This brief presents a 55-nm level shifter (LS) that enables wide voltage range conversion from 80mV to 1.2V with high energy efficiency and fast transition speed.

The RX employs a quarter-rate clocking architecture to reduce the on-chip clock (CK) frequency and ensure reliable operation under stringent DFE timing constraints. The slicer output is fed back to the DFE weight selection MUX integrated into the second-stage slicer, achieving a short feedback loop latency. In the proposed architecture, the number of stacked transistors in the slicer is reduced to three, thereby reducing the CK-to-Q delay and overall DFE feedback loop latency. This optimized design increases the feedback speed and alleviates DFE timing constraints, ensuring stable operation even at low supply voltages. A prototype RX was fabricated using a 65-nm CMOS process and had an area of 0.004 mm2.

The CCCA achieves a high dynamic range (DR) due to its very low noise floor and is implemented with common low-voltage (LV) input devices, while the voltage-boosting power stage achieves a boosted output power ( $P_{\mathrm {OUT}}$ ) with good power efficiency due to its single-stage power delivery. Compared with prior-art CDAs utilizing a capacitive-feedback scheme with two off-chip inductors, this work uses only a single off-chip inductor and has additional output voltage ( $V_{\mathrm {OUT}}$ ) boost capability. The proposed DSVB modulation doubles the effective switching frequency to enhance the LC attenuation, leading to reduced differential-mode electromagnetic interference (EMI) and, unlike typical BD modulation, no modulation-induced common-mode EMI is generated. Compared with the other state-of-the-art LV digital-input CDAs, this work&#8217;s CDA, fabricated using a 0.5- $\mu $ m process, achieves the highest DR of 121.3 dB and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 115 dB, as well as a competitive minimal total harmonic distortion plus noise (THD+N) of 0.0019%.

We designed for a high tracking bandwidth (BW) of 38 GHz and optimized the SNDR up to the 5th Nyquist zone. This allows covering the targeted Ka-band frequencies of 27&#8211;31 GHz allocated for high-throughput Earth-to-satellite communication without the need for a dedicated mixer, enabling a wideband direct RF sub-sampling receiver approach. We employ an inductor-based input network together with co-optimized push&#8211;pull buffers and an active bootstrapping concept in the critical first track-and-hold (TH) for BW enhancement and improved linearity. Because the focus of this work lies in achieving a high SNDR at multi-ten-GHz inputs rather than maximizing the sampling rate  $f {_{S}}$ , we implement a single 1st-rank TH to eliminate the need for skew and BW mismatch calibration. A prototype of this two-rank TH is implemented in 22-nm FDSOI technology. Measurements of four different chip samples indicate SNDR &gt;39 dB up to 32-GHz input frequency at 12.8-GS/s operation while consuming 87 mW. A sweep of  $f {_{S}}$  from 4.8 to 15.2 GHz and &#177;10% supply variation causes &lt;1.3-dB SNDR fluctuation at a 30.2-GHz input. We estimate the total aperture jitter to about 25 fs, and an input  ${S_{{11}}{\lt }} {-}12$ dB is achieved up to 35 GHz.</description></item><item><title>A Compact and Ultra-Low-Power 32-kHz Conduction-Angle-Adaptive Crystal Oscillator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11151988</link><description>This article presents an ultra-low-power and compact 32-kHz crystal oscillator (XO) with intrinsic start-up capability for real-time clock (RTC) applications. The key idea is to operate a Pierce oscillator in a class-C-like fashion, with a digitally defined conduction angle generated based on the current oscillation amplitude. Hence, the XO can start-up when no oscillation is present and boosts its energy efficiency as the oscillation amplitude grows. Two circuit techniques based on the use of charge pumps are proposed in this work to generate this conduction angle information on-chip and regulate the oscillation amplitude. The proposed circuit topology, named the conduction-angle-adaptive XO (CAAXO), is verified through a fabricated integrated circuit (IC) implemented in 28-nm CMOS technology. Measurement results across ten samples demonstrate that under a 0.38-V supply, the proposed circuit functions well across a temperature range of  ${-} 20~{^{\circ } }$ C to  $85~{^{\circ } }$ C while only consuming 0.36 nW of power at  $25~{^{\circ } }$ C room temperature. Furthermore, the proposed CAAXO only occupies 820  $\mu $ m2 of core area, marking it the smallest XO among the state of the art.</description></item><item><title>A 14-b Energy-Efficient BW/Power Scalable CTDSM With a Frequency-Controlled Current Source</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11219048</link><description>This work presents a 14-bit energy-efficient bandwidth (BW)/power scalable continuous-time delta&#8211;sigma modulator (CTDSM) for sensor interfaces in IoT applications. To ensure low noise for small input signals and achieve BW/power scalability, it is built around Gm-C integrators biased via a linear frequency-controlled current source (FCCS). The FCCS enables the integrators to maintain a nearly constant output swing and linearly scalable power consumption across a wide sampling frequency ( $f_{s}$ ) range. Furthermore, multi-bit quantization and dead-band (DB) switches are applied to suppress the nonlinearity of the open-loop Gm-C integrator and DAC transient glitches, respectively. Fabricated in a standard 130-nm CMOS process, it occupies an active area of 0.29 mm2. With an input of &#177;80 mV, the proposed CTDSM demonstrates a nearly constant peak SNDR (~85 dB) and a stable energy efficiency over a  $225\times $  scaling range of  $f_{s}$  under a 0.9-V supply. When operating at a typical sampling frequency of 1 MHz, it achieves an input-referred noise density of 46 nV/ $\surd $ Hz, and a state-of-the-art energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Continuous-Time Capacitance-to-Digital Converter for Floating-Target Displacement Sensing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11176979</link><description>This article presents a high-performance continuous-time (CT) capacitance-to-digital converter (CDC) for floating-target displacement measurement applications. It uses a differential first-order RC low-pass filter (LPF) front end to convert parallel-plate capacitance to phase shift, which is further digitized by a high-resolution second-order CT phase-domain (PD) delta&#8211;sigma modulator (CT-PD $\Delta \Sigma $ M). The electrical field interference of the sensor, modeled as a capacitive-coupled charge on the common plate, is rejected by differential-mode readout and built-in bandpass interference filtering of the proposed architecture. To achieve a high temperature stability, the RC filter&#8217;s temperature coefficient (TC) is compensated by driving it using an RC frequency reference with the same temperature dependency. Fabricated in a standard 180-nm CMOS process, the sensor draws  $347~\mu $ A from a 1.8-V supply. The sensor offers common-mode rejection ratios (CMRRs) of &gt;119 dB near dc and &gt;97 dB around 100 MHz, providing reliable electrical field interference immunity. Furthermore, the CDC achieves a wide dynamic range (DR) of more than 143 dB without any sub-ranging and a competitive TC of &lt;25 ppm/&#176;C from  $- 40~^{\circ }$ C to  $85~^{\circ }$ C.</description></item><item><title>A Two-Stage 12&#8211;1-V Converter Featuring Regulated Resonant SC Regulators and Collaborative Control Scheme</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11169509</link><description>In the field of power converters for data centers, the two-stage architecture has received widespread attentions due to its various advantages. Especially, the switched-capacitor voltage regulator (SCVR) becomes popular as the second-stage converter owing to its high efficiency and power density. However, the SCVR suffers from poor voltage regulation and limited load capacity. To address these limitations, this article presents a two-stage converter featuring a regulated resonant switched-capacitor (ReSC) second-stage design. Thanks to the resonant operation of the ReSC, the converter achieves the superior power density and load capacity using a compact sub-nano-henry trace inductor. In addition, the resonant operation paves way for the voltage regulation, which is further employed for enhancing transient performances. Finally, to overcome the inherent efficiency versus voltage regulation tradeoff for the ReSC, a collaborative control scheme is built between the first and second stages, which adaptively adjusts the intermediate bus voltage to maintain the ReSC always in the efficient non-regulation mode for the entire output voltage range, leading to a high efficiency for a wide voltage and current range. By employing discrete GaNFETs for the first stage and 65-nm CMOS technology for the ReSC and controller design, the proposed two-stage converter achieves a measured system peak efficiency of 89.3% for 12:1-V conversion. With a 4-A/20-ns load current step, the measured undershoot voltage is 26 mV.</description></item><item><title>A Symbol-Based Power-Tracking Supply Modulator Integrated With a 28-GHz CMOS PA for 5G FR2</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11159181</link><description>This article presents a supply-modulated power amplifier (PA) system architecture for a high-efficiency transmitter (TX) that utilizes a symbol-power-tracking (SPT) technique to support 5G new radio (NR) frequency range 2 (FR2) bands. Conventional analog envelope tracking (ET) supply modulators (SMs) suffer from limited supportable bandwidth due to a decoupling capacitor required at the PA supply node, which makes loop compensation difficult. As a result, analog ET techniques often require complex loop compensation circuits and struggle to meet the stringent specifications of next-generation communication systems. To support wider channel bandwidths, the proposed architecture adopts an SPT supply modulation technique, realized through a single-inductor multiple-output (SIMO) dc&#8211;dc converter, enhancing overall SM-PA system efficiency. The full integration of the SM and PA using a single process helps to mitigate voltage overshoot on the PA supply node during fast SPT transitions, contributing to enhanced device reliability and longer lifetime. In addition, an SPT-adaptive biasing scheme is implemented to adjust the PA bias according to the supply voltage, maintaining linearity across multiple supply levels for the PA. The SPT-PA system is fabricated using a 28-nm CMOS process. The SPT modulator achieves a 20-ns/V transition time with nonuniform supply voltage distribution. It supports a 400-MHz 5G FR2 64-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signal at a 28-GHz PA operating frequency, achieving a 21-mW power saving at a 10-dB power back-off (PBO) level. The die size is 1.5 mm2.</description></item><item><title>A 1.52-W Capacitor-Drop Sigma-Floating-SC AC/DC Converter for Grid Power to IoT Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11151982</link><description>This work proposes a switched-capacitor (SC)-based non-isolated ac&#8211;dc power converter, converting the ac mains (110V @ 60Hz or 230V @ 50Hz) input to a single-cell battery voltage (3.3&#8211;4.6V), optimized for the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and smart home devices.

Piezoelectric (PE) and electromagnetic (EM) transducers are widely used to convert vibration energy into electrical power. While hybrid PE&#8211;EM harvesters can deliver higher output power to support self-sustained systems, existing implementations invariably rely on at least one off-chip inductor for either PE bias-flip or dc&#8211;dc conversion, substantially increasing system volume. This article presents an inductor-less, capacitor-less PE&#8211;EM hybrid energy harvesting platform that eliminates this limitation. By leveraging the inherent phase synchronization between PE and EM sources, the proposed coil-sharing technique enables both bias-flip and dc&#8211;dc conversion without additional passive components, enabling the first fully integrated hybrid energy harvesting system. Fabricated in 0.18- $\mu $ m CMOS technology, the prototype delivers dual-regulated outputs at 1.8 and 5 V for multi-domain sensor nodes, achieving a maximum output power of 2.72 mW and a peak end-to-end (E2E) efficiency of 90%. These results highlight the platform&#8217;s potential for ultra-compact, high-performance energy harvesting in next-generation IoT applications.</description></item><item><title>A Shoot-Through-Free 180-MHz Isolated Converter With PG-Downsized PA for Low EMI</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11151231</link><description>This article presents a 180-MHz low electromagnetic interference (EMI) isolated dc-dc converter using a  $P_{\mathrm { G}}$ -downsized Class-D power amplifier (PA). This PA features a symmetrical topology that effectively cancels dipole emissions, while its series inductors placed between the cross-connected high-side and low-side transistors that inherently block shoot-through currents. To address the resulting degeneration states of oscillation, we introduce small, actively driven transistors, whereas the original power transistors operate in a passively driven manner, with their gate charge recycled like in a Class-D oscillator. This preserves the advantage of low gate drive loss ( $P_{\mathrm { G}}$ ) in high-frequency oscillators. The frequency misalignment between the switching and oscillation frequencies leads to only minor efficiency degradation. This eliminates the requirement for switching frequency calibration, while enables the low-complexity frequency hopping to further reduce EMI. We fabricated the PA and the receiver (RX) chips using 0.18- $\boldsymbol {\mu }$ m bipolar&#8211;CMOS&#8211;DMOS (BCD) process and attached them with a 14.4-mm $\boldsymbol {^{2}}$  PCB transformer. The converter achieves a 45.3% peak efficiency and a maximum output power of 1 W. It complies with the CISPR-32 Class-B standard.</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid Bidirectional Converter With Always-Half-Inductor Current Using Adaptive Target Current Tracking for USB-to-2-Cell Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11165386</link><description>This article presents an always-half-inductor-current hybrid bidirectional converter (AHI-HBC) for USB-to-2-cell bidirectional power transfer. The converter achieves always-half-inductor current (AHI) in both directions compared to conventional bidirectional converters (CBCs) while using only 5-V transistors. This enables the elimination of high-voltage (HV) transistors, which have poor on-resistance ( $R_{\mathrm { ON}}$ ) performance and increase process costs. In addition, to address the challenge of varying charging current caused by changes in a battery voltage ( $V_{\mathrm { BAT}}$ ), we propose a normalized inductor current ( $N_{\mathrm { IL}}$ )-based adaptive target current controller that leverages the relationship between the inductor current ( $I_{L}$ ) and output current to effectively regulate the battery charging current ( $I_{\mathrm { BAT}}$ ). By utilizing the proposed controller,  $I_{\mathrm { BAT}}$  adaptively tracks the target charging current regardless of  $V_{\mathrm { BAT}}$ , which varies depending on the state-of-charge. The prototype chip was fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS process with a 4.7- $\mu $ H inductor, two 10- $\mu $ F flying capacitors, and a 10- $\mu $ F output capacitor. With the greatest  $I_{L}$  reduction within the target USB-to-2-cell range, the converter demonstrated peak efficiencies of 97.4% (96%) in the forward mode and 97% (96.2%) in the on-the-go (OTG) mode with an inductor dc resistance ( $R_{\mathrm { DC}}$ ) of 11.5 m $\Omega $  (295 m $\Omega $ ).</description></item><item><title>A Dual-Input Bidirectional Three-Level Battery Charger Using Coarse-Fine VCF Balancing and Frequency Foldback Control for Foldable Mobile Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11203939</link><description>Foldable mobile applications recently have been leading the battery charger to have a slim height with a small form-factor and high efficiency at higher input voltages to increase the power density.

It achieves a seamless bidirectional operation with a well-balanced  $V$ CF, a peak charging efficiency of 96.8%, and a maximum VCR of 92.9%.</description></item><item><title>SLiMDO: A Single-Link Multi-Domain-Output Isolated DC&#8211;DC Converter With Passive Magnetic Flux Sharing for Local Energy Distribution and Rx Behavior Sensing-Based Global Power Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11164176</link><description>This article introduces a small form-factor single-link multi-domain-output (SLiMDO) isolated dc&#8211;dc converter design. The proposed design provides two regulated outputs in separate domains in the receiver (Rx) side with a single micro-transformer. These isolated Rxes achieve local voltage regulation and automatic energy distribution across domains through passive magnetic flux sharing (PMFS) without any shared controllers or communication links for coordination. The transmitter (Tx) achieves global power modulation by sensing Rx behaviors through the reflected impedance without using dedicated digital isolators as data links, thus enables closed-loop control with a fast transient response. The SLiMDO converter prototype consists of one Tx chip and two identical Rx chips for two outputs, all fabricated in 0.18- $\mu $ m CMOS using 3.3-V I/O devices. The micro-transformer is fabricated in standard flexible-printed-circuit (FPC) with 8 mm diameter and 0.13 mm thickness. The isolation level of the transformer is measured to be &gt;5 kV between Tx and Rx and &gt;3 kV between Rx and Rx. The SLiMDO operation is verified in measurements converting a 3.3-V input from the primary domain to two outputs from 1.8 to 3.3 V each located in separated isolated secondary domains, with a 62.6% peak efficiency at ~600 mW, a 1.13-W maximum power, and a decent load transient response.</description></item><item><title>A Bi-Directional Dual-Path Boost&#8211;Buck Hybrid Converter for High-Voltage Power Transmission Delivery Cable in Humanoid Robots</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11223878</link><description>Humanoid robots have great potential to replace human labors for various tasks in the near future. For a centralized energy storage system in humanoid robots, its battery pack (heart) is located in the main body while the energy is mostly consumed through its legs and hands, demanding thick wires (strong blood vessels) to deliver power to the actuators (muscles). In this work, we present a high-voltage power transmission cable system, which utilizes two bidirectional dual-path boost&#8211;buck (DP-BB) converters and reuses the parasitic cable inductor as the power inductor for a compact and efficient power delivery.

The method leverages the principle that the sensitivity of the oscillator frequency to a dither signal injected into the gate voltage of the cross-coupled transistors diminishes to near zero when the CM resonance is optimally tuned for minimal phase noise (PN). By detecting and nullifying this sensitivity, the proposed technique automatically adjusts the CM resonance to its ideal value. This background operation is continuous across the entire tuning range. The concept was validated through a digital PLL prototype fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process, which achieved a jitter of 45.9 fs, a power-versus-jitter figure-of-merit of &#8722;257 dB, and a PN of &#8722;146.6 dBc/Hz at 10-MHz offset from a 4.75-GHz carrier, all within an active area of 0.21 mm2.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Jitter Fractional-N Digital PLL Using a Quantization-Error-Compensating BBPD and an Orthogonal-Polynomial-Based LMS Calibration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11183652</link><description>This work presents a 10.0&#8211;11.5-GHz fractional- $N$  digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) using the quantization-error-compensating bang&#8211;bang phase detector (QEC-BBPD) that can minimize both the static delay ( $T_{\mathrm {S}}$ ) and the dynamic delay ( $T_{\mathrm {D}}$ ) required for removing the delta-sigma modulator&#8217;s ( $\Delta \Sigma $ M) quantization-error (Q-error). Since the proposed QEC-BBPD reduces additional thermal noise during the Q-error-compensation process, it allows the DPLL to achieve low in-band phase noise (PN) and low rms jitter. Along with the QEC-BBPD, this work also presents the orthogonal-polynomial-based least-mean-square multivariable calibration (OP-LMS MVC) to accelerate the calibration speed for the removal of the nonlinearities (NLs) of the QEC-BBPD with minimal hardware overhead. The fractional- $N$  DPLL in this work, fabricated in a 40-nm CMOS process, occupied 0.12 mm2 of silicon and consumed 14.4 mW of power. The rms jitter and worst fractional spur were 64 fs and &#8722;62.8 dBc, respectively, at a fractional- $N$  frequency near 10.9 GHz. It achieved the lowest in-band PN and the best normalized jitter-power figure-of-merit for the multiplication factor  $N$  (FoM ${}_{\mathrm {jitter,}N}$ ), i.e., &#8722;272.2 dB, among the state-of-the-art fractional- $N$  phase-locked loops (PLLs).</description></item><item><title>Design of G-Band Watt-Level GaN Power Amplifier With Multiband Large-Signal Impedance Correction and Circuit-Package Co-Design Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11227135</link><description>This article presents a gallium nitride (GaN) solid-state power amplifier (SSPA) operating in the G band and delivering watt-level output power. To enhance the performance of the  $2 {\times } 20~{\mu }$ m GaN high electron mobility transistors (GaN HEMTs), AlN/GaN heterojunction, n+ GaN regrown, and 50-nm floating T-gate are employed with a transconductance of 880 mS/mm and an  ${f} {_{T}}$  ( ${f} {_{\max }}$ ) of 180 GHz (420 GHz). By utilizing multiband large-signal impedance correction technology, the optimal power matching impedance for GaN HEMTs was achieved without the need for a G-band load&#8211;pull testing system. As a result, a 50-nm GaN power amplifier monolithic microwave integrated circuit (PA MMIC) is designed with an output power of 100 mW at 216 GHz and a power density exceeding 1.35 W/mm at 216 GHz. The measured power-added efficiency (PAE) exceeds 2% across the entire frequency band. Furthermore, the circuit-package co-design technique integrates bonding wires, waveguide-to-microstrip transitions, and the packaging cavity into the matching networks of PA MMIC. It minimizes output power and bandwidth degradation due to the packaging parasitics. The presented SSPA module employs 32-way GaN PA MMICs with power combining and delivers &gt;1-W saturated output power across 216&#8211;226 GHz, peaking at 1.54 W at 223 GHz. The power gain exceeds 9 dB and reaches 10.1 dB at 223 GHz.

Switchless Class-G (SLCG) PA has a great potential in the RF bandwidth (BW), but shows limited signal BW and difficulty in parasitics absorption. The situation for Doherty PA (DPA) is exactly the opposite. To combine the merits of SLCG PA and DPA, we propose an SLCG-Doherty-continuum PA (SDCPA), which is constructed by simply inserting a frequency-adaptive transmission line (FATL) into SLCG PA. When the phase shift of FATL deviates from 0&#176; to &#177;90&#176;, SDCPA transfers from SLCG mode to Doherty mode gradually. The theoretical performance of SDCPA is analyzed in depth. Furthermore, a coupled resonator (CR) with inherent parasitics absorption and supply path is proposed to realize broadband FATL on chip. An SDCPA prototype is implemented in a 0.25- $\mu $ m GaN-HEMT process for validation. The fabricated SDCPA achieves a saturated output power of 36.6&#8211;38.6 dBm and a 6-/7.5-dB back-off drain efficiency (DE) of 38%&#8211;56%/37%&#8211;54% from 1.35 to 7.6 GHz with a compact chip size of  $2.1 {\times } 1.6$  mm2. The fractional BW (FBW) is up to 140%. Applying a 100-MHz LTE signal with a 7.5-dB peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), an average DE of 35%&#8211;49.2% is measured over the entire BW, and adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) before and after digital predistortion (DPD) are better than &#8722;25.3 and &#8722;46 dBc, respectively. Applying a 100-MHz 64-QAM signal with a 7.94-dB PAPR, the measured error vector magnitudes (EVMs) without DPD at 1.6/3.6/5.0/6.8 GHz are &#8722;33.5/&#8722;28.3/&#8722;29.4/&#8722;33.7 dB. Moreover, a maximum supported signal BW up to 350 MHz is recorded at 5 GHz. To the best of the authors&#8217; knowledge, the proposed SDCPA demonstrates the largest FBW among all reported integrated back-off efficient PAs without using digital techniques or reconfiguration.</description></item><item><title>CORDIC-Less Digital Polar Transmitter Architecture Based on Delta-Sigma Modulator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11175908</link><description>Conventional digital polar transmitters (TXs) suffer from limited power efficiency and linearity due to the multi-bit nature of intermediate signals. This work proposes a digital polar TX architecture that avoids such drawbacks by reducing the bit count of TX signals. The proposed TX oversamples and quantizes multi-bit I/Q inputs into three-level signals using simple delta-sigma modulators (DSMs), followed by a nine-state lookup table (LUT) to directly generate amplitude modulation (AM) and phase modulation (PM) signals. The complex coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) that is widely used in polar TXs is not required. The AM signal is truncated to two levels for on/off control of an intrinsically linear 1-bit power amplifier (PA). The PA avoids the linearity and switching loss issues of conventional switched-capacitor PAs (SCPAs). The PM signal is represented with 3 bits for eight-phase generation via edge selection from a  $4\times $  carrier local oscillator (LO), which offers better linearity and power efficiency than phase modulators based on multi-bit digital-to-time converters (DTCs). Therefore, the proposed approach enables simultaneous improvements in power efficiency and linearity. Fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, the proposed TX achieves a 33.5% peak power-added efficiency (PAE) at 24.2-dBm output power and supports wideband 50-MSymbol/s 256-quadratic-AM (QAM) signals without digital predistortion (DPD). A maximum system efficiency (SE) of 24.5% is achieved at &#8722;25.1-dB error vector magnitude (EVM), demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art DPD-less digital polar TXs.</description></item><item><title>A Blocker-Tolerant Receiver With VCO-Based Non-Uniform Multi-Level Time-Approximation Filter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11148079</link><description>A blocker-tolerant millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) receiver is presented using a multi-level time-approximation filter (mTAF), a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)-based integrator with embedded digitization, and non-uniform (NU) sampling to enhance filtering flexibility and efficiency. The mTAF approximates FIR filter responses using a digitally generated multi-level weighting pattern that controls gated integration over time. Compared with state-of-the-art reconfigurable blocker-tolerant receivers, the seven-level mTAF introduces more programmable notches, enables asymmetric filtering, and provides wider stopbands for improved blocker suppression. The VCO-based integrator simplifies circuit complexity and achieves competitive power efficiency compared with conventional Gm-C designs, while NU sampling further mitigates alias-band blockers. Fabricated in 28-nm CMOS, the prototype occupies 0.83 mm2 and consumes 87 mW. The receiver achieves 65-dB maximum blocker rejection, &#8722;36-dB EVM without blockers, and &#8722;31-dB EVM with a 24-dBc blocker at 1.217-GHz offset from a 32-GHz LO.</description></item><item><title>A Millimeter-Wave Direct Digital Transmitter Using Multiphase Subharmonic Switching PA</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11162936</link><description>This article presents a direct digital transmitter (TX) employing a multiphase subharmonic switching (MP-SHS) power amplifier (PA) to achieve both high peak and power back-off (PBO) efficiency with wide signal bandwidth. A phase-shifted subharmonic (SH) local oscillator (LO) divider is proposed to suppress SH spurs with minimal implementation overhead by introducing an additional phase shift during LO frequency division. Furthermore, a dual-rate hybrid digital-to-analog converter (HDAC) is integrated with the MP-SHS TX, which enables noise shaping and lowers in-band error vector magnitude (EVM). A proof-of-concept prototype, fabricated in 65-nm CMOS, operates at 24 GHz, achieving 19.2-dBm peak output power with 38.3% peak power-added efficiency (PAE).

The system integrates eight independent transmitters ( $8~{\times }~1$  TXs) and two four-channel phased-array receivers ( $2~{\times }~4$  RXs), achieving a  $4.76{\times }$  increase in detection range compared to single-input&#8211;single-output (SISO) architecture in long-range radar (LRR) mode and 1.79&#176; angular resolution with  $16 {\times } 4$  virtual array in short-range radar (SRR) mode. To realize a large chirp bandwidth while maintaining low voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) gain ( $K_{\text {VCO}}$ ), a zig-zag phase-locked loop (PLL)-based frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) generator is proposed, enabling continuous multi-subband chirping. By monitoring the voltage across the capacitance in loop filter ( $V_{\text {CAP}}$ ) for subband switching, the tuning voltage ( $V_{\text {TUNE}}$ ) is configured to the optimal switching voltage, eliminating the frequency ripple ( $F_{R}$ ) during subband switching. Each TX channel integrates switches to support a flexible number and positioning of 1&#8211;8 transmitters in TDM mode. To mitigate the leakage effect caused by variations in amplitude and phase due to the varying number and position of TX on-channels, a receiver architecture with three low noise amplifiers (LNAs) and a 4-bit phase shifter is designed to achieve low noise figure (NF) and high linearity. Furthermore, an I/Q mixer is designed to achieve orthogonal-ellipse-overlapping-shape NF and petal-shape linearity over a phase difference range of 0&#176;&#8211; ${360^{\circ } }~{\Delta \phi _{\text {leak}}}$  between the local oscillator (LO) and leakage. The chip achieves a measured maximum chirp bandwidth of 12.6-GHz spanning four zig-zag subbands. The root-mean-square (rms) frequency error is 0.0068% at 18.8-MHz/ $\mu $ s chirp rate with 2.5-GHz bandwidth, and 0.3% at 545-MHz/ $\mu $ s chirp rate with 2.65-GHz bandwidth. The eight-channel TX achieves a maximum effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of 32 dBm at 78.8 GHz, while the four-channel RX achieves a minimum NF of 16.3 dB at a 2-MHz intermediate frequency (IF). The hybrid radar achieves a detection range of 186 m and a range resolution of 3 cm.</description></item><item><title>Fully Integrated Single-Input-Dual-Output Switch-Capacitor DC-DC Converter With Fast DVS Speed and Fast Transient Response</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11204726</link><description>This paper presents a fully integrated single-input-dual-output (SIDO) switched-capacitor (SC) DC-DC converter targeting on fast dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) and fast transient response applications.

The proposed design strategy formulates the WPT design as an optimization problem and solves it by fully-numerical computation to achieve high-frequency LI operation. A multi-objective evaluation function is given to achieve the LI operation, which evaluates output voltage, power-delivery efficiency, and total harmonic distortion. The class-EF WPT system designed using the proposed method achieved narrower output voltage variations and higher power-delivery efficiency than the analysis-based design system. Additionally, the proposed design algorithm identifies parameter sets that were never found through the analysis-based design. Namely, only a small amount of current flows through the previous harmonic resonant filter of the class-EF inverter. These results demonstrate the potential of ML-based design in the field of power electronics.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Circuit Performance Prediction Using Machine Learning: From Schematic to Layout and Silicon Measurement With Minimal Data Input</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11114348</link><description>We present an ML-driven framework for predicting circuit performance metrics, bridging the gap between schematic and layout simulations, multi-process corner analysis, and measured silicon data. We demonstrate this using 14nm and 5nm FinFET-based ring oscillators, by collecting data across varying supply voltages, temperatures, and process corners. Using three baseline ML models&#8212;XGBoost, Random Forest, and a Neural Network&#8212;we simulate real-world design scenarios where parameter fine-tuning may not always be feasible. Key tasks include predicting layout performance from schematic data, performance prediction across process corners, and fabricated chip performance. Our results show that these models can achieve less than 5% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for power and frequency prediction while reducing required simulations by more than  $2\times $ . When migrating from 14nm to 5nm, XGBoost and Neural Network achieve high accuracy (&gt;0.99  $R^{2}$ ) using just 10% of the otherwise required 5nm simulations. We also present an extensive robustness analysis to demonstrate that our results are not limited to a single data split or initialization. By varying random seeds across multiple runs, we evaluate the stability of each model with respect to algorithm initialization and the selection of training data subsets. This demonstrates that the observed accuracy is consistent and not the result of a specific, favorable configuration. This framework offers a promising approach to accelerating circuit design across technology nodes by reducing simulation costs while maintaining accuracy in predicting performance.</description></item><item><title>An Integer-N Reference-Double-Sampling PLL for Frequency-Multiplied Octa-Phase Clock Generation Achieving &#8722;251.9 dB FOMJitter-N</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11131491</link><description>This paper presents a reference double-sampling phase-locked loop (RDSPLL) that integrates frequency multiplication and octa-phase clock generation into a single system, significantly reducing power consumption. A differential ring oscillator (DRO) is employed to generate octa-phase clocks with high phase accuracy. The reference double-sampling technique extends the loop bandwidth, effectively suppressing phase noise from the ring oscillator and thereby reducing jitter. To achieve accurate and efficient phase error detection, we proposed a novel offset-compensated hybrid phase detector (OCH-PD), featuring an offset calibration and a comparator-ADC hybrid quantizer. The offset calibration utilizes the CDAC to dynamically compensate for the mismatch in double-sampling, improving jitter and spur performance. The hybrid quantizer supports dynamic mode switching based on different locking states: during the coarse frequency locking phase, it operates in the ADC mode to accelerate the locking process; once a stable lock is achieved, it switches to the comparator mode to enable low-power, high-speed quantization. Fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, the prototype achieves 674 fs RMS jitter at 2.4 GHz while consuming only 3.43 mW, resulting in a  $\text {FOM}_{\text {Jitter-N}}$  of -251.9 dB. With offset calibration, the reference spur at 100 MHz is suppressed from -56 dBc to -80 dBc, and the jitter is reduced from 1.42 ps to 674 fs. The locking time improves from  $10.5~{\mu }$ s to  $1.6~{\mu }$ s using the hybrid quantizer. The eight-phase accuracy remains better than 1&#176; over the frequency range of 2-2.8 GHz.</description></item><item><title>A Compact, Power-Efficient, and On-the-Fly I2C-to-SPI Converter for Distributed E-Textile Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11073551</link><description>This paper presents a 0.36-mm2 I2C-to-SPI converter chip designed for electronic textile (E-textile) applications, featuring an on-the-fly conversion scheme that eliminates the need for on-chip data buffers and internal clock generation. By leveraging the synchronous nature of both I2C and SPI protocols, the proposed design forwards each incoming I2C data bit, SDA (Serial Data Line) directly to the SPI output using the I2C serial clock line (SCL), thereby reducing both area and power consumption. Two versions of the chip are proposed: a &#8216;full&#8217; die and a &#8216;compact&#8217; die. The converter enables seamless integration into distributed in-textile architectures by minimizing silicon overhead. The &#8216;full&#8217; die implementation achieves a  $7.33\times $  area reduction compared to commercially available I2C-to-SPI converters, while the &#8216;compact&#8217; version further reduces the footprint by  $14.73\times $  through the use of a small corner seal-ring and a linear pad ring layout. Measurement results confirm robust operation at ultra-fast I2C frequency (5 MHz), consuming only 0.379 mW for the &#8216;full&#8217; die and 0.333 mW for the &#8216;compact&#8217; variant. At standard I2C speeds (400 kHz), the converter demonstrates a  $48\times $  improvement (&#8216;full&#8217; die) in power efficiency over commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions, making it an effective and unobtrusive solution for next-generation E-textile systems.</description></item><item><title>A Mode-Reconfigurable Second-Order NS-SAR ADC With NTF Synchronous Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045517</link><description>This paper presents a mode-reconfigurable 2nd-order noise-shaping successive-approximation-register (NS-SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) featured with the ability of optimizing the noise transfer function (NTF) synchronously. Three operation modes, the energy-saving (ES) mode, the normal (NM) mode, and the high-resolution (HR) mode, can be supported by reconfiguring the resolution of the internal SAR ADC (N ${}_{\mathrm {SAR}}$ ) and the oversampling rate (OSR), while the NTF optimization is realized by modulating locations of zeros and poles in the context of a specific mode to enhance the NS effect. The prototype ADC is fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS and operates under a 1.8-V supply. Operating at 5MS/s sampling rate, the ADC&#8217;s OSR can be configured as 8 or 16 in different operation modes, so its bandwidth can be configured as 312.5kHz or 156.25kHz. With NSAR and OSR reconfigured to be 8-bit and 8 for the ES mode, it achieves a signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) of 80.3dB and consumes  $201\mu $ W. Attributing to the NTF optimization, 27% power saving can be reached in the ES mode with respect to that when the optimization were disabled for the same SNDR. In the HR mode, NSAR and OSR are set to be 9-bit and 16, respectively. And a SNDR of 93.3dB is obtained at the expense of consuming  $280\mu $ W. It is evidenced that the SNDR can be boosted by 6.4dB owe to the NTF optimization, resulting in an optimal SNDR-based Schreier figure-of-merit (FoM ${}_{\mathrm {S}}$ ) of 180.8dB for the ADC. The values for NSAR and OSR are determined to be 9-bit and 8 for the NM mode, and the achievable SNDR is 88.2dB.

Many preclinical studies and clinical applications urgently require a portable, high-quality, low-cost, and fast imaging system. Thus, translating advanced image reconstruction algorithms into hardware implementations is highly desired. However, existing iterative PA image reconstructions, although exhibit higher accuracy than the delay-and-sum algorithm, suffer from high computational cost. In this paper, we introduce a novel model-based hardware architecture for palm-size PA tomography (palm-PAT), aiming at enhancing both the speed and performance of image reconstruction at a much lower system cost. To achieve this, we propose an innovative data reuse method that significantly reduces the consumption of hardware storage resources, achieving a reduction of approximately 75% in hardware storage requirements. We conducted experiments utilizing the FPGA implementation of the algorithm, using phantom, human finger data in vivo and ex vivo breast tumor data to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that our proposed architecture can substantially reduce system cost while maintaining high imaging performance. The novel hardware architecture design of the model-based algorithm achieves a speedup of up to approximately 270 times compared to the CPU, while the corresponding energy efficiency ratio is improved by more than 2700 times.</description></item><item><title>DCiROM: A High-Density Fully-Digital Compute-in-Read-Only-Memory Macro for Energy-Efficient Task-Level DNN Inference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11062902</link><description>Compute-in-memory (CiM) is a promising approach to alleviating the von Neumann memory wall bottleneck in data-intensive tasks. As a candidate to build CiM, static-random-access memory (SRAM) has become popular in accelerating deep neural networks (DNNs) because of its mature fabrication support and high flexibility. However, SRAM-based CiM suffers from low memory density, resulting in frequent weight reloading and increased power consumption during end-to-end inference tasks. Recently, read-only-memory (ROM)-based analog CiM (ACiM) has demonstrated the potential to deploy all DNN weights on-chip by leveraging high-density ROM. It may also achieve encouraging flexibility by exploiting the synergy between a small SRAM and a big ROM. Nevertheless, it faces challenges in achieving high computing density due to limitations in analog-to-digital converter (ADC) performance. Meanwhile, digital CiM (DCiM) improves computing density but incurs significant energy and area overhead due to the adder tree. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the first fully digital and flexible compute-in-read-only-memory (DCiROM) design approach. On the one hand, DCiROM introduces a novel ROM-logic fusion CiM that reduces the CiM area by 51% while maintaining high memory density and computing performance. On the other hand, DCiROM achieves high flexibility with minimal area overhead by proposing two innovative multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) resource-reusing techniques. This work has implemented a DCiROM chip with 3024Kb ResNet-56 parameters using a 65nm CMOS technology. This macro achieves 6.9-29.5x higher normalized FoM (memory density x computing density) than the state-of-the-art CiM works. Additionally, it reduces energy consumption per image inference by 2.9-9.9x compared to SRAM-based CiM works when off-chip access is considered.</description></item><item><title>A Bit-Partitioned Floating-Point 6T SRAM Computing-in-Memory Macro Based on Dual-Edge Time-Domain Structure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11080504</link><description>In the computing-in-memory (CIM) field, floating-point (FP) CIM is afflicted with high computing latency and energy consumption due to the intricate procedures involved in exponent computation and processing. In this work, an 8Kb FP time-domain (TD) static-random-access-memory (SRAM) CIM macro is presented. Fabricated with a 180nm process, this macro exhibits low computational latency and high energy efficiency. A novel FP computing architecture is proposed, which is capable of concurrently executing exponent summation, maximum value finding, difference generation, and mantissa shifting. This architecture effectively reduces the overall delay in exponent computation and processing, thereby enhancing the throughput. Furthermore, a bit-partitioned computing concept and an exponent sparsity scheme are introduced. In this scheme, sparsity judgment is made solely by processing the high 4 bits of the exponent, which significantly reduces power consumption in the remaining exponent computation and processing steps. Additionally, based on the bit-partitioned concept, a dual-edge TD exponent summation and mantissa multiplication-and-accumulation (MAC) circuit is devised. This circuit not only suppresses nonlinear errors during multi-bit computation but also exploits both the rising and falling edges of pulses for computation, thus accelerating the macro&#8217;s operation speed.

Meanwhile, Digital Computing-in-Memory (DCIM) offers higher energy efficiency than its analog counterpart and supports full-precision processing. However, existing ReRAM-based DCIMs are hindered by error-prone readout and low input parallelism. The inefficient bit-width reconfiguration also incurs significant hardware overhead during neural network mapping. This paper reports a 64Kb DCIM engine based on 1T2R ReRAM bitcells for multiply-and-Accumulate(MAC) acceleration. The ternary-input Booth-assisted multiply-in-memory (TB-MIM) flow allows bi-state ReRAM with limited readout margin to achieve high-accuracy computation with high parallelism. The corresponding reconfigurable vector adder-tree and accumulator (ReV-A2) effectively facilitate practical hybrid-precision network mapping. Simulations show that the proposed DCIM engine achieves a normalized throughput rate of 284.44 GOPS/Kb and an energy efficiency of 730.16 TOPS/W, surpassing previous ReRAM-based DCIM designs by  $3.3\times $ .</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Column-Wise Multi-Gain HDR CMOS Image Sensor for Single-Shot HDR Imaging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11060573</link><description>This paper presents a novel column-wise multi-gain high dynamic range (HDR) CMOS image sensor (CIS) designed to adapt dynamically to varying illumination conditions.

However, traditional CIM architectures face challenges such as high resource consumption, especially in data conversion, which can significantly impact chip area and energy efficiency. To address these challenges, this work proposes a computational CIM architecture utilizing multilevel analog memory, named AM-CIM, tailored for near-sensor (NS) computation of real-time KWS applications. Additionally, approximate memory technology is integrated into the AM-CIM architecture, employing data resilience scheduling for analog memory which contributes to significant reductions in hardware overhead. This integration facilitates a hardware-software co-design approach. To deploy KWS tasks in AM-CIM, a gated recurrent unit (GRU) network, referred to as MAC-GRU, is implemented. By employing Mel-energy as the input feature at the near-sensor end, the system achieves a 93.13% reduction in feature extraction power consumption. Evaluation results based on TSMC 180-nm technology demonstrate that the AM-CIM architecture achieves an accuracy of 88.51% for 10-keyword classification with a power consumption of  $546~\mu W$ , while reducing analog memory area by 43.32%.</description></item><item><title>MGARoute: Efficient Analog Routing With Multi-Stage Rip-Up and Rerouting Under Geometric and Symmetry Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11051139</link><description>Routing is a critical path-planning challenge in integrated circuit (IC) design, especially in analog IC design, where the complexity of the routing problem increases significantly owing to complex constraints and process parameters. Traditional automated routing techniques often rely on manual experience, limiting the effectiveness of the algorithms. To address this limitation, this study proposes a multilevel fast detour and rerouting algorithm based on reinforcement learning that integrates multiple symmetry and geometric constraints. The algorithm can effectively improve the design efficiency and reduce human error while optimizing the circuit performance and power consumption. The results show that the framework significantly improves the routing speed, reduces the number of vias, and is essentially free of DRC reporting errors on a variety of circuits in SMIC&#8217;s 180 nm technology.

However, in real circuits, multiple inputs can switch simultaneously, resulting in a significant speed-up. This discrepancy can lead to circuit failures due to inaccurate early analysis, despite static timing analysis (STA) tools adopting conservative strategies. Consequently, multi-input switching (MIS) models have gained importance for timing libraries. For complex logic gates, however, the number of possible transitions that must be considered for characterization increases significantly, posing a substantial challenge in modeling MIS effects. We propose a novel approach to address this challenge by combining the power of satisfiability (SAT) solvers and machine learning (ML) techniques. First, we perform a logical analysis on the Boolean function of a given logic gate to identify input patterns that can lead to MIS-induced speed-up. This task is formulated as a SAT problem, and a SAT solver is utilized to extract all MIS-relevant transitions, thereby significantly reducing the characterization and modeling effort. Next, we leverage ML techniques to accurately capture the complex dependencies of MIS-induced speed-up under various circuit and environmental conditions. To streamline this process, we introduce an automated tool framework named LiMo (Library Model), which integrates a SAT solver, SPICE simulator, dataset optimization strategies, ML training/testing infrastructure, and multiprocessing capabilities to create MIS-aware timing libraries. The results on benchmark circuits reveal that ignoring MIS effects can result in relative root mean square errors (RRMSE) exceeding 40% in timing attributes. In contrast, LiMo-generated libraries achieve RRMSE errors below 7% compared to SPICE simulations, while delivering results  $\sim 10,000 \times $  faster, underscoring their suitability for incorporating MIS effects in STA for industrial designs.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Hybrid Dynamic Event-Triggered Bipartite Consensus Control for Multi-Agent Systems Against DoS Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11048444</link><description>This paper addresses the secure bipartite consensus control problem for multi-agent systems under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. A class of aperiodic time-sequence-based DoS attacks is considered, and its impact on both undirected and directed network topologies is analyzed. The stability analysis is conducted using a Lyapunov function approach combined with an iterative method. To reduce energy consumption and prevent Zeno behavior, a hybrid dynamic event-triggered mechanism is introduced. This mechanism incorporates an improved dynamic event-triggering condition, which determines when each agent updates its control signal and transmits its currently triggered state to neighboring agents. The proposed approach integrates this mechanism with the developed distributed control protocol and to ensure bipartite consensus even in the presence of DoS attacks. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through two simulation examples.</description></item><item><title>Autoencoder-Based Transceivers for Multiple Access Human Body Communication Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11054282</link><description>The Internet of Bodies (IoB) represents a transformative technological innovation that merges the bio-physical and digital realms through networks of intelligent devices positioned in, on, and around the human body. Human Body Communication (HBC) offers a promising method for enabling IoB networks, using the human body as a communication channel for multiple wearable nodes. Despite the prevalence of HBC peer-to-peer communication methods in the literature, the challenge of implementing multiple access techniques for HBC at the physical layer remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a new multiple access HBC (MA-HBC) system that leverages autoencoders to design and implement low-power and efficient transceivers sharing a common channel. The proposed MA-HBC system consists of multiple autoencoder-based transceivers trained jointly to optimize overall network performance. It supports various data rates ranging from 164 kbps to 5.25 Mbps, making it suitable for a wide range of IoB applications. To validate the design, a prototype implementation is presented. Additionally, to ensure suitability for wearable devices, a low-power hardware transceiver architecture is provided with an estimated energy efficiency of 105 pJ/b when implemented using TSMC 65nm LP technology. The results show that the proposed MA-HBC system outperforms traditional IEEE 802.15.6 based transceivers for two users with time Sharing, achieving a 3.9 dB improvement in Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at a block error rate of  $10^{-2}$ .</description></item><item><title>Continuous Flow 4096-Point FFT/IFFT Hardware Architecture for 5G Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11073142</link><description>This paper presents a high-throughput, low-latency 4096-point FFT/IFFT hardware design tailored for 5G applications.

The desired features of a theoretical framework for DPs are heavily inspired on classical phasor theory: the ability to transform time differential equations into equivalent algebraic complex equations, while maintaining the familiar notions of phasors, magnitudes and phases, and describing instantaneous power by two components, active and reactive power. Current frameworks rely on integral transforms which need approximations and truncations to allow for practical computation and application and do not offer a theory of nonstationary power. Further, the integral transforms are difficult to operate with and are not suitable to transform any generic nonstationary signal due to convergence requirements and frequency resolution challenges. This paper presents a new theoretical framework for DPs, based on differential operators, that offers a natural and efficient framework to transform nonstationary sinusoidal signals into Dynamic Phasors, while also offering a solid theory on nonstationary power extending the conventional well defined active and reactive power definitions.</description></item><item><title>Online Distributed Convex Optimization for Unbalanced Varying Graphs With Delayed Feedback</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11081829</link><description>Feedback signal delays present a common challenge in the online decision-making processes of various real-world systems, such as real-time economic dispatch in power systems. These delays, primarily induced by limited computational capabilities or unknown parameter changes, can significantly hinder the performance or even effectiveness of online decision-making strategies. This study investigates distributed optimization over time-varying unbalanced networks with delayed feedback signals. We propose discrete-time distributed online algorithms for both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems. Each node in the network has access only to its individual time-varying local objective function with a delayed time sequence. At each decision-making step, each node selects the appropriate local online behavior, which depends on the information from its neighbor nodes, towards the minimization of global cumulative cost function value. We demonstrate that sublinear regrets can be ensured as long as the time-varying unbalanced communication networks maintain  $\mathcal {B}$ -strong connectivity. For a general convex or  $\mu $ -strongly convex local objective function, the network regret and individual regret grow as  $\mathcal {O}((\ln (T))^{2})$  and  $\mathcal {O}(\sqrt {T})$ , respectively, and are intrinsically related to the feedback delays and step sizes. To validate the proposed algorithms, numerical studies are carried out on constrained distributed time-varying economic dispatch problems.</description></item><item><title>Constant Voltage Regulation of Delayed Inductive Power Transfer Systems: A Data-Driven Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11048450</link><description>This paper delves into the constant voltage output regulation problem for delayed inductive power transfer (IPT) systems with linear matrix inequality region constraints.

A non-singular fast terminal sliding mode technique is employed to guarantee that the tracking error converges within a fixed time. To address system uncertainties and input delays, actor neural networks are designed to estimate the modeling uncertainties and provide compensation, and critic neural networks evaluate execution costs. To further enhance efficiency, a dual-channel event-triggered mechanism is designed, reducing communication overhead through independent dynamic event-triggering strategies for control input and output channels.

Ever increasing interface speed has resulted in multi-phase clock distributions (e.g., half-rate, quarter-rate architecture) becoming a reality over single / complementary phase clock distribution for performance reasons. Conventional techniques of clock distribution often involve distributing multi-phase clocks in pairs of complementary clock phases with proper shields around these phases to avoid coupling with other non-complementary clock phases of multi-phase clock distribution. However, these schemes suffer heavily when speeds/datarates and routing length of clock distribution increase. A mutually coupled multi-phase clock distribution scheme is proposed that overcomes signal integrity issues observed in the conventional multi-phase clock distribution scheme. Two schemes, correct by design (CD) and correct by layout (CL) are proposed to boost performance over conventional methods. Mutual coupling is effectively used between N-phase clocks and matched clocks are distributed with minimal/zero power overhead. Implemented in 7nm FinFET technology, the proposed schemes improve clock swings by ~4.75%-8%, random jitter (RJ) by ~4%-10%, rise/fall times by 10%-23% and achieve perfect matching between N phases of the clock.</description></item><item><title>A 31.25 MHz Bandwidth 52.4 dB SNDR VCO-Based ADC With on-Chip Non-Linearity Correction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11054050</link><description>This brief presents a method for correcting nonlinearities in voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) based analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).

However, achieving this promise has remained elusive due to the lack of suitable training algorithms. Analog memory devices exhibit asymmetric and nonlinear switching behavior in addition to device-to-device variation, meaning that most, if not all, of the current off-the-shelf training algorithms cannot achieve good training outcomes. Recently introduced algorithms have attracted limited attention, as they require bi-directionally switching devices of unrealistically high symmetry and precision and are highly sensitive. A new algorithm, chopped TTv2 (c-TTv2), has been introduced, which leverages the chopped technique to address many of these challenges. In this brief, we evaluate the accuracy and the performance of the c-TTv2 algorithm for analog TL using ResNet and Swin-ViT models, pre-trained on the CIFAR10 dataset, on a fine-tuning task using two subsets of the CIFAR100 dataset. We also investigate the robustness of our algorithm to changes in some device and circuit non-idealities, including weight transfer noise, write noise, symmetry point skew, symmetry point variability, pulse update noise, mean pulse response, device-to-device variability, the number of states, output noise, I/O resolution, and the minimum and maximum conductance device-to-device variability. We demonstrate that the c-TTv2 algorithm mostly surpasses the performance of analog/digital training and narrows the performance gap between analog and digital TL while being robust to changes in device and circuit non-idealities.</description></item><item><title>Smart Watchdog for RISC-V: A Novel Spiking Neural Network Approach to Fault Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11051055</link><description>Watchdog mechanisms must detect permanent and transient faults with minimal power and area overheads, but their own reliability is vital, as failures can jeopardize system integrity.

First, the multiple renewable short-circuit ratio (MRSCR) is employed as a voltage stability indicator, providing a computationally efficient representation of voltage stability constraints. Subsequently, a double-loop multi-objective optimization framework is developed to generate an optimal SVG configuration scheme. The hierarchical structure consists of: (1) an inner-loop optimal power dispatch model that determines the minimum curtailment of renewable energy under both voltage stability constraints and the SVG configuration provided by the outer loop; (2) an outer-loop multi-objective optimization model that simultaneously minimizes SVG configuration costs and annual renewable energy curtailment to establish the SVG configuration. Experimental validation on the SG-118 test system demonstrates the superiority of the proposed framework. Through a comparative analysis of MRSCR characteristics and renewable energy accommodation levels, this brief presents an innovative SVG configuration methodology that effectively balances voltage stability maintenance with renewable energy integration enhancement.</description></item><item><title>A Three-Phase Fully-Integrated Reconfigurable Switched-Capacitor Converter for Near-Threshold Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11079946</link><description>A matrix analysis is proposed to generate all possible topologies of switched-capacitor converters (SCCs) with N flying capacitors.

High resolution digital pulse-width modulation (DPWM) can be used, but it needs to be designed with a reasonable operating frequency to avoid high dynamic power dissipation. In this brief, a DPWM based on a programmable delay unit implemented in a closed loop solution is presented. The loop ensures that the elements in the delay chain have the same delay enabling PVT variation rejection and result consistency without the need for a high operating frequency. This allows tuning signals with a resolution of  $195~ps$  and a high linearity, making the unit compatible with the requirements for driving GaN power devices.

In this work, we propose DeltaTrack, a hardware-efficient MOT accelerator that significantly reduces redundant computations by dynamically skipping detection in non-key frames. Our method employs a lightweight optical flow estimation module to predict object trajectories in non-key frames, invoking the full detector&#8211;tracker pipeline only when new objects are detected. In addition, for hardware efficiency, we introduce a variable LSB approximation scheme, performing multiplication with reduced bit-widths in selected layers: 4-bit weights  $\times 8$ -bit activations for accuracy-tolerant layers to improve performance, and 6-bit weights  $\times 8$ -bit activations for accuracy-critical layers to reduce dynamic power instead of improving latency. Based on post-layout estimation in 28-nm CMOS, DeltaTrack sustains 18.5 frame/s at  $640\times 640$  (7.59 Mpixel/s) and 5.29 mJ/frame (12.9 nJ/pixel); in normalized terms, this corresponds to  $2.26- 4.66\times $  higher throughput and  $1.29- 8.7\times $  lower energy than prior accelerators.</description></item><item><title>ESTU: Enabling Spiking Transformers on Ultra-Low-Power FPGAs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11218914</link><description>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are computational efficient algorithms that have proven to be very effective on edge applications.

Accurate prediction of nonlinear distortion is essential for making design trade-offs between output power and network throughput. We use the series form of the characteristic function (ch.f.) method to predict distortion spectra for sparse multi-carrier transmissions. This method results in efficient calculations of individual signal and distortion components. The method is validated both theoretically and practically. Theoretical validation is performed by modeling the signal as a bandpass Gaussian process that is hard limited, and it is shown that the series ch.f. method produces results that are identical with the classical Price&#8217;s theorem. Practical validation is shown by considering an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal with a fragmented spectrum which is then applied to an amplifier driven into compression for which application of Price&#8217;s theorem is difficult, and the predicted output spectrum corroborates laboratory measurements. Part of the computational efficiency is realized in that the nonlinearity can be expressed as the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of samples of its forward scattering parameter (i.e., S21) or transconductance function (including AM-PM effects), and distortion contributions of the signal can be expressed as numerical autoconvolutions of the clean spectrum. Signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) can be easily computed and parameterized across variables of interest, such as overdrive level.</description></item><item><title>A 12-MHz GaN-Based DC&#8211;DC Buck Converter Featuring Dual Reverse Conduction Controllers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11215820</link><description>This brief presents a 12-MHz 30V-to-12V GaN-based DC-DC buck converter incorporating a high-efficiency gate driver IC with dual (high-side and low-side) reverse conduction controllers (RCCs).

Traditional pipelining techniques distributing the computation across different on-chip processing units, while effective for throughput, do not address the latency demands posed by modern neural networks with complex interdependencies and extensive operator parallelism. There is a potential in leveraging operator parallelism to enable concurrent execution across multiple processing units, thereby reducing inference latency. However, prioritizing pipelining or parallel execution often necessitates a compromise, where optimizing one performance metric adversely impacts the other. This article introduces Para-Pipe, a hierarchical mapping framework that integrates intra- and interstage operator parallelism within a pipelined architecture. Para-Pipe navigates the tradeoff between throughput and latency by selectively fine-tuning parallelism levels within and across pipeline stages. This strategy can significantly reduce interprocessor communication overhead, significantly improving energy efficiency. Our evaluation demonstrates that Para-Pipe generates multiple Pareto-optimal configurations, achieving a balance between throughput and latency on an Amlogic SoC equipped with ARM big.LITTLE CPUs and GPU, as well as the Black Sesame Technology SoC featuring a deep learning accelerator and two DSPs. More importantly, throughput-optimized configurations under Para-Pipe on Amlogic SoC show an average energy efficiency improvement of 11.0% over purely pipelined strategies and 23.3% relative to nonpipelined parallel execution.</description></item><item><title>Mitigating Computation Errors of In-RRAM Computing Through Network Retraining With IR-Drop and Data Allocation Effects</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10982297</link><description>In recent years, In-RRAM Computing (IRC) has been a promising technique for deep neural network (DNN) applications. Combined with the proper pruning technique, the cost and energy of DNN computation can be further reduced. However, IRC often suffers from accuracy issues due to the nonideal effects in RRAM arrays, such as the sneak path and IR-drop, as well as its data allocation. To mitigate those nonideal effects, network retraining with extra error injection is often adopted to alleviate the accuracy degradation of IRC designs in the real environment. Conventional random disturbance and equation-based approaches did not consider the data allocation issue, which may incur larger errors for the sparse matrix generated by data pruning techniques. In this article, a fast and accurate IR-drop model is proposed to reflect the data-dependent effects, which is able to offer accurate error injection in the DNN training phase with sparse matrixes. As shown in the experimental results, the proposed simple model is successfully integrated into the network retraining flow with little overhead, which helps to alleviate the computation errors of IRC designs in the real environment.</description></item><item><title>A Sub- 10 &#956;s In-Memory-Search Collision Detection Accelerator Based on RRAM-TCAMs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002546</link><description>Collision detection can account for over 90% of the total calculation time in motion planning, which makes it critical to optimize the collision detection process.

In addition, we have observed that the location of denoisers in the entire image processing pipeline has a significant impact on resource consumption and denoising effectiveness. Deploying the denoiser closer to the image acquisition stage will be more effective in separating noise from the image. In this article, we propose a near-sensor compute-in-memory macro for visual perception denoising (Denoise on Sensor, DoS) along with its corresponding Edge Denoise U-net (EDU) architecture. DoS employs a mixed-signal circuit implementation for neural network inference, offering a notable advantage in terms of high speed and low power consumption compared to FPGA- or GPU-based approaches, making it feasible to deploy denoising tasks at the near-sensor edge. The simulation results show that the energy efficiency of DoS can reach 21.98 TOPS/W, and EDU deployed on DoS can achieve around 30 dB PSNR and 0.83 SSIM on KODAK, BSD300 and SET14 datasets.</description></item><item><title>Synthesis of a CNTFET-Based Ternary Full Adder Using a Carry-Less Ternary Half Adder</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11003064</link><description>The full adder (FA) is an essential element within arithmetic units, significantly contributing to their computational efficiency. Contemporary research endeavors are actively exploring optimized FA circuit designs. The integration of carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNTFETs) and multiple-valued logic (MVL) in circuit implementations holds great promise for achieving exceptional performance gains. This article proposes novel complete and partial ternary FA (TFA) architectures utilizing 76 and 55 CNTFETs, respectively, realized through a streamlined design methodology. The design strategically incorporates a proposed carry-less ternary half adder to compute the sum of the primary inputs. The resulting sum output then serves as a control signal in both TFA configurations. The TFA circuits are further implemented utilizing three unary operators, transmission gates, and pass transistor logic. HSPICE simulation results, conducted using Stanford 32-nm CNTFET technology at a  $V_{DD} \; {=} \; 0.9$  V, demonstrate that the proposed complete TFA design outperforms its counterparts with a 24.24% improvement in delay, a 5.81% reduction in power consumption, and a 28.71% decrease in energy consumption. Meanwhile, the proposed partial TFA offers 19.13% faster operation, 14.4% lower power consumption, and 30.74% better energy efficiency. The superiority of the proposed complete TFA is further substantiated through the creation of a three-trit ripple-carry adder.</description></item><item><title>VariPar: Variation-Aware Workload Partitioning in Chiplet-Based DNN Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10993501</link><description>Chiplet-based DNN accelerators have been extensively explored to save design and manufacturing costs. Previous works regard all chiplets as identical and employ uniform workload partitioning strategies. These workload partitioning strategies overlook various real-world factors that contribute to remarkable performance variations among chiplets, including manufacturing process variation, thermal condition, physical placement, and power supply condition. When considering these performance variations, a variation-aware workload partitioning can achieve superior performance. This article introduces VariPar, a systematic framework to employ variation-aware partitioning strategy in chiplet-based DNN accelerators. VariPar models performance variations for each chiplet and partition workloads accordingly. VariPar includes a simulator with multifactor variation modeling and a heuristic search engine to generate near-optimal partitioning within a reasonable time. Experiment results show that VariPar achieves  $1.45{\times }$  performance and  $1.82{\times }$  energy efficiency improvement on average when compared to uniform partitioning (UP) strategy.</description></item><item><title>Impact of Interconnect on Ferroelectric FinFET-Based Logic-in-Memory Circuits at 3-nm Technology Node</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11007562</link><description>This study delves into the impact of interconnects on ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) devices, employing ferroelectric materials in the gate stack for nonvolatile memory at the 3-nm technology node. Specifically, the study investigates the impact of interconnect on logic-in-memory (LiM) circuits. As the impact of interconnect become more pronounced at sub-nanometer scales, they are known to have a significant influence on circuit characteristics beyond the intrinsic properties of the components. Leveraging a newly developed path-finding process-design-kit (PDK), encompassing FeFET characteristics and interconnect properties, we explored various circuit configurations, such as full-adder (FA) and ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM). Our investigation revealed that FeFET-based LiM circuits offer advantages in area, propagation delay, and power consumption compared to traditional CMOS-based circuits. While interconnects still influence FeFET-based circuit characteristics, their impact is somewhat tempered in comparison. We meticulously quantified these impacts. The simulation of how the next generation of advanced interconnect processes can further enhance FeFET-based LiM circuit performance was conducted using the PDK. Through this analysis, we proposed guidelines for the layout design of future FeFET-based LiM circuits.</description></item><item><title>An Ultraspeed Middle Voltage and Timing Analyzer With Near-SPICE Accuracy for Charge-Recycling Buses</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10994426</link><description>By stacking two data channels between  $V_{DD}$  and  $V_{SS}$ , charge recycling buses (CRBs) halve the voltage swing on interconnects, achieving significant power savings for energy-efficient on-chip data transmission. However, the middle voltage ( $V_{MID}$ ) between the two channels may fluctuate dynamically due to the diversity of input data, which significantly impacts data propagation delay and reliability. Unfortunately, existing SPICE-based simulators do not run fast enough to identify the worst-case  $V_{MID}$  fluctuation and propagation delay, posing great challenges in CRB design. In this article, we present a dedicated CRB Simulator for fast and accurate  $V_{MID}$  and timing analysis. A highly condensed  $V_{MID}$  fluctuation model, which integrates each cycle&#8217;s  $V_{MID}$  changes into a single closed-form formula, is embedded in the simulator to predict  $V_{MID}$  values at clock edges. In addition, a speed-monitoring algorithm is developed to track the continuously changing signal propagation speed under intracycle  $V_{MID}$  fluctuations for accurate delay estimation. Both the  $V_{MID}$  fluctuation model and the delay estimation algorithm involve only a small number of arithmetic operations, thus featuring remarkably low computational complexity. Compared with HSPICE, our CRB Simulator runs &gt; $1.0\times 10^{5} $  times faster on average across various CRB circuits, with a  $V_{MID}$  prediction error of only 1.3 mV and a delay estimation error as low as 0.6%. The significant speed improvement combined with high accuracy makes our CRB Simulator an efficient and reliable solution for  $V_{MID}$  and timing analysis in CRB circuit design.</description></item><item><title>Theseus: Exploring Efficient Wafer-Scale Chip Design for Large Language Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981855</link><description>The emergence of the large language model (LLM) poses an exponential growth of demand for computation throughput, memory capacity, and communication bandwidth. Such a demand growth has significantly surpassed the improvement of corresponding chip designs. With the advancement of fabrication and integration technologies, designers have been developing wafer-scale chips (WSCs) to scale up and exploit the limits of computation density, memory capacity, and communication bandwidth at the level of a single chip. Existing solutions have demonstrated the significant advantages of WSCs over traditional designs, showing potential to effectively support LLM workloads. Despite the benefits, exploring the early-stage design space of WSCs for LLMs is a crucial yet challenging task due to the enormous and complicated design space, time-consuming evaluation methods, and inefficient exploration strategies. To address these challenges, we propose Theseus, an efficient WSC design space exploration framework for LLMs. We construct the design space of WSCs with various constraints considering the unique characteristics of WSCs. We propose efficient evaluation methodologies for large-scale NoC-based WSCs and introduce multifidelity Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore the design space. Evaluation results demonstrate the efficiency of Theseus that the searched Pareto optimal results outperform GPU cluster and existing WSC designs by up to 62.8%/73.7% in performance (with the same or lower power) and 38.6%/42.4% in power consumption (with the same or higher performance) for LLM training, while improving up to  $23.2\times $  and  $15.7\times $  for the performance and power of inference tasks. Furthermore, we conduct case studies to address the design tradeoffs in WSCs and provide insights to facilitate WSC designs for LLMs.</description></item></channel></rss>
