This article proposes a loosely coupled transformer with a customized T-shaped core and printed circuit board (PCB) coils, achieving high isolation and low capacitance within a limited footprint. Dual-output PCBs are oriented to reinforce the isolation between multiple coils, while orthogonal placement minimizes parasitic coupling. Bulk field grading is applied with an internal layer to reduce the electric field (E-field) stress, as well as alleviate the triple point. Finally, circuit decoupling is used to address the cross-coupling between multiple outputs, so that a quasi-constant voltage is available in each output channel against varying load while unregulated. The solution is tailored for a typical SiC half-bridge, which achieves a partial discharge inception voltage of 30 kV RMS with a minimal primary-to-secondary distance of 9.5 mm, a coupling capacitance of 2.65 pF, and an output power of 20 W per channel. The GDPS also supports self-regulated power delivery under slew rates of up to 180 kV/&#956;s, indicating its high common-mode transient immunity level.</description></item><item><title>An Empirical Model Informed Neural Network Core Loss Predictor for Soft Magnetic Materials</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947722</link><description>Advancements in materials, improved modeling, and optimized design of power magnetic components are imperative to push the efficiency and power density bounds of power electronic converters. The MagNet Challenge was launched in 2023 as the first IEEE Power Electronics Society International Challenge on Design Methods in Power Electronics, to leverage data-driven approaches for modeling losses in power magnetics with a goal to &#8220;Upgrade the Steinmetz Equation.&#8221; The nonlinear magnetic characteristics, material properties, tolerances introduced by material processing and manufacturing of ferrites, and circuit and component level nonidealities that impact core-loss measurements cannot be easily modeled using traditional methods. However, some of these effects can be captured using a neural network since they are good at deciphering the complex relationships between the input and output data. We presented an EMPirical model informed neural network (EMPINN) approach for core loss modeling of soft ferrites for the 2023 MagNet Challenge. In this work, we have radically improved our approach and reduced the size of our model by a factor of 20 to present an EMPINN core loss predictor. This article also delves deep into data preparation, choice of empirical models, custom training loss function, and how the neural network can find the localized fit Steinmetz parameters across a wide range of operating frequencies and peak flux-density ranges. The proposed model is compared with empirical and neural network-based approaches to showcase the benefits of combining these approaches. The proposed EMPINN core loss predictor outperforms state-of-the-art core loss models in terms of accuracy and size.</description></item><item><title>Monolithic Data-Driven Condition Monitoring Strategy for MMC Considering $C$ and ESR</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916965</link><description>Reliability of capacitors is a critical factor in ensuring the optimal performance of modular multilevel converters (MMC), which can be enhanced through health status monitoring and predictive maintenance. However, existing literature on MMC submodule capacitor condition monitoring primarily focuses on capacitance while overlooking the influences of the equivalent series resistance (ESR). Furthermore, the second problem is that the ESR is assumed to be negligible in the capacitance estimation. The assumption is not always valid, and may introduce significant errors in capacitance estimation. To improve existing condition monitoring methods, this article uses a capacitor&#8211;voltage equation to model the coupling effect of capacitance and ESR, based on which, particle swarm optimization is used to update the estimations of capacitance and ESR together. The proposed method offers more reliable health monitoring with two health indicators and derives a better estimation accuracy when the ESR is not negligible. Furthermore, to ensure the existence of the global optimal solution, the convexity of the data-driven problem is studied. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method are validated with simulations, experiments, and an open-source dataset.</description></item><item><title>A Series Arc Fault Detection Method Based on Time-Frequency Markov Permutation Transition Field for Photovoltaic Systems With Power Electronic Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10945512</link><description>Series arc faults (SAFs) are a primary cause of fire incidents in photovoltaic systems. Accurately and rapidly detecting SAF under the interference of power electronic devices remains a significant challenge. This article proposes an SAF detection method based on the time-frequency Markov permutation transition field (TFMPTF). First, variational mode decomposition is used to decompose the current signal into modes containing different frequency components to prevent interference between the information of different frequency bands. Then, the modes are transformed into two-dimensional matrices using TFMPTF. Innovatively, the concept of time-frequency permutation patterns state transition analysis in TFMPTF is proposed, from which the distinct structural information of the current signal can be effectively depicted. Afterward, singular value decomposition is employed to extract fault features from matrices. Finally, fault features are processed using a kernel extreme learning machine to obtain detection results. Offline experimental results show that the average detection accuracy of the proposed method is 98.97%, and the advancedness and adaptability of the proposed method are verified by comparing it with different methods. The proposed method and comparison methods are implemented in a microprogrammed control unit (MCU) for online experiments, further confirming that the detection speed and detection accuracy of the proposed method are reliable.</description></item><item><title>Model-Free Quantitative Diagnosis of Internal Short Circuit for Sodium-Ion Batteries With Charging Capacity Difference Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10945515</link><description>Thermal runaway caused by the internal short circuit (ISC) poses a significant safety risk for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) in electric vehicles and energy storage applications. Early detection of ISC faults is considered a potential way to reduce the risk associated with fire or explosion and can be identified via minor power leakage. However, diagnosing these leaks in the initial stages of ISC is quite challenging without battery modeling or preliminary experiments. Here, a model-free method based on charging capacity difference (CCD) analysis is proposed for quantitatively diagnosing ISC fault. First, a wavelet denoising algorithm with improved thresholding is presented to extract the real signals from the noise-containing voltage and current data. Subsequently, the ISC resistance is estimated by calculating the CCD variation between the ISC cell and the normal cell. Furthermore, the amount of power leakage during the charging process of ISC batteries is considered to improve the accuracy of the ISC diagnosis. Finally, experiments with elaborate ISC batteries are conducted to validate the method, achieving a resistance estimation error below 5% across different ISC severities while maintaining robustness to capacity inconsistencies. Compared to existing model-free methods, the proposed method significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy and broadens its applicability.</description></item><item><title>Active PWM Synchronization With ON-OFF-State Information of Power Semiconductors in Mission Profile Emulation Test</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10955354</link><description>In a power-electronics-based mission profile emulation (MPE) system, the converter under test (CUT) and the emulating converter are typically powered by the same dc voltage source for high efficiency. This also inevitably creates a circulating path for common-mode current ripples, which will cause sampling distortions and control errors. The current ripples have not been adequately addressed in the existing literature on the MPE. Typically, the common-mode current ripples can be suppressed by common-mode chokes. However, the amplitude of the common-mode current ripples fluctuates with the difference between the carriers of the CUT and the emulating converter, burdening the common-mode choke. The carrier difference can be fixed by synchronizing the carriers of the CUT and the emulating converter. However, conventional synchronization methods require modifications to the CUT, which changes its characteristics and prevents the MPE system from being plug-and-play. In this article, an active pulsewidth modulation synchronization method with on-off-state information of devices in the CUT is proposed. The carrier of the CUT can be reconstructed without modifications to the CUT. Then, the carrier of the emulating converter can be synchronized with the reconstructed carrier to minimize common-mode current ripples. This, in turn, reduces the burden on common-mode chokes and the volume of common-mode chokes. Besides, the control structure of the emulator remains unchanged, and the emulator can achieve a plug-and-play feature. Experimental results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Experimental Investigation on Fatigue Failure Evolution of Press-Pack IGBT Devices Under MMC Operating Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10949737</link><description>Converter valves based on the modular multilevel converter (MMC) topology are the core of the voltage source converter-based high-voltage direct current transmission system, with press-pack insulated gate bipolar transistor (PP IGBT) modules being the key components. Studying the long-term aging failure mechanism of the PP IGBT under actual MMC operating conditions is of great significance for improving the safe and reliable operation of the transmission system. In this article, an electric&#8211;thermal&#8211;mechanical coupled multifield model of the PP IGBT device is built to analyze the influence of junction temperature and pressure on stress and strain distribution, identifying the weak points. Then, based on the alternating current (ac) power cycling tested rig, which equivalently reproduces the working conditions of the MMC submodule, the influence of different junction temperatures and pressures on long-term aging failure is studied, revealing the evolution of key characteristic parameters during the aging process. Two main failure modes are identified under ac power cycling tests. One mode is caused by overvoltage short-circuit failure due to the blocking voltage drop, and the other is induced by open-circuit failure due to uncontrolled gate current. Finally, the evolution of microscopic morphology and static characteristic parameters over the entire lifetime during the power cycling test are obtained, emphasizing the differences between ac and direct current (dc) power cycling tests. The results show that there are significant differences in overheating failures between ac and dc power cycling tests, highlighting the critical role of ac conditions in failure analysis and reliability assessment. The study of the long-term failure evolution mechanism of the PP IGBT device under actual MMC working conditions aims to guide operational management, control protection, and device optimization design for the reliability of MMC systems.</description></item><item><title>A Coupled Inductor-Based SSCB With Reduced Components for DC Microgrid Protection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10930680</link><description>DC microgrids have gained importance for their high efficiency, no need for synchronization, high power quality, and potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Ensuring reliable and fast protection against over current and short-circuit faults is considered to be a challenge even to date. Solid-state circuit breakers (SSCBs) offer a promising solution, providing rapid and arc-less fault clearing. However, SSCBs employing fully controlled devices lead to higher costs and conduction losses. This article discusses a cost effective circuit breaker, using a semi-controlled switch based on a coupled inductor. The proposed SSCB has reduced overall components, a discharged capacitor and also allows the option to trip manually for maintenance. A detailed analysis and design methodology for component selection is presented in the later sections. The SSCB is experimentally validated by developing a laboratory prototype for a voltage rating of 400 V and at a nominal current of 15 and 20 A with a short circuit fault current of 60 A.</description></item><item><title>Transient Stability Analysis and Coordinated Phase Control Method for Multiparallel PLL-Synchronized Inverters During Grid Fault</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10937337</link><description>To utilize renewable energies, such as solar energy, distributed power generation systems are widely used, where multiple string inverters are parallelly connected to the grid and often adopt the phase-locked loop (PLL) for grid synchronization. However, under severe voltage sags caused by grid faults, the PLL-synchronized inverter system is susceptible to transient instability, which manifests as loss of synchronization. Although such transient instability caused by interactions between the inverter and the grid has been well studied in state-of-the-art research, the instability due to interactions among different inverters is not fully considered. Thus, to investigate this issue, this article establishes the modeling of an n-parallel PLL-synchronized inverter system for transient stability analysis while considering the parameter difference. It is revealed that the inter-inverter interaction introduces the transient instability risk, even though every grid-connected inverter is separately designed to keep synchronization during the grid fault. Subsequently, this article proposes a coordinated phase control method to enhance the transient stability of the multiparallel inverter system during grid faults. Finally, utilizing the RT-LAB OP5707XG platform, a real-time simulation model of a 3-parallel PLL-synchronized inverter system is established and tested to verify the theoretical analysis and the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Self-Powered SICE Circuit for Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting With a Complete Charge Extraction Electronic Breaker</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10962553</link><description>In piezoelectric transducer (PZT) energy harvesting, the synchronized electric charge extraction (SECE) technique is recognized for its desirable load-independent performance, while a self-powered SECE system remains a significant area of research. The electronic breaker is favored for its simplicity and reliability for achieving self-powering. However, current electronic breakers used in SECE tend to have a switch conduction time longer than one-fourth of the oscillation period ($T_{\rm LC}$), which results in charge backflow and compromises its load-independence feature. In this article, a complete charge extraction electronic breaker (CEB) is introduced. The CEB controls the switch-off action of the transistor via an envelope detector, ensuring the complete extraction of the accumulated charge from the PZT. Building upon the proposed CEB, a self-powered synchronous inversion and charge extraction (SP-SICE) circuit is proposed. Simulations and experimental results validate the effectiveness of both the CEB and the SP-SICE circuit. The measurements show that the SP-SICE circuit achieves a peak power output of 333.9 &#956;W and a significantly enhanced load-independence range up to 1000 k&#937;, which surpasses other existing techniques. The circuit has a stable output power without the need of a complex maximum power point tracking module, which makes it unprecedented among all relevant papers.</description></item><item><title>Elliptical-Curve-Based Method for Precise Calculation of Maximum Rotor EMF in DFIG Under Grid Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916789</link><description>The doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) is prone to losing control due to high rotor EMF during severe grid faults. Therefore, calculating the maximum rotor EMF of DFIG under different grid faults is the theoretical basis for various low voltage-ride through (LVRT) strategies. In traditional calculation methods, the amplitudes of the positive sequence, negative sequence, and transient dc components of the EMF are summed simply, but each component may not reach its maximum value simultaneously, leading to errors. In this article, the electromagnetic processes of the DFIG are investigated for quantifying the rotor EMF magnitude during grid faults. Then the vector trajectory of the rotor EMF is plotted by using the elliptical curve, and the analytical expression of the rotor EMF is obtained. By finding its extremum point, the maximum value of the rotor EMF under faults is calculated. Through the proposed method, the voltage boundary on the rotor side of DFIG under faults is precisely determined, which can provide reference for DFIG transient analysis and enhanced excitation converter design. At last, the accuracy of the proposed calculation method is experimentally validated through a 1.5-kW DFIG, with errors less than 2% under all fault conditions.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Construction Method and Control Strategy of Modular Battery Energy Storage Systems Based on Improved Droop Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10925909</link><description>The battery balancing technology based on modular converters needs to solve the problem of how to make many modular converters in series and parallel work together stably. In this article, according to the characteristics of modular battery energy storage systems, the application form of droop control is improved, and a battery unit with converter (BUC) is designed by combining battery, modular converter, and droop control. The properties of parallel BUCs and series BUCs are analyzed and redesigned to make them suitable for series&#8211;parallel expansion and the output current sharing control of the batteries. On this basis, a construction method of energy storage systems based on BUCs is proposed. In addition, a two-layer composite control strategy based on improved droop control is proposed, including the lower control strategy and the upper control strategy. Both simulation and physical experiments show that the proposed scheme can realize the constant voltage or constant current control of the total output of the energy storage system, and it can make the output current of each battery shared according to a given ratio with high control accuracy, and it can tolerate the communication failure of up to 2.5 s.</description></item><item><title>A New Active Clamp Quasi-Resonant High Step-Up DC/DC Converter Based on Built-In Transformer With Low Voltage Stress</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10930700</link><description>This article presents a new wide voltage gain dc/dc converter with low input current ripple. This topology uses a built-in transformer (BIT) with a low current level and voltage multiplier cell to reach high voltage gains under appropriate duty cycles. In this circuit, an active clamp circuit absorbs the energy of the leakage inductor from the BIT and delivers it to the output, thus, the zero voltage switching conditions at turn-on time are achieved for both switches. Due to the unique structure, very low voltage stresses are applied across the semiconductor components of the proposed circuit. In this circuit, a quasi-resonant performance in the main mode of the converter is considered to alleviate the switching power loss. Moreover, all diodes operate without reverse-recovery issues. Therefore, high voltage gain, low input current ripple, soft-switching performance, and low magnetic current stress are merits of the proposed converter, which helps to obtain enough high efficiency for the proposed circuit. The operational principle and steady-state analysis of the proposed converter have been analyzed in detail. Finally, a 25 V/400 V output, 200 W prototype with an efficiency of 96.3% is implemented in the laboratory to verify the analytical results.</description></item><item><title>Fault Diagnosis and Fault-Tolerant Operation Strategy for Triple-Port Hydrogen Production System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10930845</link><description>The multiport converter offers significant advantages in sustainable energy-based hydrogen production, such as high energy density and wide application potential. As the core energy hub in these systems, the multiport hydrogen converter demands high reliability. However, its numerous switches and complex operation increase the risk of failure. Currently, there are no effective fault diagnosis or fault tolerance solutions for these systems. Current fault diagnosis methods for two-port and multiport converters rely on many sensors, have low accuracy, and cannot handle multiswitch faults. In addition, existing fault tolerance strategies fall short of maintaining stable power for the electrolyzer and do not allow capacity sharing among ports. This article proposes a fault diagnosis method for open-circuit faults in a triple-port hydrogen converter and a corresponding fault-tolerant operating strategy. By optimizing a random forest algorithm with a sparrow search algorithm, high-precision multiswitch fault diagnosis is achieved using only three current sensors. Fault-tolerant operation of the system is ensured through an auxiliary switch following a failure. In addition, power sharing between output ports can be realized. This ensures the efficient and stable operation of the hydrogen production system. The effectiveness of this solution has been validated through simulations and experiments.</description></item><item><title>Grid-Following Voltage Source Converter With a PLL-Less PI Passivity-Based Controller for Unbalanced Grid Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10937257</link><description>Actual voltage-source converters (VSCs) advocate flexible and fast controls, low-voltage ripple levels at the dc-link, and grid compliances for operating under imbalanced grid conditions. To counteract these needs, this investigation focuses on proposing a straightforward passivity-inspired controller structure that facilitates the reference signals' generation to appropriately and quickly regulate grid currents and dc voltage ripples under unbalanced conditions, complying with the harmonic standard (ANSI/IEEE Std 519) thanks to the mitigation of the $\text{2}\omega$ oscillation. Since the proposal works on the abc reference frame, this prevents the use of a phase-locked loop, abc/dq0/abc and abc/$\alpha \beta$/abc transformations, and it reduces the computational burden in the prototyping stage. The results in both real-time simulation and experimental testbed confirm the controller's effectiveness for working under imbalance grid conditions greater than 35% of voltage drops in one or two phases, operating with low 2$\omega$ oscillations, and providing reactive power control. Besides, the controller is featured for settling back the voltage reference in less than 40 ms, guaranteeing voltage ripple levels below 5%, and fulfilling the harmonic standard since it reaches a total harmonic distortion maximum of 2.9%. Also, the passivity-based controller is characterized for reducing the computational burden by 73% compared to the widely used conventional, ensuring a lower computational cost than other approaches that use dq control as a basis.</description></item><item><title>Direct Power Distribution Strategy Based on Space Vector Modulation for Single-Stage Dual-DC-Port Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10944603</link><description>The single-stage dual-dc-port inverter directly connects the photovoltaic-battery hybrid system to the ac side, which offers the advantages of high efficiency and low cost due to the removal of dc&#8211;dc converter. The existing modulation-based power distribution strategies realize flexible power flow control by indirectly regulating redundant zero or small vectors via additional outer loop power controllers, which have the drawbacks of limited steady-state and dynamic response. To address this issue, the relationship between the dc-port power and large/small vectors is analytically revealed, which provides intuitive parameter design guidelines for power distribution control. On this basis, a direct power distribution strategy based on space-vector modulation is proposed, which regulates the dc-port power by splitting the reference voltage vector into large and small vectors. Compared to the conventional strategies, the proposed strategy shows better steady-state and dynamic response due to desirable power control directly realized in the modulation layer. Finally, the comprehensive comparison experimental tests are conducted to verify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed direct power distribution strategy.</description></item><item><title>A Decentralized Secondary Voltage Control Method With Unbalance Voltage Compensation Capability for Parallel Inverters in Islanded Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10945741</link><description>To stabilize voltage and improve power quality at the point of common coupling (PCC), this article extends the previous work by proposing secondary voltage control with unbalanced voltage compensation capability in islanded microgrids, which is fully independent of communication links. By injecting an extra small-ac-signal (SACS) into the output of each inverter, a droop relation is built between the SACS frequency and the voltage compensation components. The SACS active power is then calculated and coupled with the measured feeder impedance to adjust the voltage compensation components generated by the estimated positive and negative sequence voltage at the PCC, which in turn affects the SACS active power distribution. Compared with the existing method, the proposed method fully utilizes only one single injected SACS to achieve both secondary voltage control and unbalanced voltage compensation simultaneously, which reduces the control complexity and total harmonic distortion at the PCC. Meanwhile, the proposed method remains effective for both inaccurate PCC voltage estimation and activation delays. Moreover, the control parameters are designed in detail based on a small-signal differential mode model with complex feeder impedance. Finally, the simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>The Constant Power Transmission Control for Suppressing DC-Link Voltage Ripple Effect of Single-Phase AC&#8211;DC&#8211;AC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10946193</link><description>The dual active bridge (DAB) converter achieves relatively high efficiency and high power density. Therefore, it is widely used in ac&#8211;dc&#8211;ac converters to provide electrical isolation between the input and output. However, the single-phase converter inherently exhibits significant low-frequency voltage ripple in the DAB topology. Traditional control strategies focus on reducing voltage ripple and optimizing the capacitor size by transferring fluctuating power through the DAB converter. This method leads to higher magnetic component and switch currents, as well as a larger transformer size. To suppress these effects, this article proposes a constant power transmission (CPT) control for the DAB converter. The proposed CPT control dynamically adjusts the modulation width of each operating cycle by tracking the input&#8211;output voltage fluctuations in real-time through the control variables. This ensures constant power transfer in the DAB converter. Compared to traditional methods, the proposed control strategy reduces both the RMS and peak-to-peak values of the inductor current, thereby reducing the size of the converter and improving system efficiency. Simulation and experimental results confirm that the CPT control effectively reduces the peak-to-peak and RMS values of the inductor current by 40.7% and 18.8%, respectively, reduces the transformer size by 21.4%, and increases the efficiency by 1.1%.</description></item><item><title>Bidirectional Hybrid Isolated DC Transformer for All-DC Collection and Transmission System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947719</link><description>Bidirectional dc transformer (DCT) is the key energy conversion equipment for all-dc collection and transmission system. Cost, efficiency, and dc fault blocking capability are important considerations that are currently difficult to address simultaneously for the existing modular multilevel converter (MMC) based DCT. In this article, a bidirectional hybrid isolated dc transformer (BHIT) as an alternative to the existing MMC based DCT is proposed. By replacing half of the submodules (SMs) by antiparalleled thyristors, the proposed BHIT can reduce 36.7% device cost, 32.5% device loss, and 64.8% total SM capacitance compared with the existing MMC based DCTs. By tailoring the trapezoidal waveforms of the thyristors, continuous dc currents are ensured without any filtering effort. In addition, an active fault current limiting control is further proposed to reduce the fault current during short-circuit faults. The detailed operational analysis, control schemes, simulation results, and scale-down prototype are provided to validate the effectiveness of proposed topology.</description></item><item><title>Design of a Megawatt-Scale IGCT-Based Medium-Voltage Direct Current Transformer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947739</link><description>This article presents a robust design of a megawatt-scale medium-voltage (MV) direct current transformer (DCT) that features a bidirectional LLC resonant converter topology. This topology harnesses the inherent ability to control power flow seamlessly between two MVdc buses without relying on closed-loop control, maximizing efficiency and stability. Integrated gate-commutated thyristors were chosen as the power devices due to their superb on-state properties, enhancing the performance of this resonant DCT. The power stages incorporate a three-level neutral point clamped topology, paired with a split-capacitor dc-link, enabling three-level modulation during soft-start and two-level modulation during normal operation. Taking advantage of the resonant operation, the record-high switching frequency in the range of 5 kHz is achieved. The custom-designed medium-frequency transformer uses oil-insulated copper pipes for the windings and nanocrystalline core while integrating the inductive elements of the resonant tank. Power-in-the-loop experiments are presented that demonstrate the system's efficiency approaching 99%.</description></item><item><title>Understanding a Type of Forced Oscillation in Grid-Forming and Grid-Following Inverter Connected Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947721</link><description>This article investigates a novel oscillation phenomenon in systems with grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) inverters. Unlike previous studies that primarily focus on small-signal stability, this work explores forced oscillations (FOs), where GFL inverters act as excitation sources, inducing oscillations in GFM inverters. Specifically, interharmonics generated by maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control trigger low-frequency oscillation modes in GFM inverters. To analyze this phenomenon, the article first examines the power characteristics of the interharmonics injected by MPPT and leverages this understanding to develop a P-&#969; admittance model for GFM and GFL inverter connected systems. This model enables precise prediction of FO amplitudes and provides insights into the influence of factors such as the number of GFM inverters on oscillation behavior. To validate findings, hardware-in-the-loop experiments are performed to verify the observed behavior in a system consisting of photovoltaic farms with GFL control and battery energy storage systems with GFM control. Finally, merits and limitations of this work are explicitly highlighted to provide a balanced perspective.</description></item><item><title>Enhanced Modulation Strategy and Magnetic Component Parameter Design for Dual Active Bridge Converters to Improve Efficiency Under Variable Load Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10950087</link><description>Dual active bridge converter serves as the hub for energy exchange, with efficiency being its paramount indicator. A comprehensive optimization solution for efficiency improvement is proposed in this article, which consists of two parts. The part one is an optimal modulation strategy that achieves full soft switching under light-load conditions, minimizes peak current under heavy-load conditions, and enables seamless transitions between different modes. The part two is the optimization of magnetic component parameters, specifically the turns ratio and inductance, based on this modulation strategy to further reduce the current stress and enhance overall efficiency. Distinct from the previous work, the proposed solution offers noteworthy advantages: 1) the modulation strategy attains zero-voltage switching (ZVS) instead of quasi-ZVS under light-load conditions and facilitates seamless mode transitions; 2) the turns ratio and inductance are tailored for variable load conditions, rendering them applicable to a more extensive array of scenarios; 3) the analytical design method for magnetic component parameters enhances both the portability and accuracy compared to traditional exhaustive search methods. The experimental results confirm the theoretical analysis and illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed solution.</description></item><item><title>Quad-Port Magnetic Integrated Coupled Inductor Based Magnetic Network Energy Routers With High Power Density</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10962294</link><description>The magnetic network energy router (MNER) is promising for applications integrating multiple renewable sources, storages, and loads with the advantages of low component requirement, high efficiency, and high controllability. Power density is essential for MNERs, which is mainly restricted due to the use of multiple magnetic components, including the high-frequency transformer (HF-TF) and branch inductor (BI). This article proposes a quad-port magnetic integrated coupled inductor (MICI) based MNER with high power density. In the proposed quad-port MICI-MNER, the HF-TF and four BIs are magnetically integrated with a customized magnetic core, and the MNER's ports are partially magnetically coupled with each other to achieve the required power transfer.

This design achieves high voltage gain and a wide voltage regulation range, allowing for a reduced turns ratio in the high-frequency transformer (HFT). Consequently, voltage stress on the secondary-side switches is minimized, and associated losses in both the switches and HFT are reduced. An advanced modulation strategy is developed to enable soft-switching for all switches while effectively suppressing voltage spikes, without the need for additional clamping circuits. The microinverter supports split-phase output while maintaining voltage-source-inverter characteristics, making it suitable for both grid-connected and islanded operations. An accompanying control strategy ensures robust performance across both modes. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed topology, with a 600-W/50-Hz prototype achieving a peak efficiency of 97.12%.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Control of DC Coupled Fast EV Charging Station</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964326</link><description>This article proposes a new hierarchal control scheme for dc-coupled fast electric vehicle (EV) charging stations.

The main objectives of NPC-DAB converters include high steady-state efficiency, dc-bias elimination, fast dynamic characteristics, constant-power-load stability, and midpoint voltage balance (MVB). NPC-DAB converters may also experience various complicated operating conditions, such as startup, sudden reference voltage, and load change. Originating from the concept of natural switching surfaces (NSS), this article proposes a multitrajectory NSS boundary control (MNBC) to address these issues for the first time.

However, the conventional LLC resonant converter regulates the wide output voltage through a wide frequency range, which leads to low efficiency with large circulating energy and the difficulty of the resonant tank optimization.

Firstly, the behaviors of the MMC after the faults are analyzed, including single-phase and two-phase open-circuit faults. For single-phase open-circuit fault, the proposed strategy can be achieved by reconfiguring the amplitude and phase of the arm currents, thereby eliminating the zero-sequence current. For two-phase open-circuit fault, both the arm currents and voltages need to be reconfigured. After that, a method for detecting and locating specific faults is provided, which can be implemented by detecting the amplitude of the zero-sequence current. Besides, the postfault characteristics of the MMC under single-phase open-circuit condition are given, including submodule (SM) capacitor voltage ripple, circulating current, arm rms current and arm peak current. According to it, long-term postfault operation of the MMC can be guaranteed with 50% of the rated power. Additionally, stable dc-bus voltage and balanced SM capacitor voltage are satisfied even though one phase is disconnected. Moreover, with the proposed control strategy, although the MMC is able to operate for a short period of time in emergency situations when two phases are disconnected, it is not supposed to transmit power due to the inevitable large current on neutral conductors. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is validated by simulation and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>The Impact of Signal Delay and Power Surge on the Performance of Parity-Time Symmetric Wireless Power Transfer System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964069</link><description>Parity-time symmetry wireless power transfer (PTS-WPT) technology enables constant output that is independent of load and mutual inductance, simply by controlling the zero-crossing points of the transmitting voltage and current. This approach is straightforward to implement and holds significant application potential. This article provides a detailed analysis of the power characteristics of the PTS system under strong coupling conditions and identifies a phenomenon unique to low-frequency tracking, referred to as the double-PTS (DPTS) state.

The proposed converter has a feature of dual dc buses, one of which is adjustable while the other is always clamped by the input source. An auxiliary inductor is added to transmit power between the dual dc buses. The voltage of the adjustable dc-bus is regulated to match the voltages between two sides of the series inductor. With the voltage match control, the root mean square (rms) value of the transformer current is reduced and all switches can achieve theoretical full load range zero voltage switching (ZVS) operations. Furthermore, the auxiliary inductor processes only a portion of the main power and operates in continuous conduction mode (CCM), resulting in low losses and small size. Consequently, the efficiency is optimized over a wide voltage range. The working principle, working characteristics, and design considerations are introduced in detail. Finally, a 1 kW laboratory prototype is built to verify the theoretical analysis. The peak efficiency of the prototype is 96.8% and the efficiency over a wide range of voltage is always above 90%.</description></item><item><title>Optimization of the Energy Extraction Process From Capacitive Deionization Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10820837</link><description>Capacitive deionization cells, already present in different industrial applications, can also be used to generate electrical energy by alternating salt and fresh water flows (CapMix cells).

Offline DRL-based EMS is promising to improve the practicality as it could improve itself via offline collected data. However, the performance of existing offline DRL solutions is readily degraded due to the varying quality of training data. To overcome this problem, in this article, we propose a novel offline experience replay method to improve the adaptiveness and robustness of imperfect data and therefore enhance the energy-saving performance of associated EMSs. Specifically, the possibility of a specific piece of data being used is automatically tuned based on its contribution to the value function of DRL. A range of prevailing offline DRL algorithms have been used to validate the proposed experience replay method. Validation results suggest that the proposed method successfully broadly boosted all involved offline DRL algorithms in improving the EMS&#8217;s fuel economy. A hardware-in-the-loop test is also conducted to validate the reliability of the method. The proposed method is promising to improve the practicability of offline DRL in EMS for HEVs and broader fields.</description></item><item><title>Design and Control of a Multimodal Compliant Actuator Based on a Scissor-Epicyclic Mechanism for Wearable Robotics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10820004</link><description>Developing wearable robotic actuators by imitating the fiber activation patterns is an encouraging way to improve the performance of wearable robotics. Existing wearable robotic actuation systems cannot provide efficient assistance and accurate force delivery for human users. In this article, we develop a bionic multimodal compliant actuation system based on a scissor-epicyclic clutch mechanism that can provide fast twitch fibers (FTFs) contraction assistance, slow twitch fibers (STFs) contraction assistance or almost transform into a transparent device efficiently. In addition, a novel disturbance-observer-based virtual sliding mode torque controller (DVSMC) is designed to accurately control the output torque by eliminating unexpected external disturbance during the clutch engagement process. Comparative experimental results reveal that, under conditions without load disturbance, with load disturbance, and with time-varying load disturbance, the torque tracking error of the proposed controller is decreased by more than 60% compared with that of contrastive controllers, and the energy consumption is reduced by more than 50% compared with that of the conventional one. Finally, the experimental tests conducted on the human subject demonstrate the effectiveness of fast multimodal switching assistance and precise assistive torque delivery of the proposed wearable robotic system when interacting with human. This study highlights the significance of functional bionic design in wearable devices for human motion assistance and provides a brand-new actuation solution that could be introduced to the emerging biomimetic robot field.</description></item><item><title>Multifrequency Modeling and Stability Analysis of Multisampled Three-Phase Grid-Connected Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10811750</link><description>Digital control based on multisampling and multiupdating (MSMU) is a potential way to enhance the performance of grid-connected converters (GCCs). But the traditional model of MSMU pulse width modulation (PWM) can&#8217;t be used to predict high-frequency instability caused by perturbation sidebands. Multisampled GCCs&#8217; high-frequency response is still unknown and needs to be further explored. In this study, as for three-phase multisampled GCCs, a multifrequency model of MSMU PWM is built and verified, which considers perturbation sideband harmonics.

When properly configured, an RL agent can autonomously learn the optimal control policy by interacting with the converter system. In particular, similar to conventional finite-control-set model predictive control (FCS-MPC), the RL agent can learn the optimal switching strategy for the power converter and achieve desirable control performance. However, the alteration of closed-loop dynamics by the RL controller poses challenges in ensuring and assessing system stability. To address this, the article proposes formulating a Lyapunov function to guide the agent in learning an optimal control policy that enhances desirable control performance while ensuring closed-loop stability.

The technique consists of a three-step process, starting with online noise injection from the supplying converter to excite the system over a wide bandwidth. During the noise injection, the voltage and current at the converter output are recorded, allowing the system impedance to be calculated by fast Fourier transform. Finally, a neural network computes an estimate of the desired parameters. In this work, the Z-SpecNNet is applied to a series&#8211;series compensated system as it is one of the most popular compensation topologies in the literature and because it is the topology for which the information of load and mutual coupling result most correlated and therefore more difficult to estimate. The proposed Z-SpecNNet offers significant advantages because impedance spectroscopy is a straightforward and model-free method for characterizing system behavior. Furthermore, the neural network can be rapidly trained on a known transfer function. The technique has been demonstrated to be effective on a low-cost microcontroller that integrates the control of the converter. Experimental results indicate a mean relative estimation error of 7.81% with a total estimation time of 85 ms.</description></item><item><title>In-Circuit Impedance Extraction of Individual Components in Power Converter Using Capacitive Coupling Fixture Adapters Method for Electromagnetic Interference Estimation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10814971</link><description>In-circuit impedances of individual components in power converters, such as semiconductor power switches and inductors, can deviate from their off-circuit impedances, affecting electromagnetic interference (EMI) estimation. Existing methods pose challenges in extracting in-circuit impedances of these components. To overcome this limitation, this article proposes a method based on capacitive coupling fixture adapters (CFAs), where compact-sized CFAs serve as interconnections between the vector network analyzer (VNA) and the measured nodes of the power converter. Unlike the traditional capacitive coupling method, the CFAs consist of a five-stage structure with flexible end (FE), coaxial cable, dc blocker, protector, and attenuator; and also facilitate easy configuration into an operating power converter. Additionally, the FEs can be configured into reflection, parallel-through, and series-through capacitive coupling topologies to accommodate different component types. Moreover, a simple deembedding procedure is utilized to eliminate the parasitic effects of CFAs. Using a 450&#160;W dc&#8211;dc converter as a case study, the proposed method effectively extracts the in-circuit impedances of individual components within the power converter, enabling the creation of precise component models and finally realizing the accurate estimation of conducted EMI from 150&#160;kHz to 30&#160;MHz.</description></item><item><title>Low Carbon Economic Energy Management Method in a Microgrid Based on Enhanced D3QN Algorithm With Mixed Penalty Function</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10839632</link><description>In this paper, an enhanced dueling double deep Q network algorithm with mixed penalty function (EN-D3QN-MPF) for microgrid energy management control is developed.

Thus, this paper introduces a novel framework that intricately nests short-term operational characteristics within long-term operating rules to synchronize multi-timescale scheduling for WPHS-HES. The cornerstone of our approach is the novel formulation of the long-term scheduling as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). It is integrated seamlessly with short-term generation schedules developed through an optimal model embedded at each MDP step. To achieve computational effectiveness and reliability, we propose a hybrid data-model-driven solution that harnesses the synergistic benefits of both data-driven and model-driven methodologies. By leveraging deep reinforcement learning our approach significantly streamlines long-term decision variables, while ensuring strict adherence to short-term operational constraints through mixed integer linear programming. Empirical simulations on an operational WPHS-HES validate the superior efficacy of our method over traditional scenario reduction and robust optimization techniques. The results are striking that it achieves a reduction in sustainable energy curtailment from 11.67% to 0.63% and slashes the load shedding rate from 3.3% to 0.69%, thereby setting a new benchmark for intelligent energy management in complex hybrid systems.</description></item><item><title>Stochastic-Robust Optimal Power Flow With Small-Signal Stability Guarantee Under Renewable Uncertainties</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10839614</link><description>The diversification of power system operation modes raises the necessity of incorporating dynamic characteristics into steady-state operation. Small-signal stability is a representative issue. Though, existing frameworks either ignore the uncertainties of renewables, or only focus on the worst case. In this regard, this paper establishes a small-signal stability constrained stochastic-robust optimal power flow (OPF) model, which aims to optimize the expected cost of scheduling results with respect to the probability distributions of uncertainties while ensuring the small-signal stability requirement even in extreme scenarios. However, the synergy of uncertainties and the complicated small-signal stability mechanism significantly increase the solving difficulty. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework to overcome this challenge. First, we solve the stochastic OPF without small-signal stability constraints. For those results that do not meet the stability requirements, we use them as initial points to locate the effective boundary of the OPF feasible region where the robust small-signal stability requirement is satisfied. The effective boundary location is realized in an iterative manner. Then, in the neighborhood of this effective boundary, we construct a linear surrogate expression to represent the original robust small-signal stability constraint with Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and sample weighted support vector machine (swSVM). Finally, we solve the OPF model with the surrogate constraint. Moreover, we further propose a constraint correction strategy to guarantee the stability requirement. Case studies verify that the proposed method can acquire economical operation schemes and meet the robust small-signal stability requirement at the same time.</description></item><item><title>A Self-Supervised Pre-Learning Method for Low Wind Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10839636</link><description>As wind power is becoming a major energy source of power systems, the risk of power shortages due to its intermittent low power output is growing. Accurate forecasting of low wind power is crucial for mitigating these impacts. However, conventional methods struggle with few-sample issues due to the infrequent occurrence of low wind power, limiting accuracy improvements. To address this, a self-supervised pre-learning method is proposed to forecast low wind power occurrence period and output, leveraging the similarities and differences among low output samples to enhance forecasting accuracy. Low wind power output is decomposed into low wind power events (LWPE), which represent the occurrence timeframe, and low wind power processes (LWPP), which represent the power sequences. For LWPE forecasting, a siamese residual shrinkage network based on contrastive learning is introduced. This network pre-learns LWPE features from sample pairs to mitigate the impact of imbalanced sample distribution. For LWPP forecasting, a pattern recognition-based embedded forecasting framework is proposed, embedding typical LWPP fluctuations into the prediction network to improve fit under limited sample conditions. A case study on 3 wind farm clusters shows that this method improves LWPP forecasting accuracy from 84.99%-86.6% to 89.97%, outperforming traditional methods without pre-learning.</description></item><item><title>Estimation of Stability Region for Grid-Forming Inverters Considering Switching Characteristics via Constructing Damping-Reflected Energy Functions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10843855</link><description>Grid-forming (GFM) inverters have been widely used as the interface between renewable energy sources and power grid. During low voltage ride through (LVRT) period, to limit the fault current, GFM inverters will experience the switching of control strategy, which makes the transient stability of GFM inverters exhibit different features from that of synchronous generators (SGs). In this paper, considering the switching characteristics induced by virtual impedance (VI), the framework of predicting the transient stability of GFM inverters during the fault period and after fault clearance is established from the perspective of energy. To reduce the conservativeness of the stability region, a uniform energy function considering the damping dissipation and the dynamics of reactive power control loop is constructed for the transient stability analysis of GFM inverters. Compared with existing approaches, the stability region estimated by the proposed energy function can intuitively show the effect of damping, and effectively reduce the degree of conservatism in transient stability prediction. Finally, simulation and hardware-in-loop experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method in the transient stability prediction of GFM inverters with switching characteristics.</description></item><item><title>A Decentralized Demanded Power Tracking and Voltage Control Method for Wind Farms Based on Data-Driven Sensitivities</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10848501</link><description>Efficient power dispatch in wind farms (WFs) hinges on precise demanded power tracking. This study proposes a decentralized WF power tracking and voltage control method based on data-driven sensitivities (DDSs). This method relies only on local operational variables for model predictive control (MPC), achieving near-global optimal solutions. With a backpropagation algorithm, a new sensitivity calculation method is designed to yield DDSs by computing the gradients of a global mapping model (GMM). The voltage DDSs can be derived simply by calculating the gradient of the voltage GMM and can replace the voltage sensitivities in traditional MPC methods. The power DDSs establishes linear relationships between the power outputs of different wind turbines (WTs), simplifying the WF state-space equations to local prediction models for reducing the quadratic programming dimensions. The three control modes designed based on DDSs enable control without WF line parameters, reduce computational complexity, or combine both effects. The variable spacing constraint linearization method transforms nonlinear constraints into linear ones, addressing the nonlinear coupling between control variables. Testing on a WF with 32 WTs in MATLAB/Simulink demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method comparable to centralized control methods.</description></item><item><title>Approximately Adaptive Distributionally Robust Optimization for Energy and Reserve Dispatch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10849978</link><description>This paper proposes two novel paradigms of approximately adaptive distributionally robust optimization (AADRO) for the energy and reserve dispatch with wind uncertainty. The piecewise linear policy-based AADRO (PLP-AADRO) approximates the adaptive optimization-based recourse decision as piecewise affine adjustment, while the piecewise value function-based AADRO (PVF-AADRO) approximates the quadratic recourse problem as piecewise linear recourse problems. Moreover, an equal probability principle is developed to achieve a high-quality segmentation of the wind power ambiguity set. Consequently, the distributionally robust quadratic cost constraint can be decomposed into decoupled piecewise constraints, allowing the dispatch problem to be formulated as a less-iterative or even non-iterative program. The two-stage AADROs with polyhedron supported uncertainties are first recast precisely as tractable forms with semidefinite constraints, by employing duality theory and S-lemma. Then, the distributionally robust cost constraint in PVF-AADRO is handled by dual vertex generation, and the bilinear terms in both AADROs are addressed by alternating optimization. Numerical simulations verify the efficiency of AADROs in approximating the strict adaptive distributionally robust optimization, and their adaptability in different cases is discussed.</description></item><item><title>Inertia Transmission Control of Full-Power Converter Variable-Speed Pumped Storage System for Grid Frequency Support</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10852016</link><description>Full-power converter variable-speed pumped storage (FPC-VSPS) is a promising technique for flexible power regulation in small-scale distributed hydroelectric power plants. However, conventional vector control limits the synchronous motor of the FPC-VSPS from providing inertia support to the power grid. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces an inertia transmission control for FPC-VSPS based on the concept of DC voltage synchronization. Firstly, the control incorporates the DC capacitor power equation into the GSC control. To enable inertia transmission from the FPC-VSPS synchronous machine, the DC capacitor dynamics are fed into both the speed and torque control of the MSC. Secondly, a torsion spring-rigid body equivalent model is introduced based on the inertia transmission process, analyzing the effects of physical parameters, control coefficients, and transmission delays on the inertia transmission performance. Theoretical analysis and simulation results reveal that the inherent physical differences and transmission delay have a negative impact on the effectiveness of the inertia transmission. Consequently, a DC capacitor design method based on inertia matching is proposed, accounting for the constraints of physical inertia matching, system stability, and operational security. Finally, simulations and experiments prove the necessity of inertia matching and verify the effectiveness of the proposed control to cope with frequency fluctuations in both pumping and generating modes.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Grid-Forming Undersea Pumped Storage to Enable 100% Renewable Offshore Oilfield Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854915</link><description>To advance carbon reduction of the offshore oilfield power system (OOPS), the grid-forming undersea pumped storage system (GFM-UPSS) emerges as a promising solution. This paper introduces a novel framework for a 100% renewable OOPS utilizing the GFM-UPSS. Firstly, the control strategy of the GFM-UPSS is presented. It consists of the grid-side converter (GSC), machine-side converter (MSC), and reversible pump-turbine (RPT) to achieve frequency and voltage regulation. A steady-state model is then developed detailing the water head, power, and volume of the spherical shell. In addition, the paper explores the converter parameter impacts on the GFM-UPSS transient model and derives the closed-form solutions. With the steady-state model, an optimal sizing method is presented and economic advantages in the marine environment are studied for the GFM-UPSS. Finally, EMT simulations are conducted to assess the frequency &amp; voltage stabilities and verify the effectiveness of the GFM-UPSS in enabling a 100% renewable OOPS. The optimal sizing results show that construction costs, mainly for OWP, are dominated and are influenced by sphere radius, placement depth, and start-stop cycles, while a 2.5 capacity ratio between OWP and GFM-UPSS consistently emerges as optimal. Moreover, analysis of transient stability shows that it improves with higher frequency &amp; voltage modulation coefficient and lower virtual impedance. The impact of RPT and MSC, mainly on frequency regulation, is determined by the DC droop coefficient and turbine inertia.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Short-Term Spatio-Temporal Wind Speed Prediction Based on OWT-STGradRAM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10869841</link><description>Taking into account the orientation and distance characteristics of wind turbine stations in wind farms can improve the accuracy of wind power prediction. This paper proposed a deep learning spatio-temporal prediction method named orthogonal wind direction transformation spatio-temporal gradient Regression Activation Mapping (OWT-STGrad-RAM) for wind speed prediction. The model encodes the wind farm using an image, and each wind turbine is encoded as a point in the image. The spatio-temporal data related to wind turbines, such as wind speed, temperature, and air pressure, are integrated into fusion features through spatio-temporal fusion convolutional networks model for pre training to obtain a feature dataset. OWT is used to eliminate the effects of different prevailing winds, and STGrad-RAM is used to characterize the orientation and distance between wind turbine nodes and make the spatial features interpretable. The feature dataset is used for wind speed prediction. The experimental results show that the proposed method has achieved a significant improvement in wind speed prediction accuracy compared to the comparative models.</description></item><item><title>Study on Output Power of Wind Farm Composed of Current-Source Series-Connected Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10870180</link><description>The output power of a wind farm composed of current-source series-connected wind turbine/generators with thyristor rectifier circuits that does not require offshore substation is studied.

Then, dynamic performances for a single wind turbine/generator as well as for a wind farm (WF) consisting of 36 wind turbines are simulated for an average wind speed of 8.65 m/s considering offshore wind turbulence. The simulation results show that the ratio of the standard deviation of the output fluctuation to the average output of single wind turbine is 39.38%, while that of WF is 6.24%, confirming that output leveling effect is achieved.</description></item><item><title>Learning a Robust Fuzzy Cognitive Map Based on Bubble Entropy Fusion With SCAD Regularization for Solar Power Generation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10869385</link><description>Accurate and reliable solar photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting are crucial for cost-effective resource planning and stable operation of smart grids. However, current methods are affected by the intermittent, non-stationary and stochastic nature of solar energy and thus cannot satisfy the requirement of high-precision forecasting. To this end, we propose a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) forecasting method based on bubble entropy and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) regularization, called BesFCM. This method first utilizes bubble entropy to fuse two mode decomposition methods to improve the representation of PV data to capture effective features with significant stability and discriminative ability, then employs a FCM with a combination of fuzzy logic, neural networks, and expert systems to model solar PV power generation, and finally develops a high order FCM learning method based on SCAD regularization to alleviate the overfitting problem, enhancing the robustness and generalization ability of forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate that the BesFCM achieves the best overall performance on PV power datasets from multiple sampling intervals in multiple regions of Belgium compared to multiple state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness for solar power generation forecasting, providing support and reference for improving the quality of smart grid dispatch and reducing spare capacity reserves.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Suppression for Temporary Overvoltage Considering Dynamic Interactions Between LCC-HVDC and Renewable Energy Plants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10874178</link><description>Temporary overvoltage (TOV) severely restricts the development and utilization of renewable power resources (RPRs), especially when RPRs are delivered through the line commutated converter-based high voltage direct current (LCC-HVDC) system. To reveal the TOV mechanism for the sending system during commutation failures (CFs), the transient process of the system is partitioned into different stages, where the evolution of the system trajectories is analyzed. On this basis, the variation of AC voltage and DC current considering complex dynamic interactions between LCC-HVDC and renewable energy Plants (REPs) during repetitive CFs (RCFs) is clearly quantified. After revealing the impact of control parameters of both REPs and the LCC-HVDC on the TOV during RCFs, a collaborative optimization method for control parameters is proposed for TOV suppression. Moreover, when the blocking after the RCF tends to be inevitable, the optimal blocking moment is determined to inhibit the TOV caused by HVDC blocking. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed methods are verified with EMT simulations of a typical benchmark system.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Modeling and Switching Control of Electric Vehicle Aggregation for Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10878811</link><description>The aggregation and control of massive electric vehicles (EVs) are crucial for grid frequency regulation (FR). However, challenges such as disordered charging, high computational and communication burdens need to be addressed. To this end, a hierarchical hybrid modeling and switching control method for EV aggregation (EVA) is proposed. For modeling, a hybrid state set for EVs comprising three discrete states and one dynamic state is established at the local level. The dynamic state's flexibility allows EVs to charge orderly while considering user demands. At the aggregation level, a Markov-based EVA state space model is designed, integrating the user's willingness-to-pay (WTP) index and hybrid state. It estimates the EVA's FR capacity (FRC) with a lower communication burden and reduces computational burden by simplifying control dimensions. For control, a model predictive control (MPC)-based state switching method is designed at the aggregation level, considering user's FR willingness and power cancellation issue. Furthermore, a predictive compensation mechanism is designed to address model parameter errors resulting from asynchronous control cycles. At the local level, a probabilistic response method is proposed for responding to dispatched control signals, which reduces battery degradation through the state of charge (SOC) based response probability generation. Simulation results validate the method's effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Coordinated Control Strategy for Enhanced Performance of Energy Storage System in Secondary Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10879267</link><description>This paper presents a hierarchical coordinated con-trol strategy designed to enhance the overall performance of the energy storage system (ESS) in secondary frequency regulation (SFR). The strategy includes three layers: the system layer, the ESS operation layer, and the coordination control layer. In the system layer, a detailed frequency response model of the multi-area interconnected system is developed. The intrinsic mech-anisms of timing, depth, and the effect of ESS and conventional generating unit (CGU) in SFR are revealed through the sen-sitivity analysis of the power allocation factor. Furthermore, a sensitivity-based adaptive power allocation strategy for ESS and CGU is proposed, which improves the SFR effect while reducing the ESS power and maintaining the state of charge (SOC). In the ESS operation layer, the ESS is divided into two components for integration, employing a monotonic charge-discharge strategy to reduce lifetime degradation caused by frequent charging and discharging, thereby enhancing operational efficiency. In the coordination control layer, considering the power prediction and the ESS operating state, a SOC optimization strategy based on the double-input fuzzy control (DIFC) is proposed. It further dynamically corrects the power allocation factor based on fuzzy rules, optimizing the SOC level to ensure the bidirectional SFR capability of ESS under all conditions. The case studies validate the overall SFR performance of the proposed strategy with different scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Spatiotemporal Graph Contrastive Learning for Wind Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10879260</link><description>Accurate and robust wind power forecasting plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety and stability of the power system. Hybrid spatiotemporal forecasting models based on graph convolutional networks have received widespread attention due to their advantages in spatial feature extraction. However, these methods are susceptible to the quality of the generated graph due to data noise and missing issues, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid deep learning model based on spatiotemporal graph contrastive learning to address the above issues. Specifically, the model's encoder combines an adaptive graph convolutional network with LSTM to capture fine-grained spatiotemporal dependencies. To enhance the robustness of the encoder against data noise, we apply feature-level and topology-level data augmentation techniques to the model's input and design two contrastive learning auxiliary tasks from the temporal and spatial dimensions, respectively. Furthermore, to capture more comprehensive spatial correlations, we construct an adaptive graph by fusing the static graph with a learnable parameter matrix. Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.</description></item><item><title>A Carryover Storage Valuation Framework for Medium-Term Cascaded Hydropower Planning: A Portland General Electric System Study</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884034</link><description>Medium-term planning of cascaded hydropower (CHP) determines appropriate carryover storage levels in reservoirs to optimize the usage of available water resources. This optimization seeks to maximize the hydropower generated in the current period (i.e., immediate benefit) plus the potential hydropower generation in the future period (i.e., future value). Thus, in the medium-term planning, properly quantifying the future value deposited in carryover storage is essential to achieve a balanced trade-off between immediate benefit and future value. To this end, this paper presents a framework to quantify the future value of carryover storage, which consists of three major steps: i) constructing a deterministic model to calculate the maximum possible hydropower generation that a given level of carryover storage can deliver in the future period; ii) extracting the implicit locational marginal water value (LMWV) of carryover storage for each reservoir by applying a partition-then-extract algorithm to the constructed model; and iii) developing a set of analytical rules based on the extracted LMWV to effectively calculate the future value. These rules can be seamlessly integrated into medium-term CHP planning models as tractable mixed-integer linear constraints to quantify the future value properly, and can be easily visualized to offer valuable insights for CHP operators. Finally, numerical results on Portland General Electric's CHP demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented framework in aiding medium-term CHP planning to identify suitable carryover storage strategies.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Hydrogen Production Dispatch of Networked Hydrogen-Based Microgrids via a Distributed Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884064</link><description>Hydrogen has drawn significant attention due to its long-term storage capability and wide industrial applications. How to efficiently utilize renewable energy to maximize hydrogen production of a group of spatially distributed electrolyzers is a fundamental problem urgently needed to be solved. This paper is the first to attempt to address the problem by proposing a hydrogen production dispatch (HPD) model for hydrogen-based microgrids with proton exchange membrane electrolyzers. Considering the limited communication and privacy requirement of distributed energy systems, a distributed hydrogen production dispatch framework is constructed. The original nonconvex optimization problem is transformed into a convex form. Furthermore, it is proven that the marginal hydrogen production benefit of each electrolyzer should be equal for the optimal hydrogen production dispatch via Lagrangian duality. By setting the marginal hydrogen production benefit as a consensus variable, a novel distributed consensus-based dispatch algorithm is developed, in which an event-triggered communication scheme is introduced to alleviate the communication burden. It is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm achieves linear convergence. Results of the case study indicate that the proposed strategy yields the optimal hydrogen production benefit, which is increased by 9.43% compared to on-site hydrogen production and demonstrates excellent solving efficiency especially for large-scale systems.</description></item><item><title>Transient Frequency-Voltage Support Strategy for VSC-MTDC Integrated Offshore Wind Farms Based on Perturbation Observer and Funnel Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884062</link><description>To address the transient frequency and voltage stability challenges posed by low-inertia offshore wind farms (OWFs) connected through voltage source converter (VSC) based multi-terminal high voltage direct current (VSC-MTDC) system, a nonlinear perturbation observer and funnel control-based transient frequency and voltage support (PFTFVS) control strategy is proposed for VSC-MTDC integrated OWFs system. This approach utilizes improved estimation ability of the observer and adaptive feature of the funnel controller to enhance transient support capability and disturbance rejection performance of the system. The strategy comprises three parts: 1) an adaptive transient frequency support and rotor speed control method for wind turbines is devised to enhance the frequency support capability of OWFs; 2) considering the energy storage capability of DC capacitor in VSC-MTDC system, a transient frequency support controller is designed for VSC station to swiftly manage transient frequency variations; and 3) utilizing the rapid power regulation ability of VSC-MTDC, a transient voltage support controller is developed for VSC station to enhance voltage stability and boost the power transmission capacity. Finally, dynamic simulations of VSC-MTDC integrated OWFs system are built to verify the validity and robustness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Integration of Electrical Energy Storage in Wave Energy Hardware-in-the-Loop Test Rigs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10887246</link><description>This paper presents a design methodology for integrating an electrical energy storage unit into a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test rig for wave energy converters (WECs). Typically, the power production from WECs is characterised by pronounced fluctuations at low frequency and high peaks compared to the average. Wave energy test rigs should be able to reproduce these variations to impose realistic conditions to the device under test. Thus, the grid connection of the rig must be sized to cope with high peaks, and additional measures may be required to avoid disturbances on nearby loads and negative effects on voltage quality. The integration of electrical energy storage can smoothen power fluctuations and mitigate these drawbacks, while resulting in lower installation and operating costs. The design methodology indicates how to effectively size the storage unit and which technology to favour based on the type and duration of test campaigns. Numerical simulation results are presented for a dual HIL test rig and operational profiles of three different WEC technologies. For designs with energy storage lifetime shorter than the calendar life, sensitivity analyses indicate that the rig's annual utilisation rate and the level of accelerated testing have a significant effect on the storage energy requirements.</description></item><item><title>Station-Network Cooperative Optimization Planning of Urban Integrated Energy System Considering Heat Storage Capacity of Heat Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891182</link><description>Heat storage capacity of heat network in urban integrated energy system (UIES) has the potential to significantly improve the operational flexibility of the system. To obtain the optimal UIES planning scheme, a UIES station-network cooperative optimization planning (UIES-SNCOP) method considering heat storage capacity is proposed. First, a heat network operation model under constant flow-variable temperature considering flow direction depiction is established for solving the problem that the existing model cannot be directly applied to UIES-SNCOP because the flow direction of pipeline cannot be predetermined. Then, a radial structure-oriented topology model of distribution and heat networks is developed to ensure the radiality of energy supply network while also reducing planning cost. On this basis, a UIES-SNCOP model based on information gap decision theory and stochastic optimization is constructed to realize the co-optimization of the siting and sizing of energy station and topology of distribution and heat networks. Finally, a solution method of UIES-SNCOP model based on relaxation-contraction coupled McCormick envelope is proposed for effectively improving the accuracy of solution result. The planning of UIES is conducted on an urban topology containing 55 nodes to test the performance of the proposed method, and simulation results indicate that the proposed method outperforms other existing methods in terms of reducing planning cost, ensuring radial structure of the energy supply network, utilizing heat storage capacity and enhancing solution accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Two-Stage Adaptive Robust Model for AC Network-Constrained Unit Commitment in Power Systems With Uncertain Wind Power</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891662</link><description>With wind power being extensively integrated into power systems, its inherent uncertainty and variability pose significant challenges to the power system operational security. Traditional robust optimization methods capture the worst-case scenario, which results in overly conservative decisions, with insufficient considerations on AC network constraints in power systems. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a novel adaptive robust AC network-constrained unit commitment (AC-NCUC) model that considers both the AC network security and the uncertainty of wind power output in power systems. More specifically, a convex polyhedral uncertainty set is constructed to characterize the uncertain wind power output. Here, the conservativeness of UC dispatch decisions can be adjusted by modifying the size of the convex polyhedral uncertainty set. Then, we combine Benders&#8217; decomposition and Newton-Raphson methods to solve the AC-NCUC model for the optimal dispatch decisions. Simulation results on the modified IEEE 6-bus and IEEE RTS 79 systems validate the rationality and validity of our proposed approach. The proposed AC-NCUC model effectively maintains the system security while ensuring economic effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Power Control in Wind Farms for Gearbox Load Reduction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891746</link><description>Rapid power and torque fluctuations in time-varying conditions increase the fatigue load and failure rate of wind turbine (WT) gearboxes. In this study, an optimal power control method is proposed for a wind farm (WF) to improve the power flow and service quality, allowing the WF to track the power demand instructions from the transmission system operator while minimizing the fluctuations of vibration displacements inside the gearbox. A comprehensive dynamic model of the gearbox is developed by analyzing the transmission mechanism of key gearbox components, such as the planet carrier, planet gears, sun gears, and spur gears, describing the correlation between the internal vibration and mechanical torque and power output. Then, an optimal power control problem is formulated based on model predictive control to suppress the fatigue load while tracking power. Furthermore, a fatigue evaluation system is built based on the real-time vibration state inside the gearbox to characterize the service quality of WTs and guide the power generation of the WF. This approach provides a safety-oriented boundary regarding the WT fatigue load in the optimal power dispatch issue of WFs to suppress potential WT failures. Case studies in MATLAB/Simulink demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Deterministic Forecasts and Prediction Intervals for Wind Speed Using Enhanced Multi-Quantile Loss Based Dilated Causal Convolutions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891745</link><description>With rising wind power penetration into power systems obtaining wind speed forecasts with associated uncertainty becomes crucial for better planning and dispatch. This study proposes an enhanced multi quantile regression-based loss function specially tailored to train models to generate both deterministic forecast and the corresponding prediction intervals. Though the regression architecture of the model plays an important role in extracting precise forecasts, however, its efficiency is often ignored which may be a downside for short term forecasting scenarios where model training time may also be a significant factor. The present study therefore designed a multi-scale dilated convolution-based architecture for enhanced efficiency. The architecture generates predictions at different scales which are combined using particle swarm optimization to obtain optimal forecasts. The model is trained using the proposed loss function on datasets from both NREL simulations and operational Chinese state grid measurements across three different locations. The proposed model exhibits excellent forecasting performance in comparative experiments with both simulated and real-world operational datasets.</description></item><item><title>Stability Region Estimation and Decentralized Transient Control for Parallel Grid-Tied Grid-Forming Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10892023</link><description>Renewable energyes are highly penetrated in power system through Grid-forming inverter (GFMI). Transient stability of single GFMI system under severe grid fault has been thoroughly analyzed in recent years, but quantitative analysis for parallel grid-tied GFMI system is rarely studied. To fill this gap, the large signal equivalent model of parallel system considering the interaction between inverters is newly built. Based on the model, the Lyapunov function incorporating kinetic energy, potential energy, damping dissipation, and interaction energy is constructed for accurate stability region estimation. Then, the effect of control parameters on stability region is analyzed, indicating that increasing damping, reducing inertia, and lowering reference power of one GFMI can deteriorate stability margin of parallel GFMI system due to the enlarged interaction power, which is distinct from single GFMI system. For this, a decentralized transient control that adaptively adjusts damping, inertia, and reference power is proposed to guarantee transient stability and achieve low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) for parallel system without relying on communication, system information. Finally, simulation and experimental tests validate the correctness of theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of proposed control.</description></item><item><title>Aggregation Feasible Region of Full Power Spectrum Electric Vehicles Based on Polyhedron Projection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10900425</link><description>The aggregation of electric vehicles (EVs) can take full advantage of the power flexibility of EV clusters, based on the aggregation feasible region (AFR) of EVs. However, existing aggregation techniques of conventional distributed energy resources (DERs), exhibit significant inaccuracies or require excessive computational efforts when applied to EVs with high power and small capacity. To solve this problem, an iterative method based on the high dimensional polyhedron projection principle is proposed to derive the exact AFR formula for the full power spectrum of EVs, and the limitations of the existing analytical AFR are revealed. The results reveal that the exact AFR is a set of linear inequalities, whose coefficients can be represented in binary code, and the complexity of the right side is linear with the number of EVs, making it highly conducive to programming calculations. Moreover, this paper proposes a simplified practical AFR based on the exact AFR, which reduces computational complexity. Numerical simulation cases demonstrate that the accuracy of this simplified approach is still higher than that of existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Matrix Adaptive Correction-Based Dynamic Dimensionality Reduction Method for Voltage-Related TSCOPF in Bulk Power Systems With High Wind Power Penetration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10902439</link><description>Transient security-constrained optimal power flow (TSCOPF) is an important class of problems for system operation. Several challenges arise when dealing with bulk power grids, including the large size and complex transient voltage behaviors. This paper aims to address such hurdles by proposing a dynamic dimensionality reduction matrix adaptive correction (DDR-MAC) algorithm, which can effectively evaluate proper Volt/Var levels to guarantee secure system operation. First, this paper performs dimensionality reduction processing at the bus and device levels to obtain a low-dimensional model with dominant modes, which solves the problems of high-order and large computational volumes of differential equations. Moreover, a dimensionality reduction error assessment model is established to ensure reduced-order accuracy.

Furthermore, a secant/tangent sensitivity adaptive correction method is presented to achieve fast computation. The DDR-MAC approach is verified across differently scaled IEEE test systems and the Nordic test system and can improve computational efficiency by 49.07% while offering higher accuracy than traditional computation methods.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Synthetic Inertia Control for Two-Area Power Systems With Wind Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10906542</link><description>Modern power systems may experience decrease in stability due to the increased integration of variable generation sources that depend on power electronics converters. A common control strategy is to incorporate synthetic inertia from wind turbines, typically using state-feedback control in a single-area power system model that assumes uniform frequency. As power systems become more interconnected, different frequency behaviors can emerge in multiple areas, casting doubt on current methods that do not consider multi-area stability. Furthermore, most single-area synthetic inertia methods ignore the limitations of communication systems in real power systems. This paper proposes a decentralized synthetic inertia control strategy for a two-area power system with wind power. This approach accounts for the actual behavior of power systems in different areas and the limitations of communication systems in real scenarios. Numerical results, derived from dynamic models using actual operating data from the Chilean Power System, demonstrate that the decentralized control performs comparably to centralized control in maintaining power system stability and optimizing frequency nadir. However, the decentralized control has the advantage of relying solely on local variables, eliminating the need for communication links between areas during operation.</description></item><item><title>A Unified Strategy for Frequency Regulating and MPPT for Photovoltaic Sources Based on a Novel Three-Parameter Characteristic Curve</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10907967</link><description>The large-scale integration of Photovoltaic (PV) sources may reduce system inertia and power quality, resulting in increased frequency fluctuations and diminished system stability due to lack of the primary frequency regulation (FR) capability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a unified strategy for frequency regulating and Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) for PV sources to provide ancillary services to the power grid. The strategy employs a specifically designed active power control (APC) method to enable rapid and flexible power adjustments of PV sources, with which further FR function may be achieved. The presented APC algorithm adopts an iterative technique with a novel three-parameter PV characteristic curve, making it possible to reconstruct the real-time PV generation model, clarify the relationship between the system frequency, output power, and operating voltage. Its high control accuracy, fast convergence rate, and strong explainability offer significant practical value. Additionally, this adaptive control strategy features autonomous switch between the FR and MPPT modes adapting to real-time irradiation changes, without the need for additional irradiation or temperature sensors. The integration enhances both solar utilization efficiency and the FR capability, while eliminating the controller transitions during operating mode switches. Hardware-in-the-loop tests validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Online Monitoring of Battery Degradation for Enhanced Power Smoothing of PV Power Plants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10908680</link><description>In pursuit of a carbon-neutral future, the integration of photovoltaic (PV) power plants into the electrical power grid is expanding. Although beneficial, this expansion presents challenges due to weather-induced variability, which destabilizes the grid and causes voltage and frequency deviations. A viable solution is the use of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) alongside PV power plants. However, conventional controllers, which lead to uniform and frequent charging cycles, accelerate degradation and reduce efficiency in BESS. To address this, this paper proposes segmenting the BESS units into distinct charging and discharging groups, effectively minimizing battery cycling and enhancing their lifespan. The controller dynamically assigns batteries to each group based on power fluctuation forecasts using a power-sharing model. This model manages battery activation, enables inter-group support, and balances degradation by monitoring BESS charge levels and assessing battery health through an online system. This controller, coupled with a degradation balancing layer, strategically prioritizes units based on their cycling age. The proposed technique was rigorously tested and experimentally validated, demonstrating that it significantly reduces battery degradation to a maximum of 0.099%, in stark contrast to the up to 4.41% observed with conventional controllers.</description></item><item><title>State Transfer Induced Transient Synchronization Instability of GFM-VSC: Analysis and Improvement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909647</link><description>The operation mode of grid-forming voltage source converters (GFM-VSCs) may switch between voltage source mode (VSM) and current source mode (CSM) under some situations such as grid faults, owing to the current limitation control. During the mode-switching process, there is state transfer from the final state of the last mode to the initial state of the next mode, which impacts the transient synchronization stability (TSS) of GFM-VSCs. This paper primarily focuses on analyzing and improving the TSS of GFM-VSCs by considering the effect of state transfer. A novel transient instability mechanism is revealed through the existence analysis of equilibrium points. It clarifies that the state transfer may cause the operating trajectory during faults to bypass the stable equilibrium point in CSM before diverging to the next cycle, thereby resulting in transient synchronization instability. Besides, to further analyze the TSS of mode-switched VSCs considering the dynamics during faults, multiple Lyapunov functions are adopted to derive the TSS criteria and boundaries. It has been identified that lowering the minimum critical current and adjusting the saturated current phase in accordance with virtual power angle (VPA) dynamics can enhance the TSS. Therefore, a VPA feedback-based current limiting strategy is proposed to safeguard GFM-VSCs against overcurrent and ensure the TSS. The validity of the new transient instability mechanism and the efficacy of the proposed strategy are confirmed through simulations of a GFM-VSC connected to an IEEE 39-bus power grid and hardware-in-the-loop experiments.</description></item><item><title>Assessing Dynamic Reserves vs. Stochastic Optimization for Effective Integration of Operating Probabilistic Forecasts</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909649</link><description>Probabilistic forecasting is becoming pivotal in utilities' decision-making processes, offering an accurate portrayal of plausible forecast deviations as opposed to deterministic forecasting which only focuses on the expected forecasted variables. Two methods, dynamic reserve and stochastic optimization, have been used to integrate probabilistic forecasts into power system operational planning. Dynamic reserve predicts system reserve requirements based on observed (from historical observations) or expected (from probabilistic forecasts) uncertainty spreads. This approach has a low computational burden, but it is commitment and dispatch agnostic. Stochastic optimization, on the other hand, considers multiple scenarios simultaneously (from probabilistic forecasts), allocating recourse across the commitment and dispatch variables, but demanding high computational resources and time. The selection between these methods depends on utility requirements and specific situations. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of both methods using a calibrated real-size system representing the Southern Company for medium and high solar penetration levels. Additionally, it proposes a hybrid dynamic reserve and stochastic optimization approach with a risk evaluation pre-scheduling procedure to enhance decision-making.</description></item><item><title>Minimax Regret Robust Co-Planning of Transmission and Energy Storage Systems With Mixed Integer Recourse</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909558</link><description>The growing penetration of renewable energy sources, with intermittent and uncertain nature, brings new challenges to the secure and efficient operation of power systems. Expanding transmission networks and utilizing energy storage (ES) have been introduced as effective solutions to address these challenges. This paper presents a minimax regret robust co-planning model with mixed integer recourse for transmission and ES systems, designed from the perspective of a central planner. The model considers a polyhedral uncertainty set for future peak load growth, while uncertainties in wind farm expansion are addressed through internal scenario analysis. This approach will guarantee the robustness of investment decisions and provide the central planner with a clear picture of the maximum regret among all possible scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed minimax regret framework facilitates strategic planning for ES installation after the resolution of long-term uncertainties. In this paper, we reformulate the model into a standard min-max-min problem, in which the maximization level is only over uncertainties. Subsequently, a five-level solution strategy based on a modified nested column and constraint generation decomposition technique is represented to deal with the intractability and complexity of the problem caused by binary variables of transmission lines and ES blocks. The model is finally evaluated through comprehensive simulation studies to verify its tractability, practicality, and effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>A Dynamic Model-Based Minute-Level Optimal Operation Strategy for Alkaline Electrolyzers in Wind-Hydrogen Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10912757</link><description>Maintaining the export power of wind-hydrogen systems within a stable range is critical for power system security. However, this is challenged by the mismatch between large time-scale of alkaline electrolyzer (AWE) scheduling strategies and the short-term fluctuations of wind power. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel minute-level optimization strategy for AWE operation. Developing effective small time-scale strategies requires a detailed consideration of AWE dynamics. To this end, we first introduce its steady-state electrochemical characteristics and third-order dynamic models for both temperature and Hydrogen-to-Oxygen (HTO) ratio. Based on these refined models, we develop an AWE optimization framework that enables electrolysis power to track minute-level wind power fluctuations by dynamically adjusting fine-grained variables, such as the lye flow rate, cooling flow rate, and pressure, at 1-minute intervals. To overcome the computational challenges posed by the detailed modeling, we propose an improved model predictive control (MPC) framework. This framework incorporates model simplifications to improve computational efficiency, along with an optimization-simulation iterative procedure to ensure operational feasibility. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed strategy extends the AWE load range by 13.8% and reduces wind power curtailment by 15.06%. Additionally, synergies among control variables enable the system to achieve a balance between operational efficiency, stability, and security, highlighting the potential of this approach to enhance the performance of wind-hydrogen integrated systems.</description></item><item><title>Promote Data Sharing in Integrated Power-Traffic Networks: A Coalition Game Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10910214</link><description>Accurately estimating spatial-temporal electric vehicles' (EVs) charging demands is crucial for the secure and economic operation of power systems. At present, the distribution system operator (DSO) relies on historical data collected at each charging station to estimate future EV charging demand. However, the station-level forecast disregards EVs' spatial correlations within traffic networks (TNs) and might suffer significant forecast error, forcing the DSO to make conservative scheduling at the expense of operation economics. To this end, this paper proposes to leverage cross-sector information (i.e., traffic demand data and network parameters in TNs) to enhance forecast accuracy and avoid over-conservative operations. To facilitate the data sharing among the DSO and TN data holders (i.e., traffic authority and navigation App. companies), we adopt the Coalition Game theory to uncover how these entities could cooperate to benefit each other, and to fairly allocate the extra profits (i.e., the operational cost reduction induced by the improved forecasts) among themselves. The conditional value-at-risk theory is adopted to model the risk-averse behavior of the DSO. In case studies, we reveal the non-negligible impact of TN condition variations on EV charging distributions. Moreover, numerical results show that sharing high-quality traffic data contributes to the reduction in DSO's operating cost by utmost 20.8% as compared to the current practice without data sharing.</description></item><item><title>An Optimization Framework for Component Sizing and Energy Management in Electric-Hydrogen Hybrid Energy Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10915713</link><description>This paper proposes an optimization framework to address the component sizing and energy management problems in an electric-hydrogen hybrid energy storage system connected to a wind turbine. The total cost of the hybrid system is minimized using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. In particular, four decision variables are optimized: the electrolyzer (EL) size, the supercapacitor (SC) size, and two parameters in the energy management strategy (EMS). To determine the power split factor for the wind power, the EMS introduces an artificial potential field (APF) and defines a virtual force based on the SC state of charge (SOC). Two APF parameters are optimized to tune the power allocation between the EL and the SC: the shaping parameter of the virtual force and the basis parameter of the power split factor. Since the cutoff frequency of the low pass filter (LPF) in the EMS is adaptively updated based on the optimized APF parameters, the proposed framework is referred to as the &#8220;OP-APF&#8221; framework. The effectiveness of the OP-APF framework is validated by performing MATLAB and real-time simulations. Compared to three baseline frameworks, OP-APF is more effective in reducing the system total cost, controlling the SC SOC, and alleviating the EL degradation.</description></item><item><title>Photovoltaic Power Prediction Considering Multifactorial Dynamic Effects: A Dynamic Locally Featured Embedding-Based Broad Learning System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916943</link><description>Accurate photovoltaic power (PVP) prediction is a prerequisite for the efficient and stable operation of new power systems. While existing research has extensively explored the relationship between global factors such as temperature, irradiance, and photovoltaic power, the local dynamic impacts of these factors are often overlooked, which may reduce the accuracy of predictions. To address this issue, this paper considers the dynamic interrelationships among multiple factors and proposes a dynamic locally featured embedding-based broad learning system (DLFE-BLS) algorithm for PVP prediction. Firstly, a novel dynamic phase space reconstruction method (DPSR) is proposed to characterize the dynamic properties of multivariate data. Furthermore, a dynamic local featured embedding (DLFE) algorithm is introduced to extract local dynamic features from multivariate data. Finally, by integrating the dynamic reconstruction and dynamic feature extraction processes into the broad learning system (BLS) framework, we propose the DLFE-BLS algorithm to improve the accuracy of PVP prediction. Case studies have shown that DLFE-BLS outperforms other models in terms of prediction accuracy. Additionally, it has the highest accuracy when applied to transfer prediction.</description></item><item><title>Optimal VSG BESS Sizing for Improving Grid-Following Converter Stability Under Various Dispatch Scenarios and Grid Strengths</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10924310</link><description>As renewable energy integration increases, ensuring stability of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) in weak grids is crucial, as grid-following (GFL) converters often become unstable under such conditions. Integrating virtual synchronous generator (VSG) batteries has shown potential to improve GFL stability, but determining the optimal size of the VSG required for stability remains an open question. Existing research typically relies on small-signal or impedance models for stability analysis, which are only valid at a single operating point and do not consider the full range of operating conditions, including various dispatch scenarios and grid strengths. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel methodology to visualize the system's stable operating region, offering insights into stability boundaries across various real power and grid impedance variations. Additionally, it introduces an optimal VSG battery sizing strategy that accounts for these variations, ensuring stability while minimizing VSG capacity. The strategy's effectiveness is validated through comprehensive PSCAD simulations, demonstrating its reliability across a wide range of real power and grid impedance operating points.</description></item><item><title>Fast Centralized Model Predictive Control for Wave Energy Converter Arrays Based on Rollout</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10923686</link><description>Centralized control of wave energy converter (WEC) arrays for grid-scale generation can achieve higher energy production than decentralized (independent) control, due to its capability of fully exploiting mutual radiation effects. However, the state-of-the-art centralized model predictive control (CMPC) is significantly more computationally challenging than decentralized MPC (DMPC), since the number of control moves to be optimized grows in proportion to the number of WECs. In this paper, a fast CMPC controller is proposed, whose idea is to optimize only the first few control moves while rolling out future system trajectories using a fixed controller. A linear, two-degree-of-freedom (2-DoF) controller with a sea-state-dependent control coefficient tuning strategy is further proposed to serve as the rollout controller. It is shown that the proposed rollout-based CMPC (R-CMPC) can maintain almost the same energy production as conventional CMPC under a wide range of sea states, while significantly reducing the optimization dimension (in the studied case, by a factor of 6), enabling ultra-fast online computation (about 40 times faster than conventional CMPC).</description></item><item><title>Energy Management of Multi-Energy Communities: A Hierarchical MIQP-Constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10923740</link><description>This paper proposes a hybrid mixed-integer quadratic programming-constrained deep reinforcement learning (MIQP-CDRL) framework for energy management of multi-energy communities. The framework employs a hierarchical two-layer structure: the MIQP layer handles day-ahead scheduling, minimizing operational costs while ensuring system constraint satisfaction, while the CDRL agent makes real-time adjustments. The goal of this framework is to combine the strengths of CDRL in addressing sequential decision-making problems in stochastic systems with the advantages of a mathematical programming model to guide the agent's exploration during the training and reduce the dependency on opaque policies during real-time operation. The system dynamics are modeled as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), which is solved by a model-free CDRL agent built upon the constrained policy optimization (CPO) algorithm. Practical test results demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in improving the optimality and feasibility of the real-time solutions compared to existing stand-alone DRL approaches.</description></item><item><title>Complex Variable Design for Power Control of Grid-Forming Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854804</link><description>The analysis and design of the grid-forming (GFM) power loop and decoupling control can be challenging due to the coupled high-order system, where active and reactive power controls are typically designed separately using a dual-input-dual-output model.

Managing frequency, voltage, and power dynamics in microgrids under varying conditions, however, poses significant challenges. This paper proposes an adaptive, data-driven secondary control framework for real-time tuning of hierarchical controllers in both islanded and grid-connected modes. The approach employs a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning (VRFT) method with a novel low-memory formulation optimized for digital signal processor (DSP) implementation. Integrated with a performance detector, it enables automated controller retuning during open- and closed-loop operations, ensuring robust reference tracking and dynamic performance under disturbances. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations, incorporating significant communication delays, validate the framework&#8217;s effectiveness. The results highlight the proposed method&#8217;s practical applicability, offering a scalable solution for microgrid management in real-world conditions.</description></item><item><title>Uninterruptable Hierarchical Distributed Coordinated Control Scheme of Islanded AC/DC Microgrid Clusters Under Grid-Forming Converter Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10974648</link><description>Grid-forming converter faults in islanded hybrid AC/DC microgrid clusters could lead to voltage and frequency instability risk in the subgrid, thus threatening system operating safety. To solve this issue, this paper has proposed an uninterruptable hierarchical distributed coordinated control scheme of islanded hybrid AC/DC microgrid clusters. Firstly, when grid-forming converter faults occur in a certain AC microgrid (ACMG), the interlinking converter connected with the faulty subgrid switches its control mode into grid-forming, providing stable voltage and frequency support for the faulty ACMG. Then, a two-layer coordinated control scheme is presented, where the first layer is designed for the remaining interlinking converters, and the second layer is designed for converters in normal subgrids and grid-following converters in abnormal ACMG together with its interlinking converter. By the control mode switch of the IC and the two-layer coordinated control scheme, accurate power sharing can quickly fill the power deficit in the faulty subgrid, and the voltage and frequency of the microgrid clusters can remain stable. Verification results indicate that with the proposed scheme, the islanded AC/DC microgrid clusters can operate uninterruptedly under different kinds of grid-forming converter faults.</description></item><item><title>Robust Consensus-Based Secondary Control for Microgrids Considering Communication Delay and Noises: A Kalman Filter-Based Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10994544</link><description>To achieve the frequency and voltage regulation as well as active and reactive power sharing, the consensus-based secondary controls of microgrids rely on communication network to exchange signals between neighbor inverters, which may be affected by the communication delay and noises. Unlike the existing methods that focus solely on communication delay, this paper proposes a Kalman filter-based robust consensus control to address the communication delay and noises comprehensively. Based on the discrete differential equation of the signal transmitted via communication network, the multi-step prediction model of the delayed signal is firstly built by considering the prediction errors. The state space model is then constructed by taking the predicted signals at each step as the state variables while the delayed and noise-involved signal and its differential value are seen as the measurements. A Kalman filter is further designed to comprehensively handle the communication delay, noises and prediction errors to estimate the true signal generated from neighbor inverters. With the estimated signals of all neighbor inverters, the consensus control is performed to coordinate the grid-following and grid-forming inverters within the microgrid. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with simulations and experiments performed on the modified IEEE-33 bus-based microgrid.</description></item><item><title>A Unified Directional Protection Element for Converter-Based Islanded Hybrid Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11006132</link><description>This paper proposes a unified directional element (UDE) for protecting converter-dominated islanded hybrid microgrids (IHMGs) relying on phase current samples. For the AC sub-network, the fault diagnosis component (FDC) is constructed by averaging the first-order derivative (FOD) of the phase currents at each line end over one power cycle. On the DC side, the FDC is obtained directly by computing the FOD of the pole current. The current direction of each phase/pole can be identified based on the first peak sign of the FDC. Once a disturbance occurs, the UDE is activated utilizing a startup unit, and the first peak sign of the FDC of each phase/pole is shared between both terminals of the line to differentiate internal faults from other disturbances or external faults. A phase/pole is being faulted if both values of the FDC at both sides of the line have the same sign. The developed UDE is verified by simulating the modified IEEE 33-bus IHMG on PSCAD/EMTDC. Several scenarios are carried out including load switching as well as external and internal faults. Additionally, the effect of different factors is examined, encompassing measurement inaccuracies and high resistance faults.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Power Flow Estimation for MVDC Distribution Systems Based on Physics-Embedded FCN</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10945791</link><description>Maintaining high prediction accuracy with varying grid topologies poses a significant challenge to adopting neural network (NN)-based approaches for power flow (PF) estimation in medium-voltage direct current (MVDC) distribution systems. This paper proposes a physics-embedded fully convolutional network (PEFCN) to improve the accuracy. Physics-embedded techniques are incorporated in the proposed PEFCN through 1) architecture reconstruction, and 2) loss function reformulation. Architecture is reconstructed by input channel conversion calculation in a new physics operation layer. This process offers physical connections among the three input matrix channels (voltage, current, and line conductance). Three new physics loss terms are included in the loss function to restrict the outliers violating the limits of converter power ratings and terminal MVDC voltages. The two operations enable the FCN to achieve improved prediction accuracy and strong generalization capabilities. Five MVDC distribution systems, characterized by different dc voltage levels and topology configurations, serve to validate the superiority of the proposed PEFCN over other NNs in the PF estimation for scenarios involving both fixed and varying system structures. Moreover, a modified IEEE 69-bus distribution system is further used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed PEFCN for larger systems.</description></item><item><title>Non-Iterative Sensitivity-Based Switch Exchange Method for Distribution Network Reconfiguration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10960360</link><description>In this paper, a non-iterative sensitivity-based zsolve the distribution network reconfiguration (DNR) problem and ensure the security of the switch operation process, while maintaining the node voltage within the feasible range. The NSSE method involved the sensitivity-based network reconfiguration (SNR) stage and sensitivity-based power optimization (SPO) stage. In the SNR stage, the computational speed was improved by considering the dynamic voltage sensitivity with respect to the compensated power analysis, while the network power losses and number of switching times were minimized. The closed-loop and open-loop operation model was developed to solve the compensated power for simulating the switch operation process. Moreover, the maximum loop current was set as a constraint to avoid the equipment risk of switching operation. Each switch operation process can be formulated as integer quadratic programming (IQP) to obtain the optimal network topology and switch operation sequence with the non-iterative calculations. In the SPO stage, the active and reactive power outputs of distributed generations (DGs) were optimized to regulate the node voltage and reduce the active power curtailment. The effectiveness of the proposed NSSE method on the calculation speed and accuracy was validated in MATLAB.</description></item><item><title>Multiagent System-Based VPPs Cooperative Power Control for Frequency Regulation Considering Diverse Communication Issues</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948420</link><description>Virtual power plants (VPPs) possess significant potential to support power systems&#8217; frequency regulation through the aggregation of demand-side distributed energy resources. However, due to their heavy reliance on information technology, VPPs inevitably face diverse communication issues, such as cyber-attacks, privacy disclosure, and packet losses, which poses a serious challenge to ensure efficient power control for frequency regulation. To this end, this paper proposes a multiagent system-based VPPs cooperative power control strategy to achieve frequency regulation in a resilient, optimal, and scalable manner. First, a joint design scheme of VPPs cooperative power control and information interaction mechanism is presented to determine the optimal regulation power of VPPs for frequency regulation, where a consensus-based collaborative strategy is designed for cyber-attacks and a homomorphic encryption technology is introduced for privacy protection. Also, an event-triggered mechanism is adopted for communication burden. Second, a dynamic power control scheme for inverter is presented to enable the internal units of VPPs to track the power reference from the joint design scheme, in which an improved model predictive control method is suggested for packet losses to enhance control performance. Finally, simulation results reveal that, when confronting diverse communication issues, the proposed strategy exhibits significant effects in defending against cyber-attacks, ensuring privacy security, alleviating the communication burden, and achieving fast response, thus effectively facilitating VPPs frequency regulation.</description></item><item><title>Voltage-Source Control for Green-Hydrogen Hybrid Energy Storage System With Operational Constraints and Current Rate Limiter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947357</link><description>Green hydrogen produced from renewable energy generation (RES) is facilitating the energy transition. Due to the complicated operational constraints of green-hydrogen hybrid energy storage system (GH-HESS), the existing two-layer power-based control architecture is prevalent, but it heavily relies on the communication infrastructure and the prediction accuracy of RES&#8217;s power. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel voltage-source hierarchical control framework for the grid-connected GH-HESS to solve the above problems. Considering the electricity price, the hot-standby current and safety of the hydrogen production of the electrolyzer, the current allocation between hydrogen energy storage and power grid is achieved for the continuous stable operation of GH-HESS even in the situation with potential communication failure. When the current rate limiter is adopted for the fuel starvation phenomenon of fuel cell, the current feed-forward loop and current-based secondary control are designed to solve the trade-off problem between the current overshoot and convergence speed of the tradition voltage-source control, where the large current overshoot will cause irreversible damage to hydrogen energy storage. Battery energy storage rapidly responses the power fluctuation from RES, while the steady-state power vacancy is undertaken by hydrogen energy storage. Finally, a 800V DC microgrid based on NI-PXI real-time platform is built to validate its advantages.</description></item><item><title>Reliability and Comfort-Aware Operation Optimization for Hydrogen-Based Building Energy Systems in Off-Grid Mode</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10965864</link><description>Hydrogen-based energy systems have gained wide attention due to their significant potential for relieving energy crises and environmental problems. However, existing studies neglect occupant comfort control in hydrogen-based building energy systems (HBESs). In this paper, we investigate a reliability and comfort-aware operation optimization problem of an HBES in off-grid mode. Achieving the above aim encounters several challenges due to multi-source uncertainties, implicit indoor environmental dynamics, temporally and spatially coupled constraints, and nonlinear constraints. To address the above challenges, we propose a physics-embedded neural network (PENN)-assisted hierarchical model predictive control (MPC) algorithm. Specifically, the PENN architecture is adopted to capture the indoor dynamics accurately. Then, the PENN-assisted upper-level MPC implements occupant comfort control and optimizes the multi-energy demands. Next, the lower-level MPC optimizes the system operation cost and reliability with known multi-energy demands decided by the upper-level MPC. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms baselines in terms of operation cost, system reliability, and indoor occupant comfort.</description></item><item><title>Exploring the Feasible Regulation Region of Building HVAC Systems Within Hygro-Thermal Comfort</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11006322</link><description>Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems are widely recognized as promising demand response (DR) resources for enhancing grid flexibility. Despite extensive research on evaluating the regulation capacity of HVAC systems, the role of humidity in air dynamic description and occupant comfort assessment during DR has been overlooked. This paper addresses these gaps by exploring the feasible regulation region of HVAC systems while meeting occupant hygro-thermal comfort. Firstly, a comprehensive model of HVAC systems is developed to describe the hygro-thermal air dynamics and equipment characteristics. Subsequently, the hygro-thermal comfort area is defined to establish permissible temperature and humidity boundaries. Based on key constraints, the hygro-thermal air dynamics are categorized into 3 distinct types. Moreover, a novel criterion is proposed to identify these dynamics without requiring full knowledge of boundary conditions. On this basis, the maximum regulation capacities are quantitatively evaluated to explore the feasible regulation region throughout the day. Finally, numerical case studies are conducted to validate the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that humidity plays a crucial role in the operating power and the feasible regulation region of HVAC systems. Incorporating humidity improves hygro-thermal comfort, thereby encouraging more occupant participation in DR programs.</description></item><item><title>Automated Fast Frequency Response From Inverter-Based Motor Loads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002578</link><description>The increasing integration of inverter-based renewable generation presents challenges for the frequency stability of power systems, primarily due to reduced system inertia and governor response&#8212;collectively known as Fast Frequency Response (FFR). Obtaining FFR from inverter-based generation requires reserving operational headroom, resulting in a lost opportunity to generate more renewable energy. Recently, inverter-based loads have been proposed as potential sources of FFR; however, critical gaps remain in the control algorithms needed to transform these loads into grid-supportive loads (GSLs) capable of delivering FFR. To address this gap, this paper introduces a novel algorithm that enables automatic, communication-free, grid-supportive behavior in inverter-based motor loads. The algorithm&#8217;s efficacy is demonstrated through comprehensive simulations and hardware experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that GSLs equipped with the proposed controller can provide FFR by adjusting power consumption, reducing it by up to 32% for a 1.8% drop in grid frequency and increasing it by 10.65% for a 0.4% rise, within 1.5 seconds in response to frequency events. By retrofitting existing, or designing new inverter-based motor loads with this controller, end-use devices can automatically deliver aggregated FFR without communication infrastructure, enhancing frequency stability in grids with high levels of variable renewable energy.</description></item><item><title>Bayesian Active Learning-Based Soft Data Space Calibration for System-Wise Aggregate Flexibility Characterization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10945771</link><description>There have been growing interests in characterizing system-wide aggregate flexibility to support transmission-side ancillary services and promote large-scale integration of distributed energy resources (DERs). However, accurately characterizing the power flexibility region (PFR) at the substation interface is computationally challenging due to the heterogeneity of the DER devices and the need to satisfy network constraints, resulting in a nonlinear and unpredictable geometry. Therefore, this paper proposes a network-aware, near-optimal, and sample-efficient data-driven method. First, a bus-level PFR estimation model is proposed to aggregate local DER devices at each bus into an inner-box approximated region. Second, a feeder-level PFR estimation model is proposed to aggregate all bus-level PFRs into an outer-box approximated region. A Bayesian active learning-based soft calibration strategy is proposed to iteratively and interactively learn a decision boundary of the binary classifier as an improved feeder-level PFR while providing trustworthy measurement to system operators. Case studies on a small, illustrative IEEE system and modified IEEE 123 bus test feeder validate effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description></item><item><title>Aggregated DER_A Model Parameterization via Online Moving Horizon Estimation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10945798</link><description>This paper introduces a methodology for parameterizing the DER_A model using a novel smooth mathematical representation, simplifying the process and preserving accuracy in modeling inverter-based generator (IBG).

This approach adapts to systems with varying voltage and frequency support requirements by selectively applying each step. Simulation results on systems with both known and unknown parameters validate the methodology&#8217;s effectiveness. The online moving horizon estimation technique accurately captures the dynamics of the overall system and ensures that the parameterized DER_A model closely mirrors the real system&#8217;s voltage, current, and power dynamics.

However, the delivery of the power they are awarded can result in over-voltage or congestion issues within the distribution network (DN). The opportunity to lease energy storage from the utility that manages the DN provides the aggregator with a means to mitigate these issues, while also benefiting the utility in terms of additional lease revenue. Nevertheless, this leasing opportunity considerably complicates the aggregator&#8217;s offer-making process, as it requires the consideration of market uncertainties, uncertain power injection at DN buses, and the strategic interactions between the aggregator and the utility. This paper presents a robust Stackelberg game model that effectively captures the interactions between the aggregator and the utility, ensuring DN security across all potential uncertainty scenarios. Furthermore, in light of the privacy concerns of both the aggregator and the utility, two distributed solution methods are proposed. The first method follows a traditional predict-then-optimize framework and has been validated to achieve the game equilibrium. The second method employs an end-to-end framework, which has been empirically shown to yield superior economic results. Case studies conducted on 69 and 533-bus DNs illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.</description></item><item><title>New Insights on the Stability of Sampled-Data-Based LFC for Power Systems: A Delay-Interval-Dependent LKF Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981893</link><description>This paper analyzes the stability problem of load frequency control (LFC) for power systems under uncertain transmission delays. First, an argumented LFC system model accounting for uncertainties in transmission delays is proposed. Then, a novel delay-interval-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) that takes into account both the upper and lower bounds of the transmission delay is proposed. Several less conservative stability criteria are derived using the proposed LKF. Based on the stability criterion obtained, the sampling interval and the upper and lower bounds of the transmission delay are taken as the conditions to guide the controller design. Finally, case studies are conducted based on a one-area power system and a three-area power system, both integrated with wind and solar power generation. The simulation comparison results demonstrate that the proposed LFC scheme exhibits strong robustness against uncertain transmission delays, load fluctuations, and the intermittent generation of wind and solar power.</description></item><item><title>Advancing Privacy-Preserving Wind Generation Forecasts With Selective Spatial-Temporal Dependencies Extraction, Encryption and Sharing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988895</link><description>The adoption of renewable energy sources (RES) is essential for accelerating the low-carbon transition. Accurate forecasting of renewable energy generation is vital for its effective integration into power systems, allowing for mitigation on variability and intermittency of RES and facilitating economic and secure grid operation. In this context, collaborative wind generation forecasting task faces multiple challenges, including secure information sharing, spatial-temporal dependencies characterization and utilization, as well as uncertainty quantification via probabilistic forecasting. To this end, this paper proposes a novel collaborative forecasting framework which features 4 core functionalities: a temporal convolutional network-autoencoder based secure data encryption and temporal dependencies extraction module; a self-attention based secure data sharing and selective spatial-temporal dependencies extraction module; a privacy-preserving collaborative point/probabilistic forecasting module based on improved pinball loss function; and an adaptive fine-tuning procedure to further leverage feature extraction performance and prediction accuracy through joint training. Case studies using real-world data from 10 wind farms located across Jiangsu province, China, validated superior performance of the proposed method while highlighting the value of the developed functionalities. The proposed collaborative forecasting method achieves 18.21%, 15.23%, 8.69% improvement in RMSE compared to the worst-performing baseline method, in benchmarking against individual forecasting, pre-training only and statistical pre-screening based methods. Furthermore, a maximum 26.62% improvement in Coverage Width-based Criterion is attained with respect to parametric and non-parametric baseline methods.</description></item><item><title>Robust Microgrid Dispatch With Real-Time Energy Sharing and Endogenous Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10999049</link><description>With the rising adoption of distributed energy resources (DERs), microgrid dispatch is facing new challenges: DER owners are independent stakeholders seeking to maximize their individual profits rather than being controlled centrally; and the dispatch of renewable generators may affect the microgrid&#8217;s exposure to uncertainty. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a two-stage robust microgrid dispatch model with real-time energy sharing and endogenous uncertainty. In the day-ahead stage, the connection/disconnection of renewable generators is optimized, which influences the size and dimension of the uncertainty set. As a result, the uncertainty set is endogenously given. In addition, non-anticipative operational bounds for energy storage (ES) are derived to enable the online operation of ES in real-time. In the real-time stage, DER owners (consumers and prosumers) share energy with each other via a proposed energy sharing mechanism, which forms a generalized Nash game. To solve the robust microgrid dispatch model, we develop an equivalent optimization model to compute the real-time energy sharing equilibrium. Based on this, a projection-based column-and-constraint generation (C&amp;amp;CG) method is proposed to handle the endogenous uncertainty. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed model and method.</description></item><item><title>Systematic Design of Active Power Control Parameters for Multi-VSG Systems Based on Active Power Separation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11003181</link><description>According to emerging guidelines, system operators are increasingly emphasizing three critical performance aspects from grid-forming (GFM) plants: active power-frequency (P-f) droop, low-frequency oscillation (LFO) damping, and active power setpoint tracking (APST) bandwidth. In GFM plants implemented by multiple virtual synchronous generators (VSGs), these performance aspects are dominated by VSGs&#8217; active power control (APC) parameters, i.e., the inertia constant H and damping coefficient D. However, an APC parameter design with these performance aspects comprehensively considered remains unexplored, potentially leading to inappropriate P-f droop, underdamped LFOs, or excessive APST bandwidth. To address this issue, first, by separating the multi-VSG system&#8217;s active power responses into a common part and a differential part, the analytical expressions for its LFO damping ratio and APST bandwidth are derived. Second, by aligning these performance aspects with the requirements outlined in representative GFM plant guidelines, a systematic APC parameter design method is proposed. This method explicitly formulates the feasible region for the APC parameters that ensures appropriate P-f droop, LFO damping, and APST bandwidth. Finally, real-time simulations and experiments are conducted in various multi-VSG systems to validate the theoretical analysis and the proposed APC parameter design method.</description></item><item><title>A Bi-Level Nash Bargaining Model for Electricity Trading Among Microgrids With Endogenous Nodal Prices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11006478</link><description>Determining a fair trading price is challenging, and this complexity is further heightened in power systems as the price must consider network constraints, fluctuating and endogenous electricity prices, and generation cost. This paper proposes a novel Nash-in-Stackelberg model designed to coordinate a collection of independently operated microgrids. Within this framework, the microgrids engage in a bargaining game to collectively decide a fair trading price as well as other operational decisions. We use the Nash bargaining solution (NBS) to model this interaction. Microgrids&#8217; trading decisions impact the locational marginal prices of the main power grid. Hence, a Stackelberg game is used to determine these prices. The Stackelberg model considers microgrids as leaders (upper-level problem) and the independent system operator as follower (lower-level problem). The NBS guarantees a fair allocation of the generated profit based on individual characteristics of the microgrids. In specific, in scenarios of higher generation, we achieve a cost reduction of  ${\$}$ 884 and  ${\$}$ 904 per microgrid compared with a grand coalition where only one microgrid receives the total cost reduction ( ${\$}$ 1788). Also we noticed that increasing the amount of solar-generated electricity reduces the nodal price in 1.53% and consequently the trading price in 1.27%.</description></item><item><title>Optimal PMU Placement via Quantum Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10980373</link><description>Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) are essential for real-time monitoring and improving grid observability. Determining the optimal PMU installation is critical, especially as the penetration of renewable energy resources increases, as the Optimal PMU Placement (OPMUP) can guarantee full system observability and reduce the installation cost. However, identifying the optimal PMU installation is a prototypical combinatorial optimization problem, requiring substantial classical computational resources. Furthermore, the significant expansion of the grid in terms of renewable energy integration makes the determination of optimal PMU placement increasingly computationally intensive. In this work, a hybrid quantum-classical approach, Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), is developed to effectively solve the optimal PMU installation problem under normal and channel limitation scenarios. A tailored objective function is proposed for quantum optimization, which takes into account both PMU placement cost and system observability constraints. To analyze the observability of QAOA-generated solution distributions, recursion-based Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search algorithms are proposed for normal and channel-limited scenarios. These methods determine solution feasibility on classical computers with  $\mathcal {O}(N+M)$  complexity, outperforming the  $\mathcal {O}(N^{2})$  complexity of inequality-based approaches, where N and M denote the number of buses and branches, respectively. In addition, the proposed quantum optimization framework can significantly reduce the computational complexity from the polynomial or exponential levels required by previous classical methods, i.e.,  $\mathcal {O}(RN)$  on quantum circuits and  $\mathcal {O}(R(M+N))$  on classical resources, where R is the repetition times of quantum circuits executions. The proposed method is tested on IEEE 9-, 14-, 24-, and 30-bus systems, where better installation results are achieved compared to the state-of-the-art results, providing a new baseline for further quantum studies in OPMUP. Furthermore, a landscape optimization strategy is introduced to improve QAOA solution quality. This approach also reduces the time cost of quantum computing resources, making it more efficient for current quantum applications. Additionally, parameter studies are conducted to identify key factors influencing QAOA performance. This work is expected to lay the foundations for addressing challenging power system problems through quantum technology in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Operation and Control Schemes of Retired Batteries in DC Microgrid for Secondary Usage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964325</link><description>The utilization of repurposed second-life batteries from electric vehicles in DC microgrids presents a sustainable and cost-effective solution. However, efficiently integrating these batteries within DC microgrids poses two main challenges: (1) poor consistency among retired battery packs; (2) fluctuations in the DC bus voltage. Traditional approaches primarily focus on achieving the state of charge (SOC) balancing within retired battery packs, often neglecting the suppression of voltage fluctuations, thereby compromising system stability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a virtual DC machine (VDCM)-based control strategy that enhances both the power quality of the DC microgrid and the consistency of retired battery packs. On the one hand, reconfigurable topology and SOC balancing strategies are developed to manage the equalization current, achieving SOC balancing within the retired battery packs. On the other hand, a VDCM strategy is designed to leverage the capacity characteristics of retired batteries to increase the inertia of the DC microgrid. Compared to conventional methods, experimental results show that the proposed strategy not only maintains SOC balancing during both the charging and discharging phases but also significantly reduces overshoot and settle times of dc voltage to 64.2% and 55.6%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>V2Sim: An Open-Source Microscopic V2G Simulation Platform in Urban Power and Transportation Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10970754</link><description>This paper proposes V2Sim, an open source Python-based simulation platform designed for advanced vehicle-to-grid (V2G) analysis in coupled urban power and transportation networks. By integrating a microscopic urban transportation network (MUTN) with a power distribution network (PDN), V2Sim enables precise modeling of electric vehicle charging loads (EVCL) and dynamic V2G operations. The platform uniquely combines SUMO for MUTN simulations and an optimized DistFlow model for PDN analysis, with dedicated models for fast charging stations (FCS) and slow charging stations (SCS), capturing detailed charging dynamics often overlooked in existing simulation tools. V2Sim supports a range of customizable V2G strategies, advanced fault-sensing in charging stations, and parallel simulation through multi-processing to accelerate large-scale case studies. Case studies using a real-world MUTN from Nanjing, China, demonstrate V2Sim&#8217;s capability to analyze the spatial-temporal distribution of EVCL and evaluate V2G impacts, such as fault dissemination and pricing variations, in unprecedented detail. Unlike traditional equilibrium models, V2Sim captures single-vehicle behavior and charging interactions at the microscopic level, offering unparalleled accuracy in assessing the operational and planning needs of V2G-compatible systems. This platform serves as a comprehensive tool for researchers and urban planners aiming to optimize integrated power and transportation networks.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Planning for Wireless Charging Lanes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10970087</link><description>The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is significantly hindered by the long charging time and range anxiety resulting from slow charging speed and limited battery capacity. Meanwhile, wireless charging lanes (WCLs) and solar-powered EVs (SEVs) offer a promising solution by providing wireless and solar charging power while driving. Under this circumstance, addressing the optimal planning of WCLs while considering SEV operations is crucial for facilitating the widespread adoption of EVs. Considering the uncertain solar power harvesting of SEVs, we propose a data-driven two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model for this integrated planning and operation problem. In the first stage, we optimize the deployment of WCLs with budget constraints, and the second stage determines the optimal operation schedules of SEVs under uncertain solar charging power characterized by a moment-based ambiguity set. To address the computational challenges (due to the discrete variables in both stages and the infinite-dimensional optimization in the second stage), we develop two approximation models and an integrated distributed method. Finally, extensive numerical experiments with synthetic and real transportation networks are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our proposed models and algorithms. Specifically, the proposed DRO model achieves a 1.17% lower total cost in out-of-sample tests than the sample average approximation method, and with higher wireless charging power rates and increased battery capacities, we can build fewer WCLs.</description></item><item><title>A Real-Time Robust Method for Post-Disaster Load Restoration of Coordinated Power-Transportation System With Vehicle-to-Grid Response</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10994444</link><description>With the proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs), vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capability emerges as a potential resource for load restoration after a large disruption. This paper presents a real-time post-disaster load restoration method for the coordinated power distribution networks (PDN) and urban traffic networks (UTN) with V2G response. The multi-period restoration problem is modeled as a dynamic programming-based multi-stage robust optimization model, addressing uncertainties of renewable generation and traffic demands. It incorporates a dynamic traffic assignment scheme to characterize vehicle travels and V2G services within short time slots. Then, an improved robust dual dynamic programming algorithm is proposed to solve the multi-stage robust optimization problem. For online application, the solved value functions from each stage serve as per-period policies, leveraging knowledge of future uncertainties to quickly guide real-time load restoration through distributed resource dispatch, network reconfiguration, and V2G assignments. Numerical experiments with a 33-bus PDN and 20-road UTN, plus a real-world 91-bus PDN with 35-road UTN, validate the effectiveness of proposed restoration method.</description></item><item><title>Best Response Learning Assisted Asynchronous ADMM for Real-Time Energy Sharing Under Communication Delay</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981894</link><description>Energy sharing can activate prosumer flexibility to support power system operations. However, in practice, communication delays are inevitable and seriously threaten the real-time energy sharing equilibrium. While many asynchronous methods aim to address this, they ignore the learnability of prosumer&#8217;s response and often struggle to balance convergence speed and stability. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel asynchronous algorithm based on best response (BR) learning. First, we demonstrate that the prosumer&#8217;s best response in ADMM-based energy sharing can be represented as the piecewise linear function. Besides, we propose a batch-fitting method to learn the BR function with high accuracy and low computational cost. Building on this, we develop an asynchronous ADMM algorithm with a practical error criterion to ensure strict convergence of energy sharing under severe delays. Numerical studies indicate that the proposed algorithm can achieve faster convergence with fewer iterations and greater reliability across various energy sharing scales and asynchronous rates than existing asynchronous algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Data Aggregation Reconfiguration Scheme to Mitigate Stealthy False Data Injection Attacks in Energy Management Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947360</link><description>Stealthy false data injection attacks (SFDIAs) pose serious threats to the stability and operation of power systems, with the potential to initiate cascading failures. These attacks depend on extensive access to system measurements, and the likelihood of gaining such access is closely linked to the structure of the system&#8217;s cyber-layer. However, the role of the cyber-layer in assessing SFDIA vulnerabilities has been largely overlooked in the literature, leading to oversimplified risk evaluations and suboptimal mitigation strategies. To address this gap, this paper first proposes a new cyber-physical risk metric (CPRM) to assess the system&#8217;s vulnerability to SFDIAs. The CPRM combines the physical impact of losing a transmission line-such as load shedding or generation loss-with the probability of such a loss resulting from an SFDIA. The likelihood of losing a transmission line is estimated by identifying all critical phasor measurement unit (PMU) sets, defined as sets whose measurements can be manipulated to stealthily overload the line. These critical PMU sets are determined using an algorithm that solves multiple bi-level optimization problems. Next, Bayesian attack graphs (BAGs) are developed for each substation and communication link to model potential access pathways and calculate the probability of compromising the identified critical PMU sets. Building on this analysis, the paper introduces a novel data aggregation reconfiguration (DAR) scheme that dynamically modifies the cyber-layer structure using software-defined networking (SDN) to minimize the risk of SFDIAs. Simulation results from the IEEE 39-bus test system demonstrate that the proposed DAR scheme significantly enhances the system&#8217;s resilience against SFDIAs.</description></item><item><title>Privacy Preservation for Cloud-Edge-Collaborative Energy Management System Using Post-Quantum Homomorphic Encryption</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10980370</link><description>Cloud-based energy management systems (EMS) in smart grids face privacy challenges, as existing methods based on traditional homomorphic encryption support limited operations and are vulnerable to quantum attacks. We propose a privacy preservation method for smart grid energy management system, leveraging edge-assisted computing and ring learning with errors (RLWE) homomorphic encryption. Our approach enables both addition and multiplication operations on encrypted smart grid data while defending against quantum threats. We demonstrate the method&#8217;s security under the RLWE hardness assumption and validate its effectiveness through an experimental platform simulating smart grid environments. This work addresses computational limitations in current privacy-preserving techniques, enhancing data security for evolving smart grid technologies.</description></item><item><title>Node-Decomposition Privacy Preserving for Finite-Time Secondary Control of DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10980358</link><description>In the distributed secondary control of DC microgrids, achieving both rapid convergence and robust information security is critical for enhancing control performance and maintaining power quality. However, current privacy-preserving approaches often compromise either control performance or privacy preservation performance. To address this challenge, this paper presents a node-decomposition privacy-preserving (NDPP) method for fully distributed, finite-time secondary control in DC microgrids. By splitting each node in the communication graph into multiple sub-nodes, the method enhances both convergence speed and privacy preservation without sacrificing control accuracy. Sub-nodes communicate within groups, and the topology of the generated graph is concealed from malicious nodes and eavesdroppers. Theoretical analysis is provided to prove finite-time voltage regulation and current sharing with privacy preservation against malicious nodes and external eavesdroppers. Simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the method in maintaining control performance and power quality.</description></item><item><title>Early-Stage Anomaly Detection in IT-OT Power Grid Communication Networks Using Wavelet Transform and Hybrid Deep Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988657</link><description>In cyber-physical power systems, the imperative convergence of information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) engenders enhanced operational efficiency, yet increases susceptibility to cyberattacks. This scenario accentuates the necessity for deploying effective anomaly detection (AD) mechanisms to protect these critical infrastructures against the devastating impacts of cyberattacks. Traditional AD algorithms often focus on identifying anomalies through analyzing spatial and temporal patterns derived from the physical system measurements, an approach that typically proves effective only after a cyberattack has been successfully executed at the later stages of the cyberkill chain. This reactive approach fails to respond to evolving cyber threats. To tackle this issue, this article introduces an innovative framework for early-stage AD in integrated IT-OT power grid communication networks. Our approach models the IT-OT network as a traffic dispersion graph and applies wavelet transform to decompose the real-time traffic throughput of each information node into its constituent sub-bands to extract time-frequency features. These features are then weighted and prioritized using a graph attention mechanism and fed into a bidirectional long short-term memory for temporal analysis, ultimately classifying the nodes as normal or abnormal. Our experiments confirm the methodology&#8217;s precise detection and localization of active cyberattack sites, outperforming existing state-of-the-art AD models.</description></item><item><title>Observer-Based Finite-Time Fuzzy Load Frequency Control for Multiarea Nonlinear Power Systems Under Input Delays and Cyber Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10993468</link><description>This paper presents an observer-based finite-time fuzzy load frequency control (LFC) strategy for multiarea nonlinear power systems with uncertain parameters, considering the impact of cyber attacks and input delays. To tackle the nonlinearities and uncertainties, an LFC model incorporating multiple input delays is developed within the interval type-2 (IT2) Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy framework. In response to unmeasurable states and unknown false data injection attacks (FDIAs), state and attack observers are designed to estimate these unknowns, thereby enabling effective compensation for FDIAs during the controller design. Furthermore, an observer-based reduction method is employed to transform the multiple input-delay system into a delay-free one, which reduces conservatism. Sufficient conditions are derived such that the closed-loop system is finite-time stable with  $H_{\infty }$  performance. Finally, simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A New Method for Stealthy False Data Injection Attack Detection Using Advanced Feasibility Areas Considering Spatial Distribution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11004030</link><description>The Feasibility Area (FA) in power system applications defines the region within which Power System State Variables (PSSVs) typically exist under normal operating conditions. Accurate characterization of the FA helps enhancing optimal power flow, detecting anomalies, and identifying stealthy False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs). Traditional FA-based approaches assess the location of PSSVs based on discrete time instances, using a binary flag to indicate whether the PSSVs lie inside or outside the FA. This paper introduces an advanced FA-based stealthy FDIAs detection method that improves upon this by incorporating the spatial distribution of PSSVs relative to the estimated FA. Unlike conventional methods, the advanced FA incorporates spatial distribution to evaluate the proximity of the current PSSV to the expected FA in the complex plane. A sigmoid-expansion flag is employed to represent the probability of the current PSSVs belonging to the expected FA, replacing the conventional binary flag. This sigmoid-expansion flag is then used as an input to a Deep Neural Network (DNN), where both the sigmoid-expansion flag and DNN model parameters are fine-tuned during training to ensure optimal compatibility, thereby improving detection accuracy. The proposed method significantly improves the detection of stealthy FDIAs, offering superior performance over traditional FA. Additionally, it enables the extraction of key attack characteristics, such as type, nature, and magnitude, further strengthening the system&#8217;s defense capabilities.</description></item><item><title>Carbon-Aware Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading in an Unbalanced Distribution Network via a Nash Equilibrium Discovery Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10966432</link><description>Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading offers an innovative platform for prosumers to engage in bilateral electricity and carbon trades, enabling promoting the integration of distributed energy resources and supporting low-carbon operations in distribution networks. However, existing studies often rely on single-phase approximations, leading to inaccuracies in emission accounting and potential economic inefficiencies loss. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a carbon-aware P2P energy trading mechanism for unbalanced distribution networks. A novel joint electricity and carbon trading market framework is developed, integrating carbon permits trading with a continuous double auction mechanism. The trading process is formulated as a cooperative Markov game to capture the stochastic nature of market dynamics and to enable intelligent bidding decisions. A Nash equilibrium (NE) discovery multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework is employed, utilizing a trust region policy optimization-based algorithm to enhance trading reliability and policy interpretability. Simulations on a modified IEEE-123 unbalanced distribution network demonstrate the proposed effectiveness in reducing operational costs and carbon emissions, providing rigorous NE validation and showcasing its practical applicability in complex energy markets.</description></item><item><title>Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring via Binary Integer Search and Transient Load Feature Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10976991</link><description>Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) aims to analyze energy consumption and monitor loads without intrusive measurements. However, existing household NILM models often depend heavily on specific datasets or electricity usage scenarios, which limits their performance consistency across different households. To enhance adaptability across diverse households and regions, this paper proposes an optimization-based NILM solution consisting of two key steps: using binary integer search to determine a feasible solution space, and incorporating transient load features in the final solution selection. The proposed model only requires a few electrical parameters for each appliance, eliminating the need for device-level load training data. Tests on real-world datasets across multiple households demonstrate the model&#8217;s effectiveness in load disaggregation and its computational efficiency, making it suitable for practical applications. Furthermore, the model&#8217;s physical interpretability lays a strong foundation for further research and development.</description></item><item><title>RL2: Reinforce Large Language Model to Assist Safe Reinforcement Learning for Energy Management of Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11016112</link><description>As large-scale distributed energy resources are integrated into the active distribution networks (ADNs), effective energy management in ADNs becomes increasingly prominent compared to traditional distribution networks. Although advanced reinforcement learning (RL) methods, which alleviate the burden of complicated modelling and optimization, have greatly improved the efficiency of energy management in ADNs, safety becomes a critical concern for RL applications in real-world problems. Since the design and adjustment of penalty functions, which correspond to operational safety constraints, require extensive domain knowledge in RL and power system operation, the emerging ADN operators call for a more flexible and customized approach to address the penalty functions so that the operational safety and efficiency can be further enhanced. Empowered with strong comprehension, reasoning, and in-context learning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) provide a promising way to assist safe RL for energy management in ADNs. In this paper, we introduce the LLM to comprehend operational safety requirements in ADNs and generate corresponding penalty functions. In addition, we propose an RL2 mechanism to refine the generated functions iteratively and adaptively through multi-round dialogues, in which the LLM agent adjusts the functions&#8217; pattern and parameters based on training and test performance of the downstream RL agent. The proposed method significantly reduces the intervention of the ADN operators. Comprehensive test results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Distribution Network Expansion-Friendly Adaptive Deep Reinforcement Learning for Inverter-Based Volt-Var Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10975829</link><description>In recent years, in response to the challenges posed by the volatility and uncertainty of increasing renewable energy sources (RESs), numerous studies have emerged on inverter-based Volt-Var control (VVC) using data-driven deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods. However, most of these methods assume fixed distribution network (DN) scales, which may not be applicable under potential DN expansion involving newly connected nodes and controllable devices. To address this issue, this letter proposes a novel DRL framework for inverter-based VVC capable of adapting to evolving DN environments. Specifically, state embedding for expanding state space (SE-ESS) and action branching for expanding action space (AB-EAS) are designed to facilitate model fine-tuning for the expansion of DN scales. Case studies on a modified IEEE 33-bus system validate the proposed method&#8217;s strong adaptability to DN expansion.</description></item><item><title>Aggregated Modeling of Massive Heterogeneous Building HVAC Loads for Demand Response: A Fluid Dynamics Perspective</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988639</link><description>The aggregation of massive heterogeneous building HVAC (heating, ventilation and air-conditioning) loads is essential for enhancing the flexibility of power grids in demand response contexts. However, practical challenges such as unavailability of load parameters and sensor update delays significantly hinder the development of accurate aggregation models. To this end, this letter introduces a novel fluid dynamics perspective to model the HVAC aggregation behavior under more realistic scenarios that account for these practical issues. A novel analogy is established to treat the HVAC population as a fluid system, enabling the aggregation dynamics to be intuitively captured through well-established fluid phenomena. Building on this perspective, a 2-D advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) equation-based aggregation model is developed. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately predict the aggregated power variation under these realistic scenarios. In addition, control strategies guided by this model can accurately track the reference load regulation signal, with an average relative error of less than 2%.</description></item><item><title>Coherent Compensation-Based Sensing for Long-Range Targets in Integrated Sensing and Communication System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10887024</link><description>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising candidate technology for 6G due to its improvement in spectral efficiency and energy efficiency. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal is a mainstream candidate ISAC waveform. However, there are inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) when the round-trip delay exceeds the cyclic prefix (CP) duration for OFDM signals, which limits the maximum sensing range of ISAC system. When detecting a long-range target, the wide beam inevitably covers the close-range target, of which the echo's power is much larger than that of the long-range target. In order to tackle the above problem, a multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and least squares (LS)-based spatial signal separation method is proposed to separate the echo signals reflected from different targets. Moreover, a coherent compensation-based sensing signal processing method at the receiver is proposed to enhance the signal to interference plus noise power ratio (SINR) of the OFDM block for generating the range-Doppler map (RDM) with higher SINR. Simulation results reveal that the proposed method greatly enhances the SINR of RDM by 10 dB for a target at 500 m compared with two-dimensional fast Fourier transform (2D-FFT) method. Besides, the detection probability is also significantly improved compared to the benchmarking method.</description></item><item><title>Toward Energy-Efficient Dynamic Resource Allocation in Uplink NOMA Systems: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Single and Multi-Cell NOMA Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10882994</link><description>Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a key technology for future wireless networks, enabling improved spectral efficiency and massive device connectivity. However, optimizing power allocation, subchannel assignment, and cell association in multi-cell uplink NOMA systems is challenging due to user mobility and the NP-hard nature of the problem. This paper addresses these challenges by formulating the problem as a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model to maximize energy efficiency (EE). We propose a deep reinforcement learning framework that employs deep Q-networks (DQN) for cell association and subchannel assignment, and twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) for power allocation. Simulation results reveal significant EE improvements, with multi-agent TD3 (MATD3) outperforming traditional Lagrange methods and multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG). Furthermore, the proposed method exhibits robust adaptability to user mobility and superior performance in multi-cell environments, effectively mitigating inter-cell interference and enhancing resource allocation in dynamic scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Learning-Based Task-Centric Multi-User Semantic Communication Solution for Vehicle Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10887356</link><description>With the application of 5G in in-vehicle network scenarios, the inevitable crisis of scarcity of communication resources is deepening. At the same time, considering the high demands for communication delay in vehicular network scenarios, it is essential to meet the requirements for reliable information transmission in high-speed mobility environments. To address these issues, we propose the Task-Centric Multi-User Semantic Communication (TCMSC) solution, designed to meet the energy consumption and transmission time delay requirements in line with the new paradigm of semantic communication. Our solution introduces a task-centric semantic processing model aimed at improving Semantic Spectral Efficiency (S-SE). The TCMSC solution is tailored for multi-service vehicle scenarios, optimizing power consumption and enhancing reliability, making it well-suited for challenging environments. Moreover, we propose a novel method using Stochastic Network Calculus (SNC) to accurately model semantic task delay and calculate the upper bound of Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) delay-bound violation probability. However, to tackle the increased optimization complexity from SNC while simultaneously enhancing feature extraction, we propose the Transformer Advantage Actor Critic (TR-A2C) algorithm. This algorithm leverages the Transformer to capture dynamic vehicle parameters across scenarios, accelerating the TCMSC solution. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional single-service vehicle dispatch, TCMSC improves delay violation probability by ${2.88\%}$ and reduces power consumption by ${31.1\%}$, all while effectively enhancing S-SE in complex traffic environments.</description></item><item><title>Resource Allocation for Dynamic TDD-Enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884055</link><description>In this paper, we investigate a dynamic time division duplex (DTDD) enabled integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, in which access points (APs) mode, bandwidth and transmit power can be flexibly configured. To obtain the best tradeoff between communication and sensing performance, we maximize the sum of downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) transmission rates under the constraints of Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and the maximal transmit power by jointly optimizing the power/subcarrier allocation and APs mode selection. To deal with the proposed nonconvex problem, we adopt the alternating optimization (AO) method to divide the original problem into two subproblems. The first subproblem is related to power/subcarriers allocation, which is equivalently transformed into a Semidefinite Programming (SDP) problem and eventually solved by the penalized convex-concave procedure (PCCP) method. The second subproblem is a quadratic integer problem related to APs mode selection, which is transformed into a convex quadratic integer problem that can be efficiently solved by the convex optimization toolbox. The numerical results demonstrate the tradeoff between the total transmission rate and sensing performance with different parameter configurations. Compared with existing schemes, our proposed scheme has significant advantages in terms of tradeoff performance.</description></item><item><title>Pattern-Domain NOMA-Based Orthogonal Time Frequency Space Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884046</link><description>Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) is envisioned as a highly promising modulation technique due to its superior performance in high-mobility scenarios. Meanwhile, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) stands out as a key contender for enhancing spectral efficiency and reducing transmission delay. In this paper, we amalgamate the pattern division multiple access (PDMA), recognized as an appealing NOMA scheme, with OTFS, coined as OTFS-PDMA, to leverage the benefits of both technologies and address the low-latency and massive connectivity demands of sixth-generation (6G) networks. Specifically, we first reformulate the input-output relations in the delay-Doppler domain for localized and distributed-mapping-based OTFS-PDMA systems featuring various PDMA pattern allocation schemes. Then, we propose a low-complexity power vector expectation propagation detection algorithm (PV-EPA) for OTFS-PDMA schemes operating in spatially correlated channels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed OTFS-PDMA scheme offers substantial performance improvements over the conventional OTFS-OMA scheme. For irregular PDMA patterns, localized mapping-based OTFS-PDMA schemes exhibit superior performance relative to their distributed counterparts. Additionally, the proposed PV-EPA receiver shows remarkable robustness against channel correlation and achieves a favorable trade-off between performance and complexity.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Distributed Beamforming Scheme Based on Phase Adjustment and Dynamic Tracking for LEO Satellite Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884878</link><description>Among LEO satellites communications, satellite direct connectivity to User Equipment (UE) has drawn much attention for its ability of providing basic emergent services. However, the link budget shortage resulting from long propagation length limits the capacity of communications. Distributed beamforming is a solution that provides high power gain by utilizing multiple transmitters simultaneously. This work presents a novel distributed beamforming scheme for LEO satellites direct connectivity services that can provide high power gain for multiple ground UEs with arbitrary locations and numbers. Firstly, an algorithm is designed for static satellites. By selecting satellites from a set of available ones and optimizing the transmit phases of electromagnetic waves on satellites, all the ground UEs can receive power gains improvement. Furthermore, this work considers satellite motions by proposing a fast algorithm that adjusts phases according to changing satellite locations. Finally, a satellite re-selection process is designed to ensure stable power improvement when satellites become unavailable due to their motions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our design. For four static satellites and 10 UEs, we examine 20 cases with different satellite and UE locations. Results show that UEs receive an average of at least 7 dB power gain in most cases. The condition of four moving satellites is also tested, and results demonstrate that all 10 UEs can have consistent receiving power gain as satellites move quickly.</description></item><item><title>Fading Evaluation in a Robust Spectrum Sensing System Based on Phase Difference Distribution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884811</link><description>In this paper, we delve deeper into a blind and robust spectral sensing technique, namely cosine feature recognition detection (CRD), based on the phase difference distribution of the received signal. The CRD algorithm is evaluated over various comprehensive fading environments, especially Rayleigh, Rice, Nakagami-$\bm {m}$, $\boldsymbol{\alpha }$-$\boldsymbol{\mu }$, $\boldsymbol{\kappa }$-$\boldsymbol{\mu }$, Extended $\boldsymbol{\eta }$-$\boldsymbol{\mu }$, and their special cases. We derive closed-form formulas for the probability of detection and asymptotic expressions for the probability of miss detection considering the mentioned fading models and evaluate the performance of the CRD spectrum sensing system under various propagation conditions. We quantify the achievable diversity order and coding gain as a function of the propagation parameters. We draw conclusions about how each physical propagation phenomenon affects this promising spectrum sensing technique and compare its performance against the energy detector (ED) technique under a realistic scenario with severe fading conditions, noise uncertainty, and frequency mismatch, highlighting the potential of the CRD algorithm for practical implementation. Additionally, a Hybrid ED-CRD technique is proposed, which improves the detection capability of the CRD without increasing the number of collected samples.</description></item><item><title>Ergodic Capacity Analysis of MSK-Type Signal-Based Uplink Asynchronous NOMA With Imperfect CSI and SIC Over Generalized Fading Channels</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884903</link><description>Recently, asynchronous non-orthogonal multiple access (ANOMA), that can further enhance the performance of NOMA, has gained much attention. Considering the demands of resource-constrained wireless communications and green communications, power-efficient minimum shift keying-type (MSK-type) signals have also been introduced into uplink ANOMA, but they are only for a basic flat fading channel and perfect conditions. In this paper, an uplink ANOMA based on MSK-type signals with imperfect channel state information and successive interference cancellation over generalized fading channels is proposed, and its ergodic capacity is investigated. Specifically, the system model is first established. Then, a moment generating function (MGF)-based ergodic capacity expression applicable to general fading channels with known MGF is derived. Based on the expression, the integral expressions for the ergodic capacity over Rayleigh and Rician fading channels are exactly derived, respectively, and their closed-form expressions are also provided by exploiting the Gauss-Laguerre method. Further, their expressions with perfect conditions, asymptotic expressions at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and high SNR slopes are also derived. The accuracy of the expression is verified by numerical and simulation results. It also shows the superiority of the proposed scheme over conventional OMA and ANOMA with linear modulation, and the relationship between system performance and time offsets, imperfect conditions, channel differences, and modulation formats.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Cache Retrieving Scheme in VANET via Online Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10887034</link><description>The implementation of intelligent driving technology is inseparable from reliable wireless communication and efficient cache scheduling in Vehicle Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs). The purpose of cache scheduling in VANETs is to provide efficient and fast data services to vehicles. In response to difficult to handle wireless communication interference and high requirements for communication delay and energy consumption optimization in vehicle-road cooperation, we propose a new communication model of &#8220;Retrieving-Cast&#8221; to simplify the cache scheduling process oriented by data requirements. In V2I mode, consider the uplink of all roadside units(RSUs) retrieving data from vehicles, and prioritize data retrieving based on factors such as the number, density, and urgency of vehicles within the communication coverage range of RSUs. We hope that as many high-priority RSUs as possible to complete cached data retrieving as soon as possible under wireless communication interference. To overcome the limitations of traditional heuristic algorithms with low scheduling efficiency and deep learning methods requiring a large amount of training data, we propose a double-$\varepsilon$ online reinforcement learning method, which efficiently solves the cache retrieval scheduling problem. Through experiments and analysis, our method achieved better scheduling results compared to traditional approximation algorithms and single $\varepsilon$-greedy Deep Q-learning methods. The designed data transformation method also addresses the issue of requiring a large amount of training data, enabling rapid computation of scheduling requests in the network at an extremely low training cost, meeting the low-latency computation requirements in VANETs.</description></item><item><title>Delay Minimization for NOMA-MEC Offloading in ABS-Aided Maritime Communication Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884688</link><description>As maritime activities increase, the demand for high-speed, low-latency communications and efficient task processing in maritime communication networks (MCNets) intensifies. Currently, sea-surface communications and tasks mainly depend on on-shore base stations, which have limited coverage, and marine satellites, which offer broader reach but cannot provide high-speed connections and are costly. Motivated by the above, we investigate the deployment of air base stations (ABSs) in MCNets to offer flexible coverage and handle maritime-specific tasks. ABS-aided MCNets benefit from the integration of mobile edge computing (MEC) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) techniques. Specifically, by optimizing the task offloading and resource allocation, we formulate a total task processing delay minimization problem under the constraints of task time-to-live (TTL) and successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding threshold. Since the formulated problem is non-convex, we decouple it and solve it iteratively. The channel allocation, power control, offloading ratio, and computation resource allocation are tackled in turn. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing schemes in reducing the total task processing delay. Notably, the incorporation of NOMA markedly enhances the task offloading rate, further decreasing the total task processing delay. The proposed scheme cuts the total task processing delay by at least 7.7% compared to the state-of-the-art schemes and by 40.9% against the local computing benchmark. Additionally, the performance of the proposed scheme, including its complexity, convergence, and the performance loss due to iterative optimization, is analyzed.</description></item><item><title>A Learning-Based Stochastic Game for Energy Efficient Optimization of UAV Trajectory and Task Offloading in Space/Aerial Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891825</link><description>In this paper, we study the energy-efficient unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and low earth orbital (LEO) satellite assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) in space&#8211;air&#8211;ground integrated networks (SAGINs). The key challenge involves how to efficiently execute tasks offloaded from IoT devices, given limited on-board computation capabilities of UAVs and delay constraints of tasks. To address it, UAVs are first allowed to adjust their trajectories to accommodate as many tasks as possible from IoT devices. Subsequently, UAVs compute a portion of these tasks while delegating the rest to LEO satellites for further execution. Accordingly, we formulate a joint optimization problem including UAV trajectory planning, task offloading, and bandwidth allocations, aiming to maximize the long-term energy efficiency of UAVs and LEO satellites (i.e., the total data size in computation offloading divided by energy consumption of UAVs and LEO satellites). Considering the interactions among intelligent UAVs, this problem is reformulated as a set of interconnected multi-agent stochastic games, and the existence of corresponding Nash Equilibrium (NE) is theoretically proved. To obtain the NE, a multi-agent reinforcement learning-based algorithm, namely UTPTR, is developed concerning system dynamics and uncertainties. Simulations evaluate the performance of the UTPTR and demonstrate its superiority compared to existing approaches.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Agent RL for Sleep Mode and Antenna Configuration With User Offloading Under Dynamic Traffic in Massive MIMO Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884953</link><description>In this paper, we focus on minimizing the total energy consumption of multi-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks while simultaneously guaranteeing user quality of service (QoS). This is achieved by optimizing the multi-level advanced sleep modes (ASM), antenna switching, and user association of the base stations (BSs). Due to the interdependence of user association and inter-cell interference in the network, collaborative efforts among individual BSs become imperative. The problem is modeled as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (DEC-POMDP) and a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) algorithm is proposed to obtain a collaborative BS control policy. Simulation results demonstrate that the obtained policy can significantly improve network energy efficiency, adaptively switch the BSs into different depths of sleep, reduce inter-cell interference, and maintain good QoS compared to the two benchmark algorithms. The results also validate that enabling user offloading among BSs can improve both user QoS and system performance. The superiority of MAPPO is further affirmed by comparing it with the single-agent deep Q network (DQN) algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Power Allocation Strategy of Multi-Static Radar Network Tracking Maneuvering Jammer Based on Stackelberg Game</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884788</link><description>This article investigates a power allocation strategy and performs a game equilibrium analysis for tracking a self-defense jammer in a multi-static radar network with non-ideal detection performance. Specifically, the main objective of multi-static radar network is to maximize the jammer tracking accuracy under power constraints, whereas the jammer aims to minimize the index. The closed-form expression for the Bayesian Cram&#233;r-Rao Lower Bound(BCRLB) with radiation power as variable in the non-ideal detection environment is derived and adopted as the criterion function. Then, the multi-static radar network and the jammer are taken as the leader and follower based on Stackelberg game, and the power allocation model is established to optimize their power resources. Finally, by integrating the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions and cyclic minimization algorithm, an iterative two-step solution is developed to tackle the power allocation problem between two players in the game efficiently, and the existence and uniqueness of the Stackelberg game equilibrium are derived.</description></item><item><title>Two-Timescale Optimization for E2E Network Slicing-Aided Cloud-Edge Collaborative Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891194</link><description>To leverage the synergy between cloud computing (CC) and edge computing (EC) to support various services while reducing the CC/EC switching overhead, the two-timescale utility maximization problem for an end-to-end network slicing-aided cloud-edge collaborative network (E2E-CECN) is formulated covering both the high throughput and low delay service requirements. To solve the utility maximization problem while dynamically adjusting the weights of the E2E-CECN utility to accommodate the variation of users' service requests, we proposed a reward comparison double deep Q network algorithm to optimize the large timescale joint virtual basestation activation and CC-EC scheduling, and a reward comparison deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to optimize the small timescale allocation of backhaul link capacity (BLC), CC/EC capability and transmission power. Numerical results show that both the high-throughput and low-delay service requirements can be satisfied simultaneously under the reasonable BLC usage and power consumption.</description></item><item><title>An Evolutionary Approach for Multiple Flying Base Stations Deployment in NOMA-Based Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891177</link><description>This paper addresses the problem of deploying a Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) using multiple Flying Base Stations (FBSs) to serve multiple Stationary Ground Users (SGUs). Our objectives are to minimize the number of active FBSs, reduce overlapping coverage areas, and increase data rates for SGUs. We formulate this as a multi-objective, non-convex Non-Linear Mixed Integer Programming (NLMIP) problem, incorporating both deployment and resource allocation practical constraints. To manage the problem's complexity, we decompose it into two sub-problems: FBS deployment and resource allocation optimization. To optimize the 2D deployment of FBSs in horizontal space, we propose a general, low-complexity heuristic method based on a statistical variant of the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm, named Evolutionary Bayesian SOM (EBSOM). Then, utilizing a Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) communication scheme between FBSs and SGUs, we maximize the downlink sum rate while adhering to constraints on FBS positions, transmission power, and bandwidth availability. In this stage, the deployment of FBSs is further refined to enhance resource allocation by dividing the problem into two non-convex sub-problems, which are solved iteratively using Surrogate Optimization (SO). Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy, particularly in reducing the number of active FBSs, minimizing overlapping areas, and improving network sum rates.</description></item><item><title>Spatial Multiplexing Oriented Channel Reconfiguration in Multi-IRS Aided MIMO Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10897933</link><description>Spatial multiplexing plays a significant role in improving the capacity of multiple-input&#8211;multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems. To improve the spectral efficiency (SE) of a point-to-point MIMO system, we exploit the channel reconfiguration capabilities provided by multiple intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) to enhance the spatial multiplexing. Unlike most existing works, we address both the issues of the IRSs placement and elements allocation. To this end, we first introduce an orthogonal placement strategy to mitigate channel correlation, thereby enabling interference-free multi-stream transmission. Subsequently, we propose a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based approach to jointly optimize the IRS elements and power allocation. Our theoretical analysis unveils that equal IRS elements/power allocation scheme becomes asymptotically optimal as the number of IRS elements and transmit power tend to be infinite. Numerical results demonstrate that when the total number of IRS elements or the power exceeds a certain threshold, a multi-IRS assisted system outperforms a single IRS configuration.</description></item><item><title>Symbol-Level Channel Pattern Optimization for Reconfigurable MU-MISO Communication Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891189</link><description>In this paper, we propose a symbol-level channel pattern optimization (SLCPO) scheme for pattern reconfigurable (PR) multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) communication systems. Unlike existing transmission schemes that treat the channel as invariant, this work proposes to actively adjust the radiation power of each scattering path of the wireless channel by adjusting the radiation pattern of the transmit array, thereby removing the limitations that communications can only adapt to the wireless channel passively. We separate the optimization into two stages. In the first stage, an optimization problem on the channel matrix aimed at maximizing the worst user's quality-of service (QoS) without investing additional signal power is formulated. Given the non-convex nature of the formulated problem, we design an alternating optimization algorithm, and obtain the channel covariance matrix that achieves optimal performance for each transmission symbol slot. This structure, proven to be optimal, provides key theoretical insights into the ideal channel conditions for symbol-level precoding (SLP). In the second stage, we propose the radiation pattern design in reconfigurable MU-MISO communication systems, where communication channels are jointly decided by the radiation pattern of the transmit array and the physical propagation channel, aligning the practical pattern channel with the theoretical optimal channel. Numerical results verify the superiority of the proposed SLCPO scheme in PR MU-MISO systems in terms of error rate over state-of-the-art.</description></item><item><title>Parameter Configuration Scheme for Optimal Energy Efficiency in LoRa-Based Wireless Underground Sensor Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891365</link><description>Long Range (LoRa)-based wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs) have attracted much attention due to their long-range communication capability and easiness of deployment. Since it is difficult to replace batteries in buried end nodes, energy efficiency (EE) needs to be improved to extend the lifespan. As link quality is closely related to LoRa physical layer (PHY) parameters and soil characteristics, it is necessary to carefully configure parameters to maintain reliable connectivity and high EE in the dynamic underground environment. To this end, we propose EnergySaver, which utilizes soil moisture to estimate the underground path loss, derives signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to characterize the packet delivery rate (PDR), and finally calculates EE. The combination that maximizes EE is the best configuration for current channel state. In addition, for the case of densely deployed buried LoRa nodes, we propose a low-complexity collision decoding scheme in EnergySaver that utilizes packet time offsets to decompose concurrent transmissions. The simulation results confirm that EnergySaver improves EE by at least two times without sacrificing high link quality, and effectively reduces packet loss during concurrent data transmission with excellent scalability.</description></item><item><title>Full-Duplex Massive MIMO Relaying Over Spatially Correlated Rician Channel With Phase Shifts</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884815</link><description>We analytically study a multi-pair two-way full-duplex (FD) massive multiple-input multiple-output relay system over a spatially correlated Rician channel with unknown phase shifts. Most of the existing literature ignores the line-of-sight (LoS) phase shift, which arises due to user mobility and hardware impairments. We analyze the impact of LoS phase shift on the spectral efficiency (SE) of the system by considering two different channel estimators: i) phase-unaware linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) and ii) phase-aware MMSE. We also formulate the asymptotic SE expressions for three different power scaling schemes considering zero-forcing receiver/zero-forcing transmitter processing at the relay. We numerically show the impact of unknown phase shifts on the SE of the system. Finally, we highlight the impact of i) loop interference due to the FD operation and ii) pilot power on the sum-SE.</description></item><item><title>Security Performance Analysis for MIMO Systems: From Artificial Noise's Power and Dimension Perspective</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884850</link><description>This paper analyzes the influence of power and dimension of artificial noise (AN) on security performance of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with multiple randomly located eavesdroppers. We derive the closed-form expressions of the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and the optimal secrecy capacity by utilizing the irrelevance among transmission channels, and the orthogonality between AN and the basis vectors of the legitimate channel matrix's null space. We use the Poisson point process to determine the number and location of eavesdroppers, then analyze the security performance of the communication system under the 3D channel condition of probability-based line-of-sight (LoS) or non-line-of-sight (NLoS) channel. The simulation results show the following conclusions. When the AN dimension reaches 1/4 highest dimension (i.e., one quarter of the number of transmitting antennae less than one) and the power splitter factor (PSF) falls in the open interval (0.6, 0.9), we can achieve a trade-off between secrecy capacity and design complexity.</description></item><item><title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Aided Covert Communications: A Multi-User Scenario</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10882930</link><description>This article explores a multi-user covert communication scenario with the assistance of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). Except a covert user monitored by the warden, there are multiple public users existing in the service area. For the purpose of evaluating the efficacy of the covert communication system, a covert constraint is derived measuring the minimum detection error probability of the warden through the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Then an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the convert rate, while ensuring the constraints of covertness, transmit power and quality of service (QoS) for public users. A two-step iterative algorithm jointly designing the active and passive beamforming, is put forth to efficiently resolve this non-convex optimization problem. Additionally, the numerical results clearly demonstrate that the proposed RIS-assisted scheme can significantly enhance the covert communication performance on the premise of guaranteeing the public communication performance of the system.</description></item><item><title>Diagnosis of PV Cell Antireflective Coating Degradation Resulting From Hot-Humid High-Voltage Potential Aging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10966198</link><description>Corrosion of the antireflective coating on a photovoltaic cell (&#8220;${\text{AR}}_{\text{c}}$ corrosion&#8221;) has previously been observed in studies using hot-humid test conditions with external high-voltage (HV) bias. This study primarily focuses on known vulnerable legacy aluminum back surface field cells in mini-modules (MiMos) put through comparative stepped stress tests. Each cell type had MiMos at +1500 V, &#8211;1500 V, or unbiased (&#8220;$V_{\text{oc}}$&#8221;) potential, which were sequentially subjected to test conditions of 60 &#176;C/60% relative humidity (RH) for 96 h, as in International Electrotechnical Commission Technical Specification 62804-1; 70 &#176;C/70% RH for 200 h; and 85 &#176;C/85% RH for 200 h. Characterizations at each step included visual camera and electroluminescence (EL) imaging, colorimetry, and current&#8211;voltage curve tracing. Final characterizations included: Suns&#8211;$V_{\text{oc}}$, spatial mapping of external quantum efficiency, high-resolution photoluminescence, EL, and dark lock-in thermography imaging. Forensics were performed on extracted cores, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning Auger microscopy (SAM). Forensics were also conducted on MiMos from previous studies that underwent stepped HV aging and separate outdoor aged full-sized modules. ${\text{AR}}_{\text{c}}$ corrosion was specifically seen for the glass/encapsulant/cell side of the +1500 V (HV+) stressed MiMos and modules. Appearance, color, and reflectance were the most distinguishing characteristics relative to glass corrosion, gridline corrosion and delamination, and other concurrent degradation modes. SEM/EDS and SAM identified the conversion of silicon nitride to hydrated silica, hydrous silica, or hydrated amorphous silica, which preferentially occurred at the edges and tips of the pyramidal textured cell surface.</description></item><item><title>CsGeI3 Perovskite-Based Solar Cells for Higher Efficiency and Stability: An Experimental Investigation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988679</link><description>Among the recent developments in photovoltaic technologies, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have drawn significant attention, owing to their exceptional power conversion efficiency (PCE), cost-effectiveness, and better optoelectronic characteristics. However, the stability and presence of lead (toxicity) in PSCs remains a major challenge to their commercialization. In this study, we experimentally investigated all-inorganic, lead-free CsGeI3-based PSCs in an n-i-p configuration. The CsGeI3 films were synthesized using a one-step spin-coating technique and their crystallographic characteristics were analyzed. Furthermore, we fabricated and tested different device architectures incorporating CsGeI3 as the absorber layer with various electron transport layers (ETLs), including TiO2, ZnO, and graphene oxide (GO), while employing MoS2 as the hole transport layer. The resulting device structure was Fluorine doped Tin oxide (FTO)/(TiO2/ZnO/GO)/CsGeI3/MoS2/Ni). All fabricated devices demonstrated excellent performance, with the TiO2-based ETL device achieving the highest PCE of 10.79%. In addition, incorporating reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as an interface layer on top of the absorber layer further enhanced photovoltaic performance by approximately 3% across all configurations (achieving outstanding efficiency of 13.57%). The hydrophobic nature and high conductivity of rGO suggest its potential as a promising strategy for improving the stability and efficiency of lead-free PSCs in future applications.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Photovoltaic Module Characterization: Using Image Transformers for Current&#8211;Voltage Curve Prediction From Electroluminescence Images</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002587</link><description>Individual photovoltaic (PV) module health monitoring can be a daunting task for operation and maintenance of solar farms. Modules can be inspected through luminescence, thermal imaging, and current&#8211;voltage (I&#8211;V) curve analyzes for identification of damage and power loss. I&#8211;V curves provide easily interpretable data to determine module health as they directly provide electrical performance metrics. However, in order to obtain these curves, modules must be disconnected from the array and either removed to a solar simulator or characterized in situ with corrections for module temperature, the incident solar spectrum, and intensity. Luminescence or thermal images of a module are relatively easy to acquire in situ. Electroluminescence (EL) images highlight physical defects in the modules but do not provide easily interpretable features to correlate with electrical performance. This work presents a SWin transformer network to predict I&#8211;V curves for PV modules from their corresponding EL images. The predicted I&#8211;V curves allow the accurate prediction of the maximum power point (MPP), short-circuit current $I_{\text {sc}}$, and open-circuit voltage $V_{\text {oc}}$ with a mean error less of than 1%. Comparing single diode model (SDM) parameters extracted from the predicted curves to those extracted from the true curves, the series resistance $R_{\text {s}}$ demonstrates a mean error of 5.19%, and the photocurrent $I$ a mean error of 0.197%. The shunt resistance $R_{\text {sh}}$ and dark current $I_{\text {o}}$ parameters are predicted with larger errors because of their sensitivity to small changes in the I&#8211;V curve.</description></item><item><title>Probability Mass Function of Energy for Light-Collecting Surfaces in Rough Geometries and Its Applications in Urban Energy and Photovoltaics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10971967</link><description>Sunlight throughout urban areas largely impacts local climate [sustainable development goal (SDG) 13], residents&#8217; well-being (SDG 3), and access to clean energy (SDG 7). However, sunlight availability on various urban surfaces is affected by urban geometry. Here, in this work, a probabilistic framework to evaluate the interplay between sunlight and urban geometry is presented, and its immediate applications in urban energy studies are demonstrated. A probability mass function that predicts the energy production of a group of light-collecting surfaces, such as solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, installed in rough geometries, such as urban areas, is derived. Along the way, an expression for the sky view factor (SVF) is formulated within rough geometries as well as a link between the capacity factor of the residential PV fleet and urban geometry. The predictions of the mathematical framework are validated using the digital surface model and collected PV systems data in The Netherlands. This work primarily helps understand the underlying relation between the geometrical parameters of a rough surface and the received sunlight energy on a subset of that surface. Exemplified applications are swift SVF calculations and residential PV fleet yield predictions, which, respectively, support efficient urban energy assessments and privacy-preserving electrical grid management.</description></item><item><title>Deep Learning-Based Health Monitoring for Photovoltaic Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10993290</link><description>The transition to renewable energy sources like photovoltaic (PV) systems is essential for societal progress, counteracting the adverse effects of fossil fuels. However, managing PV systems entails significant challenges and economic implications. PV fault occurrence necessitates swift detection and resolution, exacerbating financial burdens. Effective fault diagnosis relies heavily on data from PV plant monitoring and energy management systems. Historically, PV monitoring relied on manual inspections, but autonomous aerial vehicle (UAV) technology provides a more efficient and comprehensive solution, enhancing safety and offering detailed imagery, scalability, environmental monitoring, and advanced data analytics. This study utilizes deep learning (DL) approaches to monitor the health of the PV, focusing on analyzing UAV-captured scenes. Specifically, this article presents an end-to-end two-stage DL-based health monitoring framework that consists of semantic segmentation model, SegFormer, for isolating solar panels and object detection model, YOLOv8, for identifying anomalies within the PV modules. The proposed framework is validated and compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on a three publicly available UAV-captured datasets. Results show improvements of 25.8% and 1.5% in solar panel segmentation, and 26.6% in solar panel anomaly detection compared with recent SOTA models.</description></item><item><title>Performance Improvements Through Advanced PV Backtracking on Uneven Terrain</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10966030</link><description>The climatic sensitivity of new terrain-aware backtracking algorithms is evaluated across 800 locations in the continental USA on a representative synthetic rolling terrain. We find that a global optimization approach to backtracking results in climate-specific annual energy gains of 2.4%&#8211;3.2% relative to a traditional backtracking algorithm baseline. We identify a strong logarithmic correlation between local diffuse fraction and yield improvement, and highlight the effect of seasonal precipitation on performance gains. We also find that a backtracking approach, which approximates the terrain as constant, does not offer significant annual energy gains over the baseline on the synthetic terrain. Our findings suggest that specific yield from backtracking in the USA can be improved by as much as 88 kWh/kW by considering terrain when selecting a backtracking algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Vertical Bifacial Photovoltaic System Model Validation: Study With Field Data, Various Orientations, and Latitudes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10985871</link><description>Accurate modeling of photovoltaic (PV) systems is critical for the design, financial analysis, and monitoring of solar PV plants. For bifacial PV applications, models must additionally offer robust rear-side irradiance algorithms. However, bifacial PV irradiance models have yet to be sufficiently validated for east&#8211;west vertically oriented systems, where direct beam solar irradiation swaps at solar noon. Here, we validate five bifacial irradiance models with field data collected in Golden, CO, USA (40&#176;N) and Fairbanks, AK, USA (65&#176;N) for east&#8211;west vertical, north&#8211;south vertical, and south-tilted arrays. There is no clear best performer among subhourly models; Bifacial_radiance, bifacialVF, the System Advisor Model, and dual-sided energy tracer (DUET) comparably predict seasonal and daily changes in PV production, with root-mean-squared error (RMSE) falling in the range of 11&#8211;28% depending on the location and system orientation. PVSyst (v7.4.8), limited by hourly resolution, demonstrates RMSE in the range of 33&#8211;45%. The primary causes of high RMSE are similar for all models; using an irradiance cutoff of &gt;100 W/m2, using clear-sky filtering, and removing time stamps with snow, lowers model RMSE to 4&#8211;13% for subhourly models and 12&#8211;25% for PVSyst. Regular meteorological station servicing is found to further decrease model RMSE by up to 3% abs. in Alaska. Finally, we model bifacial PV systems in over 250 locations between 15 and 85&#176;N, finding that deviations between model-predicted annual insolation tend to be 2&#8211;3&#215; higher for vertical PV systems than south-facing fixed-tilt systems. We discuss potential methods for improving vertical PV modeling and provide recommendations for high-quality field data collection in northern environments.</description></item><item><title>Sustainability Impact of Different PV Mounting Systems and Pathways for Decarbonizing Emissions of PV Deployment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11007072</link><description>The amount of electricity generated by a solar panel varies according to the installation location and chosen mounting structure. This changes the effective material consumption and the associated effective carbon emissions of electricity produced by each solar panel. This article investigates the impact of different photovoltaic (PV) mounting systems on energy yield, material consumption, and carbon emissions, focusing on the key configurations of fixed-tilt (FT), east&#8211;west, and single-axis tracking systems. As global PV capacity rapidly expands, understanding the sustainability of these systems is crucial for decarbonizing the electricity sector. We highlight the impact of different mounting systems on yield at different latitudes and demonstrate that the effective material consumption can vary by over 30% in terms of both g/Wp and g/kWh, along with the impact on carbon emissions in terms of both gCO2-eq/Wp and gCO2-eq/kWh. Pathways to reduce the carbon footprint in gCO2-eq/kWh by up to 60% compared with the FT baseline case are also discussed, including incorporating green steel and decarbonized concrete.</description></item><item><title>A Hierarchical 3-D Physical Design Method for Ultralarge-Scale Logic-on-Memory CGRA Chip</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10893709</link><description>Face-to-face bonded 3-D (F2F 3D) technology, with the potential to significantly reduce chip area while enhancing performance, stands as one of the most promising ways to extend Moore&#8217;s Law. However, current 3-D physical design flows are often modifications of 2-D design flows and rely on technical personnel to manually modify technical files. Furthermore, existing research on 3-D design flow primarily focuses on module implementation, with very few studies addressing hierarchical design methods for large-scale chips. In this article, we first introduce a 3-D physical design flow which concurrently optimizes the timing of both the logic tier and the memory tier, achieving synchronized physical design for both tiers. Then, we develop a bottom-up hierarchical 3-D physical design flow to extend the 3-D design flow to large-scale chip design. Through coordinated power planning, clock tree design, and interconnect unit design, we enhance the power, performance, and area (PPA) metrics of the entire chip. Using our RTL-to-GDS physical design flow, we successfully implemented a 28-nm CMOS logic-on-memory (LoM) 3-D coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture (CGRA) chip with over 50 million gates. Experimental results demonstrate that our 3-D flow improves timing by 16.1% while reducing voltage drop by 38.6% compared to the 2-D design.

A set of time-domain arithmetic circuits, including a one-step time register (TR), time amplifier (TA), time adder, and unit delay operator ( ${z}^{-1}$ ), are introduced to overcome the limitations of conventional time-domain filters. The working principles and nonidealities of each block are analyzed and compared with the existing methods. The proposed filter is implemented in a 180-nm CMOS process with a 0.9-V supply voltage. The designed frequency analyzer is tunable to extract the amplitude and phase angle of signals up to 400 Hz. Simulation results, targeting a 280-Hz signal at a 19.88-kHz sampling frequency, demonstrate that the filter can detect the amplitude and phase of a voltage signal in the time domain with an error below 5%. The filter achieves a resolution of  $76.7~\text {dBV/s}$ , consumes less than  $24~\mu \text {W}$  of power, and the estimated silicon area is almost  $0.828~\mathrm {mm}^{2}$ .</description></item><item><title>A Nanopower EEG Low-Pass Filter Using Current-Sharing Vertical Differential Pairs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10900603</link><description>A follower-based  ${g}_{m} - C$  low-pass filter that employs CMOS vertical source-couple-pair (VSCP) transconductors is proposed for practical use in EEG acquisition systems. The VSCP transconductor operates as a  ${g}_{m}$  cell with current sharing and linearity enhancement features. It is applied in the first- and second-order  ${g}_{m} - C$  sections cascaded to form a third-order low-pass filter targeting a 150-Hz bandwidth. To mitigate the effects of biasing current source mismatch, dynamic element matching (DEM) is optionally applied to the relevant biasing current source pairs, resulting in second harmonic distortion (HD2) and noise suppression. Implemented in a 0.18- $\mu $ m process, the proposed filter consumes 16.3-nW power from a 1.2-V supply. Thanks to the DEM and VSCPs, the filter achieves a 150-mVP linear input range [measured at 1% total harmonic distortion (THD)], whereas the input-referred noise of  $43~\mu \text {V}_{\text {rms}}$  is obtained leading to a filter dynamic range (DR) of 65.15 dB. Overall performance comparisons with other recent nanopower filters indicate that the figure of merit (FoM) of this proposed filter is comparable, while the linear input range is larger.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Ripple DIDO DC&#8211;DC Hybrid Interface With Optimal-Hysteresis-Controlled MPPT for TEH</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10905040</link><description>This article proposes a dual-input-dual-output (DIDO) dc-dc hybrid interface for thermoelectric energy harvesting (TEH) applications with high efficiency and low output ripple. A load-first ordered power distributive control (OPDC) strategy is used to recycle the excess thermoelectric energy (TE) in time. Utilizing the digital adaptive on-time (DAOT) technique, the output ripple can be reduced during battery (BAT) power supply. A hysteresis-controlled maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technique is proposed to track the variation of the internal resistance  $\text {R}_{\text {TE}}$  of the thermoelectric generator (TEG), which achieves high tracking efficiency over a wide  $\text {R}_{\text {TE}}$  range. By trading the tracking efficiency and loss off in the MPPT, an optimization method for hysteresis window is proposed. In addition, an analog zero-crossing detector (ZCD) without calibration is adopted to improve the end-to-end efficiency. The proposed hybrid interface is realized by 0.18- $\mu $ m standard CMOS process with a core area of  $0.91 \times 0.61$  mm2. Measured results show that the proposed interface can harvest TE over the  $\text {R}_{\text {TE}}$  variation range of 1&#8211; $1000 \; \Omega $ , with a peak tracking efficiency of 99.6% and an output ripple as low as 35 mV. It also achieves a peak end-to-end efficiency of 87% and an output power range of  $1 \; \mu $ W &#8722;10 mW.</description></item><item><title>A 1-MS/s 64-Channel Data Acquisition System With Full-Scale Input Range for Area-Sensitive Application Achieved 165.3-dB FoMS/Ch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10905056</link><description>This article presents a novel data acquisition system (DAS) designed for area-sensitive applications, including automotive instrumentation, launch vehicles, and satellites, which require efficient area utilization and full-swing input/output capabilities for diverse sensors. Traditional approaches to achieving full swing, such as using CMOS input transistors or generating negative voltage via charge pumps, either result in high harmonic distortion (HD) or complicate chip design. To address these challenges, we propose a complementary analog front-end (CAFE) that shifts the input signal by a fixed voltage, enabling operation in a more linear region while employing feedback to minimize HD. The system incorporates two analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) that convert the input signal and subtract the digital output of the common mode voltage ( $V_{\text {CM}}$ ), facilitating effective data fusion for complete AD conversion. Fabricated using a 180-nm 1P5M BCD process, the DAS consumes 118.81 mW from a 5.0-V power supply, providing 64 channels in a compact area of  $4.0\times 3.2$  mm. At a sampling rate of 1 MS/s, it achieves an effective number of bits (ENoBs) of 13.16, with a power consumption of 1.856 mW per channel and a dynamic range of 83.3 dB, resulting in an impressive figure of merit per channel (FoMS/Ch) of 165.3 dB.</description></item><item><title>A 12-bit 2-GS/s Pipeline ADC in 28-nm CMOS With Linear-Error Self-Calibration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10929682</link><description>This article discusses a 12-bit 2-GS/s pipeline analog-to-digital converter (ADC). A self-calibration technique is employed to correct linear errors due to capacitor mismatches and interstage gain errors (IGEs). To counteract the effects of power supply and temperature variations, the first three stages of the ADC are equipped with least-mean-squares (LMS) IGE background calibrations, enhanced by the injection of a 1-bit dither into these stages. The computational engines designed for background calibration were reused for self-calibration, simplifying the overall design. An improved integrated input buffer drives the ADC, achieving a bandwidth of approximately 6.3 GHz, which is essential for high-speed data acquisition and processing. Moreover, a low-power operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) and reference buffer, both operating on a 1.0-V supply, are implemented to minimize the chip&#8217;s power consumption. The 12-bit pipeline prototype ADC, fabricated using a 28-nm CMOS process, operates at 2-GS/s with a 1.0-Vpp input signal. It delivers a signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) of 58.92 dB and a spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of 82.23 dB. The ADC core consumes only 180 mW, resulting in a Schreier figure of merits (FoMs) of 156.4 dB.</description></item><item><title>A 2-Lane DAC-/ADC-Based 2 &#215; 2 MIMO PAM-4 MMSE-DFE Wireline Transceiver With FEXT Cancellation on RFSoC Platform</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947618</link><description>This article presents a 2-lane  $2 \times 2$  multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) 4-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) minimum mean-squared-error (MMSE)-decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) with far-end crosstalk (FEXT) cancellation for digital-to-analog converter (DAC)-/analog-to-digital converter (ADC)-based high-speed serial links. The receiver (RX) datapath is designed with a 15-tap MIMO feedforward equalizer (FFE) and a one-tap MIMO DFE with the least mean square (LMS), enabling adaptation to channel variation while maintaining the MMSE setting. The RX digital signal processor (DSP) place and route (PnR) in a 28-nm CMOS is estimated to consume 201 mW/lane at a 56-Gb/s/lane data rate while occupying a 0.5-mm2/lane silicon area. We further implement a real-time evaluation platform to verify the functionality of the MIMO PAM-4 MMSE-DFE with rapid bit-error-rate (BER) testing on RFSoC. The measurement result demonstrates that the MIMO MMSE-DFE significantly improves BER performance from 2.75e&#8722;3 to 1.31e&#8722;7 compared with equalization without FEXT cancellation when communicating over a channel exhibiting 12.4-dB insertion loss (IL) and 13.2-dB IL-to-crosstalk ratio (ICR) at Nyquist.</description></item><item><title>An Area and Energy-Efficient Systolic Array Accelerator Architecture for Deep Neural Networks Using Stochastic Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10937936</link><description>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used to handle various intelligent tasks. With the increased model size, the DNNs&#8217; hardware accelerators are challenging the higher area overhead and energy consumption. Stochastic computing (SC) has recently been considered for implementing DNNs and reducing hardware consumption. However, many current SC-based DNN accelerators fail to balance accuracy, performance, and resource overhead. In addition, their limited scalability and flexibility restrict their use in edge devices. In this article, we design an area and energy-efficient DNN accelerator architecture using SC. We propose an SC-binary hybrid processing unit with piecewise shift compensation without significant additional hardware overhead increment to improve the SC accuracy. To balance performance and resource overhead, we conduct a design space exploration (DSE) from an overall architectural perspective. An experimental platform with both software and hardware for SC-based DNNs is established. The software simulation results demonstrate that the best accuracy of the designed SC-DNN on the CIFAR-10 is 91.9%, which is 3.2% higher than that of the previous SC-DNN work. The VLSI implementation of the hardware is synthesized using the TSMC 28-nm CMOS process. Results show that compared to the binary computing counterpart, our design achieves  $2.7\times $  area efficiency and  $3.4\times $  energy efficiency. Compared to other SC-DNN accelerator designs, our design can provide  $5.3\times $  area efficiency and  $7.3\times $  energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Xpikeformer: Hybrid Analog-Digital Hardware Acceleration for Spiking Transformers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10957839</link><description>The integration of neuromorphic computing and transformers through spiking neural networks (SNNs) offers a promising path to energy-efficient sequence modeling, with the potential to overcome the energy-intensive nature of the artificial neural network (ANN)-based transformers. However, the algorithmic efficiency of SNN-based transformers cannot be fully exploited on GPUs due to architectural incompatibility. This article introduces Xpikeformer, a hybrid analog-digital hardware architecture designed to accelerate SNN-based transformer models. The architecture integrates analog in-memory computing (AIMC) for feedforward and fully connected layers, and a stochastic spiking attention (SSA) engine for efficient attention mechanisms. We detail the design, implementation, and evaluation of Xpikeformer, demonstrating significant improvements in energy consumption and computational efficiency. Through image classification tasks and wireless communication symbol detection tasks, we show that Xpikeformer can achieve inference accuracy comparable to the GPU implementation of ANN-based transformers. Evaluations reveal that Xpikeformer achieves a  $13\times $  reduction in energy consumption at approximately the same throughput as the state-of-the-art (SOTA) digital accelerator for ANN-based transformers. In addition, Xpikeformer achieves up to  $1.9\times $  energy reduction compared to the optimal digital ASIC projection of SOTA SNN-based transformers.</description></item><item><title>Flex-PE: Flexible and SIMD Multiprecision Processing Element for AI Workloads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10950103</link><description>The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) models, from deep neural networks (DNNs) to transformers/large-language models (LLMs), demands flexible hardware solutions to meet diverse execution needs across edge and cloud platforms. Existing accelerators lack unified support for multiprecision arithmetic and runtime-configurable activation functions (AFs). This work proposes Flex-PE, a single instruction, multiple data (SIMD)-enabled multiprecision processing element that efficiently integrates multiply-and-accumulate operations with configurable AFs using unified hardware, including Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU, and SoftMax. The proposed design achieves throughput improvements of up to  $16\times $  FxP4,  $8\times $  FxP8,  $4\times $  FxP16, and  $1\times $  FxP32, with maximum hardware efficiency for both iterative and pipelined architectures. An area-efficient iterative Flex-PE-based SIMD systolic array reduces DMA reads by up to  $62\times $  and  $371\times $  for input feature maps and weight filters in VGG-16, achieving 8.42 GOPS/W energy efficiency with minimal accuracy loss (&lt;2%). Flex-PE scales from 4-bit edge inference to FxP8/16/32, supporting edge and cloud high-performance computing (HPC) while providing high-performance adaptable AI hardware with optimal precision, throughput, and energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Wireless PHY With Adaptive OFDM and Multiarmed Bandit Learning on Zynq System-on-Chip</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964385</link><description>In this work, we present an intelligent and reconfigurable wireless physical layer (PHY) that dynamically adjusts the transmission parameters for a given radio frequency (RF) environment. The proposed PHY is based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and can dynamically augment OFDM with a finite impulse response (FIR) low-pass filter to improve the out-of-band emissions (OOBE). To make these adaptations intelligently, we employ multiarmed bandit (MAB)-based online learning algorithms, specifically upper confidence bound with control variate (UCB-CV). UCB-CV enhances traditional UCB by incorporating additional information such as interference level and transmit power, allowing it to manage interference more effectively. These algorithms are integrated into the PHY of an FPGA-based OFDM transceiver on the Zynq system-on-chip (SoC), facilitating real-time decision-making based on side-channel interference and other parameters. Our comparative analysis highlights the enhanced performance of the UCB-CV algorithm over the traditional UCB in terms of reducing the bit-error rate (BER) and managing interference more effectively. Unlike the traditional UCB, UCB-CV leverages side information through a control variate approach, incorporating the coefficient of variation (CV) into reward estimation to better handle interference. Additionally, we underline the advantages of filtered-OFDM (FOFDM) compared to standard OFDM. Notably, FOFDM significantly reduces OOBE by 20&#8211;75 dBW/Hz and improves BER. In environments with high interference, UCB-CV achieves a throughput improvement of 29.54% compared to UCB.</description></item><item><title>A 25-GHz PLL Achieving 8-ns Phase-Shifting Time With Double-Path Modulation Scheme</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10876796</link><description>This article presents a reference phase-shifting architecture (PSA) based on a phase-locked loop (PLL) and a digital-to-time converter (DTC). The double-path phase modulation scheme (DPMS) is proposed to accelerate the settling time of the reference PSA. Off-chip calibration is added to mitigate the effects of nonlinearity in the DPMS process. Additionally, a DTC with improved retiming is proposed to reduce phase-shifting errors. The reference PSA with the DPMS is designed and fabricated in a commercial 22-nm CMOS technology. It occupies 0.048-mm2 active area and 12.8-mW dc power consumption. It achieves a 360&#176; phase tuning range with a resolution of 1.26&#176; at 24.75 GHz. The rms and peak phase errors are 1.38&#176; and 2.6&#176;, respectively. With the proposed DPMS, the settling time of reference PSA is significantly reduced from more than  $1~\mu $  s to less than 10 ns. Moreover, the PLL with DTC features a phase noise of &#8722;112.1 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset from 24.75 GHz and a 79.7-fs jitter integrated from 10 kHz to 30 MHz with 250-MHz reference clock. The figure of merits (FoMs) of jitter versus power for the proposed PLL with and without DTC are &#8722;250.9 and &#8722;251.4 dB, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Revisiting Multiple ECC on High-Density NAND Flash memory</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947224</link><description>Three-dimensional nand flash memory using the advanced multibit-per-cell technique is widely adopted due to its high density. However, it faces the problem of deteriorating read performance and energy consumption due to decreased reliability. Low-density parity-check code (LDPC) is typically adopted as an error correction code (ECC) to encode data and provide fault tolerance. To reduce the cost, LDPC with a high code rate is always adopted. However, LDPC will lead to read retry operations when the accessed data are not successfully decoded, and such retry-induced performance degradation is serious, especially for modern high-density flash memory. In this work, a reliability-aware differential ECC (READECC) approach is proposed to reduce redundancy protection and storage cost of LDPC with a low code rate and optimize the read performance. The basic idea is to adopt LDPC with a suitable code rate considering both data access characteristics and flash reliability characteristics. First, hot reads are identified based on the frequency of being accessed. Second, based on the reliability variation characteristics, the life of flash memory is divided into three reliability periods. As the reliability period shifts, the code rate of the LDPC adjusts adaptively to minimize redundancy protection. Third, an adaptive-sized logical page approach is further proposed to support LDPC with strong error correction capability (a low code rate) with a low storage cost. Through careful design and evaluation on 3-D triple-level-cell nand flash memory, READECC achieves encouraging optimizations with a negligible cost.</description></item><item><title>A Robust Computing-in-Memory Macro With 2T1R1C Cells and Reused Capacitors for Successive-Approximation ADC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10905048</link><description>Computing-in-memory (CIM) has emerged as a practical paradigm to bypass the von Neumann bottleneck. However, traditional CIM schemes face challenges due to the nonideal characteristics of nonvolatile memory (NVM). To address this issue, this work provides a resistive random access memory (RRAM)-based CIM macro employing two-transistor-one-RRAM&#8211;one-capacitor (2T1R1C) cells, with capacitors reused for the successive-approximation analog-to-digital converter (SAR ADC). Single-level RRAM is utilized to mitigate resistance variation. The multiply-accumulate (MAC) operation is performed via the charge and discharge of capacitors, enhancing robustness across different process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) corners. The capacitors in 2T1R1C cells are repurposed as sampling capacitors to integrate the ADC with the array. A precision-adjustable SAR (PA-SAR) logic is proposed to generate partial sums at varying precision levels aligned with different input bits, optimizing energy efficiency while maintaining reliability. Our proposed 2T1R1C array features an average area of  $3.403~\mu $ m2 for each cell, which accounts for 87.46% of the total macro area. The total macro area is 1.020 mm2 with a capacity of 256 Kb, achieving an energy density of 0.201 TOPS/mm2. The PA-SAR logic boosts energy efficiency to 44.71 TOPS/W, marking a 38.55% improvement over conventional full-precision schemes.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient FPGA Implementation of Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10922212</link><description>Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) plays an important role in modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems, being extensively utilized in search engines, advertising, and recommendation systems. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), ANNS is increasingly finding applications in edge scenarios such as personal assistants. The demand for efficient and fast ANNS solutions is, therefore, more pressing than ever. In this article, we propose a scalable and efficient field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation of ANNS based on the inverted file with product quantization (IVF-PQ) algorithm, thus marking the first hardware implementation supporting up to 1024-D datasets. First, we devise a novel architecture for the Top-K module, capable of processing multiple input data streams simultaneously and linearly increasing throughput.

In this article, we introduce a novel side-channel vulnerability that leaks data-dependent power variations through physical layer supply voltage coupling (PSVC). Unlike traditional power side-channel attacks, the proposed vulnerability allows an adversary to mount an attack and extract information without modifying the device. In addition, unlike existing power-based remote attacks on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), the PSVC vulnerability applies to both on-chip and on-board attacks. We assess the effectiveness of the PSVC vulnerability through three case studies, demonstrating several end-to-end attacks on general-purpose microcontrollers with varying adversary capabilities. These case studies provide evidence for the existence of the PSVC vulnerability, its applicability to on-chip as well as on-board side-channel attacks, and how it can eliminate the need for physical access to the target device, making it applicable to any off-the-shelf hardware. Our experiments also reveal that designing devices to operate at the lowest operational voltage significantly reduces the risk of PSVC side-channel vulnerability.</description></item><item><title>Sense and React: Self-Destructive Polymorphic Mechanism Against Voltage Tampered Active Physical Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981798</link><description>Secrets such as cryptographic keys and obfuscation keys are used in modern computing systems to protect the sensitive and private information as well as intellectual property (IP). During typical operations, they are stored in volatile memories, e.g., registers and SRAMs, which are vulnerable to active physical attacks whereby environmental parameters such as temperature, system clock, and supply voltage, are manipulated to extract information. A common way to protect assets against such attacks are sensors that detect active physical attacks and trigger the destruction of secrets. Often, this requires several thousand clock cycles to accomplish. On top of that, the detection and destruction mechanisms are implemented as separate circuitry, which can be identified and disabled by an attacker. In this article, active physical attacks based on supply voltage manipulation are considered. Storage elements, specifically latches and registers, are designed to change their behavior with supply voltage manipulation and automatically destroy their stored data in an integrated sense and response countermeasure. The ability of an electronic circuit to change its behavior under different environmental conditions is known as polymorphism and such circuits are called polymorphic circuits. In the proposed designs, a genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize polymorphic gates designed using two separate approaches, namely, multithreshold null convention logic (MTNCL) and voltage-controlled polymorphism termed in this article as Non-MTNCL. These polymorphic gates are used to design polymorphic latches and registers and both approaches are compared using power, performance, area overhead, reliability criteria, and application in cryptographic benchmarks. It is observed that while the GA-optimized MTNCL-based implementation has 75% less area overhead, the GA-optimized Non-MTNCL implementation is 14% more reliable according to simulation results. Apart from the simulations, proof-of-concept is further provided with an FPGA implementation.</description></item><item><title>ResiLogic: Leveraging Composability and Diversity to Design Fault and Intrusion Resilient Chips</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10934979</link><description>A long-standing challenge is the design of chips resilient to faults and glitches. Both fine-grained gate diversity and coarse-grained modular redundancy have been used in the past. However, these approaches have not been well-studied under other threat models where some stakeholders in the supply chain are untrusted. Increasing digital sovereignty tensions raise concerns regarding the use of foreign off-the-shelf tools and intellectual property (IP), or off-sourcing fabrication, driving research into the design of resilient chips under this threat model. This article addresses a threat model considering three pertinent attacks to resilience: distribution, zonal, and compound attacks. To mitigate these attacks, we introduce the ResiLogic framework that exploits Diversity by Composability: constructing diverse circuits composed of smaller diverse ones by design. This approach enables designers to develop circuits in the early stages of design without the need for additional redundancy in terms of space or cost. To generate diverse circuits, we propose a technique using E-Graphs with new rewrite definitions for diversity. Using this approach at different levels of granularity is shown to improve the resilience of circuit design in ResiLogic up to  $\times 5$  against the three considered attacks.</description></item><item><title>An Energy-Efficient FPGA Accelerator for Swin Transformer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10900605</link><description>Recently, transformers have shown strong performance in tasks such as computer vision and natural language processing.

On system level, a delay-based load-adaptive V $_{\text {ON}}$  generator is exploited in LASM at ultralight load. When the output ripple is kept below its maximum restriction, the switching loss of the converter is further minimized in LASM compared with prior operation modes, including PFM, pulse-skip modulation (PSM), multiple-sawtooth PWM (MSPWM), and deep green mode (DGM). On circuit level, a dynamic-biased dual-offset hysteresis comparator is proposed. Together with other blocks that can be disabled, the quiescent consumption of controller in LASM is reduced to only 14  $\mu $ W. Fabricated in a 130-nm BCD process, the proposed converter can provide a 1.8-V output with a power density of 4.11 W/mm2.

The generated layout must not only adhere to design rules but also exhibit optimized performance in terms of factors such as delay, power, area, and cost. However, prior works often rely on metrics that fail to consider the layout-dependent effects (LDEs). Furthermore, evaluating the actual performance using commercial tools can be excessively time-consuming, especially when iteratively optimizing cell layouts. Therefore, this work proposes a new machine-learning(ML)-based ranking model to enable rapid performance ranking between layout candidates of standard cells. This model incorporates all LDEs in feature extraction, generating an ordered list of cell layouts, and evaluating only the top-K candidates for performance. The experiments show that this approach successfully identifies the optimal layout from ten benchmark cells, which are most used in intellectual property (IP) cores, in a sub-5 nm fin field-effect transistor (FinFET) industrial standard cell library, achieving a  $348\times $  speedup over the conventional flow.</description></item><item><title>Metastable-Dither-Based Digital Background Calibration of Interstage Gain Nonlinearity in Pipelined SAR ADC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10929642</link><description>A digital background calibration technique is proposed in this brief, utilizing comparator metastability to correct conversion errors from interstage gain errors and higher order nonlinearities for the first time.

The feed-forward path employs a pre-amplifier, hysteresis-detector, and differential charge pumps, while the linear path includes a recycling folded-cascode amplifier. An analysis is performed to study the amplifier&#8217;s settling error with and without the feed-forward path, and also the trade-off between the dead-zone width of the hysteresis detector and the amplifier&#8217;s settling speed. The assisted feed-forward path has improved the slew rate  $\times 2.5$ &#8211;800 V/ $\mu $ s, effective GBW by 15%, and dc gain by 16 dB at the expense of adding  $187.5~\mu $ A extra current consumption and  $1.25~\mu $ m2 extra silicon area. To prove the concept, the proposed amplifier is used as a multiplying digital-to-analog converter (MDAC) amplifier of an 8-bit pipeline analog-to-digital converter (ADC), and the ADC is fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process. The results reveal that the spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) and signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) performances are improved by 6&#8211;7 dB in the presence of the feed-forward path.</description></item><item><title>How to Keep Pushing ML Accelerator Performance?

The tile uses commercial materials, fabrication, and assembly techniques while relaxing printed circuit board (PCB) requirements by eliminating D-band routing. This is accomplished by fully integrating the D-band signal generation, amplification, phase shifting, and antenna coupling structures onto the chip. The phase shifting is accomplished without requiring I/Q generation using the on-chip frequency multipliers. The on-chip power amplifiers (PAs) directly excite off-chip patch antennas via aperture coupling from the chip to the PCB, avoiding the need for costly transitions off-chip. The tile is aligned and assembled with the antenna using flip-chip bonding, which also provides all the low-frequency interconnects for the chip. A  ${2} {\times } {4}$  array using two of the tiles, demonstrating the scalability of the system, achieves a narrow inter-chip element spacing of  $0.6{\lambda }$  at 140 GHz, a peak effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of +23.5 dBm, and a scan range of &#177;40&#176; while dissipating 77 mW per element.</description></item><item><title>Sub- &#956; W Battery-Less and Oscillator-Less Wi-Fi Backscattering Transmitter Reusing RF Signal for Harvesting, Communications, and Motion Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10758438</link><description>In this article, a sub-microwatt power 802.11b backscattering transmitter is presented to enable the reuse of the same incident wave for three purposes: RF harvesting, backscattering communications, and position/motion sensing. The removal of the battery and any off-chip motion sensor (e.g., MEMS) enables an unprecedented level of miniaturization and ubiquity, unrestricted device lifespan, and low fabrication and maintenance cost. The microwatt power wall for Wi-Fi transmitters is broken for the first time via local oscillator elimination, as achieved by extracting its frequency through second-order intermodulation of a two-tone incident wave. The two-tone scheme also enables a cumulative harvesting/transmission/sensing sensitivity down to  ${P_{\min }}~{\sim }- 19 $  dBm. Position/motion sensing is enabled by using the harvested voltage as a proxy for the received signal strength (RSS), allowing to sense the chip location with respect to the tone generator(s) shared across tags in indoor neighborhoods.</description></item><item><title>A 48&#8211;56 GHz &gt;1 dBm-HB1dB Sub-Sampling Eight-Path-Filter Receiver With Fully-Integrated LO Generation and On-Chip Antenna</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10742625</link><description>This article presents a 48&#8211;56 GHz mixer-first fourth-harmonic sub-sampling eight-path-filter receiver integrating an on-chip differential dipole antenna, a six-port hybrid coupler, and an eight-phase 12.5-duty-cycle local oscillator (LO) generator with phase and duty-cycle calibration. A sub-sampling gapped eight-path-filter configuration is proposed to relax LO operating frequency and rise/fall time requirements so that LO power consumption can be reduced significantly.

The S2D topology eliminates the need for a lossy balun in the input matching network, resulting in an inherent improvement of the achievable noise figure (NF). The proposed four-stage LNA is implemented based on high-gain and wideband  $G_{\max }$ -cores. For a compact realization, the first-stage single-ended (SE)  $G_{\max }$ -core uses lumped elements (L-C-L) within its embedding network. In addition, a pseudo-simultaneous noise and input matching (p-SNIM) technique is used to mitigate the tradeoff between gain and noise characteristics. Differential wideband  $G_{\max }$ -cores in the subsequent stages use a coupled-line-based embedding network (CLEN) without any explicit capacitors. It helps simplify the dc biasing and generally enhances the tolerance to process variations with a compact form factor. Implemented in a 40-nm CMOS technology, the proposed LNA achieves a peak power gain of 20.0 dB, a 3-dB bandwidth of 18.8 GHz, a minimum NF of 4.9 dB, and a maximum OP1dB/IP1dB of &#8722;7.7/&#8722;22.4 dBm, respectively, while dissipating dc power of 19.6 mW.

A cancellation-based OOK modulator is proposed to support high-speed modulation. The transmitter (TX) includes one compact sub-terahertz (sub-THz) fundamental frequency voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) to reduce power consumption. The receiver (RX) with an adaptive demodulator design and load-optimized single-ended to differential converting active balun supports the high-speed noncoherent demodulation. The proposed sub-THz package scheme solves the high-cost issues brought by the conventional complex package process, which favors efficient sub-THz system integration. The communication link has demonstrated transmission data rates up to 26-Gb/s using OOK modulation over a 1-cm long over-the-air (OTA) distance with a bit error rate (BER) of  $1 {\times }10{^{-12}}$  and consumes 162 mW (TX: 99 mW and RX: 63 mW) of power under a 0.9-V supply, achieving a 6.3-pJ/bit energy efficiency. A polymer microwave fiber (PMF) communication link is also presented in this work. The communication distance is extended to 4 m by inserting a dielectric waveguide (DWG) channel between the same chipset.

To obtain reliable depth information, a backside-illuminated  $6{\times } 6~{\mu }$  m pinned photodiode (PPD) pixel with high built-in electric field is used to accelerate charge transfer. Storage diodes (SDs) are designed to collect demodulated electrons for correlated double sampling (CDS) readout. The two-tap pixel and differential multiplexing readout architecture realize both image modes (2-D and 3-D) working with full-HD resolution. To overcome the limitation of quantization speed in conventional structures, we introduce a 4-bit time-to-digital converter (TDC) into the 8-bit SSADC for residual information quantization, achieving 3- $\mu $  s row-time and 12-bit readout accuracy. In addition, we have proposed a detection and correction circuit in the data stitching process, which resolves error code problem. The common-mode output of two different taps is removed through full differential readout for the background light (BGL) canceling. A prototype chip is fabricated in a 110-nm backside illumination CMOS image sensor (BSI CIS) process. The designed PPD enabled a low depth noise of under 0.43% over the range of 0.3&#8211;1.5 m, with a modulation frequency of 100 MHz.

The ASIC implements a novel energy-efficient high-voltage (HV) pulser that generates HV transmit (TX) pulses directly from a low-voltage (LV) battery supply. By means of a single off-chip inductor, energy is supplied to a US transducer in a resonant fashion, directly generating half-period sinusoidal HV pulses on the transducer, while consuming substantially less energy than a conventional class-D pulser. By recycling residual reactive energy from the transducer back to the input, the energy consumption is further reduced by more than 50%. The autocalibration techniques are leveraged to deal with tolerances of the inductor, transducer, and battery supply and thus maximize the energy efficiency. A prototype chip was fabricated in TSMC 0.18- $\mu $ m HV BCD technology and used to drive external 120-pF capacitive micromachined US transducers (CMUTs) with a center frequency of approximately 2.5 MHz.

Hall sensors are commonly used due to their compatibility with the standard CMOS process but suffer from poor 3-D sensitivity and consume high power. Here, we present the first-of-its-kind 3-D ac magnetic sensor in the CMOS process with high-resolution and ultralow-power operation. The sensor is comprised of three orthogonal and highly dense metal coils (X, Y, and Z) implemented in the 65-nm node, which generate a voltage in response to ac magnetic fields by electromagnetic induction. The X and Y sensor coils are realized in the vertical plane of the CMOS chip by using interconnect vias as part of the coil structure, while the Z sensor is realized in the horizontal plane. The induced voltage by the three coils is processed by a low-noise instrumentation amplifier (IA), sharp bandpass filter (BPF), programmable gain amplifier (PGA), differential peak detect and hold circuit, 12-bit successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC), and serializer. The entire circuitry consumes only  $14.8~{\mu }$ W to yield  $\mu $ T-level resolution.

By employing a continuous-time (CT) SAR to track the input signal, the design avoids the kT/C noise typically induced by sampling operations. This approach decouples the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from the size of the sampling capacitor, thus relaxing the burden of the input and reference buffers. The CT SAR is followed by a two-stage floating-inverter-amplifier (FIA)-based closed-loop residue amplifier (RA) with a 94.6-dB open-loop gain, effectively mitigating interstage gain error. Furthermore, the CT-DT NS SAR exhibits high energy efficiency and fully dynamic characteristics due to the proposed RA and the second-stage DT NS SAR. Fabricated in a 55-nm CMOS process, the prototype achieves a signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) of 93.6 dB with only a 120-fF single-ended input capacitor at a signal bandwidth of 5 kHz. Operating at a 1-MHz operating rate, the prototype consumes  $34.7~{\mu }$ W from a 1.2-V supply, resulting in a Schreier figure of merit (FoM) of 175.2 dB.</description></item><item><title>Dual-Input Stacked Inverter-Based Single-Ended DRAM Sense Amplifier Using BL Switches for Low-Power High-Speed Sensing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10747369</link><description>Dynamic random access memory (DRAM) sensing capabilities have deteriorated with the reduced supply voltage and cell capacitance as the DRAM process scales down. Previous bitline sense amplifiers (BLSAs) use offset-canceling (OC) techniques based on capacitive coupling or current mirrors. However, these OC techniques induce substantial static power during the OC phase due to the transistors operating in the saturation region. In addition, the previous offset-canceling techniques have to precede charge sharing, resulting in additional timing overhead. Furthermore, the previous BLSAs suffer from a large area due to two capacitors, high sensitivity to ambient noise, and imbalanced sensing problems, which impedes them from being utilized for the highly scaled DRAM process. This article proposes a dual-input stacked inverter-based single-ended sense amplifier (DISA) to achieve improved sensing capability with reduced energy consumption, small area, and high speed. The dual-input stacked inverter in DISA significantly reduces the static current during both OC and main sensing phases while improving inverter gain. In addition, DISA achieves the smallest area compared to the previous BLSAs because of the use of a single capacitor in the single-ended structure. The simultaneous offset canceling and charge sharing also contribute to the fast sensing operation of DISA. According to the measurement on the experimental chip fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS technology, DISA achieves the shortest sensing time of &lt;9 ns and the lowest sensing energy of 5.8 fJ/cycle/bit under 0.7-V  $V_{\text {DD}}$ .</description></item><item><title>A DPD/Dither-Free DPLL Based on a Cascaded Fractional Divider and Pseudo-Differential DTCs Achieving a &#8212;62.1-dBc Fractional Spur</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10729860</link><description>This article presents a 7-GHz fractional-N digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) without any digital pre-distortion (DPD) on the integral nonlinearity (INL) of the digital-to-time converter (DTC) or dither. Utilizing a cascaded fractional divider, the fractional spur offset frequency can be shifted beyond the PLL bandwidth, resulting in less fractional spur degradation at near-integer channels. A pseudo-differential DTC (PD-DTC) technique that can cancel the even-symmetric nonlinearity components is also employed to achieve a better suppression of the fractional spur. Thanks to the aforementioned two techniques, a &#8722;62.1-dBc worst-case fractional spur can be achieved without degrading the in-band PLL phase noise (PN) or PLL locking time. Occupying 0.23-mm2 area in a 65-nm CMOS process, this PLL can achieve a 143.7-fs integrated jitter with a 100-MHz reference frequency and 8.89-mW power consumption, which translates to a figure-of-merit (FoM) of &#8722;247.4 dB.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Jitter Fractional- N Digital PLL Adopting a Reverse-Concavity Variable-Slope DTC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10706601</link><description>This article presents a fractional-N digital-to-time converter (DTC)-based digital phase-locked loop (PLL), achieving simultaneously low phase noise and low spurious tones.

The proposed hTDC substitutes digital counters and logic in the timing generator (TG) in the previous hTDC with analog counterparts comprising a time-to-analog converter (TAC) and a self-referenced successive approximation register analog-to-digital converter (SAR ADC). It supports the two-step zoom hTDC functionality based on the SA-hTDC for the coarse step and the indirect time-of-flight (iToF) technique for the fine step. The proposed architecture minimizes the need for high-frequency clocks, resulting in an impressively low pixel power consumption of  $3.1~{\mu }$ W per pixel. In addition, by placing the capacitors underneath the SPAD device, the pixel pitch is scaled down to  $35~{\mu }$ m. The self-referenced SAR ADC mitigates PVT variations in the analog TG and suppresses the pixel-to-pixel nonuniformities in the conversion slope of the TAC. The D-latches in the depth memory are repurposed to store and read the 4-b coarse ToF sequentially and the 10-b digital output of the single-slope (SS) ADC from the fine operation. The prototype LiDAR sensor with a  $160 {\times } 120$  pixel array was fabricated in a 0.11- $\mu $ m CMOS image sensor (CIS) process.

The proposed hTDC utilizes a two-step approach to combine a coarse step using the successive approximation (SA) method and a fine step based on phase-delay calculation akin to the indirect ToF (iToF) technique, achieving a resolution of 200 ps. Compared to the conventional digital counters, the proposed analog counter replaced with histogram memories attains a substantial power reduction of 3300-fold under 80-klx illumination. The analog counter consumes only 8 nW for in-pixel histogramming operation and occupies 6.5% of the hTDC area. Furthermore, an in-pixel self-referenced single-slope analog-to-digital converter (SS-ADC) is devised to mitigate the vulnerability of the analog counter to PVT variations. This SS-ADC can suppress the pixel-to-pixel gain variation, suppressing the non-uniformities of counters. The timing generator (TG) of each pixel, which originally generates the time gate window, has been reconfigured to serve as a 10-bit counter for A/D conversion. The prototype LiDAR sensor with a  $100{\times }80$  pixel array was fabricated in a 0.11- $\mu $  m CMOS image sensor (CIS) process. The coarse TDC has a resolution of 75 cm and can achieve a detection range of up to 24 m with less than one LSB error over all measurements. Under indoor conditions, the coarse and fine TDC measures the depth accuracy and precision of 4.8 and 2.8 cm, respectively, within the 6&#8211;7.5-m range.</description></item><item><title>A Fully Integrated Electrostatic Charge Boosting Rectifier for Triboelectric Energy Harvesting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10729856</link><description>The various application scenarios of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) have attracted increasing research interest, while one of the biggest challenges is the energy extraction efficiency. Due to the small and time-varying inherent capacitor in a TENG, the previous energy extraction techniques e.g., full-bridge rectifier (FBR) and bias-flip (BF) rectifier, performed not well. To extract more energy from TENG, this article proposed a fully integrated switched-capacitor (SC) rectifier with an electrostatic charge boosting (ECB) technique, achieving simultaneous extraction from the synchronized triboelectric energy and self-excited electrostatic energy. The proposed rectifier was fabricated in a 180-nm BCD process. With the proposed ECB technique, the theoretical analysis and measurements show a quadratically increasing output power with respect to the rectification voltage, attaining a constant maximum power point (MPP) at the breakdown voltage of the circuit. A maximum output power of  $127.6~{\mu }$  W is measured with a TENG fabricated in-house. Compared to a passive FBR, the proposed rectifier enhances the output power by 14 times.</description></item><item><title>A 65-nm Proactive Power Management Technique With Real-Time Machine Learning Engine for Droop Prediction and Mitigation on Microprocessors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10742645</link><description>A proactive power management (PM) scheme for mitigating dynamic supply droop is proposed with a fully integrated buck converter, an RISC-V CPU core, a real-time machine learning engine (MLE), and a safety droop guardband.

The MLE is used to predict the supply droop on a cycle-by-cycle basis for proactive supply regulation from the integrated buck converter through a fast PWM modulation of the power switches. In addition, to deal with the misprediction of MLE and other long-term supply droops that cannot be captured by MLE, a safety droop guardband is implemented to secure the integrity of the supply voltage. The proposed proactive scheme has been implemented on a 65-nm test chip and demonstrated up to 9.9% higher CPU frequency or 9.2% higher power efficiency compared with prior fast digital LDO schemes.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Path Inductor-First Inductor-on-Ground Switched-Capacitor Hybrid DC-DC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10742623</link><description>Energy-efficient compact smart devices operate at a supply voltage as low as 0.5 V, powered by either a battery (3&#8211;4.2 V) or a universal serial bus (USB) port (5 V), demanding a voltage conversion ratio (VCR) as large as 10:1. This work proposes a multi-path inductor-first inductor-on-ground switched-capacitor (L2SC) hybrid buck dc-dc converter for large VCR and high-power density. The inductors on the input and the ground nodes combine and reuse the parasitic inductors from PCB routing and bonding wire, enable a continuous input current, and relieve the electromagnetic interference (EMI) issue.

The proposed converter consists of four low-voltage power switches and one flying capacitor ( $C_{\text {F}}$ ). Unlike the conventional buck-boost converters (CBBCs) that employ two power switches in series with an inductor, this converter uses only one. The  $C_{\text {F}}$ , which is paralleled with the inductor (L), facilitates charge transfer to the output capacitor in the buck mode and distributes input current in the boost mode. This configuration significantly reduces inductor current across the entire input voltage ( $V_{\text {IN}}$ ) range. By leveraging the low-voltage stress of power switches and reduced current stress of inductor, the conduction loss (CDL) of the power switches is reduced by up to 64% compared with other studies with equivalent silicon areas. The converter was fabricated with a  $0.18~{\mu }$ m bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD) process using only 5-V devices. Measurement results show that the converter achieves a peak efficiency of 98.6% with a small dc resistance (DCR) of 8 m $\Omega $  and maintains a peak efficiency of 97.3% with a larger DCR of 170 m $\Omega $ . Moreover, the converter achieves an on-die current density of 1.47 A/mm2.</description></item><item><title>A Time-Domain Current-Mode Buck Converter With a PI Compensator Incorporating an Infinite Phase Shift Delay Line</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10742657</link><description>This article presents a current-mode buck converter that incorporates two control paths implemented using time-domain (TD) signal processing.

As data rates and the number of stacked TSVs increase, signal integrity is significantly degraded at low-voltage operation due to the following factors: insufficient timing margins in serializer and equalizer, insufficient eye-margin in TSV signaling, and clock (CK) mismatches. To ensure sufficient timing margins, a 4:1 multiplexing (MUX) output driver with an overlapped MUX (OVM) technique is adopted in the transmitter (TX). To improve eye-margin, a hybrid equalizer and direct-feedback one-tap decision feedback equalizer (DFE) are adopted in the TX and receiver (RX), respectively. CK mismatches are calibrated through the proposed QEC. A 12-stacked TSVs channel is emulated using six metal layers in the 65 nm CMOS process. The measured energy efficiency is 0.137&#8211;0.145 pJ/b/pF at 8&#8211;15 Gb/s data rates, respectively, with 0.6&#8211;0.7 V supply voltage.</description></item><item><title>ED-MPIM: An Energy-Efficient Event-Driven Smart Vision SoC With High-Linearity and Reconfigurable MRAM PIM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10714470</link><description>This study introduces an event-driven smart vision system-on-chip (SoC) using a reconfigurable and high-linearity magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) processing-in-memory (PIM) architecture.

To resolve the issue, this article proposes a low-power redundant transition-free flip-flop with reduced latency. It can reduce the latency by reconfiguring the primary stage to let it capture the input data directly. The proposed flip-flop can minimize dynamic power consumption by efficiently removing all redundant transitions. By adopting a full-static and contention-free structure, it can also provide robust operation. The proposed flip-flop was fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process. The performance evaluation indicates that the proposed flip-flop achieves 26.0% and 21.5% DQ latency reductions from recent low-power flip-flops such as single-phase contention-free flip-flop (S2CFF) and REFF, respectively. It also indicates that the power consumption is reduced by 51.2% at 10% switching activity when compared with transmission-gate flip-flop (TGFF), a traditional primary-secondary flip-flop. Contributed by reduced latency and power consumption, the power-delay-product (PDP) of the proposed flip-flop is improved by 53.6%, 44.7%, and 17.1% when compared with TGFF, S2CFF, and REFF, respectively.

PQC algorithms exhibit considerable diversity in their underlying mathematical problems, storage requirements, and computational patterns, thus complicating unified PQC architecture design. To address this issue, a unified PQC domain-specific accelerator (DSA), post-quantum processing unit (PQPU), is proposed to address the trade-off between performance and flexibility at the algorithm, architecture, and circuit levels.

However, the extensive use of nonlinear operations, like softmax, poses a performance bottleneck during transformer inference and comprises up to 40% of the total latency. Hence, we propose innovations at the circuit, algorithm and architecture levels to accelerate the transformer. At the circuit level, we propose Topkima&#8212;combining top-k activation selection with in-memory ADC (IMA) to implement efficient softmax without any sorting overhead. Only the k largest activations are sent to softmax calculation block, reducing the huge computational cost of softmax. At the algorithmic level, a modified training scheme utilizes top-k activations only during the forward pass, combined with a sub-top-k method to address the crossbar size limitation by aggregating each sub-top-k values as global top-k. At the architecture level, we introduce a fine pipeline for efficiently scheduling data flows and an improved scale-free technique for removing scaling cost. The combined system, dubbed Topkima-Former, enhances  $1.8\times -84\times $  speedup and  $1.2\times -36\times $  energy efficiency (EE) over prior In-memory computing (IMC) accelerators. Compared to a conventional softmax macro and a digital top-k (Dtopk) softmax macro, our proposed Topkima softmax macro achieves about  $15\times $  and  $8\times $  faster speed respectively.

However, previous researches have primarily concentrated on super-regenerative amplifiers/oscillators, leading to limited insights into SRRs with inappropriate assumptions or dispensable operations, such as synchronous quench and baseband oversampling. This paper presents an improved general theory of super-regenerative reception in the linear mode that provides more design insights for digital communication. By analyzing the time-domain model of a general super-regenerative circuit, we derived a comprehensive frequency-domain model based on a convolution method, through which a concept of signal-lobe transfer function is introduced. Based on the proposed model, the effects of quench jitter and residual phenomenon are analyzed. Furthermore, an asynchronous quench method is introduced, which eliminates the requirement of synchronization between the modulated symbol and the quench signal, thus reducing the system complexity. To eliminate the baseband oversampling, especially for high-speed communications, main-lobe filtering and sub-sampling techniques are also proposed. To verify this general theory and proposed techniques, two SRRs with main-lobe filtering and sub-sampling were designed with ideal components and simulated using Cadence Virtuoso. The simulation results of two SRRs match with the proposed model very well. Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of super-regenerative reception for digital communication and offers valuable insights into its potentials and limitations.</description></item><item><title>A High-Efficiency RFEH System With Feedback-Free Fast (F3) MPPT Over a Wide Input Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10896882</link><description>This paper presents a high-efficiency, wide-input power range ambient Radio Frequency Energy Harvester (RFEH) system, which comprises an adaptive 4-mode impedance matching network (IMN), a single-stage cross-coupled differential-drive (CCDD) rectifier, a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) circuit, and a power manager unit (PMU).

The miniaturization and enhanced performance of the radiator is achieved through co-designing a ring oscillator and a multifunctional antenna. The multi-stage ring oscillator features a variable common-source (CS) stage, which is proposed to achieve a broad frequency tuning range. To enhance the performance of the proposed variable CS stage for terahertz (THz) oscillator, wideband load impedances for all harmonics are theoretically analyzed and recursively optimized.

This paper proposes an input phase control mechanism together with a cooperative asymmetric out-phased current load modulation technique. The cooperative asymmetric out-phased current load modulation can extend the output back-off range (OBO). The input phase control mechanism together with modified impedance transforming load modulation networks (LMNs) is used to widen the DPA bandwidth.

These wideband BPFs feature broadband quasi-reflectionless behavior along with quasi-constant group-delay responses beyond their associated 3-dB-bandwidth (BW) ranges. Firstly. by means of a  $\pi $ -shape network composed of a reflective first-order BPF and two shunt identical lossy bandstop filters (BSFs), a two-port-absorptive RF BPF is engineered. To further increase the stopband attenuation levels, the extension of this filter concept to higher-rejection BPFs using n cascaded reflective single-pole BPF units and ( ${n} +1$ ) replicas of a shunt lossy BSF is then approached. Subsequently, in order to equip such BPFs with higher-selectivity filtering responses, the development of input- and two-port-reflectionless BPFs with multiple transmission zeros (TZs) is addressed. Moreover, a multi-TZ flat-group-delay BPF with input-absorptive behavior is devised. It exploits a reflective BPF channel, which is shaped by a high-selectivity BPF unit with two close-to-passband TZs and a shunt series-LC resonator that produces an additional TZ, along with a shunt absorptive BSF in a complementary-diplexer-based topology. Finally, by cascading two duplicated high-selectivity BPFs and the associated absorptive BSFs with a modified shunt series-LC resonator in a back-to-back connection, a type of two-port-reflectionless BPF with multiple TZs is further engineered. Following this approach, a modified shunt lossy BSF instead of the previous shunt series-LC resonator is employed in the overall reflectionless BPF to obtain a sharper-rejection passband and flatter group delay versus the corresponding beyond-3-dB BW. The RF operational foundations of these absorptive BPFs are detailed with analyses of their relevant lumped-element-based equivalent circuits. Furthermore, proof-of-concept prototypes for the five suggested RF BPFs are simulated, built, and measured to experimentally validate their design concepts for application in power-efficient high-data-rate digital-communication systems.</description></item><item><title>A VM-Terminated PAM-3 Transmitter Using Floating Middle Level With Enhanced Signal Integrity and Energy Efficiency for Low-Power Memory Interfaces</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10938983</link><description>This paper introduces a three-level pulse amplitude modulation single-ended transmitter using VM (half of  $\text{V}_{\mathrm {DDQ}}$ ) termination, designed for next-generation low-power memory interfaces. The proposed signaling strategy, based on the VM termination, improves signal integrity by reducing signaling current by 41.05% while maintaining the same voltage swing compared to existing VSS-terminated structures for low-power memory interfaces. This reduction in signaling current effectively decreases simultaneous switching output noise. Additionally, this approach alleviates the voltage headroom limitation and enables pre-emphasis adoption, resulting in a larger voltage swing and reduced power consumption compared to de-emphasis. The voltage difference between the drain and source of each pull-up and pull-down driver is balanced, achieving a good ratio of level mismatch (RLM). Moreover, the three-step ZQ calibration and transmission gate-based receiver-side VM termination help achieve accurate on-resistance and improve output linearity, reducing signal reflection.

However, it involves numerous complex operations, including large-bit-width multiplication, division, matrix transposition, and exponentiation. These require substantial storage and computational resources, making it challenging to deploy on edge devices. This work introduces a neuromorphic transformer architecture with low hardware cost for AI edge computing (AI-EC). At the structural level, it absorbs scaling factors within the self-attention mechanism into weight matrixes, thereby eliminating the division caused by the scaling operation. Additionally, a transposition calculation method is proposed to perform matrix transposition using dedicated memory access strategies and optimized data flow designs, which reduces logic resource overhead and avoids memory access discontinuities. At the computing paradigm level, the architecture employs spike-driven computing, substituting multi-bit multipliers with AND logic for synaptic operations.

This study investigates the implementation of the 3D-Morris Lecar neuronal system, known as Digital Optimized Morris Lecar (DOML), in circuits to characterize the magnetic induction flow induced by neuron membrane potential. By employing a combination of trigonometric functions, hyperbolic functions, power-2 based terms, and LUT-based modules, a high-performance circuit is achieved through the best approximation methods. The model&#8217;s effectiveness is verified through validation techniques and error analysis, demonstrating a low-error mechanism due to the approximation of nonlinear functions and the avoidance of multipliers, dividers, and high-cost terms. By utilizing the proposed DOML method in digital synthesized circuits, a potential reduction of up to 37% in FPGA hardware resource cost and a potential speed increase of up to 5 times are achievable. The models were digitally synthesized using the Xilinx FPGA Virtex-4 board for cost-frequency validation, showing that the proposed model outperforms the original ML3D model while preserving its essential characteristics. The novelty of this approach lies in applying the combined approximation methods to create a cost-effective circuit suitable for biological systems, offering high speed and low cost attributes. Then, this basic circuit is applied in a sample Network of DOMLs (as a case study) to simulate and realize the population approach in simple form. This research&#8217;s findings can have practical implications for the development of neuromorphic hardware in medical devices, particularly in brain-computer interfaces and neuroprosthetics, where high-performance, low-cost hardware is crucial. In large-scale networks, our proposed modeling can be applied which is investigated in case of DOML connections.</description></item><item><title>SHMT: An SRAM and HBM Hybrid Computing-in-Memory Architecture With Optimized KV Cache for Multimodal Transformer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10993508</link><description>Multimodal Transformer (MMT) algorithms have become the state-of-the-art for multimodal tasks such as image captioning. The Encoder-Decoder (E-D) structure, consisting of Encoder, Decoder-causal, and Decoder-cross components, provides a flexible and effective framework for multimodal tasks. However, previous accelerators mainly focus on the dataflow and hardware optimization of the Encoder, which fails to accelerate the entire E-D structure efficiently. There remain three challenges: 1) the lack of pipeline and multicore optimization at the module, layer, and E-D level; 2) the Decoder-causal and Decoder-cross computations have lower arithmetic intensity compared to the Encoder, requiring a better solution for the varying arithmetic intensities; and 3) the autoregressive algorithm in Decoder-causal leads to redundant KV Cache accesses and considerable idle power. In this paper, SHMT, an SRAM and HBM hybrid computing-in-memory (CIM) architecture, is designed to efficiently support multimodal Transformers with three key contributions: 1) a multi-level pipelined multicore scheme, including pipeline optimization across E-D layer-head-module levels and a multicore network-on-chip (NoC) architecture, to reduce inference latency and off-chip accesses; 2) a heterogeneous SRAM-HBM architecture, utilizing high-density HBM-CIM for low-arithmetic-intensity (LAI) parts and high-performance SRAM-CIM for high-arithmetic-intensity (HAI) parts; and 3) by integrating KV Cache with zero-padding in SRAM-CIM, SHMT eliminates redundant read-write operations in KV Cache, reducing idle power consumption. Experiment results show that SHMT achieves  $212\times $  speedup, reduces energy consumption by  $208\times \sim 2000\times $  per token, and achieves  $13.3\times $  higher energy efficiency compared to NVIDIA A100 GPU.</description></item><item><title>MINA: A Hardware-Efficient and Flexible Mini-InceptionNet Accelerator for ECG Classification in Wearable Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948469</link><description>Classification is a crucial aspect of cardiovascular-related challenges, requiring thorough research and optimization to develop effective solutions for both patients and doctors. Recently, rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have introduced numerous effective methods, significantly improving disease classification in Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis. However, existing CNN-based accelerators often encounter challenges such as high parameter counts, limited flexibility in handling diverse CNN configurations, and inefficient hardware utilization. To address these issues, this paper proposes the Mini InceptionNet Accelerator (MINA), a hardware-efficient and flexible accelerator designed specifically for one-dimensional (1-D) CNN-based ECG classification. First, a novel 1-D CNN model, Mini InceptionNet, reduces the parameter count by 41.6% compared to the smallest existing 1-D CNN, minimizing memory requirements while maintaining high classification accuracy. Second, a flexible Processing Element Array (PEA) is designed with a Sharing Buffer Allocator (SBA) to support dynamic data coordination across various network topology parameters. Third, each Processing Element (PE) is equipped with four Local Data Memories (LDMs) and an ALU, enabling efficient intermediate data storage and versatile operations for modern CNN models. To demonstrate its effectiveness, MINA has been successfully implemented and verified on the ZCU102 FPGA at the system-on-chip level. FPGA evaluations show that MINA achieves  $1.3\times - 2.9\times $  higher energy efficiency (GOP/s/MeLUT) than state-of-the-art 2-D CNN accelerators. Compared to existing 1-D CNN accelerators, MINA achieves at least  $1.53\times $  improvement in the area-delay product (ADP). Additionally, weight pruning is discussed as a supporting strategy, achieving up to  $3\times $  faster inference time and a  $2.13\times $  improvement in ADP at 70% sparsity.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Nonlinear Dynamic Behavior Analysis of Photovoltaic-Energy Storage DC Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10971432</link><description>In the DC microgrid cluster system, due to the large number of converters, there are many operation modes and switching frequencies. The traditional modeling methods are difficult to balance the accuracy of the model and the simplicity of calculation and are not suitable for different switching frequency systems. In view of the above problems, this paper uses simplified discrete time mapping model to model the system. It combines the state space average model with the discrete time mapping model, which greatly improves the simplicity and accuracy of modeling. Taking the photovoltaic-energy storage system as an example, this paper analyzes the nonlinear behavior of the system and predicts the critical control parameters when the Hopf bifurcation occurs in the system. The eigenvalue sensitivity analysis is used to determine the eigenvalue change rate and change trend when the control parameters change, which provides guidance for the selection of parameters in practical applications. Finally, the high precision of the model is verified by simulation, and the applicability and effectiveness of the method in different switching frequency systems are verified by experiments.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Nonlinear Resistance Model for a Power MOSFET in an Oscillatory RLC Circuit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909987</link><description>This paper presents the development of a new Matlab mosfet model specifically designed for RLC circuits. The key contribution is the formulation of a novel equation that accurately captures the device behavior across subthreshold, above-threshold regions and at threshold point, addressing limitations in existing models. The developed model treats the mosfet as a variable resistance element, with the resistance changing dynamically at each instant, enabling the solution of differential equations governing the RLC circuit. Curve fitting and refinement were conducted based on experimental results, leading to a close match between the simulations and experimental data. The model was tested with triangle, sinusoidal and quadrilateral gate voltages, and the simulation results show good match with the experimental data, demonstrating the model&#8217;s accuracy. It provides a straightforward way to predict performance, making it easier to refine and optimize the design gate voltage before physical implementation. This work provides a solid foundation for mosfet modeling in oscillatory RLC circuits, which can be applied to a wide range of power electronics applications.</description></item><item><title>Inductive GNN-Based Methodology for Accurate and Fast Average Power Estimation of Synthesized ASIC Designs From RTL Simulation Bypassing Gate-Level Simulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964401</link><description>This paper proposes an inductive Graph Neural Network (GNN) based methodology for accurate and fast average power estimation of logic-synthesized and RTL-simulated ASIC Design, eliminating gate-level simulation. With the novel variation of inductive GNN architecture, the proposed model propagates the input wires&#8217; toggle rates acquired from RTL simulation through the synthesized design. We only train the proposed model on circuits synthesized from TSMC 65nm technology node but test on the circuits synthesized across TSMC 65nm, 40nm, 90nm, 130nm and GF 40nm technology nodes. We test the inductivity of the proposed model to predict the output wires&#8217; toggle rates of unseen and untrained logic cells of the designs. We compute the proposed methodology&#8217;s average power inference throughput (number of cycles inferred per second) for speed comparison. The proposed model does better than state-of-the-art architecture GRANNITE to predict the unseen and untrained logic cell&#8217;s toggle rates of the designs across TSMC 65nm, 40nm, 90nm, 130nm, and GF 40nm technology nodes, showing an average improvement of 6.67%, 8.49%, 9.26%, 7.47% and 6.36%, respectively. The proposed methodology is more accurate than the commercial RTL average power estimation tool and GRANNITE in estimating the average power of circuits across TSMC 65nm, 40nm, 90nm, 130nm, and GF 40nm technology nodes by achieving a mean improvement of 24.94%, 16.77%, 17.65%, 29.72%, and 32.84%; 2.75%, 1.1%, 1.81%, 2.59% and 4.49%; respectively. The proposed methodology is 11.07X faster, with an average inference throughput of 1.218kHz, than the commercial gate-level average power estimation tool.</description></item><item><title>Stabilization of Markov Jump Systems With Delay by Discrete-Time Aperiodically Intermittent Stochastic Control Based on L&#233;vy Noise</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10892348</link><description>This paper investigates how to stabilize unstable Markov jump systems with delay (MJSs-D) using non-Gaussian white noise based on sampled observations. First, the study addresses the noise stabilization problem of the corresponding delay-free Markov jump systems (MJSs). Using the Lyapunov function method and the stationary distribution of Markov chains, an aperiodic intermittent stochastic control based on L&#233;vy noise (AISC-LN) is developed. The analysis of the low-order moment exponential stability of stochastic controlled systems is comprehensively based on the ergodicity of the Markov chain, making the derived criterion less restrictive than the traditional one under M-matrix-based conditions. Subsequently, leveraging the auxiliary system method and comparison principle, the AISC-LN based on discrete-time state and mode observations is proposed for MJSs-D. This strategy encompasses specific cases such as discrete-time feedback control and periodic intermittent control based on Brownian motion, furthermore highlights the stabilizing effects of Markov chains and Poisson white noise, thereby providing a definitive answer to the proposed problem. The new control scheme applies to MJSs-D with various types of relatively small delays. Finally, the feasibility and accuracy of the conclusions are validated through an example of a DC-DC buck converter circuit.</description></item><item><title>A Consistency Enhancement Technique for MIMO Power Amplifier Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10902436</link><description>Hybrid beamforming reduces the hardware complexity of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In this architecture, one digital chain must drive all the power amplifiers (PAs) in the subarray. However, differences in PAs lead to poor linearization of shared digital pre-distortion (DPD). Based on circuit mechanisms and model simulations of PAs, this article identifies one reason for differences in PAs. Fluctuations in the manufacturing process lead to changes in the matching network of PAs, and the transmission characteristics of the matching network affect the nonlinear behavior of PAs. In order to reduce the network differences of PAs at the circuit level and improve the consistency of nonlinear behavior, this article proposes a consistency improvement scheme for MIMO power amplifier (PA) modules. The scheme uses the tuned network to correct the differences in the matching network. To validate the scheme, seven PAs from the same batch are corrected by the tuned network. Before and after the correction, the other PAs are linearized by the DPD signal of one PA. The measured bandwidths include 10 MHz and 40 MHz, and the measured power ranges from saturated average power to back-off of 9 dB. The results show that the PAs corrected by the tuned network have a better consistency. The linearization ability of the shared DPD one-drive-multiple is improved. The adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) improvement reaches 14 dB.</description></item><item><title>A Unified Sampled-Data Small-Signal Model for a Ripple-Based COT Buck Converter With Arbitrary Ripple Injection Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10962170</link><description>In this paper, we present a novel and unified small-signal modeling technique for Pulse-Width Modulated (PWM) DC-DC Buck converters with Ripple-Based Constant On-Time (RBCOT) control. In fact, despite the spread of RBCOT-based converters in several applications requiring tight dynamic performances and a low architectural complexity, their description through small-signal models is not always as reliable as that of fixed-frequency PWM control architectures, and a general and exact modeling framework is not well established. The proposed methodology is grounded on the DC-DC converter state-space representation and thus, differently from other modeling techniques, it permits to fully characterize the dynamic behavior of generic RBCOT converter topologies with arbitrary complex power stage and ripple injection networks. As a case study, we derive the small-signal model for a Buck converter embedding a widely used ripple injection network in industrial applications. The validity of the theoretical results is confirmed through direct comparison with SIMetrix/SIMPLIS simulations and experimental measurements in practical application scenarios, confirming the accuracy of the model even well beyond the converter switching frequency.</description></item><item><title>A Single-Input Multi-Output Resonant Regulating Rectifier Generating Three Outputs in a Half Cycle for Wirelessly Powered Biomedical Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10870376</link><description>This paper introduces single-input multi-output (SIMO) resonant regulating rectifier (R3) designed to produce three regulated outputs in a half cycle without low drop-out (LDO) regulators. Utilizing distributed multi-phase control allows for the regulation of three outputs in a half cycle, leading to increased power delivered to the load (PDL), reduced output ripple, and a higher number of outputs. Additionally, the adoption of negative threshold gate driver (NTGD) and a hybrid high/low comparator (HCMP) enhances the output voltage regulation range and power conversion efficiency (PCE). To ensure the safe control of three distinct outputs in a half cycle, all three outputs are equipped with end protection techniques. Moreover, for a secure start-up of the secondary outputs, the proposed pre-biasing technique in the pulse width modulation (PWM) controller is implemented. The 1.54-mm $^{2}~0.25$ - $\mu $ m CMOS SIMO R3 demonstrates the capability to generate three regulated outputs, with a maximum primary voltage and minimum secondary voltage difference of up to 3.5 V. Furthermore, a PCE of 90.82% is achieved with a total load power of 84.6 mW. These advancements position the SIMO R3, especially with dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) stimulation, as a promising solution for efficient use in retinal prostheses.</description></item><item><title>Impedance Circuit Model of Voltage Source Converter With DC-Link Voltage Control Dynamics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10924794</link><description>The impedance circuit model maps the control algorithms into the circuit topology of voltage source converters (VSCs). By analyzing discrete circuit elements, the model provides clear physical insight for the oscillation mechanisms triggered by the control dynamics. However, previous studies do not consider the outer-loop control and reactive power. To enhance the generality, this paper integrates the DC-link voltage control (DVC) loop into the impedance circuit model and thoroughly considers the non-unity power factor operating conditions. In this model, DVC dynamics is mapped as two equivalent impedances in the AC circuit, and interaction between the inner and outer loops is visualized by the interconnection of impedances. The analysis indicates that the perturbation of DVC dynamics on grid-connected current introduces the negative resistance effect at low-power levels. Moreover, the effect of reactive power on impedance circuit is mapped as a coupled current source linking the d-axis and q-axis circuits. As the inductive-reactive power increases, self-excited oscillations occur in the coupled source. According to the stability constraints of the coupled sources, a strict design method for the control parameters is proposed. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed model.</description></item><item><title>A Dual-Core Dual-Mode DCO for S/C-Band Radar</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10963897</link><description>This brief presents a dual-core, dual-mode digital-controlled oscillator (DCO) featuring a novel transformer-based resonator that minimizes parasitics in the switch connection lines and enhances the design flexibility of the resonator.

However, variations in component parameters within the resonant tanks can lead to discrepancies in voltage gain, causing imbalanced output currents and thereby compromising the safe and reliable operation of the system. This brief delves into the underlying mechanism of current imbalance and elucidates the dynamic process through state-plane trajectory analysis. Consequently, a virtual-synchronizer based online current sharing scheme is proposed for m-phase resonant converters, which facilitates rapid online current balancing and ensures excellent synchronization performance. Moreover, it eliminates the need to designate a master phase, thereby enhancing the control flexibility, and the addition or removal of any phase does not disrupt the control process. The proposed method achieves synchronization and current sharing by constructing a virtual phase, without requiring additional hardware such as circuits and sensors. Results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A New Variant of Turns-Ratio Independent Shoot-Through Current-Based Magnetically-Coupled Z-Source Inverter With Smooth DC-Link Voltage and Enhanced High-Gain</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10965743</link><description>In a magnetically coupled impedance-source (MCIS) inverter, the low value of shoot-through (ST) current is desired to reduce the ratings and losses of the power converter. In this regard, turns-ratio-independent ST current is an important requirement. Very few inverters (active-switched Y-source MCIS inverters) are found in a recent article, which claims turns-ratio-independent ST current as a figure of merit. But it is observed that the voltage gain of the turn-ratio-independent ST current-based configuration is lesser than the turns-ratio-dependent ST current-based inverters. Therefore, this brief proposes a new variant of an active-switched MCIS inverter with a smooth DC-link voltage, which simultaneously exhibits enhanced voltage gain and a turns ratio-independent ST current. The voltage gain of the suggested network is higher than that of the recent equivalent MCIS inverters for the same magnitude and duration of shoot-through current, i.e., the voltage gains per shoot-through current (combined figure of merit) are significantly improved in the proposed inverter. The switching device power (SDP) is also reduced in the suggested inverter. Its desired operation is experimentally verified.</description></item><item><title>SSPP Transmission System With Negative Group Delay and Power Compensation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10977049</link><description>The advanced signal output based on negative group delay (NGD) plays a pivotal role in real-time communication and sensing applications. However, the implementation of NGD often results in significant signal attenuation. Spoof surface plasmon polariton (SSPP) units with tightly coupled structures are capable of generating NGD near the sidebands. Building on this principle, an NGD SSPP unit is proposed in this brief by utilizing tightly folded structures. The NGD SSPP unit is integrated into the classical SSPP waveguide with an H-shaped unit to control the transmission group delay. This waveguide configuration facilitates the advanced output of double-sideband modulation signals. Nevertheless, the generation of negative group delay is also typically accompanied by considerable transmission losses. To address this challenge, a low-noise amplifier is designed for power compensation. The SSPP waveguide with the NGD unit is then cascaded with the low-noise amplifier, resulting in an SSPP transmission system with power compensation for the NGD signal.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time 3-D Thermal Simulation of Advanced Packages via Generative Adversarial Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10816122</link><description>Thermal optimization plays a crucial role in the design of advanced systems in package. Due to the large number of thermal simulations needed for full design space exploration, reductions in simulation run-time are critical. Here, we propose a data-driven approach to physics simulation by using neural networks (NNs) to cast the temperature solution process into an image-to-image translation problem. We first model the power generation map, conductivity map, and boundary conditions (BCs) into separate channels of an image. We then generate temperature solutions by training a generative adversarial network, composed of a U-Net shaped generator and a discriminator. The resultant NN model can handle diverse thermal simulation scenarios with accuracy. More importantly, our model can handle BCs, power maps, and physical package designs which are unseen during the training. Experiments show that speed wise, it enables near real-time design, providing a  $2581\times $  and  $9171\times $  speedup over a custom sparse matrix optimized finite element method and ABAQUS, respectively. Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods have demonstrated the accuracy, efficiency, and versatility of the proposed work.</description></item><item><title>Spatz: Clustering Compact RISC-V-Based Vector Units to Maximize Computing Efficiency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10836838</link><description>The ever-increasing computational and storage requirements of modern applications and the slowdown of technology scaling pose major challenges to designing and implementing efficient computer architectures. To mitigate the bottlenecks of typical processor-based architectures on both the instruction and data sides of the memory, we present Spatz, a compact 64 bit floating-point-capable vector processor based on RISC-V&#8217;s vector extension Zve64d. Using Spatz as the main Processing Element (PE), we design an open-source dualcore vector processor architecture based on a modular and scalable cluster sharing a Scratchpad Memory (SCM). Unlike typical vector processors, whose Vector Register Files (VRFs) are hundreds of KiB large, we prove that Spatz can achieve peak energy efficiency with a latch-based VRF of only 2 KiB. An implementation of the Spatz-based cluster in GlobalFoundries&#8217; 12LPP process with eight double-precision Floating Point Units (FPUs) achieves an FPU utilization just 3.4% lower than the ideal upper bound on a double-precision, floating-point matrix multiplication.

Different from homogeneous graph neural networks directly aggregating information based on neighbors, HGNNs aggregate information based on complex metapaths. ReRAM-based processing-in-memory (PIM) architecture can reduce data movement and compute matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) in analog. It can be well used to accelerate HGNNs. However, the complex metapath-based aggregation of HGNNs makes it challenging to efficiently utilize the parallelism of ReRAM and vertices data reuse. To this end, we propose ChainPIM, the first ReRAM-based processing-in-memory accelerator for HGNNs featuring high-computing parallelism and vertices data reuse. Specifically, we introduce R-chain, which is based on a chain structure to build related metapath instances together. We can efficiently reuse vertices through R-chain and process different R-chains in parallel. Then, we further design an efficient storage format for storing R-chains, which reduces a lot of repeated vertices storage. Finally, a specialized ReRAM-based architecture is developed to pipeline different types of aggregations in HGNNs, fully exploiting the huge potential of multilevel parallelism in HGNNs. Our experiments show that ChainPIM achieves an average memory space reduction of 47.86% and performance improvement by  $128.29\times $  compared to NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU.</description></item><item><title>Tradeoff Performance and Energy Efficiency by Optimizing the Data Flow for PIM Architectures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10816195</link><description>The processing-in-memory (PIM) architecture becomes a promising candidate for deep learning accelerators by integrating computation and memory. Most PIM-based studies improve the performance and energy efficiency by using the weight stationary (WS) data flow due to its high parallelism. However, the WS data flow has some fundamental limitations. First, the WS data flow has huge activation movements between on-chip memory and off-chip memory due to the limited memory space of the resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) array. Second, the WS data flow needs to read the input activation repeatedly according to the convolution window. These data movements decrease the energy efficiency and performance of the PIM architecture. To address these issues, the input stationary (IS) data flow stores activations instead of weights to reduce data movements. But the IS data flow faces some challenges. First, the data dependency between adjacent layers limits the performance. Second, there are huge across-array computations due to the special mapping method. Third, the previous IS data flow cannot realize the high parallelism. Fourth, the IS data flow depends on the 3-D ReRAM structure. To address these issues, we propose a novel data flow for PIM architectures. We optimize the IS data flow to decrease the activation movement and propose a parallel computing method to realize high parallelism and reduce the across-array computations. We identify and analyze the fundamental limitations and impact of different interlayer data flows, including the WS-WS, IS-IS, WS-IS, and IS-WS. We also propose a method to build a hybrid data flow by combining these interlayer data flows to tradeoff performance and energy consumption. Our experimental results and analysis demonstrate the potential of our design. The performance and energy efficiency of our design reach 0.13&#8211;1.77 TFLOPS and 61&#8211;85 TOPS/J, respectively. Compared to the state-of-the-art design, the NEBULA, our design can improve performance by  $1.4\times $ ,  $2.3\times $ , and  $3.5\times $  for deploying the MobileNet-V1, ResNet-18, and VGG-16, and also can improve energy efficiency by  $3.3\times $ ,  $2\times $ , and  $2\times $ , respectively.</description></item><item><title>Area-Oriented Resubstitution For Networks of Look-Up Tables</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10820546</link><description>This article addresses the challenge of reducing the number of nodes in look-up table (LUT) networks with two significant applications. First, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) can be modeled as networks of LUTs, and minimizing the node count is imperative to meet resource constraints. Second, in area-oriented design space exploration for standard-cell designs, collapsing a circuit into a LUT network, restructuring it, and later remapping to the original representation helps escape local minima. Thus, the development of algorithms for optimizing and restructuring LUT networks holds considerable promise for area-oriented optimization. Substitution (also called resubstitution) is a powerful logic minimization method that can identify nonlocal logic dependencies and exploit them for logic minimization. State-of-the-art substitution algorithms for LUT networks rely heavily on SAT solving, limiting the number of optimization attempts and the size of the substitution subnetworks to one node [1]. Conversely, our method relies on circuit simulation to increase the number of substitution candidates and enables substitutions with more than one node. The experimental results show that the proposed method identifies optimization opportunities overlooked by other methods, improving 11 out of 23 best-known results in the EPFL synthesis competition and yielding a 3.46% area reduction compared to the state-of-the-art.</description></item><item><title>Design and Analysis of Optimization Method for Ultra-Wideband PA Based on Improved MOEA/D Algorithm Using Mixed Objective Function</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10818755</link><description>This article proposes a design and optimization method for Ultra-Wideband power amplifiers (PAs) using improved multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) and mixed optimization objective function (MOOF). In order to address the insufficient optimization capabilities of conventional MOEA/D algorithm when dealing with complex Pareto fronts, the optimization algorithm is improved by using adaptive weights, neighborhoods, and global replacement. Initially, based on the sparsity of the population and an external population, the weight vectors corresponding to invalid or crowded individuals in the population are replaced. And, the neighborhoods are adaptively adjusted based on the number of iterations and the sparsity of each individual. Then, a global replacement is employed to accelerate the convergence process. Moreover, a MOOF using the load impedance, output power, efficiency and gain is conducted in the PA optimization design. To reduce the difficulty of impedance judgment, a construction method of impedance solution set based on Poisson disk sampling has been proposed and employed for optimization. For validation, an Ultra-Wideband PA operating at 100&#8211;4000 MHz (190.2% fractional bandwidth) was designed and optimized. Measured results show a drain efficiency ranging from 56.0% to 70.9% with an output power higher than 39 dBm at saturation within the whole operational frequency band.</description></item><item><title>Neural Evolutionary Architecture Search for Compact Printed Analog Neuromorphic Circuits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10818737</link><description>Printed electronics (PEs) is an additive fabrication technology which not only allows for a highly flexible printing of circuit patterns, but also produce soft, nontoxic, and degradable electronics at an extremely low cost. These properties make PE an enabler of new application domains, e.g., fast moving consumer goods and disposable healthcare devices. A particularly promising class of circuits in this technology is the printed analog neuromorphic circuits, offering efficient and highly tailored computational functionalities. In this work, we leverage the highly flexible fabrication process of PE to address the bottleneck of PE, i.e., the large feature sizes and low device counts. This issue is crucial, as it impairs the integration of printed circuits into target applications with limited footprint, such as smart band-aids. We propose an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to improve the circuit compactness through circuit architecture optimization. As baseline, we compare the proposed EA method with a state-of-the-art pruning method and a modified area-aware pruning method. All of them are able to optimize circuit architecture. Experimental simulation reveals that the proposed EA approach can effectively achieve compact circuits and outperform the pruning method by  $3.1\times $  lower area with no loss of accuracy. As a byproduct, the power is reduced by  $3.0\times $ , paving the way to energy-harvested printed systems.</description></item><item><title>Neural Rendering Acceleration With Deferred Neural Decoding and Voxel-Centric Data Flow</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10819500</link><description>Neural radiance field has become a fundamental rendering technique across diverse applications such as augmented/virtual reality and autonomous driving. It achieves exceptional rendering quality and reduces model construction cost mainly by introducing a novel neural representation, instant neural graphics primitives (Instant-NGPs). Despite its superiority, Instant-NGP poses severe problems of intensive computation, memory inefficiency and pipeline inefficiency, owing to numerous neural network queries, irregular memory access and intricate sampling procedure. To address these issues, this article proposes NeRA, an algorithm-architecture co-optimization framework that facilitates the efficient neural rendering of Instant-NGP. For intensive computation, we reconstruct the rendering flow and propose a deferred neural decoding algorithm to aggregate the network queries, which reduces the computational workload by 85.6% and only incurs &lt;0.5% loss in rendering quality. For memory inefficiency, a base- $\Delta $  interpolation algorithm is proposed to condense the scattered memory access and improves the equivalent bandwidth of on-chip memory by  $2.38\times $ . Furthermore, a voxel-centric data flow is proposed to fully reuse the cached data and save 88.7% of the external memory access. For pipeline inefficiency, a highly-pipelined hardware architecture with decoupled spatial skipping and interleaved sampling is constructed to eliminate the bubbles and invalid samples in the pipeline, which boosts the overall throughput by  $2.41\times $ . Extensively evaluated on representative benchmarks, NeRA attains  $1.2\sim 2.9\times $  in rendering throughput,  $1.7\sim 36.5\times $  in energy-efficiency and  $3.6\sim 8.3\times $  in area-efficiency, compared to the state-of-the-art related architectures.</description></item><item><title>An Architecture-Level CPU Modeling Framework for Power and Other Design Qualities</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10816030</link><description>Power efficiency is a critical design objective in modern microprocessor design. To evaluate the impact of architectural-level design decisions, an accurate yet efficient architecture-level power model is desired. However, widely adopted analytical power models like McPAT and Wattch have been criticized for their unreliable accuracy, while machine learning (ML) methods like McPAT-Calib rely on sufficient known designs for training and perform poorly when available designs are limited, which is the case in realistic scenarios. In this work, we propose PANDA, an innovative architecture-level solution that combines the advantages of analytical and ML power models. It achieves unprecedented high accuracy on unknown new designs even when there are very limited designs for training. Besides being an excellent average power model, we also extend PANDA to support the time-based power trace prediction, which can enable the analysis of peak power, power fluctuations, and voltage fluctuation. This is highly challenging at the architecture level. Other qualities, such as area, performance, and energy accurately, can also be supported. In addition to single design quality, PANDA can model the tradeoffs among different design qualities, such as the tradeoff between power and timing, by predicting the Pareto-optimal curve. Finally, PANDA can further support power prediction for unknown new technology nodes. Our experiment shows that, for average power prediction, our method can achieve high accuracy with a correlation coefficient R of 0.99 and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 7.91% even when only one configuration is known, outperforming McPAT-Calib which has R of -0.24 and MAPE of 35.96%. For time-based power trace prediction, our method can achieve a low MAPE of 4.34%, outperforming the state-of-the-art method Powertrain which has a MAPE of 53.8%.</description></item><item><title>Retention Accelerated Testing for 3-D QLC nand Flash Memory: Characterization, Analysis, and Modeling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10824831</link><description>3-D nand flash memory has become quite popular and is now widely used in data centers and mobile devices due to its outstanding storage density and cost-effectiveness. Larger storage capacity is made possible by 3-D quad-level cell (QLC) nand flash memory with the charge-trap (CT) structure, which stores four bits in each cell. However, data reliability is sacrificed in exchange for greater capacity. The lifespan of data retention is crucial for nonvolatile storage. Thus, an important role is played by the Arrhenius model, which is widely used for lifespan prediction and high-temperature acceleration testing. Interestingly, we discover that the conventional Arrhenius model is inaccurate after analyzing the data retention properties of 3-D QLC nand flash memory. An empirical model is proposed for changing the apparent activation energy (Ea) based on the influence of different parameters, in order to accurately predict data lifespan and perform accelerated experiments. This developed model provides a temperature- and cycle-related parameter table for Ea, which is useful for high-temperature acceleration testing examinations. Simultaneously, we observe a linear connection between the 40 &#176;C data retention time mapping and the other temperatures. We evaluate the effects of the modified Ea model and the classic Arrhenius model with the epitaxial data and conclude that the former can reduce the error by approximately 70% to a maximum.</description></item><item><title>Magnifier: A Chiplet Feature-Aware Test Case Generation Method for Deep Learning Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10836817</link><description>The development of deep learning has led to increasing demands for computation and memory, making multichiplet accelerators a powerful solution. Multichiplet accelerators require more precise consideration of hardware configurations and mapping schemes in terms of computation, memory, and communication patterns compared to monolithic designs, in order to avoid underutilization of performance. However, there is currently a lack of performance testing methods specifically tailored for multichiplet accelerators. Existing testing methods primarily focus on correctness testing and do not address potential performance issues from a hardware perspective. To address these issues, this article proposes Magnifier: a test case generation method for performance testing of multichiplet accelerators. First, we analyze typical multichiplet accelerator prototype from the perspectives of computation, memory, and communication patterns, and summarize a chiplet feature-aware operator task set. Next, we define the test evaluation metric interdevice percentile performance standard deviation and use a candidate operator set to construct a sampling space for model-level test cases. Finally, we build a generative adversarial network to learn the distribution of high-diversity test cases, enabling the rapid generation of high-quality test cases. We validate the proposed method on both simulated and real multichiplet accelerators. Experiments show that Magnifier can improve the metric of test cases by up to 3.42 times and significantly reduce generation time, providing valuable insights for optimizing the hardware and software of multichiplet accelerators.</description></item><item><title>SubMap: A Partial Mapping Strategy for CGRA Based on sub-CGRA Exploration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10806802</link><description>Coarse-grained reconfigurable array (CGRA) is a quality hardware for compute-intensive loop kernels, with its excellent balance of performance, energy efficiency, and reconfigurability. However, the efficiency of CGRA depends heavily on how the compiler maps the data flow graph (DFG) extracted from application kernels onto the target architecture. Most existing CGRA compilers encounter the challenge of long compilation times due to excessive exploration space. To reduce the exploration space and compilation time, we propose SubMap, which adaptively explores a suitable sub-CGRA for different DFGs in a target CGRA and efficiently performs the mapping process. The experimental results show that SubMap greatly reduces the compilation time compared to the latest methods while maintaining the mapping quality. On HyCube  $4\times 4$ , SubMap has an average performance improvement of  $9.47 \times $  and  $11.67 \times $ , respectively, compared with Morpher (Pathfinder) and Morpher (SA). As the scale of the target CGRA increases, the performance improvement of SubMap becomes more pronounced.</description></item></channel></rss>
