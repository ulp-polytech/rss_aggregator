CCM model-based control methods suffer from degraded performance under such conditions, whereas hybrid model-based control methods are limited by complex mathematical formulations of logical variables, piecewise structures, and inequalities and high computational costs. This article proposes a state quadrant modeling approach, which includes circuit state classification and state descriptor construction, offering high-precision and simplifying models for model-based control. The circuit state classification method identifies circuit states based on freewheeling conditions and current trends, ensuring comprehensive coverage of operating scenarios and enhancing modeling accuracy. Furthermore, the state descriptor construction method employs logical operations to derive one or two logical variables that uniformly represent different circuit states, eliminating the need for inequalities and piecewise structures. This method is highly scalable and applicable to single-inductor, dual-inductor, multiphase, and isolated converters. It significantly enhances control performance, simplifies design, and improves computational efficiency when integrated into model-based control methods. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed models achieve 99.99% accuracy relative to simulink results and 98.99% accuracy relative to experimental results. They also reduce computation time by 36.85% in model predictive control and decrease voltage response time by 35.69%.</description></item><item><title>Multimodal Split-Bus Boost-LLC Resonant Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11204831</link><description>This article proposes a multimodal split-bus boost-LLC resonant converter suitable for wide-range applications. In the proposed topology, the bus of the conventional full-bridge LLC resonant converter is split. Specifically, the bus of the first half-bridge arm is directly connected to the input voltage source, while the bus of the second half-bridge arm is boosted by an integrated boost circuit formed by the boost inductor connected to the input voltage source and the second bridge arm. A fixed-frequency duty cycle control is applied to the second switching bridge arm to raise its bus voltage, thereby adjusting the equivalent input voltage of the resonant tank and modifying the voltage gain of the converter. In addition, through topological reconfiguration, the primary-side inverter bridge can transition from full-bridge mode to half-bridge mode, enabling the converter to achieve a fourfold voltage gain range. Finally, a 1-kW laboratory prototype with 400 V input and 200&#8211;800 V output voltage was developed. Experimental results show that the prototype achieved 97.5% peak efficiency under full-bridge LLC mode, which increased to 97.8% when operating in half-bridge LLC mode. The efficiency remained above 96.2% within the whole output voltage range under the rated output current.</description></item><item><title>Modulated Parameter-Less Predictive Voltage Control for Dual-Active-Bridge Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11165003</link><description>Conventional model-based predictive voltage control in dual-active-bridge (DAB) converters suffers from voltage regulation limitations because the limited phase-shift angle candidate set impacts dynamic response and the parametric sensitivity impacts robustness. To address the above limitations, this letter proposes a modulated parameter-less predictive voltage control (MPL-PVC), where a parameter-less modeling architecture replaces the conventional mathematical models, eliminating dependence on precise circuit parameters through real-time parameter-less model updating, and a modulated optimal phase-shift angle calculation replaces conventional phase-shift angle candidate set, enhancing voltage regulation capacity while decoupling control performance from parametric variations. Experimental validation on a DAB prototype confirms the effectiveness of proposed MPL-PVC in enhancing dynamic performance and eliminating parametric effect.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Spatial Temperature Monitoring of Power Modules via Fourier Neural Operator-Based Thermal Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11168963</link><description>Accurate monitoring of power module spatial temperature (PMST) remains a critical challenge in power electronics. This letter proposes a Fourier neural operator-based thermal model (FNO-TM) to enable efficient and precise prediction of PMST for the first time. Built on a data-driven paradigm, FNO-TM extracts spatial-frequency features, facilitating faster convergence and reduced training costs compared to conventional neural networks. To further enhance generalization, a Trunk-and-Branch architecture is employed to adapt to varying boundary conditions. In addition, an electrothermal coupling strategy tailored for FNO-TM is developed and validated on a practical inverter platform. Experimental results show that FNO-TM maintains high accuracy across different current levels and cooling conditions, with maximum errors below 1.8&#176;C. Furthermore, the PMST prediction is completed within 0.1 s, significantly outperforming traditional methods in computational efficiency. The prediction accuracy can be further enhanced through fine-tuning with measured data. These features make FNO-TM a promising solution for thermal monitoring and digital twin applications in power electronics.</description></item><item><title>Dissipation-Based Dynamics-Aware Learning Scheme for Transient Stability Analysis of Networked Black-Box Grid-Forming Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11175507</link><description>Dissipation-based stability analysis, leveraging Lyapunov functions, is popular for assessing the transient stability of inverter-based power systems. However, the proprietary nature of vendor-specific inverter control schemes often results in &#8220;black-box&#8221; inverter models with limited transparency, while there remains a need for a &#8220;generalized&#8221; transient stability assessment framework, as opposed to the case-specific designs typically employed in current practice. To address these limitations, this letter proposes a dissipation-based dynamics-aware learning scheme for transient stability analysis of power grids with networked black-box grid-forming inverters. Unlike classical black-box modeling approaches that learn pointwise trajectory mappings as output characteristics, the proposed method directly learns state variable derivatives to uncover the underlying dynamics that govern system evolution. Leveraging the universal approximation capability of neural networks (NNs), the unknown system dynamics are first captured by a NN. Subsequently, data sampled from this NN facilitates the training of a separate NN that represents the Lyapunov function. The proposed bilevel approach enables generalized transient stability evaluation for highly nonlinear system without requiring explicit system models, making it applicable to diverse practical scenarios. Case studies are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Repairable, Recyclable, and Reliable Power Electronics Using Liquid Metal Interconnection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11175024</link><description>The progression of power electronics technologies prioritizes efficiency and power density, often paying scant attention to the converter&#8217;s own lifecycle environmental impact, resulting in significant and unnecessary waste. Traditional packaging and assembling methods of power electronic devices and converters rely on rigid bonding, such as soldering and sintering, to interconnect parts, causing challenges of disassembling and separating parts when repairing and recycling are needed. This letter introduces liquid metal (LM) as a bonding mechanism in power electronic device packaging and converter assembling. The fluidic interconnection using LM is invented to enable parts separation and thermomechanical stress reduction without compromising electrical performance. Therefore, repairable, recyclable, and reliable power electronics is achieved. Straightforward assembling and disassembling processes are demonstrated by a real repair case of the LM-based power stage. Electrical performance is validated by a buck converter, achieving an efficiency of up to 98.2%.</description></item><item><title>Multiparameter Identification Algorithm With Constant-Voltage Control for Fractional-Order Wireless Power Transfer Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11204690</link><description>Fractional-order wireless power transfer (FOWPT) systems improve robustness by utilizing fractional-order components, addressing the performance degradation of traditional integer-order systems caused by parameter variations. However, they are still limited by the load range, coupling distance, and resonant frequency offset. Moreover, existing research seldom considers the influence of multiparameter changes such as coil self-inductance, mutual inductance, and load on the output characteristics in practical applications. Therefore, this letter proposes a parameter identification method for FOWPT system based on differential evolution algorithm, which realizes the simultaneous identification of multiple parameters including load, self-inductance, and mutual inductance. Based on the parameter identification results, a constant-voltage output control strategy is further presented. Experimental results show that the system stably outputs 12 V with an error of only 0.083%, verifying the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method and providing new insights for the optimization and application of FOWPT systems.</description></item><item><title>Turn-on Switching Loss Reduction for 10 kV SiC mosfets Without Increasing dv/dt Using Desat Protection Circuits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11206520</link><description>Enabled by the fast switching capability of emerging 10 kV SiC mosfets, medium voltage (MV) power converters can achieve significantly reduced power loss. However, high dv/dt of 10 kV SiC mosfets also poses challenges for MV converter design. This letter proposes a simple method to reduce turn-on switching loss of 10 kV SiC mosfet without increasing dv/dt. The proposed circuit employs a widely used desat short-circuit protection circuit to determine the dv/dt stage of the turn-on switching transient and adjust the gate resistance to accelerate current rise period, while maintaining voltage fall period unchanged. The proposed circuit can achieve switching loss reduction under various dc voltages and load currents similar to a closed-loop active gate driver, but the circuit required is quite simple.

During testing, the measurement circuit must accurately detect the brief low-voltage portion of VDS while withstanding its full high-voltage swing, which presents significant challenges for circuit design. This letter introduces a novel approach for measuring turn-off delay times by detecting the current across the gate-loop resistor caused by the displacement current in the counterpart switch. In this case, the detection circuit can be entirely implemented using gate drive signals without detecting VDS and fully integrated into the gate driver, enhancing the flexibility of applications utilizing turn-off delay time for online junction temperature monitoring. Subsequently, a nonisolated circuit design (requiring fewer components) is presented, calibrated with a double-pulse test, and further validated through continuous operation in a buck converter.</description></item><item><title>An Antimisalignment Electric Vehicle Wireless Charging System Based on Two Transmitting Coils With LCC-S Compensation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11218841</link><description>In an electric vehicle (EV) wireless power transfer system, a critical challenge is to address mutual inductance variations and output fluctuations caused by the misalignment along the lateral direction of the EV. This letter proposes an antimisalignment method using two transmitting coils. First, an inductor&#8211;capacitor&#8211;capacitor series topology is adopted on the transmitting side. The relationship between the output voltage and the mutual inductance is derived, and a compensation parameter design method is proposed. Second, an output voltage compensation method is proposed to enhance the misalignment tolerance performance. Finally, an experimental prototype is built to verify the validity of the theory. The experimental results show that the proposed system can achieve an output performance of 200 V and 1 kW, with a peak efficiency of 95.17% over the misalignment range.</description></item><item><title>Dual-Frequency Ultra-Wide-Load Resonant Inverter for Electrosurgical Generator System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11224601</link><description>This letter presents a dual-frequency electrosurgical generator (ESG) based on a Class EF inverter, designed to accommodate ultra-wide impedance variations encountered during surgical procedures. The inherent load-insensitive characteristics of the Class EF inverter at a single frequency are further enhanced through the adoption of a dual-frequency operation strategy. To explore the design potential, inequality constraints and an impedance-based analysis method are employed. High operational efficiency is established as the primary design goal, and a simple dual-frequency and current control scheme is implemented to maintain stable output power. In the experimental validation, a 3/4-MHz ESG system is developed, achieving an efficiency above 63% and delivering 20 W of output power across a wide load range of 50&#8211;1500 $\Omega$.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Capacitance Extraction Method for Multichip Power Modules for EMI Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11151216</link><description>Extracting parasitic capacitances in multichip power modules (MCPMs) is essential for reliable electromagnetic interference (EMI) analysis, especially in switching systems such as automotive inverters or converters. Such applications increasingly employ multibridge MCPMs&#8212;where multiple half-bridge cells are integrated and each bridge drives a different motor or load&#8212; making the characterization of capacitance more critical. Conventional approaches, such as curve tracers and transient fitting techniques, suffer from limitations including single-frequency measurement, a complex measurement setup, and the need for repeated tests under different bias conditions. These drawbacks limit their practicality for complex module-level characterization. This article proposes a generalized capacitance extraction method based on two-port S-parameter measurements. The proposed method enables modeling of both static and dynamic capacitances under various voltage biases, with minimal reconfiguration of terminal connections. Experimental validation using a commercial IGBT-based MCPM demonstrated that the proposed method significantly reduces setup complexity compared to conventional measurements. These results confirm that the method is effective for EMI analysis and modeling of advanced MCPMs.</description></item><item><title>GaN-Based Inductive Charging DOS Pulse Generator Using IGBT-Isolated Modules With Bipolar Output and Adjustable Stacking for DBD Plasma Jet</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11157733</link><description>High-frequency, fast-rising nanosecond pulses have attracted considerable interest in various fields, particularly for driving dielectric barrier discharge plasma jets. The rapid reverse cutoff of diodes enables the diode opening switch (DOS) to generate ultrashort nanosecond pulses. However, it relies on small resistors and a high-power dc source for high-frequency operation, leading to low charging voltage gain and significant charging losses. Additionally, the limited controllability of diodes makes it difficult to adjust output polarity. Herein, a new DOS utilizing GaN with LC charging (L-DOS) is proposed. An inductor stores energy that is dissipated in the charging resistor of traditional DOS, achieving a higher charging voltage gain. Additionally, a new modular L-DOS circuit with IGBT isolation is designed. IGBT provides a controlled current path for the fast-rising pulses generated by the diodes, allowing for bipolar output with adjustable stacking. Results show that L-DOS achieves a fivefold increase in charging voltage gain with only 25% of the charging loss of traditional DOS, thereby enabling the generation of 5.8-kV pulses with a duration of 6.8 ns under a low input voltage of 100 V. The 4-stage prototype can not only output bipolar pulses but also achieve amplitude stacking up to 10.6 kV and bipolar frequency stacking up to 2 MHz.</description></item><item><title>Achieving ZVS in Asymmetrical Half-Bridge Structures: A Thorough Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11164343</link><description>As the demand for more efficient and compact power converters grows, the trend points to a progressive raise of their switching frequency. However, even with wide-bandgap semiconductors, switching losses limit the maximum frequency at which they can operate, requiring zero-voltage switching (ZVS) to maximize efficiency and to prevent overheating. Existing studies state that the conditions to achieve ZVS depend only on the stored charge in the output parasitic capacitances of the transistors, but this statement is not applicable for the asymmetrical half-bridge (AHB) structure defined in this article, commonly found in topologies such as the buck and the asymmetrical half-bridge flyback. This article addresses this limitation by deriving a novel condition for achieving complete ZVS in the AHB, showing that both, the stored charge and the stored energy in the transistors must be considered. It also proposes a simplified circuit for analyzing dead times and discusses the issue of having different switches in a half-bridge, stating the advantage of placing high capacitance transistors in the low-side. Furthermore, this article proposes some consideration for dimensioning the converter that facilitate achieving ZVS. Experimental measurements validate the theoretical analysis, demonstrating its potential in the design of high efficiency and high power density converters.</description></item><item><title>Safe-Operation-Area Extended IGBT Module With Enhanced Near-Junction Thermal Capacitance and Advanced Cooling for Transient High-Current Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11184245</link><description>With the growing integration of renewable energy sources, grid-connected converters are expected to provide overcurrent (OC) capability similar to those of synchronous generators. To address this challenge, we propose a power module that incorporates both enhanced near-junction thermal capacitance (NJTC) and exceptional cooling capacity. The module utilizes copper blocks as top-side interconnects, substantially enhancing NJTC and enabling dual thermal paths. Concurrently, it integrates a substrate-embedded manifold microchannel (MMC) heatsink to achieve ultralow thermal resistance. Using the simulation-optimized structural parameters of the NJTC and MMC heat sink, a 1200 V/100 A IGBT half-bridge power module with reliable connections is fabricated through silver sintering technology. Experimental validation demonstrates that the proposed module achieves a 50% higher steady-state current-carrying capacity than the pin-fin module at identical junction temperatures. Under OC conditions, the module operates stably for 3.33 s at 3 p.u. (per unit) with 1000 W heat dissipation per IGBT. At 2.5 p.u., it sustains safe operation over extended periods, outperforming the pin-fin module by a factor of ten. The heat extraction of different mechanisms during OC conditions is quantitatively analyzed through simulation. Double-pulse test results indicate that the proposed module exhibits a parasitic inductance of 25.91 nH, including the parasitics of the test circuit, which is slightly lower than that of typical wire-bonded modules. The demonstrated safe-operation-area extension makes this packaging approach highly promising for future high-reliability, high-performance grid-connected converter systems.</description></item><item><title>Partial Power Converter Based on the Gate Voltage Self-Balancing Supercascode Power Switch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11184860</link><description>To simplify the topology and control under medium-voltage dc input, a novel partial power dc transformer (DCX) based on gate voltage self-balancing supercascode power switches (GVSB-SCPSs) is proposed. The front stage of DCX is constructed by GVSB-SCPSs, which realize the medium-voltage dc input of a single module and a fixed voltage ratio. The closed-loop stabilized voltage output is achieved through the proposed partial power processing circuit, which handles a small portion of the output power. In the proposed converter, the high-frequency operation process of GVSB-SCPSs and the unique gate switching pattern during the dead time are analyzed. Based on this, the boundary condition of soft switching in the proposed converter is derived. Under this condition, the loss of the proposed converter is analyzed, and the dead time is optimally designed. Based on the proposed topology, a partial power converter experimental prototype is built. The prototype is constructed through the designed GVSB-SCPSs, which have been tested at 10 kV and demonstrate outstanding switching characteristics. The experimental results of the partial power converter prototype show that all the GVSB-SCPSs realize a ZVS soft switch at 4 kV, 20 kHz. Furthermore, the closed-loop stabilized voltage output is achieved, verifying the feasibility of the proposed PPP and DCX circuit.</description></item><item><title>Stability-Enhanced Low-Dropout Regulator With High PSRR in 40-nm CMOS for System-on-Chip Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11190462</link><description>Power supply noise can significantly degrade the performance of complex systems by reducing the signal-to-noise ratio. To address this, a low-dropout regulator (LDO) with both high power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) and robust stability under large load currents is essential. Conventional LDOs often face a trade-off between achieving high PSRR and maintaining stability, especially at large load currents and wide bandwidths. This article presents a simple yet effective LDO design approach that achieves excellent PSRR without compromising stability, even under large load current conditions. Two novel compensation techniques, adaptive zero compensation and dc-coupled zero compensation, are introduced to enhance stability margins. Stability is rigorously evaluated under process and temperature variations, as well as varying equivalent series resistance (RESR), load equivalent series inductance (LESL), and output capacitance. The proposed design demonstrates a phase margin exceeding 45 degrees and a gain margin greater than 10 dB in worst-case scenarios. Fabricated in 40-nm bulk CMOS technology, the LDO achieves PSRR greater than 60 dB up to 5 MHz and supports load currents up to 250 mA. It also delivers excellent line and load regulation, making it well suited for noise-sensitive system-on-chip applications that demand both high dynamic performance and enhanced stability.</description></item><item><title>Utilizing Silicone Gel Encapsulation in Power Semiconductor Module to Improve Manufacturability While Reducing Common-Mode Noise</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11192658</link><description>The novel power module introduced in this article features an etched section of the bottom copper layer of a direct-bonded copper substrate, encapsulated in silicone gel.

The measured CM noise in prototype hardware was decreased by maximum 5 dB&#956;V in steady-state operation. Thermal cycling tests with a total of 1000 cycles confirmed the proposed power module does not compromise mechanical stability.</description></item><item><title>A &#8220;Hand-in-Hand&#8221; Dynamic Current-Sharing Layout for Hybrid Double-Sided Cooling GaN Module</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11192784</link><description>Gallium nitride HEMTs provide exceptional advantages for high-power, space-constrained applications owing to their ultrahigh di/dt and dv/dt capabilities. However, these strengths render them prone to parasitics from layout, making current-sharing between multiple parallel chips difficult. This article develops a parasitic coupling network model for vertical commutation structures, quantitatively analyzing layout-dependent parameters (&#916;Ls, &#916;Ms, &#916;Mds, &#916;Mbs, &#916;Mpg, &#916;Mpks.) and their impact on current imbalance while offering optimized layout guidelines for power and gate-drive loops. A novel &#8220;hand-in-hand&#8221; parallel layout integrated with hybrid double-sided cooling is proposed, achieving parasitic consistency (&#916;Ls &#8804; 11.67%, &#916;Ms &#8804; 17.55%, &#916;Mds &#8804; 2.76%, &#916;Mbs &#8804; 1.96%, &#916;Mpg &#8804; 2.5%, and &#916;Mpks &#8804; 4.5%) and suppressing dynamic current deviation to &#916;Ion &#8804; 1.7 A and &#916;Ioff &#8804; 2.6 A. By adopting a unilateral gate-drive configuration, spacers are eliminated during heat dissipation substrate assembly, reducing thermal resistance by 50.5%. Experimental validation under 300 V, 48&#8211;208 A, and a case temperature range of 30&#8211;90 &#176;C confirms a current imbalance of less than 10%. Continuous operation at 300 V/50 A with forced-air cooling stabilizes module temperature at 33.6 &#176;C (deviation &lt; 1.8% from simulations), verifying thermal performance and sustained operational ability.</description></item><item><title>A Symmetrical Five-Switch Hybrid Boost Converter With Output Voltage Ripple Reduction and Right-Half-Plane Zero Elimination</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11193728</link><description>This article proposes a symmetrical five-switch hybrid (SFSH) boost converter, which has the same voltage conversion ratio as the conventional boost converter and eliminates the right-half-plane zero. By making the output current path always include an inductor current path and a capacitor current path, the continuity of the output current is enhanced and the ripple of output voltage is reduced. In addition, the SFSH converter solves the flying capacitor inrush current problem in extreme duty cycle, further reducing the conduction loss in capacitor path. An experimental prototype with switching frequency of 200 kHz is designed to verify the performance of the proposed converter. The measurement results demonstrate that the SFSH converter achieves a peak efficiency of 94.5% under the condition of $V_{IN}$ = 4 V, $V_{OUT}$ = 6 V, and $I_{Load}$ = 200 mA. Compared with conventional boost converter, the output voltage ripple is reduced by up to 40 mV. The recovery time is less than 120 &#956;s under the load transient between 100 and 500 mA.</description></item><item><title>Control Strategy Against Capacitance Degradation for BLDC Drives With Small DC-Link Capacitor in Series With IGBT</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11165484</link><description>In brushless dc motor (BLDCM) drives with a small dc-link film capacitor and a series-connected IGBT, capacitor degradation can significantly compromise system performance and reliability. To address this challenge, this article proposes a control strategy specifically designed to mitigate capacitance degradation effects. The core of the strategy involves intentionally advancing the natural voltage separation point between the film capacitor and diode rectifier outputs, thus establishing an artificial voltage separation instant. This approach ensures that the capacitor voltage consistently remains above the peak ac voltage despite capacitor degradation, effectively compensating for reduced energy storage capability. Compared to the modulation strategy optimized for initial capacitor capacity, the proposed method only increases inverter switching actions during a limited portion of the control cycle in Zone I, without altering the switching frequency of the dc-link series IGBT. The proposed strategy does not require shutting down the system to replace the capacitor after degradation. Compared to the fault-tolerant topology of paralleling capacitors, the proposed strategy incurs no additional hardware cost. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed control strategy.</description></item><item><title>Generalized INFORM Method for Low-Speed Position Sensorless Control of PMSM Using Single Current Sampling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11195770</link><description>In ac variable frequency drive systems, permanent magnet synchronous machines are highly favored for their remarkable efficiency, high power density, and compact mechanical structure. Position sensorless control of PMSMs offers notable advantages in enhancing reliability and reducing cost. At the same time, high-precision current sensors are expensive, and the use of single current sampling can further reduce costs. However, the reliability of position sensorless control, particularly at low speeds, is impacted by the distortion of applied voltage due to the phase shift of unmeasurable regions, which, in turn, leads to the failure of position observation. In order to solve the problem of combining single current sampling with position sensorless control, this article proposes the Generalized Indirect Flux detection by Online Reactance Measurement method, where the angles of injected voltage vectors can be arbitrarily assigned to minimize the negative impact of unmeasurable regions and enhance control reliability. Furthermore, the dynamic PWM modulation method is proposed, where the field-oriented control execution frequency is increased to further enhance the dynamic performance of the control system. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by experiments on a 2.2-kW platform.</description></item><item><title>A Unified Two-Dimensional SVPWM and Phase Difference Boundary Analysis for Transformerless Back-to-Back Cascaded H-Bridge Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11159157</link><description>Conventional space vector pulsewidth modulation (SVPWM) schemes for back-to-back cascaded H-bridge converters suffer from problems such as limited available sectors and the risk of capacitor short-circuit faults under phase difference conditions. To address these issues, a two-dimensional (2-D) SVPWM strategy based on bilateral voltage balancing is proposed in this article. The strategy optimizes the vector synthesis paths, expanding the boundary range of available sectors by 20% . It also ensures smooth transitions in port voltage levels, effectively reducing switching losses and voltage stress. Furthermore, the constraints between the modulation index and phase difference are clarified, providing a theoretical foundation for parameter design and stable operation.

Recent studies have shown that certain grid transformer configurations allow the full control of dc-side pole power flows by multitasking the converter-side windings to carry the required dc balancing current through a dedicated neutral line (NL). NL-based NPC converter systems offer a simpler and more cost-effective alternative to VB-based systems, but suffer from significant NL current ripple caused by the pulsewidth modulation (PWM) switching of the converter. This article addresses the issue on two fronts. First, an in-depth analysis of the NL current ripple is conducted in a dual NPC converter system. Analytical expressions are derived to characterize the harmonic distribution under both phase disposition (PD) and alternate phase opposition disposition (APOD) PWM strategies. Second, based on the analysis, an improved PD-PWM strategy incorporating triple degrees-of-freedom (PD-TDoF) is proposed for dual NPC converters, effectively reducing current ripple and significantly enhancing NL current performance compared to conventional PD-PWM. The theoretical analysis and effectiveness of the proposed PD-TDoF strategy are validated through laboratory experiments.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical DC Current Balancing Strategy for Multilevel Current-Source Converters Based on Differential-Mode Sectional Power and Dual-Redundant Vector Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11192597</link><description>Unbalanced dc inductor currents in multilevel current-source converters can degrade power quality and potentially lead to overloading of individual modules or bridge arms. Traditional current balancing strategies either require extensive processing of redundant vectors or exhibit limited degrees of freedom, which increases complexity or directly affects current balancing performance. This article proposes a novel hierarchical current balancing control strategy based on the analysis of differential-mode (DM) and common-mode (CM) components of dc currents. By adjusting the component aligning with the capacitor voltage in the module current reference, the ac DM-sectional power of the module is regulated, thereby balancing the dc DM components across modules. Furthermore, by adjusting the duration allocation ratio of two distinct zero vectors within the vector sequence of the module, the dc CM components are suppressed, ensuring balanced currents in the upper and lower branches. The proposed method is easily implementable, eliminating the need for complex redundant vector management and intricate multivariable sorting, while introducing minimal additional switching frequency. Simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>A Compensation-Based 3D-SVPWM Strategy Employing Positive and Negative DC-Link Voltages Sampling for Three-Phase Four-Wire Three-Level Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11164875</link><description>Three-phase four-wire three-level (3P4W-3L) converters demonstrate broad application prospects in off-grid systems, while facing complex and variable operating conditions. Under asymmetrical loads, their dc-link neutral-point potential (NPP) exhibits fundamental-frequency oscillation proportional to the load unbalance factor. The adoption of traditional three-dimensional space vector modulation (3D-SVPWM) based on the assumption of balanced positive and negative dc-link voltages leads to substantial output errors during large-amplitude NPP oscillation, ultimately causing three-phase voltage unbalance and elevated total harmonic distortion (THD). Further theoretical analysis confirms that such errors introduce third-harmonic components in the output voltages. A compensation-based 3D-SVPWM strategy employing positive and negative dc-link voltages sampling is proposed in this article, which constructs the 3D space vector diagram based on the real-time sampling values of positive and negative dc-link voltages. Using the real-time positions of basic vectors, subsectors in the vector diagram are optimally redivided and the vector dwell times are calculated accordingly. This strategy effectively suppresses third-harmonic components in the output voltages, ensuring that the system can still output high-quality voltage waveforms even when the NPP oscillates greatly. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified through comparative experiments, showing a high balance degree and low THD of the output voltages.</description></item><item><title>On Magnetic Shielding for Axial Winding Segmented Coreless Transformers in Self-Sustained Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11168464</link><description>In this article, the magnetic field characteristics and shielding design for the axial winding segmented coreless transformer (CLT) in self-sustained converters are studied. The axial winding segmented design can reduce the volume of CLTs, and its magnetic field is constrained in a smaller space, effectively decreasing the dimensions and cost of the electromagnetic shielding enclosure. The shielding is equivalent to a passive RL circuit coupled with CLTs, and then the virtual magnetic permeability is introduced to derive the expressions for self- and mutual impedance, transformation ratio, power loss, operating frequency, and the current phase angle. The analysis results show that the self-sustained converter with CLTs can adapt to the parameter variations caused by the shielding insertion, i.e., the electrical, thermal, and structural parameter design of CLTs be separated from its shielding design. Meanwhile, in order to solve the contradiction among power density, magnetic shielding, and heat dissipation, a closed-form design method of conductive shielding with aperture array is proposed, which integrates the heat sink with the shielding to satisfy the magnetic shielding and improve the heat dissipation capability of the system. A 1.5 kW prototype is fabricated to verify the theoretical analysis. Compared with the unshielded design, the peak efficiency of the shielding design is almost the same, reaching 95.65%, but a lower hot spot of only 58.1 &#176;C and magnetic field radiation (9.28 &#956;T) below the standard limit (27 &#956;T) can be achieved.</description></item><item><title>A Stage-by-Stage Soft Start-Up Strategy for Multiple-Modes Resonant Switched Capacitor Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11159323</link><description>A safe and rapid soft start-up mechanism is critical and essential for enhancing the reliability of the resonant switched capacitor converter (ReSCC). This article proposes a soft start-up strategy for a ReSCC with two-stage resonant tanks and multiple operating modes. Based on the principle of establishing the capacitor voltage with maximum possible rate, the state trajectories of the first-stage and second-stage resonant tanks are sequentially designed within the resonant current limiting band. After that, the output voltage is built up with an optimal switching frequency. The proposed strategy is elaborated in detail under one of the operating modes. On this basis, a generalized soft start-up procedure applicable to all operating modes is designed. Furthermore, the comparison with hard start-up and the impact of component tolerances are investigated. The proposed strategy enables rapid and sequential establishment of capacitor voltages across three stages, while ensuring that there are no inrush currents or voltage spikes on components. The correctness of the proposed strategy is verified by soft starting a 48-V/100-W converter prototype under two different operating modes.</description></item><item><title>Pseudo Partial Power Processing Multilevel Modular High Gain Switched Tank Converter for Data Center Intermediate Bus Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11165508</link><description>In this article, a pseudopartial power processing (P-PPP) multilevel modular high step-down gain switched tank converter (HGSTC) is proposed for data center application.

Therefore, in this article, power cycling tests (PCTs) considering moisture intrusion is conducted for the 6.5 kV IGBT modules. Whether it is conventional PCT or PCT considering moisture intrusion, its failure mode is manifested as an increase in thermal resistance with solder layer degradation. In conventional PCT, the failure mechanism of the module is chip solder aging, while for modules with moisture intrusion, the chip solder only shows slight aging, indicating that there are other factors causing the increase in module thermal resistance. Through comparison with scanning acoustic microscope, it was found that modules with moisture intrusion had uneven thickness of the system solder layers after PCT. This is because the high temperature during the PCT process increases the expansion stress of moisture, causing deformation of the system solder layer, then accelerating its ageing process. Furthermore, by comparing the transient thermal impedance (Zth) before and after moisture intrusion, it was found that the curve separated around the system solder layers inside the module.</description></item><item><title>An Interleaved Boost Converter With an Integrated Active Ripple Cancellation Filter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11099530</link><description>In this article, an interleaved boost converter with an integrated active ripple cancellation filter (IARCF) is presented, which is able to offer nearly duty-cycle-independent and switching-frequency-independent switching ripple cancellation capability. The inter-bridge positive coupling and inter-phase negative coupling of the integrated filter actively cancel the switching current ripple by generating mutual-inductance voltage to offset the switching voltage on the main inductor in a wide voltage range. An integrated magnetic core structure is proposed to implement the active filter, which is able to achieve partial flux cancellation and convert the ripple cancellation condition into adjusting the winding turn ratio, thereby making parameter matching easier. The accuracy of the theoretical analysis and the validity of the proposed converter and the magnetic core structure are verified by simulation and experimental results. Importantly, the proposed interleaving IARCF and magnetic core structure are versatile and can be readily applied to inverter and rectifier applications.</description></item><item><title>Resilient Operation for Grid-Connected Cascaded H-Bridge Multilevel Inverter Based on Neutral Offset</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11121403</link><description>In power systems increasingly dominated by renewable energy generations, cascaded H-bridge (CHB) multilevel inverters are well-suited for high-power applications. However, CHB topologies are prone to unbalanced conditions due to submodule faults. While redundant submodules are commonly employed to mitigate these issues, they lower efficiency and increase the costs and complexity of circuits. This article addresses unbalanced grid currents caused by faulty submodules in CHB inverters through a neutral point-shifting control strategy. When submodules are bypassed due to faults, all remaining submodules, across both normal and faulty phases, share the lost voltage of the bypassed submodules. The corresponding control strategy is presented in this article, constraints and source voltage stress reduction are analyzed, and the effectiveness is verified by simulation and experimental tests. The proposed method can reduce system costs and downtime, thus enhancing the resilient operation of the entire system.</description></item><item><title>Power-Transfer Performance Improvement for S-S Compensation IWPT System Based on Self-Adaptive Impedance Matching</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11097020</link><description>Power-transfer performance has always been one of the main obstacles to restrict the widespread deployment of series&#8211;series (S-S) compensation inductive wireless power transfer (IWPT) system. Thus, the main objective of this article is to improve the power-transfer performance of system, which enables it to better meet the demand of different application scenarios. First, coupling coefficient and load equivalent resistance are selected, to reveal one of the reasons why it is hard to realize high power-transfer efficiency from a hardware perspective.

However, conventional modulation strategies face challenges in simultaneously eliminating power backflow and achieving balanced output power among cascaded units. In response, this article proposes a double-tier power matching (DPM) hybrid frequency modulation strategy for a nine-level ACHB inverter with a dc-link voltage ratio of 2:1:1. In the upper tier power matching scheme, an improved staircase modulation for the high-voltage unit ensures power balance between high-voltage unit and low-voltage units by regulating the pulse width of the high-voltage unit. In the lower tier power matching scheme, a novel level-shift modulation is employed for the low-voltage units, utilizing carrier rotation with intervals of half a fundamental period to achieve power balance within a single fundamental period. Additionally, in order to prevent power backflow, the proposed strategy undergoes further optimization. This optimization also leads to a substantial reduction in both the implementation complexity of the DPM strategy and the switching losses in the inverter. Ultimately, this strategy is validated by both simulation and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Nonlinear Automatic Power-Decoupling Control of a Differential Buck Grid-Tied DC&#8211;AC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11099551</link><description>A nonlinear automatic power-decoupling (APD) control strategy for a single-phase grid-tied differential buck dc&#8211;ac converter is proposed in this work.

Considering the long rail-type coil structure, circuits on transmitting (Tx) and receiving (Rx) sides, an equivalent model of displacement current paths is proposed for predicting the floating potential on sorting transfer vehicles in monorail IPT systems. An expression for floating potential is then derived, revealing that the placement of compensation components for Tx coil is the main factor affecting the floating potential. Based on it, we propose the novel suppression approaches through symmetrical split resonant inductors and strategic repositioning of the Tx coil compensation elements. Experimental validation is conducted using 1-kW power pick-ups with a 3-m-long Tx coil. Experimental and simulation results confirm the validity of the analysis.

Improved distance relays in the existing literature often rely on communication from the remote end or specific IBR control strategies, limiting the compatibility of these relays. This article proposes a distance protection method at the IBR side of the line. First, the sequence equivalent circuits of IBRs are treated as three unavailable boxes. Next, the proposed method combines the information within multiple the sequence networks, to accurately consider the impact of fault resistance and remote end infeed current. Finally, the unknown fault distance is analytically solved as a root of the quadratic equation. The proposed method does not have specific assumption on IBR control schemes, step-up transformer winding connections, or branches at the local bus, and can therefore work in power systems with various grid codes. Moreover, the proposed method is compatible with present phasor data acquisition systems at local terminal and does not require remote end information. Simulations, hardware experiments and field data experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distance protection.</description></item><item><title>A Dynamic Power Management Strategy for Cascaded Multilevel Converter With Hybrid Energy Storage System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11096102</link><description>A cascaded multilevel converter (CMC) with hybrid energy storage system (HESS) offers a promising solution for high-voltage and high-power hybrid dc&#8211;ac systems.

In addition, battery state-of-charge (SOC) balancing and SC energy management strategies are introduced to maintain optimal energy distribution and ensure long-term operation. The approach enhances overall system performance by fully leveraging the complementary strengths of batteries and SCs. The effectiveness of this strategy is validated through simulations and experiments, confirming its scalability and adaptability to various CMC-based HESS configurations.</description></item><item><title>Precise Sizing of Supercapacitor Packs by Accurate Prediction of Energy Using Fractional Order Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11095724</link><description>Designing a supercapacitor (SC) pack for any application involves choosing the optimum value of capacitance that meets the energy and power demands of the application. However, this is not straight forward due to the nonlinear variation of the value of capacitance with operating conditions. The conventional sizing methodology determines the capacitance value by equating the energy demand with the energy predicted using the RC model. It assumes a constant capacitance value, which results in over sizing of the SC pack. To overcome this drawback, this article proposes a fractional order (FO) model (FOM) based method to accurately predict the stored energy in SC pack. Although FOM accounts for the nonlinear capacitance variation due to the charge redistribution in the porous SC electrodes, there are certain shortcomings. First, the identification of the FOM parameters is cumbersome due to their dependence on the charge/discharge history. Second, the scaling of the FOM parameters from cell to pack level for the performance analysis of SC systems is not clearly addressed so far. Considering these, a predictor-corrector methodology for SC pack sizing is proposed. A rough estimate of the number of SC modules for meeting the specified energy and power demand is determined in the prediction stage. The correction stage evaluates the power, energy and efficiency of the selected module with FOM parameters and adjusts the sizing. The proposed methodology is then validated with a case study on a supercapacitor-based city bus, where a 27% reduction in sizing is observed.</description></item><item><title>Transient Stability Analysis of Hybrid GFL-GFM System Considering Various Damping Effects</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11103749</link><description>As converter-based resources keep expanding in power systems, it is urgent to clarify the transient coupling mechanisms between different control types of converters. It has already been found that both the grid-following (GFL) control and the grid-forming (GFM) control could introduce significant damping effects on transient angle motions. However, the damping effects on the relative motion between different control types of converters remain unclear, which impedes the transient stability evaluation of systems containing various converters. To fill the gap, this article explores the transient damping effects present in a hybrid system containing both the GFL and GFM converters. Two distinct damping effects introduced by the GFL and the GFM algorithms are first identified. It is found that the damping terms can introduce negative damping effects during transients, which would deteriorate the system transient stability. To quantify the damping effects, a critical trajectory approximation (CTA) method for the GFL-type damping and a damping energy approximation (DEA) method for the GFM-type damping are proposed. On this basis, a transient stability criterion for the hybrid systems is developed to directly identify the critical fault-clearing point without any repetitive iteration. Simulations and hardware-in-loop experiments are both implemented for validation. The proposed method effectively evaluates the complex damping effects and quantitatively solves the transient stability boundary for hybrid GFL-GFM systems, which may provide some valuable insights for transient stability analysis of hybrid systems.</description></item><item><title>A Carrier-Based Multiswitch Virtual Space Vector Modulation With Dead-Time Effect Elimination for Multiport DC&#8211;AC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11112519</link><description>Multiport dc&#8211;ac converter has gained attention due to its power density and low cost. However, in virtual space vector pulse width modulation (VSVPWM) where common-mode voltage (CMV) reduction and power control are considered, there are multiple switching actions in a period, which can be called multiswitch-VSVPWM (MS-VSVPWM). This leads to complex vector synthesis rules, and dead-time effect (DTE) needs to be analyzed due to variable port voltages. To simplify computation, a carrier-based MS-VSVPWM with DTE elimination is proposed. First, according to volt-second balance and dwell time relations, variable and fixed modulation waves are derived. Then, final output sequences are obtained by using phase opposition disposition (POD) carrier. Second, shifted modulation wave is derived on this basis. The drive signals are obtained by the variable/fixed modulation wave and the shifted modulation wave, respectively. Thus, DTE is eliminated on the premise of avoiding shoot-through of power switches. In addition, a variable shift value strategy is investigated to obtain the maximum shift value. Finally, the proposed method is verified experimentally on photovoltaic (PV)-battery hybrid system prototype, showing its high efficiency and relatively low output harmonics based on CMV reduction and power control.</description></item><item><title>Step-Wave AC Collection System: A More Efficient Solution for Wind and Photovoltaic Power Transmission</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11095885</link><description>The sinusoidal alternating current (ac) synchronous generator-based power system has served as the backbone of electricity generation and distribution for over a century.

The newly developed DT is based on a time-domain mathematical modelling approach. Moreover, a novel optimal equilibrium optimizer (OEO) algorithm is employed to find the values of unknown parameters of developed DT. Initially, the system&#8217;s unknown parameters are estimated under healthy operating conditions through novel OEO algorithm. As the system operates, the DT continuously monitors and updates these parameters, identifying any deviations or degradation in system components.

In parallel, cascaded-bridge converters (CBCs), such as cascaded H-bridge converters (CHBs), enjoy the advantages of modularity and expandability, thus being promising candidates in high-voltage GFMCs. Although the serial connection of submodules enables high-voltage stresses, CHB submodules fail to jointly share the current. Therefore, conventional CHBs can hardly comply with short-term overload requirements, which remain a tricky problem for GFMCs. By leveraging the parallel capacity of symmetrical half-bridge submodules, this article proposes grid-forming CBCs with parallel connectivity, which benefits from: 1) implementation of multilevel converter GFM functionality and customized grid-supportive services; 2) increased current capacity; 3) minimization of sensor usage and control complexity; and 4) GFM capability sustainment under submodule faults.

As such, the prior knowledge of line resistances is very helpful for achieving the coordinated regulation of multiple dc&#8211;dc converter-interfaced distributed generators (DGs). Nevertheless, line resistances are difficult to estimate, particularly when only local measurements are available. To fill the research gap, this article proposes a novel method to estimate line resistances by applying a disturbance to the output voltage of each DG sequentially. Notably, each DG simply measures its local output current and performs simple calculation with measured parameters. Different from existing methods, the proposed method allows impedance estimation without any additional hardware or communication link. Furthermore, the proposed method can be extended to heterogeneous systems, where DGs feature different parameters and/or line impedances. In this case, we employ a particle swarm optimization algorithm for accurate estimation. Finally, simulation and experimental results validate that the proposed method achieves an approximately 3% improvement of line resistance estimation accuracy as compared with the conventional estimation methods in homogeneous and heterogeneous systems.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Simulation Method for High-Frequency Power Electronic Converters With Blocking Mode</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11112543</link><description>For the bridge-based high-frequency power electronic converters (BHPECs) using the Ron/Roff model, the identification of blocking mode is crucial for the real-time simulation to avoid oscillation and ensure model accuracy.

The proposed method ensures model stability by the backward Euler method and achieves decoupling between half-bridge arms. Besides, by correcting the predicted state variables at the diode status-changing time point, this method significantly reduces the computational amount compared to the existing blocking mode identification methods without iterative operations. Finally, a series load resonant (SLR) converter with 100 kHz switching frequency and an LLC resonant converter with 200 kHz switching frequency were implemented on a field programmable gate array (FPGA), achieving simulation time steps as low as 20 ns. Comparisons with existing methods confirm the advantages of the proposed method in terms of timing and resource consumption.</description></item><item><title>Development, Control, and Application of a Parallel-Type Hybrid-Actuated 6-$\underline{\mathrm{P}}$SS Precision Stage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11103746</link><description>Six degree-of-freedom (DOF) precision stage is crucial in optical engineering applications, which necessitates rapid velocity, submicrometer resolution, extensive workspace, and power-off self-locking functionality. Conventional multi-DOF precision stages may excel in certain motion performances while underperforming in others. This study introduces a hybrid concept of a 6-$\underline{\mathbf{P}}$SS precision stage actuated by frictional and electromagnetic forces in a parallel arrangement, with the frictional force generated by a multimode piezo-motor and the electromagnetic force produced by a voice coil motor. Unlike the conventional macro/micro precision stage, the proposed one features parallel-type actuation, avoiding some drawbacks such as complex kinematics and internal interference. The theoretical model of the system is established. A controller integrating proportion integration differentiation (PID) and sliding mode controller incorporating a disturbance compensator (SMC-DC) is developed to mitigate shock interference from the two forces, allowing the precision stage to attain optimal performance in resolution, stroke, and velocity, while also incorporating a power-off self-locking feature. The experimental setup is established to assess the feasibility of the suggested design. To further display the superiority in versatile actuation, the proposed 6-$\underline{\mathbf{P}}$SS stage is employed to align the single-mode fiber. The spatial optical coupling achieves 81% efficiency in just 32 s. The proposed methodology can be extended to further precision positioning applications.</description></item><item><title>Reinforcement Learning-Based Control for Electrohydraulic Actuators: A Case Study on an Inverted Pendulum Testbench</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11099537</link><description>Electrohydraulic actuators (EHAs) are critical in applications demanding compact designs, high power density, and precise motion control.

As a remedy, this work proposes a model predictive controller (MPC) to handle the unmeasurable backlash often encountered in dual-motor driving systems (DDSs). First, a control-oriented model with an observer is established to estimate the backlash torque. Accordingly, a constrained MPC is developed to minimize both the tracking error and vibrations. Therein, delay compensation is leveraged to decrease prediction lag. PI feedback is introduced to compensate for the steady-state error caused by the offset of the external observer. Based on the output of the proposed MPC, which is the sum of the torques for two motors, a time-varying-bias-torque (TVBT) scheme to save energy consumption is designed to compute the torque for each motor. Finally, experiments are conducted on DDSs to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the present MPC-TVBT.</description></item><item><title>Noninvasive DC Current Monitoring for High-Sensitivity With Temperature Compensation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11099536</link><description>DC microgrids, which are being widely applied in renewable energy distribution management and enhancing energy efficiency in smart buildings, are facing significant challenges in maintaining system stability and reliability, as well as effectively managing complex communication and control. In this article, a noninvasive dc current galvanometer is proposed for high-sensitivity with temperature compensation via a differential passive sensing&#8211;wireless transmitting scheme. An integrated configuration, mainly consisting of a magnetic cantilever and a dual-frequency microstrip patch, is used to synchronously realize both sensing and transmitting. A sensitivity of 503.88 ppm/A, obtained with a fabricated prototype, 41 times greater than that of previous one, is increased to 1024.75 ppm/A by introducing an array design, achieving an improvement of two orders of magnitude.

Unlike previous studies that focused on establishing a stable source on the primary side (e.g., through a full-bridge inverter), this article leverages the load-sensitive characteristics of a single-switch resonant inverter to achieve a more stable system under varying coupling conditions. In addition, instead of designing the inverter and compensated coupler in a decoupled manner, the whole system is viewed as an ultrahigh-order resonant converter. Through simplification, the existing analytical inverter model is modified to fully explore the design potential for coupling-independent zero voltage switching and high robustness under parameter variations. The modified model also fills the gap in the holistic modeling of single switch IPT systems. In the experiment, a 60 W prototype is designed, when the coupling coefficient varies from 0.085 to 0.17, the output power maintains a fluctuation of 12%, with peak efficiency reaching 89.12%.</description></item><item><title>Interpretable Wind Power Forecasting With Feature and Loss Function Construction Guided by Domain Knowledge</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11122909</link><description>Current wind power forecasting (WPF) methods predominantly rely on data-driven deep learning models, inherently lacking integration of domain knowledge, which limits forecasting accuracy and model interpretability. To address this issue, an interpretable data-knowledge fusion ultra-short-term WPF model is proposed, in which domain knowledge guides the feature construction process and is directly embedded into the design of the loss function. In the feature construction module, a wind speed-power curve is established to generate theoretical power outputs by using historical wind speed as inputs. These theoretical outputs, combined with historical measured data, serve as inputs for the model. In the loss function construction module, a boundary constraint loss is designed by extracting the upper and lower boundaries of wind power output using the alpha shape algorithm and Local Weighted Linear Regression based on wind speed and power data. Notably, the parameters of boundaries are dynamically updated to capture the volatility of wind power. Additionally, an error distribution shape loss is introduced to penalize the deviation of the training error distribution from the normal distribution, using Jensen-Shannon divergence as an indicator. Case studies across 30 wind farms demonstrate that the proposed method guided by interpretable knowledge achieves the best average performance across all time horizons compared to baseline models. The method also shows strong robustness in noise and missing data experiments.</description></item><item><title>Novel Unified Control Framework for Networked RES-BES Microgrids With Enhanced Performance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11120450</link><description>The increasing deployment of renewable energy sources (RESs) facilitates the interconnection of distributed energy networks, thereby maximizing the utilization of the unevenly distributed RESs. Networked hybrid ac/dc microgrids enable regional multi-terminal networks at end-user sites, offering plug-and-play integration for RESs and battery energy storage systems (BESs) through synergistic ac/dc complementarity. However, this interconnected configuration introduces increased complexity in control strategies and poses significant power management challenges for RES-BES microgrids, as sudden RES fluctuations demand system-wide BES compensation to prevent local overloads. This paper proposes a unified droop control-based framework for networked hybrid microgrids comprising RESs, BESs and loads. The proposed approach enables seamless transitions between operational modes, proportional power sharing, and enhanced operation without circulating currents or overstressing components. Furthermore, it inherently addresses abrupt source failures and asymmetric line faults without requiring adjustments in the primary control methods, ensuring uninterrupted maximum power harvest of RESs. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through case studies using real-time simulation platform Typhoon-HIL.</description></item><item><title>Time-Varying Inertia Characterization of DFIG-Based Wind Turbines for Power System Frequency Dynamic Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11113495</link><description>Accurately assessing the inertial response of renewable energy generation (REG) is critical for frequency stability. However, REG represented by doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbine (WT) exhibits inherent time-varying inertia behavior, fundamentally distinct from synchronous generators (SGs). Prevailing inertia assessment methods predominantly rely on SG-derived time-domain inertia constants, which cannot capture this intrinsic variability. Consequently, the rationality of directly applying these conventional methods to DFIG-based WT lacks theoretical justification. To address this gap, this paper derives an expression for calculating time-varying inertia using the angular momentum theorem. Results demonstrate that inertia in the time domain dynamically varies with disturbances, highlighting the significant limitations of conventional inertia descriptions. Alternatively, a frequency-domain inertia characterization method is investigated to provide a disturbance-independent description of inertia, effectively capturing its intrinsic time-varying nature. Due to the duality between time and frequency domains, this paper mathematically describes the relationship between frequency-domain inertia and time-domain inertia, explicitly clarifying the physical meaning of inertia in the frequency domain. Simulations on an IEEE 39-bus system verify that the frequency-domain inertia method accurately captures inertia dynamics and is suitable for frequency stability analysis. These findings emphasize frequency-domain inertia characterization as an essential method for representing inertia in renewable-rich power systems.</description></item><item><title>Wind Turbulence-Induced Power Fluctuations Mitigation in PMSG-Based Wind Turbines by a Coordinated Control Scheme</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11106269</link><description>Power fluctuations in large-scale wind turbines (WTs), induced by persistent wind turbulences, can degrade the reliability of power modules and increase mechanical stress on light-strength structural components. These issues entail intricate challenges for system operators in terms of operation and maintenance. This paper investigates specifications of power fluctuations in PMSG-based WTs and presents a control scheme advantageous both below and above the rated wind speed, without requiring additional energy storage devices. This work strives to bridge the gap between the complicated art of WT modeling and wind turbulence-induced power fluctuations aiming to reveal the origin of power fluctuations in terms of operating regions and control strategies. In the proposed control scheme, the power fluctuations are mitigated without any auxiliary control terms below the nominal wind speed. Above the nominal wind speed, the power smoothing action is performed via three items, in which the machine side converter (MSC) virtually regulates the rotor inertia, the grid side converter (GSC) exerts the damping component, and the pitch control system helps enhance the damping mechanism. The feedback gains of the auxiliary terms are optimized while considering their interactions. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed control scheme effectively mitigates both the electrical and mechanical oscillations.</description></item><item><title>Incorporating Frequency Security Constraints in Two-Stage Robust Unit Commitment of Integrated Transmission and Distribution System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11098731</link><description>With the integration of high-proportion renewable energies, the independent operation of the transmission and distribution systems (T&amp;amp;DSs) makes it difficult to achieve optimal scheduling and ensure frequency security. Therefore, this paper proposes a two-stage robust frequency-constrained unit commitment (TRO-FCUC) model of T&amp;amp;DS. Firstly, the impacts of distributed energy resources (DERs) frequency regulation capabilities on inertial response and primary frequency response (PFR) are considered, and dynamic frequency constraints considering the cooperation of thermal units, wind farms, and DERs with their inertia-based frequency reserve are constructed. Then, the TRO-FCUC model is formulated to address uncertainties of wind farms (WFs) and distributed photovoltaics (DPVs) based on uncertainty sets. Further, the column and constraint generation (C&amp;amp;CG) algorithm and strong duality theory are utilized to transform the TRO-FCUC model into a mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) model and then solve it iteratively. Finally, case analyses proposed demonstrate that the coordinated operation of T&amp;amp;DS can fully mobilize the frequency regulation potential of DERs and improve the operation&#8217;s economy while ensuring the frequency security of the system.</description></item><item><title>Novel Series-Isolated-Parallel Wind Farm DC Collection System With New Control Strategies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11105057</link><description>Offshore wind farm (WF) DC collection systems offer significant reductions in weight and size compared to conventional AC systems. Among DC architectures, the series-parallel wind farm (SP-WF) configuration achieves higher efficiency by reducing the number of power conversion stages. However, because SP-WF places the DC-DC converter upstream of the series connection of wind turbines (WTs), it suffers from reduced reliability due to its vulnerability to DC short-circuit faults within the series string. This paper proposes a novel series-isolated-parallel wind farm (SIP-WF) architecture that enhances reliability by integrating a DC-DC converter to isolate each group of series-connected WTs. This isolation provides intrinsic DC fault blocking capability without the need for external DC circuit breakers. Furthermore, as only passive rectifiers are used at each individual WT, the proposed SIP-WF architecture maintains high efficiency. To manage maximum power point tracking (MPPT) across turbines experiencing different wind conditions, two new centralized control strategies are proposed to coordinate multiple WTs using a single DC-DC converter per group. The proposed SIP-WF architecture and control strategies are validated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink. A comprehensive performance comparison is conducted against existing DC collection topologies. The results demonstrate that SIP-WF achieves a higher net energy yield while reducing cost, system weight, and volume, and offering superior fault tolerance compared to conventional architectures.</description></item><item><title>Fault Ride-Through Strategy for Grid-Forming Converters Satisfying Multi-Objective Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11091548</link><description>Transient synchronization stability (TSS), current limitation and reactive power support (RPS) are the key objectives for fault ride-through (FRT) that grid-forming converters (GFMCs) must satisfy. However, the complex coupling restraints among these objectives, along with the fact that GFMC cannot directly control current due to its voltage-source nature, present significant challenges for FRT. To address these issues, this paper first analyzes the coupling relationships among the three objectives, and reveals the formations and control mechanisms of phase current, reactive current, and fault inrush current in GFMC. Inspired these insights, an adaptive FRT strategy is designed by cooperatively adjusting the active power and voltage references, as well as the adaptive virtual resistance, which satisfies FRT multi-objective constraints even if the voltage sags to 0. And it is straightforward to implement. Furthermore, the proposed FRT strategy is shown to exhibit superior TSS and RPS performance, as demonstrated through region of attraction and voltage phase portraits. Finally, simulation and experiment results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed FRT strategy.</description></item><item><title>Transient Stability Analysis of MMC-HVDC Connected DFIG-Based Wind Farms in the Electromechanical Timescale</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11106276</link><description>This paper investigates the transient stability of doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind farms connected via a modular multilevel converter (MMC)-based high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission system in the electromechanical timescale. During faults, the MMC tends to be switched to the current-limiting mode, which further interacts with the control systems of DFIG-based wind farms, thereby complicating the transient stability problem. In this paper, a large-signal model is constructed for transient stability analysis under this condition. The transient stability mechanism is revealed, and a transient stability index that considers the impact of a phase-locked loop in the electromechanical timescale is derived. The proposed index quantitatively assesses the instability risk arising from the coupled interaction between the DFIG-based wind farms and the MMC. In addition, the impacts of the current- limiting mode and other parameters (i.e., speed control loop gains, rotor shaft damping, inertia coefficient and fault location and severity) are analyzed. Based on the results of the parametric analysis, a suite of targeted countermeasures is proposed to enhance the transient stability of the power system. Finally, a theoretical analysis is demonstrated and verified through hardware-in-the-loop simulations using the Modeling Tech microgrid real-time simulation platform.</description></item><item><title>A Quantitative Accommodation Guaranteed Robust Scheduling Method for Renewable Power System With Dynamic Uncertainty Set</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11090046</link><description>Wind power generation (WPG) has been increasingly integrated into power systems to reduce carbon emissions. However, its inherent volatility and stochasticity have significantly challenged the reliable system operation and effective accommodation. In this paper, a robust scheduling method with a quantitative accommodation guarantee for power systems with WPG integration is proposed. First, a dynamic uncertainty set (DUS) of WPG is introduced, and a stochastic accommodation rate (SAR) indicator is accordingly proposed and derived to quantify the attainable accommodation level. Based on the DUS, a robust scheduling method is proposed, in which the implicit affine strategy (IAS) is adapted to guarantee the nonanticipativity of scheduling strategies. Moreover, a SAR constraint is carefully built according to the assessment result of the power system&#8217;s maximal and minimal SAR and embedded into the scheduling model to provide a quantitative accommodation guarantee. An illustrative case is presented to validate the effectiveness of the SAR indicator. Numerical simulations in the modified 6-bus, 14-bus, and 118-bus power systems validate the superiority of the proposed scheduling method.</description></item><item><title>Current Control and DC Capacitor Dynamic Interaction in a Cross-Timescale Manner in DFIG-WT Dominated Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11088231</link><description>The Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) based wind turbine (WT) contains control loops and energy storage components operating across multiple timescales, leading to potential cross-timescale influence dynamics in DFIG-WT-dominated power systems. Previous analyses have primarily focused on single timescale dynamics or the interactions between control loops at different timescales, with limited attention given to the cross-timescale influences between control loops and energy storage components. This paper aims to reveal the cross-timescale influence mechanism of current control at the AC-current-control timescale on the dynamics of the DC capacitor at the DC-voltage-control timescale. Modal analysis is a mature method used to uncover the cross-timescale influence phenomena and laws of current control on the dynamics of the DC capacitor. Subsequently, an equivalent circuit model is established to analyze the mechanism by which current control affects the dynamics of the DC capacitor. Finally, the conclusions are validated through simulations based on a four-machine two-area power system and the power grid of Northwest China.</description></item><item><title>Rapid Active Power Regulation of Distributed Photovoltaics Based on Optimal Dynamic Droop Coefficients</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11095309</link><description>To realize the active response for rapid active power regulation of massive distributed photovoltaics (DPVs), a bi-level architecture integrating clustering and optimization is proposed for the coordinated design of dynamic droop coefficients of DPVs in this paper. At the lower level, the adjustable capacity and response time are selected as clustering features according to the rapid active power regulation requirements, and the U-k-means algorithm is applied to implement the clustering of DPVs. At the upper level, a frequency deviation-optimal droop coefficient model incorporating the regulation performance and network losses is developed in a perspective that considers power flow impacts. The droop coefficient regulation strategy under various frequency fluctuations is pre-calculated by a graph attention network (GAT). Simulations are performed on a modified IEEE 33-bus test system, and the results verify the outperformance of the proposed GAT model over the existing neural network models, as well as the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed optimal droop coefficient regulation strategy.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Energy Management of Hybrid Energy Storage System With Application to Wave Energy Converters: A Learning-Augmented MPC Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11090041</link><description>Integrating hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) into wave energy converters (WECs) can mitigate power fluctuations of WECs across multiple timescales, provided that an effective energy management strategy (EMS) is implemented. Model predictive control (MPC) is the mainstream EMS for HESSs, as it typically yields a control solution close to the global optimum while satisfying constraints. However, MPC faces a high computational burden when the optimal control problem is nonlinear. More importantly, considering multiple competing objectives, tuning weighting factors (WFs) in the MPC cost function is also challenging. To tackle these challenges, this article proposes a learning-augmented MPC strategy to optimize energy management for the HESS in WECs. The strategy first utilizes a fuzzy logic-based asymmetric action trimming technique to reduce MPC computational time. Further, a warm-start Q-learning (QL) framework with high learning efficiency is applied to obtain the WF online tuning method. To bridge the simulation-to-reality gap in the QL framework, the article designs a neural network-based current predictor, aiming to sense the nonlinear power loss during power conversion. Finally, simulations and experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed strategy in reducing energy loss, battery degradation, and MPC computational burden.</description></item><item><title>Spatio-Temporal Probabilistic Forecasting of Wind Speed Using Transformer-Based Diffusion Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11091547</link><description>Spatio-temporal wind speed forecasting plays a crucial role in enhancing energy conversion efficiency and optimizing resource allocation, forming a cornerstone of sustainable development. However, existing methods for spatio-temporal wind speed forecasting face challenges in capturing intricate spatio-temporal dependencies and adapting to dynamic variations in wind speed data. To address these limitations, we propose the Probabilistic Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Transformer (PSTDT), a novel model that combines the generative power of denoising diffusion probabilistic models with the robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities of Transformers. This approach introduces a dual-spatial attention module to model static positional relationships and dynamic dependencies from historical data, thereby capturing evolving spatial correlations. Additionally, PSTDT integrates a dual-phase temporal module for modeling cross-period temporal dependencies alongside auto-regressive temporal features, enhancing its capacity to address the complexities of time-series forecasting. Furthermore, a temporal-adaptive layer normalization is incorporated to dynamically adjust normalization parameters, improving the model&#8217;s forecast accuracy and stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PSTDT outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, reducing continuous ranked probability score by 8% &#8211;20% and mean absolute error by 7% &#8211;19% .</description></item><item><title>End-to-End Collaborative Optimization for Active Distribution Network Power Dispatch Based on Sparse Model-Ensemble Learning Policy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119768</link><description>With the higher penetration of distributed renewable power sources, novel active distribution networks are increasingly implementing flexible adjustment strategies. Currently, the dual uncertainties from both sources and demand significantly affect power dispatch in distribution networks. Typically, power dispatch is performed using a predict-then-optimize approach, making it challenging to quantify the gap between the real-time and theoretically optimal dispatch performances due to inaccuracies in power predictions. Hence, this study introduces a novel end-to-end policy to solve a collaborative optimization between prediction and dispatch. The policy directly utilizes all available information, such as gridded numerical weather forecasts, for dispatch decision-making, which eliminates the need for power predictions as intermediate variables for dispatch. To address the challenges of high-dimensional and open-scenario model training in end-to-end policies, sparse model-ensemble learning is proposed to formulate the dispatch policy model. The model is solved using constrained policy optimization. Comparative studies show that the proposed end-to-end policy outperforms the predict-then-optimize policy in real-time dispatch cases involving photovoltaic reactive power ancillary service and demand response within distribution networks.</description></item><item><title>LPV Model Predictive Control for Offshore Wind Farms Considering Wake Delay Characteristics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11082107</link><description>The pronounced wake effect in large-scale offshore wind farm necessitates careful consideration of its delay characteristics, which are crucial yet often overlooked in control. Addressing the coupling between the dynamic evolution of wake effects and the parameter changes of the WT control model, this paper introduces a Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) model predictive control method that considers wake delay characteristics. Through the development of a quasi-steady state wake model, the wake delay characteristic is incorporated within an LPV model for the wind farm. A two-stage dimensionality reduction method is proposed to simplify the calculation, and a model predictive control (MPC) method is combined to optimize the fatigue damage balance and power generation enhancement in the wind farm coordinately. Simulation results from a wind farm consisting of 16 wind turbines validate the efficacy of the quasi-steady state wake model in depicting the spatial distribution of wake delays. Furthermore, in dynamically varying wind speed and directions scenarios, the proposed control method can effectively capture the wind speed delay and fluctuation characteristics between different wind turbines, leading to heightening power output and diminishing fatigue stresses. Notably, in comparison to the static model control, the adaptive parameter tuning mechanism inherent in the proposed method effectively curtails control overshoot, enhancing overall system performance.</description></item><item><title>Fast Frequency Response in Low Inertia Grids via Integrated Supercapacitor Energy Storage Systems and Wind Turbine Generators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11082652</link><description>The increasing penetration of inverter-based resources in modern power systems has led to a significant reduction in system inertia, creating challenges for maintaining grid frequency stability. To address these issues, a new ancillary service market, termed &#8220;Fast Frequency Response (FFR)&#8221;, has emerged. FFR mandates rapid power delivery from renewable energy sources,including wind power systems, immediately following contingency events to alleviate frequency drops in a few seconds. This paper presents a control method combining supercapacitor energy storage systems and wind turbine generators to enhance the FFR capabilities of wind power systems and mitigate the frequency drop. This approach ensures the readiness of supercapacitor energy storage systems to provide FFR services under diverse wind conditions. Additionally, a control scheme for the wind turbine generator is developed to optimize its participation in FFR across a range of wind speeds while maintaining a stable operation of the wind power system. The results demonstrate that, while preserving an equivalent investment cost to that of supercapacitor banks, wind power systems can significantly increase their FFR contributions. This improvement effectively addresses critical frequency stability challenges in low-inertia grids. Eventually, the proposed method is validated through real-time experiments on a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) setup.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Evolution and Stability Analysis of GFM-Based Renewable Energy Resources Considering Repeated &amp; Continuous Current Saturation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11079878</link><description>The current saturation (CS) strategy of grid-forming renewable energy sources (GFM-RESs) is designed to protect the device from overcurrent damages. However, the potential switching processes of control strategies trigger new stability issues. It is revealed that two emerging stability issues, i.e., repeated current saturation (R-CS) and continuous current saturation (C-CS) governed by the inherent inconsistency of switching conditions, will occur when the system operates into the corresponding virtual power angle (VPA) region. This paper adopts the hybrid system theory to analyze such stability issues by deriving the necessary and sufficient switching conditions of current saturation and desaturation. During R-CS, the GFM-RES externally behaves as an abnormal current source, triggering adverse high-frequency oscillations. When subject to C-CS, the system will suffer from persistent overvoltage issues and cannot return to its initial operating point. To identify the stability risks of these two issues and offer guidance for GFM-RES&#8217;s controller design, a novel R&amp;amp;C-CS criterion, along with a generic desaturation region-based (DRB) principle, is proposed. Meanwhile, a switching condition and dynamic characteristic decoupling control (S&amp;amp;D-DC) is developed based on the DRB principle to prevent the R&amp;amp;C-CS issues. High-fidelity electromagnetic transient simulations conducted on both single-machine and multi-machine systems validate the theoretical derivations and proposed control strategy.</description></item><item><title>Interpretable Augmented Ambiguity Set for Quantifying Regional Wind Power Uncertainty in Distributionally Robust Optimal Dispatch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11082100</link><description>A large-scale grid penetration of wind power has posed severe uncertainty challenges for power system operation. This paper comes up with an interpretable augmented ambiguity set assisted by deep learning for two-stage economic dispatch formulated in a distributionally robust optimization, aiming at precisely representing regional wind power uncertainty. The specifically designed augmented ambiguity set is driven by both the fine-grained uncertainty model of each wind farm and interactive dependencies among different sites. In particular, a multi-teacher knowledge distillation-time generative adversarial network (MKD-time GAN) is presented for the first time to form a spherical ambiguity set gathering all possible distributions for power prediction error of single wind farm. This model leverages a cascaded learning framework by typical teacher-time GANs to jointly educate one general student-time GAN so as to induce a family of comprehensive reference distributions as an ambiguity set. Further, multiple ambiguity sets are mapped into augmented ambiguity set, an interdependent joint probability distribution space for regional prediction error by Nataf transformation. Based on that, a tractable solution algorithm of two-stage optimal dispatch is explicitly derived and saves computation scale. The benefits of both novel MKD-time GAN and decision-making dispatch schemes are demonstrated in IEEE 118-bus systems.</description></item><item><title>Tri-layer Distributed Scheduling for Coastal Integrated Transmission-Distribution-Gas System With Uncertain Typhoons-Affected Offshore Wind Power</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11075623</link><description>This paper addresses the scheduling challenges associated with offshore wind power within coastal power systems during uncertain typhoons. The proposed tri-layer chance-constrained coordinated scheduling model differs from existing formulations through two major innovations. First, unlike the deterministic scheduling under forecasted typhoons, it implements a scenario-based stochastic programming to address the wind power deviations resulting from the typhoon uncertainties, while additionally factoring in the potential damage to wind turbines. Second, moving beyond the isolated scheduling of thermal units in the transmission network, the proposed model enables a distributed coordination of diverse flexible resources across the distribution and gas networks to mitigate typhoon damage, resulting in a more complex tri-layer scheduling framework. These advancements introduce marked challenges for model solution. To handle this, a mix-sample average approximation method is introduced to reformulate the original random variables involved model into a tractable linear form. Moreover, a novel efficient distributed solution methodology is proposed to tackle the specific nested interactions within the tri-layer scheduling framework. Case studies verify the economic and reliability advantages of the proposed model, with 20.2% average cost saving and over 90% decrease in imbalanced power, as well as the computational superiority of the proposed distributed solution for significantly reduced solution time.</description></item><item><title>A Two-Stage Ultra-Short-Term Wind Power Forecasting Method Based on Transitional Weather Identification and Meteorological Prediction Error Propagation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11078806</link><description>Accurate and reliable wind power forecasting is crucial for the safe and economical operation of power systems. However, under transitional weather conditions, the forecasting errors of meteorological variables such as wind speed tend to increase, introducing significant input noise into wind power prediction models and reducing their reliability. To address this, this paper focuses on analyzing the error propagation mechanism of meteorological input variables and proposes a strategy to improve short-term wind power forecasting accuracy under transitional weather conditions. First, transitional weather periods are identified by analyzing the fluctuation characteristics of multi-dimensional meteorological variables. Then, a two-stage model combining Sparse Variational Gaussian Process (SVGP) and Noisy Input Gaussian Process (NIGP) is proposed. In this model, noisy input data (wind speed predictions) are decomposed into true data (actual wind speed) and noise data (forecast errors), which are modeled independently. By considering the propagation process of input noise in wind power forecasting and making necessary corrections, the SVGP-NIGP model provides more accurate deterministic forecasts and higher-quality interval predictions. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly enhances wind power forecasting accuracy under transitional weather conditions, offering an effective solution to address the uncertainties arising from meteorological forecasting.</description></item><item><title>Self-Optimizing Local Voltage Control of SOP in Active Distribution Networks Based on Lift-Dimension Mapping Linearization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11072306</link><description>The high penetration of distributed generators (DGs) deteriorates the voltage violations in active distribution networks (ADNs). Owing to the flexible adjustment capacity, the local power regulation provided by soft open point (SOP) presents a promising solution for eliminating voltage violations in ADNs. A data-driven local control method can fully excavate the potential logic from operational data without requiring precious network parameters. However, the training data may be insufficient in practical applications. In this paper, a self-optimizing local voltage control method for SOP is proposed to achieve adaptive control in label-poor conditions. First, a SOP local control model is constructed based on lift-dimension mapping linearization (LDML), which portrays the complex relationship between ADN states and SOP control strategies. Subsequently, a self-optimizing guidance mechanism is established to obtain the label data of SOP control strategy, which provides a large number of training samples for the local control model. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using a practical distribution network with a four-terminal SOP. Results demonstrate that efficient control strategies can be determined based on local state measurements. A rapid response to DG fluctuations can be achieved while enhancing the adaptability to variations in practical operations.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Optimized Parameter Tuning Algorithm for Wind Turbine Grid-Forming Control to Mitigate Power Oscillations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11068198</link><description>As the transition from synchronous generators (SGs) to renewable energy sources (RESs) accelerates, grid forming wind turbines (GFM-WTs) are increasingly expected to play a critical role in maintaining power system stability. However, the integration of GFM without thoroughly considering the interaction between the outer and inner control loops can induce power oscillations. Therefore, this paper offers a systematic sensitivity analysis to explicitly reveal how the control parameters contribute to power oscillations in the GFM-WT system. This analysis is based on a linearized state-space model for the GFM-WT system, incorporating comprehensive system dynamics and control strategies. Furthermore, an optimized control algorithm is developed based on a comprehensive small-signal model, incorporating essential constraints such as the eigenvalue damping ratio and the control loop bandwidth. The algorithm autonomously tunes the control parameters of both the inner and outer loop systems, resulting in optimal parameter values. A comprehensive stability analysis was conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in ensuring system stability. The proposed method is verified through various scenario in modified WSCC 9-bus and New England 39-bus systems. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm effectively mitigates power oscillations in the WT output, subsequently reducing power oscillations in the SG.</description></item><item><title>Deterministic and Probabilistic Forecasting of Wind Power Generation and Ramp Rate With Expectation-Implemented Deep Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11068153</link><description>Accurate day-ahead forecasting of wind power generation, both deterministically and probabilistically, is crucial for reliable and efficient power system operations, and its significance will increase in renewable energy-dominant power systems. Furthermore, inherent variability of wind farms necessitates day-ahead ramp rate forecasting to ensure stable energy balancing. To address these needs, we propose an hourly day-ahead forecasting framework that concurrently predicts the wind power generation and ramp rate. This framework leverages expectation-implemented deep learning models trained by the custom loss functions tailored to the different signal attributes and our distinct expectations. Additional strategies, such as feature generation and a feedforward error learning model, are implemented to enhance forecasting performance while maintaining a balance between tasks. Finally, our framework integrates heterogeneous generation and ramp rate forecasting results, incorporating probabilistic ramp rate forecasting derived from the synthesized output. We validate our approach using real wind power data and assess the impact of each proposed method individually. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly contribute to identifying the intrinsic volatility of wind power, thereby fully exploiting its potential benefits.</description></item><item><title>Optimal BESS Management for Peak Load Shaving and Battery Health Under Prediction Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11071638</link><description>In modern power grids, integrating renewable energy sources (RESs), deploying battery energy storage systems (BESSs) is increasingly vital for mitigating power fluctuations. However, optimizing BESS operation remains challenging amidst uncertainties in both RES and load forecasting. This paper proposes a novel stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) framework for BESS operation, focusing on peak load shaving and battery health while addressing prediction uncertainties. The proposed framework employs a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network for forecasting and integrates a constraint-tightening technique into a stochastic optimization (SO) problem with a receding horizon. Based on the load profile of a company in Germany, the proposed framework achieves an additional reduction of 99 kW (5.8%) in peak grid take-out power compared with the traditional model predictive control (MPC) approach, demonstrating its advantage in addressing uncertainties.</description></item><item><title>PMU-Based Power Oscillation Damping Control for Renewable Energy System With Communication Disruption and Multi-Time Delays</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11071336</link><description>This paper presents a novel model-free power oscillation damping strategy for renewable energy (RE) system considering communication disruption and multiple time delays in control loops. First, a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process-enabled online estimation method is developed for state-space modeling estimation only using measurement data. This estimation method is applicable to systems with different delays in each wide-area control loop. Subsequently, a novel wide-area power oscillation damper (POD) is designed for the renewable energy sources (RESs) and that is further reconstructed in a decomposition manner to achieve independently sub-control, which allows to retain better damping performance under communication disruption. After that, the POD parameter settings are carefully tuned, where the time delay and estimation error are considered, formulated as stability constraints using Razumikhin theorem, and solved via linear matrix inequality (LMI), yielding multi-dimensional robustness of the system, including operating conditions, time delay and communication disruption. Case studies in the improved 4-machine 2-area system and IEEE 39-bus system show that the proposed method can accurately estimate the state-space modeling of closed-loop system and effectively dampen power oscillations in time delay and communication disruption scenarios.</description></item><item><title>A Unified Method for Assessing Frequency Support Capability of Diverse Renewable Power Generation Units</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11061796</link><description>The proliferation of renewable power generation units (RGUs) deteriorates the physical inertia of the system, making the evaluation of unit-level frequency support capability (FSC) and system-level frequency stability increasingly important. However, the prior-art approaches lack a standardized framework for FSC assessment, and the non-disclosure of RGU information by manufacturers exacerbates this challenge. To address these issues, this paper proposes a unified transfer function structure (UTFS) model and its parameter solving method based on impedance measurement, enabling a unified assessment of both the unit-level FSC and system-level frequency stability. The unit-level UTFS can be obtained through frequency-domain approaches, e.g., xy-impedance measurements. Moreover, the system-level UTFS can be acquired through the simple aggregation of unit-level UTFS. Without detailed models or post-event data, the proposed framework uniformly represents the FSC of various RGUs through three key indicators: effective inertia, damping, and primary frequency regulation (PFR). Furthermore, the proposed method analytically derives system frequency indicators: frequency nadir, rate of change of frequency (RoCoF), and steady-state frequency deviation.

This article presents a two-stage coordination approach for mobile charging robots (MCRs) and active distribution networks (ADN). In the first stage, we maximize the total revenue for the MCRs from providing charging services for electric vehicles (EVs) and interacting with the ADN within a frame-based time scale, where the duration of each frame is determined by the charging decisions of MCRs. Furthermore, we consider the long-term objectives of meeting the battery energy deficit constraint for each MCR, thereby improving their battery life. Lyapunov optimization is utilized to transform frame-based scheduling into an optimization problem within a specified time slot, simplifying the process of solving the optimization problem. To avoid affecting charging efficiency when MCRs interact with the power grid, we use the reactive power of free MCRs to provide voltage regulation support for the ADN, improving power quality and minimizing total network loss simultaneously. Decoupling active and reactive power in two stages ensures both the profitability of the MCRs cluster and the voltage security of the ADN, resulting in a win-win situation. The simulation results, based on the 18-bus and 51-bus distribution networks, confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Assessing Grid Penalized Reinforcement Learning for Renewable Energy Management of Power-to-X Integrated With Intermediate Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11051013</link><description>This research explores the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based planning strategies of power-to-X (PtX) systems under uncertainties of renewable and price through a detailed case study and comparative analysis of system planning. A DRL-based hourly planning model is proposed to minimize operational costs for a PtX system, incorporating a hybrid energy storage system. The model employs a grid-penalized reward function to manage grid power usage while accounting for temporal uncertainties in renewable and grid prices. To analyze the DRL model&#8217;s planning strategies, it is compared to a general rule-based model across varying spatial and temporal uncertainties using real-world data from national (France) areas. The results show that the DRL-based planning approach consistently outperforms the rule-based model, achieving 1,360.12% higher monthly profits in the national area, though with a relatively lower renewable energy penetration (REP). However, sensitivity analysis reveals that increasing the grid penalty level effectively reduces the gap in REP while sustaining higher profitability. This comparative analysis is the first to quantitatively reveal the planning strategies of a DRL-based PtX system, highlighting its effectiveness in reducing grid power overuse while maintaining higher profitability in system planning.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Proximal Policy Optimization With Embedded Dual Rules for Power Systems Considering Wind and Photovoltaic Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11059762</link><description>Most renewable energy power systems are created to provide more resilient, reliable, economical, sustainable and secure power support services for loads. However, owing to the inherent forecasting errors of wind and photovoltaic (PV) power, existing optimal dispatch decisions based on forecasting errors have biases. To address this issue, this paper proposes the distributed proximal policy optimization (DPPO) model with embedded dual rules for optimal power dispatch that considers wind and PV power forecasting error correction. The proposed model embeds forecasting and error correction information into the DPPO state space. Moreover, considering the physical characteristics and operational security constraints of the power grid, power balance and flow constraints are embedded in the DPPO network in a regular form. Finally, by integrating the established rules, wind and PV forecasting, and error correction information, the proposed model achieves optimal dispatch decisions through the calculation of state and execution of prescribed actions. The proposed method is applied and tested on a modified IEEE-30 bus system using actual data from a provincial power grid. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively addresses optimal dispatch decisions caused by wind and PV forecasting errors. Compared with three other advanced methods, the proposed approach has significant advantages in promoting wind power accommodation, reducing operating costs, and enhancing the adaptability of optimal dispatch to uncertainty.</description></item><item><title>An End-to-End Ensemble Learning Approach for Enhancing Wind Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11048619</link><description>Accurate wind power forecasts are crucial for grid stability, thereby ensuring a reliable and efficient power supply. To characterize the complicated fluctuation of wind power, numerous ensemble models with multiple base forecasters have been developed. However, most existing ensemble forecasting models contain several modeling stages, which increases the risk of error accumulation and inefficiency in model training. Moreover, the limited number of base forecasters results in forecasts with reduced diversity, thereby diminishing the performance of ensemble models. To address these challenges, MG-DS, a simple but efficient end-to-end ensemble learning model based on the Dempster-Shafer (DS) evidence theory, is proposed to unify base model learning and ensemble learning into a single process. It comprises an all-MLP-based nonlinear feature extraction module, a GRU and cross attention-based base forecast generation module, and a DS-based self-ensemble forecasting module with a DS-based magnifying glass to enhance the diversity of base forecasts. Further, a DS-based self-ensemble (DSSE) plugin is proposed to integrate the trained RNN-type and non-RNN-type base forecasters. Experiments on five wind power datasets show that MG-DS outperforms popular wind power forecasting models and ensemble techniques, and the effectiveness of the DSSE plugin is also validated in enhancing the performance of ensemble wind power forecasting.</description></item><item><title>A Fully Distributed Incentive Mechanism for Integrated Electricity and Heat Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045415</link><description>Coordination between electric power systems (EPS) and district heating systems (DHS) integrates more renewable energy and improves economic benefits. However, the dispatch of integrated electricity and heat systems (IEHS) raises privacy and incentive concerns. To address these issues, we propose a fully distributed incentive mechanism for IEHS. Specifically, the combined heat and power dispatch (CHPD) model is transformed into a monotone variational inequality (MVI) and solved by a fully distributed predictor-corrector algorithm (FDPCA). With FDPCA, the EPS and DHS operators can dispatch independently. Additionally, we use a novel two-stage benefit allocation approach based on Nash bargaining to distribute profits while simplifying computational complexity. Case studies demonstrate that the fully distributed incentive mechanism effectively protects privacy, enhances efficiency, and promotes cooperation.</description></item><item><title>Adaptable Parameters Estimation for Microgrid Distributed Energy Resources Using Modified Physics-Informed Neural Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045087</link><description>Parameters estimation in microgrids remains challenging due to ambiguous system dynamics brought by distributed energy resources (DERs) and scarcity of data. This study presents a modified physics-informed neural network (PINN) paradigmdesigned for parameters estimation under such constraints. This paper introduces two main innovations: First, by combining small-signal analysis with the PINN framework for ordinary differential equations, we introduce an adaptable parameter estimation paradigm applicable to different types of DERs in microgrid. Second, we introduce a modified data transformation that reduces training time by up to 82.87% compared to traditional PINN approaches at best. To validate our approach, we conducted simulation on two typical system setups based on open-source real-world microgrid using real-time digital simulation to generate data. We evaluate the proposed method by using an error margin below 5% as a key metric to confirm its robustness and accuracy for different types of DERs. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed method across varying ordinary differential equations to diverse mathematical models. Additionally, suboptimal and failed cases are analyzed and discussed to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the method&#8217;s limitations.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Fractional Programming-Based Planning Model for 100% Renewable Poly-Generation of Electricity and Methanol</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045219</link><description>Engaging in long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with renewable energy producers (REPs) is a promising strategy for decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors, such as internet data centers. However, due to the inherent volatility and intermittency of renewable energy sources (RES), REPs typically require substantial over-installation of capacity to meet fixed PPA delivery commitments, resulting in significant energy curtailment and increased supply costs. Power-to-methanol (P2M) offers a viable pathway for large-scale integration of RES by providing flexible chemical storage and demand. This study proposes a unified planning framework for the 100% renewable poly-generation of electricity and methanol, considering both flexible and inflexible loads. The objective is to maximize the internal rate of return (IRR), a key metric for investment decision-making. To this end, a mixed-integer linear fractional programming (MILFP) model is developed and solved in a computationally tractable manner. The model is validated using real-world data. Results show that the proposed approach significantly improves IRR, reduces RES curtailment, and lowers the levelized costs of both electricity and methanol. Furthermore, the model effectively coordinates electricity delivery under PPA constraints with methanol synthesis, offering an economically robust solution for renewable energy utilization and sector coupling.</description></item><item><title>Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning Method for Volt/Var Control in Active Distribution Network With Safe Operation Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045109</link><description>In recent years, distributed energy resources (DERs) in power systems have been increasingly integrated into the distribution network. DERs will improve the flexibility and economy of active distribution networks (ADNs) while introducing increased complexity and challenges in maintaining stable and efficient system operations. The traditional voltage regulation methods struggle to cope with these complexities, highlighting the need for more advanced and adaptive control strategies for fast-response PVs and battery energy storage systems (BESS). This paper proposes a novel Human-in-the-loop deep reinforcement learning (HITL-DRL) framework for Volt/Var control in ADNs, addressing the limitations of the existing approaches by integrating human experience and knowledge into the learning process. Additionally, a Security-Clipped Proximal Policy Optimization (SC-PPO) algorithm is introduced to ensure safe operation during reinforcement learning. The paper explores three human-intervention strategies: human demonstration, human feedback, and setting adversary, which enhance the learning process by leveraging expert knowledge and experience. The proposed HITL-DRL framework demonstrates improved convergence speed, robustness, reduced exploration risk, and increased interpretability and trust, paving the way for more effective voltage regulation in complex power systems. The proposed HITL-DRL method is verified in the IEEE 33-bus system, demonstrating superior performance over standard DRL algorithms in terms of training speed and robustness, achieving the highest average reward and the second-fastest computational time. Compared to traditional PPO, our method significantly excels in managing unforeseen contingencies, resulting in a lower voltage violation rate of 73.4%. Compared with the model-based method, the strategy of HITL-DRL is very close to that of optimization results in terms of energy loss and voltage violation rates. However, HITL-DRL shows advantages in decision-making time, responding within 1 millisecond, which is capable of rapidly adapting to time-vary changes in ADNs.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Flexibility Aggregation of Heterogeneous Demand-Side Energy Storages for Secondary Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11044873</link><description>Demand-side energy storages (DESs), such as household batteries and electric vehicles (EVs), have shown great potential in providing fast frequency regulation services. This paper proposes a three-layer hierarchical flexibility aggregation framework to fully evaluate and reliably realize the aggregate flexibility of heterogeneous DESs for secondary frequency regulation (SFR). At the device layer, the regulation capacity of an individual DES is modeled as a two-dimensional feasible region, with the real-time state-of-charge (SoC) constraint and the statistical features of regulation signals well considered. On this basis, heterogeneous DESs are divided into several clusters according to the geometry of their feasible region. At the cluster layer, regulation capacity, dynamic response model as well as regulation costs are efficiently aggregated within each DES cluster by prototype-based maximum inner approximation (MIA). At the aggregator layer, an analytical expression of the multi-cluster coordinated SFR flexibility can be formulated by convex optimizations at each feasible operating point, which provides a comprehensive model for DES aggregators to economically participate in SFR. Comparative simulations validate that the proposed method can accurately capture the aggregate SFR flexibility of heterogeneous DESs with lower flexibility loss and affordable computational burden, while the disaggregation feasibility of aggregate flexibility is further demonstrated using real-world regulation signals.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Autonomous Control for Global Economic Operation of AC/DC Microgrid Clusters Interconnected by Flexible DC Distribution Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045308</link><description>This paper presents a distributed autonomous control strategy for AC/DC microgrid clusters interconnected by the flexible DC distribution network to simultaneously achieve the global economic operation and frequency/voltage control of the system while complying with the power limits of DGs and interlinking converters.

In the MG-layer, the distributed frequency/voltage and economic dispatch controllers are designed for each ACMG and DCMG. In the MGC-layer, a distributed peer-to-peer control method is provided to realize the coordinated control among interlinking converters while controlling the voltage of DC distribution network. The coordination method between MG-layer and MGC-layer is also designed. Finally, time-domain simulation and experiments are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description></item><item><title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Allocation of Mobile Wind Turbines for Enhancing Resilience in Power Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045830</link><description>The growing adoption of wind energy resources has demonstrated notable benefits in combating climate change. Mobile wind turbines (MWTs) are uniquely positioned to navigate transportation systems, being towed by trucks, and supply energy to power distribution systems (PDSs). This flexibility enables MWTs to serve as emergency power sources, thereby contributing to enhancing the system resilience by facilitating service restoration following extreme events. This paper presents a novel framework based on Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) to dispatch MWTs for service restoration. Deep Q-learning (DQL) and Double Deep Q-learning (DDQL) approaches are implemented within the agent for training and comparison purposes. Additionally, an action limitation is incorporated into the proposed framework in order to mitigate the influence of wind power fluctuations. Case studies conducted on an integrated power-transport system, comprising a Sioux Falls transportation system and four IEEE 33-bus test systems, illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed restoration scheduling policy in enhancing PDSs&#8217; resilience against disasters.</description></item><item><title>Robust Unit Commitment With Multi-State Uncertainty: A Novel Formulation and Scalable Solution Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045107</link><description>To mitigate the conservatism of scheduling schemes derived from the two-stage robust unit commitment model (TS-RUCM), this paper proposes a novel multi-state uncertainty set (MSUS) considering the uncertain wind power output (WPO). The MSUS formulates WPO uncertainties with higher resolution by introducing multiple discrete state values within the uncertain interval. Additionally, the MSUS limits extreme fluctuations of WPO uncertainties among state values through transition indicators embedded in multiple transition constraints. The state values and transition indicators are calculated using the conditional quantile regression technique and Markov chain analysis. This systematic and scientific approach allows the MSUS to effectively exclude low-probability WPO scenarios, thereby significantly mitigating the conservatism of the scheduling schemes. Moreover, to accelerate the computation of the TS-RUCM based on the MSUS, this paper proposes an improved inexact column and constraint generation (II-C&amp;amp;CG) method. The II-C&amp;amp;CG method employs an adaptive tolerance strategy and refined backtracking to solve master and subproblems inexactly while ensuring finite convergence, significantly reducing computational time. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of both the MSUS and the II-C&amp;amp;CG method.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Artificial Intelligence and Physics-Based Modeling for Long-Term Cascaded Hydropower Scheduling Under Extreme Heat Events</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11059276</link><description>The operation of hydropower plants are significantly challenged by extreme heatwave events. This paper integrates artificial intelligence and a physics-based model to introduce an efficient long-term scheduling framework aimed at maximizing hydropower generation during extreme heat events. The water values derived from the proposed long-term scheduling model can be used in developing effective strategies for short-term hydropower scheduling. A physics-based evaporation model (PEM), which captures key land-atmosphere interactions, is developed to account for significant variations in reservoir evaporation rates during extreme heat events. A multivariate long short-term memory (M-LSTM) forecasting model is also utilized to predict the key input parameters required for both the PEM and the long-term scheduling problem. A regression-based machine learning algorithm is also utilized to estimate the hydropower production function, which enables linear integration of the nonlinear and nonconvex behavior of hydropower plant in the mixed-integer linear formulation of the scheduling problem. The proposed model is applied to a case study of eleven cascaded hydropower units located on the Columbia river. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed long-term scheduling model effectively manages reservoir operations, mitigating the adverse impacts of extreme heat events on hydropower generation and operator profitability.</description></item><item><title>Chance-Constrained Optimization for VPPs With Base Stations Considering Diverse Communication Rate Requirements</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11082584</link><description>5G Base Stations (BSs) consume a large amount of electricity, requiring predominantly green power, which brings huge pressure on their electricity costs. To reduce energy costs and carbon emissions, aggregating 5G BSs (Macro BS and Micro BS), and distributed renewable energy into virtual power plants (VPPs) to participate in market transactions has become a trend. However, the operation of VPPs faces challenges: the uncertainty of renewable energy output and the unclear regulation mechanism of BSs. Consequently, this paper focuses on developing an optimal scheduling strategy for VPPs, considering the schedulability of BSs and the uncertainty of internal renewable energy. Firstly, the flexibility of BSs with 4G and 5G modules is investigated, particularly in terms of transceivers and backup energy storage. The communication rates of BSs are modeled to evaluate the impact of active transceiver numbers on user experience. A dynamic time-domain model of backup energy storage capacity considering communication load is proposed. The impact of user mobility and overlapping coverage areas of BSs on communication rates is considered to be more in line with real-world scenarios. Subsequently, an optimization model is developed for VPPs to maximize the profit of engaging BSs in the day-ahead market transaction, considering diverse communication rate requirements. The optimization model determines the schedule of transceivers, backup energy storage, and other resources. Then, to control the operational risks associated with the uncertainty of internal distributed renewable energy outputs, the chance constraint is introduced. Furthermore, the Taylor expansion-based algorithm is applied to coordinately solve the VPP dispatching problem. Numerical simulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed models, which achieve a 5.4% increase in the proportion of internal renewable energy consumption and a 18.72% increase in economic benefits.</description></item><item><title>Synthetic Inertia Control for a Wind Turbine Generator Based on Event Size and Rotor Speed</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045832</link><description>To enhance the frequency nadir without causing the excessive deceleration of the rotor speed (${{{{\omega }}}_{{r}}}$), synthetic inertia control (SIC) schemes of a wind turbine generator (WTG) need to provide incremental power in response to event magnitude and ${{{{\omega }}}_{{r}}}$. Conventional stepwise SIC approaches face limitations during large events due to the increase of predefined incremental power, which does not match the actual event size. This paper presents an SIC strategy for WTGs that adjusts incremental power in relation to event size and ${{{{\omega }}}_{{r}}}$. During the frequency-support phase, the incremental power is modulated based on the frequency deviation, along with a control gain proportional to ${{{{\omega }}}_{{r}}}$, rather than the rate of change of frequency. While this approach accounts for the power imbalance, it remains vulnerable to noise and delays in practical applications. After the frequency-support phase, the proposed method decreases the active power reference in accordance with ${{{{\omega }}}_{{r}}}$, ensuring it stabilizes within a secure operating range. Following stabilization, the WTG transitions smoothly back to maximum power point tracking operation. Simulation results indicate that the proposed approach significantly enhances the frequency nadir during large events, even under low wind conditions, while avoiding excessive deceleration of the rotor speed.</description></item><item><title>Prototype Federated Reinforcement Learning for Voltage Regulation in Distribution Systems With Physics-Aware Spatial-Temporal Graph Perception</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045127</link><description>Online voltage regulation in active distribution systems faces challenges stemming from privacy protection concerns and uncertainties introduced by renewable energy sources. To address these issues, a novel spatial-temporal transformer-based prototype federated reinforcement learning (STT-PFRL) model is proposed to mitigate voltage deviations while ensuring data privacy. Specifically, STT-PFRL operating within a decentralized framework trains the model by transmitting local prototype information between a central data server and local agents, avoiding raw data privacy leakage. Besides, a novel physics-aware spatial-temporal transformer network is proposed to improve the voltage regulation policy learning stability against uncertainties by embedding the spatial-temporal graphical physics information into the data aggregation process. Furthermore, the prototype learning-based federated soft actor-critic (ProtoFedSAC) algorithm incorporates a prototype layer to utilize diverse feature representations, thereby enhancing the model&#8217;s ability to handle heterogeneity in environmental data. Simulation results on 33- and 118-node distribution systems demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of STT-PFRL in voltage regulation.</description></item><item><title>County-Level Distributed PV Day-Ahead Power Prediction Based on Grey Correlation Analysis and Transformer-GCAN Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11061797</link><description>The distributed photovoltaic (PV) power stations within the entire county exist spatiotemporal correlation. Merely considering temporal correlation makes it challenging to meet the day-ahead scheduling demands. This paper proposes a distributed PV county-level day-ahead power prediction method based on grey relational analysis and the Transformer-Graph Convolutional Attention Network (Transformer-GCAN) model. Firstly, the grey relational degree is used to measure the relevance between each distributed PV stations, and the connection relationship of the station graph is determined based on the analysis results. Secondly, the Transformer network is utilized to extract the temporal features of each PV sequence in the graph. Based on the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model, a Graph Attention Mechanism (GAT) is introduced to dynamically extract spatial features between each photovoltaic station in the graph. Finally, the integration of spatiotemporal features is achieved through a fully connected neural network, enabling day-ahead power prediction at the county level. Case analysis results demonstrate that compared with the Transformer-GCN model, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the power prediction model proposed in this paper is reduced by 11.90%, 15.72% and 19.61% respectively in sunny days, cloudy days and rainy days.</description></item><item><title>Power Capacity Allocation Among Multiple Renewable Power Plants: A Perspective From System Strength</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11122291</link><description>Large-scale renewable energy projects consisting of renewable power plants (RPPs) managed by different stakeholders may suffer weak system strength. Consequently, only a limited amount of renewable power capacity can be delivered, or the insufficient system strength could incur stability issues. The allocation of system strength constrained power capacity among different RPPs deserves investigation, which is critical to their respective benefits. To this end, the system strength demand of each RPP is quantified based on its allowable power capacity. A power capacity allocation approach is proposed, ensuring that the RPPs efficiently and fairly utilize system strength. Case studies show that RPPs with longer electrical distances deliver less renewable capacity due to their greater impact on system strength.</description></item><item><title>Nonsmooth Decentralized Voltage Controller for Constrained Regulation of DC Microgrids With Constant Power Loads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11168949</link><description>This paper presents a novel decentralized voltage controller that enforces state constrains at all times and significantly enhances the transient response of DC Microgrid networks with constant power loads. The structure of the proposed controller ensures the existence of a positive invariant set under the solution of the dynamics, enforcing boundedness of each nodal voltage around a rated value. A rigorous analysis is presented to formulate sufficient conditions on the controller tuning parameters such that the boundedness property is guaranteed despite the time-varying nature of the nonlinear load demand. Closed-loop stability of the entire DC Microgrid with respect to desired reference points is analytically proven by employing a suitable Lyapunov function. This allows us to estimate the region of attraction of the desired equilibrium and obtain conditions under which system stability is ensured at all times. Furthermore, the structure of the proposed controller significantly improves the convergence rate of the closed loop system when compared with similar approaches in the literature. The theoretic results are verified in both experimental and power hardware-in-the-loop testing scenarios, while demonstrating fast voltage restoration in cases of load demand fluctuations and constrained regulation to the desired voltage References.</description></item><item><title>A Control Strategy of Multi-Terminal Grid-Forming Soft Open Point for Uninterrupted Power Supply Under Feeder Power Outages</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11173992</link><description>This paper proposes a control strategy of the multi-terminal grid-forming soft open point (MGSOP), aimed to ensure uninterrupted power supply during distribution feeder outages. Unlike existing approaches, the proposed control does not rely on an ideal DC voltage assumption, master-slave structure, or control mode switching. In the MGSOP, the AC-DC and DC-DC converters are used for multi-feeder interconnections and energy storage integration. The MGSOP control system comprises local and coordinating controllers, used to implement the proposed control strategy, which is made up of three sections: 1) Grid-forming AC voltage control implemented by local controllers, which ensures the independent construction of AC voltage and prevents control switching between grid-connected and standalone modes. 2) Hierarchical DC voltage control collaborated by both local and coordinating controllers. Based on the multi dynamic of DC voltage ( $\Delta U_{dc}$  and dUdc/dt), the control ensures dynamic DC power balance and DC voltage stability, avoiding system instability and restoration failures caused by the shutdown of the master converter under traditional master-slave control. 3) Coordinated control for the power regulation among multiple feeders, which reduces the consumption of energy storage during supply restorations. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is validated by simulations.</description></item><item><title>CommonPower: A Framework for Safe Data-Driven Smart Grid Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11186797</link><description>The growing complexity of power system management has led to an increased interest in reinforcement learning (RL). To validate their effectiveness, RL algorithms have to be evaluated across multiple case studies. Case study design is an arduous task requiring the consideration of many aspects, among them the influence of available forecasts and the level of decentralization in the control structure. Furthermore, vanilla RL controllers cannot themselves ensure the satisfaction of system constraints, which makes devising a safeguarding mechanism a necessary task for every case study before deploying the system. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the Python tool CommonPower, the first general framework for the modeling and simulation of power system management tailored towards machine learning. Its modular architecture enables users to focus on specific elements without having to implement a simulation environment. Another unique contribution of CommonPower is the automatic synthesis of model predictive controllers and safeguards. Beyond offering a unified interface for single-agent RL, multi-agent RL, and optimal control, CommonPower includes a training pipeline for machine-learning-based forecasters as well as a flexible mechanism for incorporating feedback of safeguards into the learning updates of RL controllers.</description></item><item><title>Chattering-Free Robust Terminal Sliding Mode Control for DC Nanogrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11197018</link><description>DC nanogrid is an emerging solution for providing affordable electricity to rural areas and homes equipped with solar panels, power converters, and on-site batteries. However, its poor transient response limits its practical application, presenting a significant drawback. This paper proposes a chattering-free robust terminal sliding mode control with finite time stability for the DC nanogrid. The proposed control strategy effectively addresses issues such as poor transient response and chattering, thereby ensuring optimal operation of the DC nanogrid. To achieve robust closed-loop power system operation, advanced nonlinear sliding surfaces and control laws are designed. This work focuses on achieving robustness against dynamic changes and system uncertainties caused by the intermittent nature of the renewable generation unit, instantaneous load variation, and saturation of the control laws. The finite-time stability of the closed-loop system is proved using Lyapunov theory to ensure finite-time convergence for both the reaching and sliding phases. The effectiveness of the proposed nonlinear controller is demonstrated by comparing it with higher-order SMC and conventional asymptotic SMC. System behavior is analyzed through MATLAB/Simulink simulations, and practical applicability is validated experimentally using an IMPERIX hardware setup.</description></item><item><title>Large-Signal Stability Analysis of Multi-Stack Fuel Cell Hybrid Power Systems With Virtual Inertia-Based Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11197052</link><description>Multi-stack fuel cell (FC) hybrid power systems (MSFCHPSs) are high-order nonlinear systems with inherently complex nonlinear characteristics due to their integration of multiple FC stacks, power electronic converters, and nonlinear loads. Thus, MSFCHPSs are very vulnerable to destabilization by transient disturbances, which exceeds the capabilities of traditional small signal stability analysis. To explore the destabilization mechanism of MSFCHPSs, this article proposes a comprehensive large-signal stability (LSS) analysis framework integrating a full-order nonlinear model, including all main circuits, complete control loops, and FC aging effects, with virtual inertia-based control. The nonlinear system is transformed into a Takagi&#8211;Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy representation, enabling domain of attraction (DOA) estimation via Lyapunov theory and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) with low computational burden and reduced conservatism. The method quantitatively assesses the influence of power distribution, virtual inertia parameters, circuit elements, control gains, and FC aging on LSS, identifying dominant stability factors. A hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platform is developed to experimentally validate the proposed approach. Results show strong agreement between estimated and actual stability boundaries, confirming the method&#8217;s accuracy and practical applicability for MSFCHPS design and operation.</description></item><item><title>Artificial Intelligence Data Driven Control for DC Solid State Transformer in DC Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11215658</link><description>The DC solid-state transformer (DCSST) serves as a key component for connecting power supplies, loads, and other elements in a DC microgrid system. With the integration of new energy sources and random loads, the system has become increasingly complex, making accurate modeling challenging due to high modeling costs. The randomness of the loads introduces various disturbances, compromising system stability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a data-driven model-free control (DMFC) approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and an improved Kalman filter (IKF) for the DCSST. First, a data-driven model of the DCSST is established. Next, the IKF is designed, which is tailored for DMFC to correct measurement errors, filter noise, and estimate uncertain disturbances. Subsequently, the DMFC is introduced, which ensures stability under large signal disturbances without relying on an accurate system model. Finally, a DRL sub-controller is integrated into the DMFC to intelligently adjust the control signal and enhance the system&#8217;s operational adaptability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed control method can adaptively ensure the stability of the system under large signal disturbances without requiring an accurate model, while also exhibiting good dynamic and steady-state performance.</description></item><item><title>Visual-Based Reinforcement Learning for Voltage Regulation and Attack Mitigation in Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11173844</link><description>The growing integration of distributed generators introduces increased vulnerability to cyber threats in modern power distribution systems, especially false data injection attacks (FDIAs) targeting communication network. This paper presents a novel real-time voltage regulation framework that enhances both system security and operational efficiency under FDIA scenarios. A time-frequency visual (TFV) model is first developed to identify FDIA types and accurately detect their duration in real-time. Based on the detection outcomes, a redirected control mechanism is employed to correct compromised control signals. These components are embedded into a Markov decision process (MDP) that guides voltage regulation strategies. To solve the MDP, an attention-based multi-agent soft actor-critic (AMS) algorithm is introduced, leveraging attention mechanisms to enhance decision-making under complex and uncertain environments. Integrating the TFV and AMS modules, a visual-based reinforcement learning (VRL) approach is formulated for robust and adaptive voltage control. Extensive simulations conducted on a modified IEEE 33-bus system using real-world synchrophasor data demonstrate that the proposed method effectively contains voltage deviations within 0.02085 p.u., significantly improving the resilience of the distribution network against cyberattacks.</description></item><item><title>A Safe Combined Reinforcement Learning and Model Predictive Control Scheme for Utility-Level Battery Control in Distribution Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11193800</link><description>Optimally controlling energy storage systems is essential for the integration of renewables and electromobility in future power grids.

Model predictive control (MPC) is traditionally used to solve these type of problems suffering however from long runtimes and the need of fine-tuned forecasts. Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches are considered as alternatives but usually cannot guarantee constraints satisfaction. To overcome the limitations of both MPC and RL, in this work, a novel method that integrates RL into MPC is proposed leading to a fast real-time control scheme that aims to enforce near-future constraints satisfaction and accounts for lookahead constraints in the current decisions. Due to the inclusion of the RL-based learned value function in the MPC cost, traditional optimization solutions do not apply and the application of the cross-entropy-method (CEM) is suggested. Its runtime is reduced to the time scale of seconds by employing appropriate initialization based on RL decisions as well as an exponentially decaying amount of samples. Numerical comparisons show that the proposed method outperforms MPC and other safe RL schemes in terms of cost performance and constraints violations.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Placement of Smart Hybrid Transformers in Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11224498</link><description>Hybrid transformers are a relatively new technology that combine conventional power transformers with power electronics to provide voltage and reactive power control capabilities in distribution networks. This paper proposes a novel method of determining the optimal location and utilisation of hybrid transformers in 3-phase distribution networks to maximise the net present value of hybrid transformers based on their ability to increase the export of power produced by distributed generators over their operational lifespan. This has been accomplished through sequential linear programming, a key feature of which is the consideration of nonlinear characteristics and constraints relating to hybrid transformer power electronics and control capabilities. Test cases were carried out in a modified version of the Cigre European Low Voltage Distribution Network Benchmark, which has been extended by connecting it with two additional low voltage distribution test networks. All test case results demonstrate that the installation and utilisation of hybrid transformers can improve the income earned from exporting excess active power, justifying their installation cost (with the highest net present value being (6.56 million, resulting from a 45.53% increase in estimated annual profits due to coordinated HT compensation).</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Operational Strategy for Ice Thermal Storage District Cooling Systems via Model-Free Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11184258</link><description>District cooling system (DCS) offers centralized cooling services for building groups that significantly reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. However, existing model-based methods struggle with the large-scale, stochastic, and nonlinear characteristics of the DCS optimization problem under strict time limits. To fill this research gap, this paper proposes a model-free safe deep reinforcement learning (MFS-DRL) algorithm for the DCS to deliver real-time scheduling strategies of multiple chillers and ice thermal storage units under varying operating conditions. The problem is modeled as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) to systematically decouple the objective from the constraint, therefore overcoming the confusion between reward and penalty caused by manual penalty coefficients in traditional DRL methods. Moreover, prior expert knowledge is acquired through the interior point optimizer (IPOPT) solver, and the agent is pre-trained using imitation learning (IL) to mitigate exploration disorder and local convergence in the early training stage. Ultimately, the Lagrangian relaxation approach is applied to modify the optimality criteria and gradient update rules of the classic deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, thereby achieving a trade-off between feasibility and optimality. Numerical experiments on 12-node and 619-node DCSs demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms representative model-based and data-driven baselines, delivering high-quality solutions within only milliseconds and maintaining robustness across hyperparameter variations.</description></item><item><title>Load Prediction of Hydrogen Powered Ship: A Deep Prediction Framework Considering Operating Environment and Error Correction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11187418</link><description>The load prediction for the future period can serve as an important reference for ship navigation planning. However, the small displacement of hydrogen powered ships and the complex operating environment and conditions pose a serious challenge to load prediction. This study develops an advanced load forecasting framework for hydrogen energy ships by integrating navigation data with hydro-meteorological conditions, proposing a novel strategy that combines classified load prediction with unified error correction. The methodology begins with Spearman correlation analysis to identify critical features for both propulsion and maintenance loads. LightGBM models then generate rapid preliminary predictions for these load categories, employing continuous training to enhance computational efficiency while producing initial forecast sequences. The framework&#8217;s key innovation is the Int-ConvGRU network, which implements error correction through a parallel architecture that simultaneously processes historical data and preliminary predictions while preserving precise temporal relationships. This unique design significantly improves prediction accuracy by effectively capturing complex temporal dependencies. Comprehensive validation using data from hydrogen-powered vessels demonstrates the framework&#8217;s superior performance against multiple benchmark models, particularly in handling the distinct load characteristics of modern ships.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Time-Domain Hierarchical Scheduling of Integrated Energy Systems With Frequency Decomposition Considering Large-Scale Grid Connection of Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11192655</link><description>Amid global decarbonization efforts, Integrated Energy Systems (IES) face critical challenges from the inherent uncertainties of high-penetration renewable energy sources and the large-scale, potentially disorderly integration of Electric Vehicles (EVs), leading to significant supply-demand imbalances and system volatility. Existing approaches struggle to effectively coordinate diverse device response times and capture complex EV user behavior. To address these, this paper proposes a multi-time domain control model-driven bi-level optimization framework for Integrated Energy Systems. The upper level employs a multi-objective intelligent algorithm to generate Pareto-optimal solutions balancing economic costs and environmental impacts. The lower level implements a singular perturbation theory-based multi-time domain control model, dynamically partitioning devices into fast/slow subsystems for differentiated scheduling, significantly enhancing resilience against uncertainties. Additionally, a prospect theory-driven EV dynamic charging response model accurately incorporates user psychology (e.g., loss aversion) to guide orderly charging via price incentives. Furthermore, a Fourier-based power decoupling strategy for hybrid storage (LIB-SC) reduces battery degradation by 28.7%. Case studies demonstrate superior performance: a 12.2% reduction in economic costs, an 11.5% reduction in emissions, and robustly maintained system volatility below 5% under extreme uncertainties, showcasing significant advancements in balancing economic-environmental objectives while accommodating high renewable and EV penetration.</description></item><item><title>Interpretable and Accurate Multi-Energy Loads Forecasting via Continuous-Time Modeling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11195784</link><description>High-precision interpretable forecasting of multi-energy loads is crucial for planning and optimizing Integrated Energy Systems (IES). Current methods have three key limitations: 1) reliance on closed-box models obscures feature interactions; 2) traditional modal decomposition methods ignore cross-modal correlations and fail to efficiently extract global cycle-trend characteristics; 3) limitations in sampling frequency prevent capturing fast dynamic characteristics of energy loads. To address these, we propose a dual resolution channel multi-period cross reconstruction parallel closed-form continuous-time network (DMP-PCFC) for multi-energy load forecasting. This method includes a multi-period cross-reconstruction network which equivalent to the signal sifter for decoupling original sequences and nonlinear mapping across periods, and models hidden states of energy loads using neuron state iterative differential equations. A parallel Closed-form continuous-time neural network (PCFC) based on chunked parallelization reduces inference time from  $O(T)$  (change with input sequence length) to  $O(P)$  (fixed cycle length). To overcome inherent sampling resolution limitations, a dual-resolution channel model with weight-sharing PCFC is used for simultaneous inference. Extensive experiments and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) on the IES dataset at Arizona State University&#8217;s Tempe campus show that DMP-PCFC offers higher prediction accuracy and greater interpretability than existing methods, providing a new paradigm for downstream tasks based on other research methods, making it valuable for IES engineering applications.

However, the predicted flexibility potential of a building&#8217;s Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system is based on uncertain ambient weather forecasts and a typically inaccurate building thermal model. This paper presents an uncertainty-aware flexibility quantifier using a chance-constrained formulation. Because such a quantifier may be conservative, we additionally model real-time feedback in the quantification, in the form of affine feedback policies. Such adaptation can take the form of intra-day trades or rebound around the flexibility provision period. To assess the flexibility quantification formulations, we further assume that flexible buildings participate in secondary frequency control markets. The results show some increase in flexibility and revenues when introducing affine feedback policies. Additionally, we demonstrate that accounting for uncertainties in the flexibility quantification is necessary, especially when intra-day trades are not available. Even though an uncertainty-ignorant potential may seem financially profitable in secondary frequency control markets, it comes at the cost of significant thermal discomfort for inhabitants. Hence, we suggest a comfort-preserving approach, aiming to truly reflect thermal discomfort on the economic flexibility revenue, to obtain a fairer comparison.</description></item><item><title>Game-Based Optimization Method for Geo-Distributed Data Centers Under Customer Directrix Load Demand Response Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11173940</link><description>This study considers geo-distributed data centers (DCs) with diverse load profiles, electricity prices, and renewable energy availability, aggregated within their respective local virtual power plants (VPPs). To optimize demand response (DR) within such a system, a two-stage decision-making framework is proposed. First, a potential game-based method is developed to decompose the total customer directrix load (CDL) into regional sub-CDLs, aligning with grid requirements while minimizing VPP adjustment costs. Second, an evolutionary game model optimizes workload allocation strategies for DCs across spatial and temporal dimensions, considering constraints of bounded rationality and incomplete information. The proposed models are rigorously analyzed for equilibrium existence, convergence, and stability. A case study based on Google&#8217;s geo-distributed DCs and local grid data demonstrates that the framework effectively enhances VPP revenues and reduces DC operational costs, especially during peak demand periods.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Objective Low-Carbon Scheduling Method for Data Centers Based on Ensemble Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11201935</link><description>The explosive growth of GPU data centers is driven by the surging demand for machine learning, artificial intelligence, and high-performance computing applications, with the pressure on the power grid intensifying. Meanwhile, as renewable energy becomes more integrated into the grid, the carbon intensity of grid electricity varies at different times. This variability presents an opportunity for data centers to align their workloads with periods of high renewable energy generation and low carbon intensity, thereby reducing their operational carbon emissions. This paper proposes a multi-objective scheduling strategy to minimize carbon emissions and maximize quality of service (QoS) by identifying the Pareto front. The proposed strategy employs an integrated reinforcement learning model to dynamically integrate action strategies for multiple objectives. Results from a case study based on a real-world, large-scale data center illustrate the method&#8217;s effectiveness. This effectiveness arises from its dual-objective job scheduling strategy, which simultaneously reduces carbon emissions from electricity consumption and maintains a high quality of service in data centers. The method aims to promote the low-carbon operation of data centers, provide decision support, and facilitate coordination between data centers and power systems in real-world applications.</description></item><item><title>Stability Constrained Voltage Control in Distribution Grids With Arbitrary Communication Infrastructure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11164977</link><description>We consider the problem of designing learning-based reactive power controllers that perform voltage regulation in distribution grids while ensuring closed-loop system stability. In contrast to existing methods, where the provably stable controllers are restricted to be decentralized, we propose a unified design framework that enables the controllers to take advantage of an arbitrary communication infrastructure on top of the physical power network. This allows the controllers to incorporate information beyond their local bus, covering existing methods as a special case and leading to less conservative constraints on the controller design. We then provide a design procedure to construct input convex neural network (ICNN) based controllers that satisfy the identified stability constraints by design under arbitrary communication scenarios, and train these controllers using supervised learning. Simulation results on the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) microgrid testbed illustrate the effectiveness of the framework and highlight the role of communication in improving control performance.</description></item><item><title>Virtual Power Plants for Frequency Regulation: A Learning-Based Method With Safety Guarantee</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11195783</link><description>Frequency safety is becoming increasingly critical in modern power systems due to the reduction of rotational inertia and governor damping. With advances in power electronics, the inverter-based resources (IBRs) installed in distribution networks can provide inertia and frequency support if their controllers are properly designed. In this paper, the virtual power plants (VPPs) framework is leveraged to aggregate and coordinate IBRs to provide inertial and primary-frequency responses. In particular, sufficient conditions are derived for the VPP central controller design to guarantee the transient frequency safety, including stability, the rate of change of frequency and Nadir requirements. On this basis, a nonlinear controller parameterization that satisfies these conditions automatically is proposed. The optimal VPPs control policies are trained by recurrent neural network (RNN)-based reinforcement learning and then fairly disaggregated to individual IBRs, ensuring that IBRs share the power injections for frequency response in proportion to their reserve capacities. Moreover, the controllers are equipped with a safety layer with trivial computation burden to satisfy critical constraint during implementation. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed control strategy outperforms linear controller and other cutting-edge learning-based control strategies.</description></item><item><title>Iterative Linear Programming-Based Angle-Relaxed Branch Flow Model and Its Application to Volt-Var Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11195819</link><description>This paper addresses the challenge of optimizing distribution networks under the increasing integration of distributed energy resources and the inherent nonconvexity of AC power flow equations. Traditional methods relying on conic-relaxed formulations often fail to accurately capture critical voltage and power flow dynamics, particularly when the optimization objective does not directly minimize current magnitudes. To overcome these limitations, we propose an iterative linear formulation for the angle-relaxed branch flow model (BFM-ar), termed BFM-it. This approach iteratively linearizes the branch flow equations and updates key parameters&#8212;such as losses and voltage estimates&#8212;so that each iteration solves a linear program that progressively converges to the true nonlinear AC power flow solution. Both mathematical analysis and numerical experiments confirm that the BFM-it achieves convergence with errors on the order of machine precision, while demonstrating superior performance in volt-var control compared to conventional methods. The proposed method not only enhances modeling accuracy but also offers a computationally efficient framework for real-time distribution network optimization.</description></item><item><title>Power Swing Trajectory Influenced by Virtual Impedance-Based Current-Limiting Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11203273</link><description>Grid-forming (GFM) inverter-based resources (IBRs) can emulate the external characteristics of synchronous generators (SGs) through appropriate control loop design. However, in systems with GFM IBRs, the apparent impedance trajectory under current limitation differs significantly from that of SG-based systems due to the limited overcurrent capability of power electronic devices. This difference challenges the power swing detection functions of distance relays designed for SG-based systems. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the apparent impedance trajectory over a full power swing cycle under two typical current-limiting strategies: variable virtual impedance (VI) and adaptive VI. The analysis reveals that the trajectory under VI current-limiting strategies differs significantly from that of a conventional SG. The results also indicate that the control parameters affect the characteristics of the trajectory. In addition, the new trajectories challenge conventional power swing detection functions, increasing the risk of malfunction. Furthermore, the implementation of VI leads to a deterioration in system stability. The theoretical analysis is further validated through simulations on the MATLAB/Simulink platform.</description></item><item><title>Two-Stage Distributionally Robust Optimization Dispatch for Power Systems With Uncertain Small-Sample Wind and Photovoltaic Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11203248</link><description>Extreme meteorological phenomena (e.g., cold waves) are low-probability, high-impact events that present significant operational and dispatch challenges for new-energy power systems. 1) Insufficient data on wind and photovoltaic power generation hinder data-driven modelling. 2) The uncertainty of small-sample wind and photovoltaic data is difficult to characterize. Therefore, a two-stage distributionally robust optimization dispatch strategy for a power system based on small-sample wind and solar data with uncertainty is developed. First, a generalized modelling method for a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) is proposed, which increases the generation of hourly output data for wind and photovoltaic power. Considering the drawback of large prediction errors for wind power and photovoltaic power in small-sample cases, a two-stage distributionally robust optimization model based on the Wasserstein metric is constructed, which embeds hard constraints (e.g., the capacity constraint of wind and solar transmission lines) and soft constraints (e.g., prediction errors). This model is nonconvex, and exactly solving it incurs a heavy computational burden. Duality theory and relaxation approximation are adopted here; the robust two-stage-distribution model is transformed into a mixed-integer linear programming model, and the iterative Taylor formula algorithm is used to linearize the constraint conditions. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate that the proposed model and solution algorithm can not only address the uncertainty of small-sample wind and photovoltaic data but also reduce the system operating costs and increase the model-solving efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Two-Stage Optimization Method for Real-Time Parameterization of PV-Farm Digital Twins</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11235949</link><description>Digital twins (DTs) are high-fidelity virtual models of physical systems. This paper details a novel two-stage optimization method for real-time parameterization of photovoltaic digital twins (PVDTs) using field measurements. Initially, the method estimates equivalent irradiance from PV power, voltage, and current data, eliminating the need for direct irradiance sensors. This is crucial for tuning the DT&#8217;s parameters to actual environmental conditions, thereby improving power prediction accuracy. The second stage focuses on refining these parameters by minimizing discrepancies between measured and predicted outputs. This optimization utilizes the estimated equivalent irradiance as a model input, maintaining synchronization with real-world conditions. Parameter updates are event-trigger, launched when deviations exceed predefined thresholds. This strategy optimizes prediction accuracy and manages communication loads efficiently. Validated with extensive data from a PV farm, this approach outperforms existing methodologies in predictive accuracy and operational efficiency, significantly improving the performance DTs in real-time grid operations.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Distribution of Grid-Following and Grid-Forming Converters for Charging Control of Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11181195</link><description>We address the problem of determining the optimal combination of grid-following (GFL) versus grid-forming (GFM) modes of control in electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) to maintain an acceptable balance between small-signal stability and voltage stability of electric distribution grids. We recall the state-space dynamic models of EVCSs operating in GFL and GFM modes and demonstrate how high charging rates of electric vehicles (EVs) in the GFL mode can impact small-signal performance. We then optimize the GFL-to-GFM ratio while also determining the optimal EV charging setpoints and a state-feedback controller to minimize the  $\mathcal {H}_{2}$ -norm of the grid transfer function (TF). To make the proposed optimization computationally favorable, we use participation factor analysis to identify the most dominant EVCSs in the GFM mode so that they can be prioritized for optimization. We validate our results using a modified model of the IEEE 33-bus power distribution test system with ten EVCSs.</description></item><item><title>Planning and Integration of a Multi-Robot Adaptive Charging Network for Voltage Regulation via Unscented Kalman Filter-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11195829</link><description>High levels of electric vehicle (EV) penetration and load uncertainty pose significant challenges to traditional voltage regulation in distribution systems (DS), particularly concerning voltage drops. This study investigates the potential of a dual-service mode (V2V/V2G) for mobile charging using multiple charging robots, cooperating with conventional DS voltage regulation methods to enhance performance. Specifically, we propose a multi-robot adaptive charging network (MRACN) embedded in a three-level voltage regulation framework to address voltage violations. At the low level, we introduce a voltage security rule-based dispatch strategy for MRACN to mitigate EV-induced voltage drops. At the mid-level, we optimize day-ahead scheduling of on-load tap changers and capacitor banks via optimal power flow for long-term voltage regulation. At the high level, we employ an unscented Kalman filter-based deep reinforcement learning (UKF-DRL) approach to integrate MRACN into DSs for real-time voltage control. Experimental results demonstrate that MRACN effectively reduces voltage violations and enhances the flexibility of conventional voltage control systems. Moreover, the UKF-DRL method accelerates DRL training by nearly an order of magnitude compared to full AC power-flow solutions, with the overwhelming majority of state estimates deviating by no more than 2%.</description></item><item><title>A Resilience-Oriented Incentive Pricing Strategy for Power-Transportation Network Against Flood Hazards</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11197582</link><description>Extreme weather events, such as flood hazards, may superimpose damage on coupled power-transportation networks (PTNs). An effective approach is to guide electric vehicle (EV) owners to enhance grid resilience. However, the EV emergency response and incentive prices are not sufficiently quantified for the post-flood recovery of power distribution network (PDN). Thus, this paper develops a fault scenario generation method to capture the capacity attacks on coupled PTNs during flood hazards. Then, a resilience-oriented tri-level incentive pricing strategy of EV emergency response is proposed for PDN post-flood recovery. At the upper level, EV charging station (EVCS) operators decide incentive pricing strategies for EV emergency response services by assessing the coupled relations of EV discharging/path strategies and PDN subsidy. At the middle level, a modified traffic model is proposed to capture the EV owner&#8217;s inconvenience cost associated with emergency response. At the lower level, a resilience metric incorporating EV discharging responses is introduced to mitigate load curtailment of PDN. Furthermore, a decomposition method based on column generation and optimal path set pre-assignment is proposed to address the urgency and destination uncertainty in emergency responses. Numerical results illuminate that the proposed strategy could reduce 41% of the peak load power shedding.</description></item><item><title>Intrusion Detection System for Digital Substations Using Semi-Supervised Learning and Traffic Distance Similarity Clustering</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11168910</link><description>Cyber attacks on power grids are imminent and potentially have a severe impact, as evidenced by the cyber attacks in Ukraine in 2015, 2016, and 2022. In response to this challenge, machine learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have become more prevalent as a potential mitigation owing to their alignment with the latest advances in artificial intelligence. However, existing anomaly detection methods for power grid Operational Technology (OT) are often inadequate, as they primarily focus on detecting power grid physical anomalies at the later attack stages and suffer from the scarcity of available data for supervised machine learning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised IDS specifically for digital substations of the power system. The proposed detection method identifies the distinctive distance similarity of digital substation OT communication traffic using a Convolutional Neural Network and Chebyshev distance of packet payloads, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov of packets&#8217; interarrival time using Fast Fourier Transform amplitude. Subsequently, these traffic features are combined into a vector and classified using a novel hybrid semi-supervised Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN). Results indicate that the proposed method can identify zero-day attacks and achieve accuracy and F1 above 95%.</description></item><item><title>A Dual Power Grid Cascading Failure Model for the Vulnerability Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11175257</link><description>When considering attacks against the power grid, one of the most effective approaches could be the attack to the transmission lines that leads to large cascading failures. Hence, the problem of locating the most critical or vulnerable transmission lines for a Power Grid Cascading Failure (PGCF) has drawn much attention from the research society. There exist many deterministic solutions and stochastic approximation algorithms aiming to analyze the power grid vulnerability. However, it has been challenging to reveal the correlations between the transmission lines for the critical line identification. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that learns such correlations, based on self-supervised learning and the self-attention mechanism, which is inspired by the Transformer model for natural language processing (NLP). Once the correlations are learned, a ranking algorithm is introduced for the critical line identification. With extensive experiments comparing our approach versus 2 other benchmark algorithms, it is proven that the proposed Dual PGCF model provides a novel and effective solution for critical line identification.</description></item><item><title>Scalable Voltage Control for DC Microgrids: Robustness to Network Structural Variations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11180064</link><description>Frequent plug-in/-out operations result in structural variations of DC microgrids (DCmGs), posing challenges to scalable control and often requiring costly redesigns to maintain stability. To address this issue, this paper proposes a scalable voltage control strategy for uncertain DCmGs, enabling plug-and-play functionality without controller redesign or system reconfiguration. A polytopic uncertain DCmG model is first formulated to simultaneously capture parameter uncertainties in distributed generation units (DGUs), power lines, and ZIP (i.e., impedance, current, and power) loads. A structured free-weight matrix technique is then developed to mitigate the adverse effects of line and load uncertainties on DGUs while yielding a more tractable linear matrix inequality formulation. The proposed scalable control method is implemented locally to ensure the dissipative voltage stability of each DGU, thereby preserving the dissipativity of the entire network. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in achieving faster convergence and reduced overshoot.</description></item><item><title>An SDN-Based Framework for Cyber-Physically Coordinated Voltage Support of Virtual Power Plants Against DoS Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11181222</link><description>The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into smart grids is accelerating worldwide. However, the growing reliance on information and communication technologies (ICTs) for real-time monitoring and control in large-scale DER aggregations introduces significant cybersecurity risks. Among these, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks pose a critical threat, with the potential to severely disrupt system operations. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a security-by-design framework for large-scale DER aggregation in the context of virtual power plants (VPPs), with a focus on enhancing the resilience of voltage support services. Central to this framework is a cyber-physical coordinated control architecture that leverages software-defined networking (SDN) to dynamically adapt to variations in both the cyber and physical layers. Specifically, a cyber-aware voltage control algorithm is developed to coordinate DERs based on the real-time status of the communication network, while a physically informed network configuration algorithm adjusts communication paths according to voltage support priorities. The proposed approach is evaluated through cyber&#8211;physical co-simulations on both the IEEE 123-bus test system and the 240-bus test system, based on a real-world distribution system located in the Midwest U.S., under server DoS attack scenarios. Results demonstrate that the SDN-enabled coordination significantly mitigates server DoS attacks, confirming the framework&#8217;s effectiveness and robustness. This work offers a scalable and resilient solution for securing large-scale DER aggregation and integration against evolving cyber threats.</description></item><item><title>Post-Disaster Multi-Timescale Coordinated Restoration of Power and Thermal Cyber-Physical System Considering Hot Standby Resources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11184621</link><description>After extreme natural disasters, the inherent coupling between the cyber and physical components of power and thermal cyber-physical systems (PTCPS) facilitates the coordinated emergency resources from both domains, thereby expediting system restoration. Previous research has overlooked the influences of hot standby emergency resources and actual services in post-disaster restoration. Taking into account thermal inertia (TI) and wireless communication emergency resources, this paper proposes a post-disaster multi-timescale coordinated restoration method for PTCPS, aiming to minimize load loss, reduce emergency costs, decrease communication delays, and maximize distributed generation (DG) absorption. Firstly, models for TI, wireless communication, and repair crew emergency resources are established, and the multi-timescale coordination emergency resources are formed. Secondly, based on the switch control and load control services, a cyber-physical interaction model is constructed, and a dynamic networking model for wireless communication with wired communication node access is established. Then, the communication network, physical system operations, and topology reconfiguration models are constructed. To optimize the numerous unconventional nonlinear constraints in the proposed model, the logical constraint and Big-M methods are introduced in linearization techniques, the multiple linearization methods are derived. Finally, case studies are conducted using an improved RBTS-Bus2 power system/12-node thermal system, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method through comparisons with two benchmarks and highlighting the necessity of multi-timescale emergency resources and cyber-physical interaction.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic PMU Configuration for Stealthy Multi-Snapshot FDIA Mitigation: Enhancing Security in Hybrid-Measurement-Based State Estimation in Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11184615</link><description>Modern power systems have evolved into cyber-physical power systems (CPPSs) requiring high-resolution spatial-temporal state awareness, driving the adoption of hybrid measurement-based state estimation (SE). However, such advancements introduce heightened cybersecurity requirements that demand systematic investigations from adversarial perspectives. This paper establishes a comprehensive attacker-defender framework with dual contributions. From the attacker&#8217;s perspective, this paper proposes a multi-snapshot coordinated false data injection attack (MS-FDIA) strategy against hybrid measurement-based SE. The proposed attack model can effectively bypass both hybrid measurement synchronization checks and temporal data anomaly detection mechanisms, thereby achieving enhanced stealth and operational impact. From the defender&#8217;s perspective, this paper develops a dynamic trusted phasor measurement unit (PMU) configuration scheme that adaptively reconfigures secure measurement matrix subsets against evolving multistage attacks. The defense mechanism is solved through two complementary approaches: a numerical algorithm based on matrix row transformations and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based optimization method with temporal awareness. Comprehensive case studies on different standard test systems demonstrate the improved MS-FDIA mitigation capabilities and the defense scheme&#8217;s effectiveness, and the test results reveal the matrix transformation algorithm&#8217;s superiority in small-scale systems versus DRL&#8217;s scalability advantages for large networks.</description></item><item><title>Communication-Aware Wide-Area Damping Control Using Risk-Constrained Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11222886</link><description>Non-ideal communication links, especially delays, critically affect fast networked controls in power systems, such as the wide-area damping control (WADC). Traditionally, a delay estimation and compensation approach is adopted to address this cyber-physical coupling, but it demands very high accuracy for the fast WADC and cannot handle other cyber concerns like link failures or cyber perturbations. Hence, we propose a new risk-constrained framework that can target the communication delays, yet amenable to general uncertainty under the cyber-physical couplings. Our WADC model includes the synchronous generators (SGs), and also voltage source converters (VSCs) for additional damping capabilities. To mitigate uncertainty, a mean-variance risk constraint is introduced to the classical optimal control cost of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR). Unlike estimating delays, our approach can effectively mitigate large communication delays by improving the worst-case performance. A reinforcement learning (RL)-based algorithm, namely, stochastic gradient-descent with max-oracle (SGDmax), is developed to solve the risk-constrained problem. We further show its guaranteed convergence to stationarity at a high probability, even using the simple zero-order policy gradient (ZOPG). Numerical tests on the IEEE 68-bus system not only verify SGDmax&#8217;s convergence and VSCs&#8217; damping capabilities, but also demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional delay compensator-based methods under estimation error. While focusing on performance improvement under large delays, our proposed risk-constrained design can effectively mitigate the worst-case oscillations, making it equally effective for addressing other communication issues and cyber perturbations.</description></item><item><title>Load Forecasting Model Trading: A Cost-Oriented and Auction-Based Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11181218</link><description>Data sharing is essential for accurate load forecasting and efficient energy management, yet data exchange remains severely constrained by a lack of effective economic incentives. Data markets have emerged as a potential solution by incentivizing the exchange of data and forecasting resources among stakeholders. Existing data market mechanisms, often designed around trading raw data or forecast outputs, face multiple barriers&#8212;such as privacy concerns, valuation misaligned with real operational benefits, unilateral pricing, computationally intensive allocation, and inflexible asset adaptation&#8212;that limit their practicality for real-world energy applications. The aim of this paper is to address these challenges by proposing a novel market framework that treats pre-trained forecasting models as tradable assets, thereby fundamentally redefining the data market paradigm. Specifically, a cost-oriented evaluation approach that links model quality to downstream operational costs is first established as the foundation throughout the entire market process. Subsequently, we propose a bilateral iterative model auction mechanism to enable efficient transactions between the buyer and sellers while maximizing social welfare. Furthermore, we propose a model adaptation strategy, including model fine-tuning and ensembling, for the buyer to enhance the applicability of purchased models to his decision-making problem. Case studies in building energy management based on public datasets demonstrate that our approach converges to the socially optimal solution, allowing all participants to benefit: sellers are appropriately compensated for providing high-quality models, and buyers achieve significant operational cost reductions through the utilization of traded models.</description></item><item><title>Forced Oscillation Recognition With Interpretable Network Framework for Class Imbalance and Limited Real-World Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11200994</link><description>Deep learning (DL) holds significant potential for distinguishing forced oscillations (FOs) from natural oscillations (NOs) and resonances in power systems. However, most existing studies treat DL models as opaque system classifiers, and these models are often susceptible to challenges such as class imbalance among the three oscillation patterns (i.e., FOs, NOs, and resonances) and the limited size of real-world training datasets. These issues can lead to incorrect diagnoses of oscillation patterns in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose a FO oscillation recognition framework that integrates balanced data processing, an interpretable recognition network, and a fine-tuning learning strategy. In this framework, DeepSMOTE1D is introduced to address the issue of class imbalance by oversampling features extracted from an encoder-decoder network. The interpretable DWT-CNN-LSTM recognition network incorporates multiple discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) into each convolutional and LSTM layer to enhance both interpretability and performance of the model. Finally, a fine-tuning transfer learning strategy is employed, where the recognition network is first pretrained on simulation data and subsequently retrained on limited real-world data. The effectiveness of DeepSMOTE1D and the fine-tuning strategy in the proposed framework is also evaluated. Experimental results show that the proposed recognition model not only learns effectively from simulated oscillation data but also outperforms existing related networks in real-world scenarios, achieving superior accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</description></item><item><title>OptDisPro: LLM-Based Multi-Agent Framework for Flexibly Adapting Heuristic Optimal DisFlow</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11201936</link><description>The existing generative coding of distribution grids modeling and optimization face several issues, like complicated usage or high auto-codes error rates. This paper proposes the OptDisPro, a novel LLM-based multi-agent framework, enabling automatic optimal power flow (OPF) script modeling and solving. Driven by interactive linguistic instruction, it realizes automatic coding for customized requirements and flexibly adaptive heuristic optimization. Specifically, domain expertise and example scripts are encoded into structured prompt sequences to guide OptDisPro and enhance reasoning via Chain-of-Thought (COT). To mitigate LLM hallucinations, a contextual feedback mechanism is introduced, which collects error messages from the run-time environment for self-correction. Furthermore, Adaptive Selection of Multiple Algorithms (ASMA) is applied in the solving process, flexibly selecting heuristic algorithms to decrease the possibility of local optima. According to cases verification in multiple scenarios, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of OptDisPro in OPF problem of distribution network. The results also encourage further exploration of LLM applications in script online self-updating, autonomous OPF problem-solving and intelligent operation within distribution grid.</description></item><item><title>Learning Data-Driven Uncertainty Set Partitions for Robust and Adaptive Energy Forecasting With Missing Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11202569</link><description>Short-term forecasting models typically assume the availability of input data (features) when they are deployed and in use. However, equipment failures, disruptions, cyberattacks, may lead to missing features when such models are used operationally, which could negatively affect forecast accuracy, and result in suboptimal operational decisions. In this paper, we use adaptive robust optimization and adversarial machine learning to develop forecasting models that seamlessly handle missing data operationally. We propose linear- and neural network-based forecasting models with parameters that adapt to available features, combining linear adaptation with a novel algorithm for learning data-driven uncertainty set partitions. The proposed adaptive models do not rely on identifying historical missing data patterns and are suitable for real-time operations under stringent time constraints. Extensive numerical experiments on short-term wind power forecasting considering horizons from 15 minutes to 4 hours ahead illustrate that our proposed adaptive models are on par with imputation when data are missing for very short periods (e.g., when only the latest measurement is missing) whereas they significantly outperform imputation when data are missing for longer periods. We further provide insights by showcasing how linear adaptation and data-driven partitions (even with a few subsets) approach the performance of the optimal, yet impractical, method of retraining for every possible realization of missing data.</description></item><item><title>Frequency-Aware Multi-Task Forecasting for Integrated Energy Systems via Variational Mode Decomposition and Convolution-Attention Encoding</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11205895</link><description>Integrated Energy Systems (IESs) integrate electricity, heating, cooling, and gas through coupled infrastructures, posing forecasting challenges due to heterogeneous temporal patterns and cross-energy interference. These heterogeneous temporal patterns often reflect distinct frequency characteristics, which existing multi-task approaches struggle to disentangle due to the lack of frequency-aware task decoupling. To address this, this paper proposes VATLNet, a unified multi-task forecasting framework that integrates frequency-aware task decoupling with hybrid convolution-attention feature extraction. Specifically, multivariate energy inputs are decomposed via variational mode decomposition, and the resulting components are clustered into frequency-similar groups based on sample entropy. A shared encoder combining temporal convolutional networks and multi-head attention extracts frequency features across all clusters, which are then independently decoded by parallel long short-term memory network branches. Extensive experiments on real-world IES load datasets demonstrate that VATLNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 2.44% and 1.03% MAPE in single- and multi-task forecasting, respectively. The framework improves cross-frequency-aware feature extraction, reduces inter-task interference, and enhances forecasting robustness and interpretability across diverse energy modalities.</description></item><item><title>Smart Meter Scheduling for Data-Driven Granular Customer Voltage Visibility</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11215656</link><description>The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) in power distribution systems introduces greater voltage volatility. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) measurements at medium-voltage (MV) networks cannot directly monitor customer-end voltages; smart meters provide direct customer-end voltages but have insufficient reporting rates to track short-term voltage fluctuations due to DERs. This paper proposes an approach to high-resolution voltage monitoring at all customer points based on low-resolution smart meter measurements. This is based on staggered smart meter data acquisition: smart meters are grouped into subsets, each of which contains enough information to estimate the voltages of all customers. These subsets of smart meters are scheduled to report their data at different times rather than simultaneously. Then, at each instant when a subset of meters reports their measurements, a data-driven method is used to estimate all the unreported customer voltages by utilizing voltage measurements of the reporting subset. To support multi-customer estimation with minimal computational overhead, an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model is chosen due to its efficiency and robustness. This approach ensures high-resolution voltage estimation (HiVE) without the need of increasing the reporting rate of smart meters. Extensive simulations on real-world smart meter datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Aperiodic Sampling Load Frequency Control of Wind Power-Integrated Power Systems With Packet Losses and Delays Under Discrete Time Feedback Interconnection Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11181202</link><description>This paper explores the stability assessment and the development of controllers for aperiodic sampling load frequency control scheme for wind power-integrated power systems, accounting for communication delays and packet losses. Firstly, transform the multi-area continuous time model into a discrete time load frequency control model. By incorporating linear operators to manage the uncertainties including communication delays, packet losses and sampling interval within the system, the discrete time load frequency control system is converted into a feedback interconnected system that consists of uncertain operators and linear time-invariant systems. Secondly, the exponential stability condition of the system is given by utilizing the integral quadratic constraint theory and linear matrix inequality technique, which can be used to compute the upper bounds for aperiodic sampled-data intervals and delays. Furthermore, based on the proposed stability conditions, a controller iteration optimization algorithm is designed, which effectively addresses issues related to delays and packet losses. Finally, an example study based on one-area, three-area load frequency control system and IEEE 39-bus system show that the method can obtain larger sampling upper bounds and better control performance than previous methods.</description></item><item><title>A Cross-Level Consistency-Aware Diffusion Model of Hierarchical Imputation for Energy Prosumers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11168916</link><description>Motivated by the aggregation structure of prosumers from energy communities within a region, this letter proposes a cross-level consistency-aware diffusion model for solving the hierarchical imputation problem (CDHI), directly processing three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical time series. In CDHI, a 3D attention mechanism of hierarchical, temporal, and feature Transformer layers is developed to capture the aggregated dependency of hierarchical series. Based on mask modeling, we extend imputation target choice strategies of missing patterns, thus training CDHI in a self-supervised manner. For implementation, we formulate the aggregation structure of prosumers as the hierarchical consistency across aggregation levels in the denoising loss function of CDHI.</description></item><item><title>Energy-Constrained Multidimensional Optimization for UAV-Aided Secure Data Collection With Cooperative Jamming</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11080077</link><description>Due to the agile mobility and line-of-sight transmission capabilities, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising technology for facilitating data collection from sensor nodes (SNs) in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. However, the inherent security vulnerabilities of ground-to-air channels and the energy limitation issues of UAVs and wireless devices pose significant challenges to UAV-assisted data collection. Thus, this paper develops a secure and effective UAV-aided data collection scheme. In this scheme, each SN operates in either sleep or wake-up mode to conserve energy, and a UAV collects data from wake-up SNs in an eavesdropped environment. To prevent interception by an eavesdropper, other idle IoT devices are strategically chosen to act as friendly jammers to send artificial noise cooperatively. We aim to maximize the worst-case secrecy rate of the considered system by jointly optimizing UAV trajectory design, sensor scheduling, and jammer selection besides ensuring all the data from SNs are successfully collected by the UAV under the triple energy constraints of the UAV, SNs, and jammers and a maximum speed constraint for the UAV. Since the formulated problem is a challenging mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm to tackle this problem by exploiting block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA). Finally, simulation results validate the superior performance of our proposed scheme compared to several baseline schemes in terms of secrecy rate.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Event-Triggered Multi-Objective Fault Detection for Turbofan Engine Sensors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11082013</link><description>Turbofan engine is the important power source of large uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV), whose health status plays a vital role in the flight operation. This paper mainly focus on the adaptive event-triggered multi-objective fault detection scheme for turbofan engine sensors. Firstly, the adaptive event-triggered mechanism (AETM) is adopted to achieve the balance between saving communication resources and guaranteeing the system performance. Based on the AETM, an optimal multi-objective $ l_{1}/H_\infty$ fault detection scheme is designed for continuous time system with transmission delay such that the generated residual is both robust against exogenous disturbance and sensitive to the sensor bias fault. Ultimately, an example of turbofan engine Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test is conducted to evaluate our proposed scheme, which is reflective of its engineering value.</description></item><item><title>Joint User Association and Beamforming for Dynamic Metasurface Antenna Based Cell-Free mmWave MIMO Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11075604</link><description>Cell-free millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems have shown great potential for satisfying demands of extra-large capacity, ultra-massive connectivity and ultra-high reliability in future wireless networks, which however may suffer from significant energy consumption and hardware cost due to large-scale distributed antenna arrays operating at mmWave bands. To alleviate this issue, a novel dynamic metasurface antenna (DMA) array has been considered as an energy-efficient and cost-efficient alternative to the conventional fully-digital array deployed at each access point (AP). In this paper, we aim to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) in a DMA-based cell-free mmWave MIMO system by jointly optimizing user association, transmit beamformer, fronthaul compression and DMA weighting matrix, where both the limited fronthaul capacity and the near-field propagation effect are considered. To tackle this non-convex mixed-integer problem effectively, we propose a double-loop penalty dual decomposition (PDD) based algorithm with the aid of variable substitution and successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. In order to circumvent its high iteration complexity, we also develop a low-complexity alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm to find a high-quality suboptimal solution with a single-loop structure. Moreover, the extensions of our work to the partially-decentralized distributed implementation and the non-coherent transmission at distributed APs are discussed. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms achieve superior performance over various benchmark schemes.</description></item><item><title>HADML: Hierarchical Asynchronous Deep Mutual Learning in Edge Intelligence Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11087760</link><description>Deep mutual learning (DML) stands out as a prominent technology in the rapidly evolving landscape of model compression over the past few years. To apply it on a large scale, this paper introduces a novel hierarchical asynchronous deep mutual learning (HADML) in edge intelligence systems to facilitate collaborative knowledge sharing among devices while prioritizing data privacy. Hierarchical and asynchronous model aggregation methods can also fully leverage the advantages of device-to-device (D2D) based wireless networks. To improve the learning efficiency of HADML, we further formulate a non-convex optimization problem, aiming to minimize the average energy consumption for knowledge exchange by adjusting link scheduling and communication resource allocation. To solve this problem effectively, it is decomposed into two subproblems, and a joint graph neural network and deep unfolding network algorithm is developed to obtain the solutions. Finally, the proposed algorithm's performance is validated through simulation results, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving efficient and secure HADML in distributed system architecture.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Resource Allocation for IoT With Computing Power Network Based on RIS-UAV-Aided NOMA-THz Communication</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11079790</link><description>The integration of advanced technologies such as sixth-generation mobile communications (6G), artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain has given new impetus to the development of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, these applications require higher computational power and lower latency, which present challenges to traditional network architectures. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel computing power network (CPN) architecture based on reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-Terahertz (THz) communication, and it aims to meet high computational demands. In the proposed scheme, CPN is introduced to assist IoT devices in executing tasks, thereby enhancing data processing. Concretely, THz communications and NOMA technologies are utilized to increase data rates and spectral efficiency. The combination of RIS and UAV shows promise in overcoming the challenges of high path loss and high sensitivity to blockage in THz communication, thereby improving system performance. To increase the efficiency of the proposed architecture, it is crucial to rationally allocate computational and transmission resources. Therefore, a joint optimization problem is formulated to minimize system consumption, encompassing both time and energy usage. To achieve efficient resource allocation, an adaptive N-Step method based on soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm is employed. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the existing baselines.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Carrier Faster-Than-Nyquist Signaling for OTFS Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11078288</link><description>Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation technique is promising for high-mobility applications to achieve reliable communications. However, the capacity of OTFS systems is generally limited by the Nyquist criterion, requiring orthogonal pulses in both time and frequency domains. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-carrier faster-than-Nyquist (MC-FTN) signaling scheme for OTFS systems. By adopting non-orthogonal pulses in both time and frequency domains, our scheme significantly improves the capacity of OTFS systems. Specifically, we firstly develop the signal models for both single-input single-output (SISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) OTFS systems. Then, we optimize the delay-Doppler (DD) domain precoding matrix at the transmitter to suppress both the inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) introduced by the MC-FTN signaling. For SISO systems, we develop an eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) precoding scheme with optimal power allocation (PA) for achieving the maximum capacity. For MIMO systems, we develop a successive interference cancellation (SIC)-based precoding scheme via decomposing the capacity maximization problem into multiple sub-capacity maximization problems with largely reduced dimensions of optimization variables. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed MC-FTN-OTFS signaling scheme achieves significantly higher capacity than traditional Nyquist-criterion-based OTFS systems. Moreover, the SIC-based precoding scheme can effectively reduce the complexity of MIMO capacity maximization, while attaining performance close to the optimal EVD-based precoding scheme.</description></item><item><title>Dual-Driven Learning for RIS-Assisted Multi-User MISO Beamforming and Reflection With Uplink Channel Information</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11079883</link><description>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can improve wireless transmission performance by passive reflective elements to reconfigure the wireless propagation environment. However, the traditional optimization approach has a high complexity when jointly optimizing phase shifts at the RIS and the beamforming at the base station (BS). This paper focuses on the sum rate maximization problem with the transmit power constraint and the phase constraint, for the RIS-assisted multiuser multiple-input-single-output (MISO) downlink transmission where the downlink and uplink channel reciprocity does not exist. To solve this problem, we propose a data and model-driven learning approach via a hybrid learning manner. Specifically, we adopt an optimal beamforming structure to effectively reduce the output dimension and to improve the training and testing efficiency of the neural network. Then, we provide a learning framework including several fully-connected neural networks to learn the mapping between uplink and downlink channels, power features of the beamforming, and phase-shift matrices, after which the optimal beamforming can be recovered by the proposed beamforming structure. Simulation results show that our proposed method achieves better rate performance than state-of-the-art data-driven learning approaches.</description></item><item><title>Beamforming Design for RIS-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems Under Finite Channel Blocklength Transmissions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11080336</link><description>Thanks to low path-loss and high macro-diversity gain, the cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is regarded as a perspective technique to realize ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) for future wireless systems. In this paper, we consider the emerging reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to further improve the capability of CF massive MIMO system in URLLC provision. Under the finite channel blocklength regime, we formulate the sum spectral efficiency (SE) maximization problem to jointly design the active beamforming of access points (APs) and the passive beamforming of RISs. To resolve this non-convex problem, we establish a tight logarithmically lower bound based on the majorization minimization criterion to replace the complicated objective function. Then, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm to solve two subproblems and derive the closed-form solutions of both active and passive beamformings. Taking into account the extra power consumption of RISs, we utilize the novel performance metric named resource efficiency (RE) to investigate the trade-off between SE and energy efficiency (EE) in RIS-aided CF massive MIMO URLLC systems. Moreover, a variant bisection search algorithm is developed to maximize the system RE. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed lower bound for optimizing the RIS-aided CF massive MIMO URLLC system. The proposed algorithms are also effective in improving the sum-SE and striking the SE-EE balance of RIS-aided CF massive MIMO URLLC systems.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Type Disaster Scenario Task Offloading in Air&#8211;Ground Integrated Search and Rescue Networks: A Blockchain-Assisted MFL Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11074756</link><description>Inrecent years, autonomous aerial vehicle (UAV) has demonstrated significant potential in Search and Rescue (SAR) operations by providing real-time high-definition image and video data.

To begin with, an optimization problem for the average content downloading delay minimization is formulated, by jointly optimizing the caching placement, trajectory, and transmit power of the drone, while satisfying the cache capacity, total transmit power, and kinematics constraints of the drones. However, there is an unpredictable nature in the environment, such as changes in content requests, locations of the users and drones, making it difficult to be solved by traditional optimization methods. In order to address this difficulty, the formulated problem is firstly modeled as a Markov decision process, and then a deep reinforcement learning framework based on dual-clip proximity policy optimization (DC-PPO) algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. The algorithm adaptively searches for caching placement, trajectory, and transmit power of drone, and a better match between action and state is ensured by using a soft greed strategy to make decisions. Finally, extensive simulation results show that the proposed DC-PPO algorithm outperforms the benchmark algorithms in terms of the average content downloading delay and the convergence speed. Moreover, compared to other schemes, the average content downloading delay is reduced by the proposed joint design scheme.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Preserving Task Offloading in Vehicular Edge Computing Using Federated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11079801</link><description>Vehicular edge computing (VEC) systems face critical challenges in balancing computational efficiency, task delay, and data privacy. This paper presents a Federated Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (FMADRL) framework to achieve privacy-preserving task offloading in dynamic vehicular networks. The proposed method leverages federated learning to collaboratively train task offloading policies across vehicles, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) servers, and the cloud, ensuring that sensitive data remains localized while enabling global optimization. A novel reward function is designed to balance task completion, delay, energy consumption, and privacy constraints, while a federated actor-critic model ensures robust decision-making under dynamic network conditions.

These findings underscore the potential of FMADRL to enhance the scalability, efficiency, and security of VEC systems in intelligent transportation networks.</description></item><item><title>Joint Service Caching and Task Offloading for Multi-UAV-Assisted Offshore Edge Computing Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11081466</link><description>Marine Internet of Things devices (MIoTDs) are inherently constrained by limited computation resources, while conventional mobile edge computing implementation faces significant challenges in offshore environments due to unstable shore-based communications and widespread device distribution. To this end, this paper proposes an integrated offshore-aerial edge computing and caching architecture where multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), capable of dynamically adjusting their three-dimensional positions for optimal service coverage, serve as edge servers collaborating with a shore-based base station to provide computing and caching services for MIoTDs. The objective is to minimize the total system latency by jointly optimizing task offloading ratios, user association decisions, and service caching decisions, subject to MIoTD energy, UAV energy, and cache capacity constraints. To solve the resulting mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm that decomposes it into tractable subproblems, strategically employing coalition game, linear relaxation, and Lagrangian dual methods to address their distinct mathematical structures. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme reduces the total latency by 15.18%, 8.90%, and 8.38% compared to local-only computing, random caching, and fixed offloading baselines, respectively, while ensuring fair service provision across MIoTDs.</description></item><item><title>Age of Information Optimization for UAV Deployment With Covert Communication: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11080333</link><description>With the rapid advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT), ensuring the timeliness of information has become increasingly critical. However, the broadcast nature of IoT data transmission poses significant challenges to secure communication.

However, irradiance variability and partial shading pose significant challenges to system stability and efficiency. This study evaluates three advanced nonisolated dc&#8211;dc converter topologies: interleaved boost, quadratic boost, and multi-input/single-output (MISO) under maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control using the perturb and observe algorithm. Simulations were conducted in Simulink using real irradiance and temperature data collected in a high solar irradiance place, such as Antofagasta, Chile. The system comprises 600 photovoltaic cells ($350\, \mathrm{V}$) connected to a $540\,\mathrm{ V}$ dc-Link bus and a $50\, \text{kWh}$ LiFePO$_{4}$ battery bank. Key performance metrics, such as voltage gain, efficiency, current ripple, and duty cycle behavior, were analyzed under three solar scenarios. Under favorable irradiance, all topologies delivered over $3.2\, \text{kW}$ with ideal efficiencies above 98.4%. The interleaved topology demonstrated strong steady-state performance but limited transient regulation. The quadratic converter operated with a low duty cycle yet showed greater sensitivity to disturbances. In contrast, the MISO converter consistently maintained a stable output, low ripple, and high efficiency even under minimal irradiance conditions (70 W/m$^{2}$). These results position the MISO topology as the most robust solution for variable urban environments, ensuring reliable energy delivery and supporting the efficient deployment of ViPV systems in electric mobility applications.</description></item><item><title>Tracking Concepts for High-Density PV Power Plants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11205357</link><description>In the search for new sites, photovoltaic (PV) system installations spread out into complex places and contexts, such as hilly terrain, floating PV, and agriPV. It is, therefore, plausible to assume that PV power plants will increasingly need to use space and, thus, sunlight more efficiently, e.g., by not wasting solar energy in the space between module rows. This means it may become increasingly important to consider the energy output of PV systems per area of land use, i.e., the &#8220;efficiency of the PV system.&#8221; To increase this efficiency, power plants with high density of PV modules are needed. For tracked systems, this necessitates adapting the tracking strategies to avoid excessive losses from either row-to-row shading or angle-of-incidence losses in backtracking. This article explores different tracking strategies that could contribute to enabling high-density PV power plants with high efficiency. The advantages of these advanced tracking strategies are quantified at two different latitudes as a function of the ground coverage ratio.</description></item><item><title>Floating Offshore Solar Photovoltaics for Land-Constrained and Diverse Renewable Supply Conditions in the United States and Canada</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11214224</link><description>Energy transition pathways for large continental areas are largely understood to be achievable using a diverse set of onshore renewable energy technologies. Previous research for the integrated United States and Canada energy&#8211;industry system indicated that solar photovoltaics (PVs) may dominate the primary energy structure, complemented by onshore wind power. However, societal constraints may require increased supply diversity, and onshore renewable energy may not be sufficient for densely populated regions, especially on the east coast of the United States. The LUT Energy System Transition Model was applied to investigate the role of floating offshore solar PV coupled with offshore wind and wave power when onshore solar PV is limited. The results indicate that, when onshore solar PV is limited to 60% of electricity generation, 434 GW of floating offshore solar PV may be installed by 2050 as part of a hybrid power plant sharing the same grid connection as offshore wind power, which reaches 414 GW of installed capacity, contributing 607 and 1576 TWh to the electricity supply, respectively. In total, 7.4 TW of solar PV capacity is installed by 2050, complemented by 1.4 TW of onshore wind power. Increased supply diversity still leads to a 42% reduction in the levelized cost of electricity, reaching 32.7 &#8364;/MWh in 2050. Compared with cost-optimal conditions, the levelized cost of final energy and nonenergy use in 2050 increases by 28% to 52.7 &#8364;/MWh. Nevertheless, such increased costs may be justifiable to meet societal constraints, and a diverse power-to-X economy structure for the United States and Canada may still be technoeconomically viable.</description></item><item><title>Performance Limits in Bifacial Tandem Solar Cell Modules for Multiple Configurations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11224657</link><description>While bifacial tandem photovoltaic technology is promising as it is able to generate higher electrical power output by accessing illumination from both front and rear surfaces, a thorough investigation of the performance limits of bifacial tandems with different architectures/arrangements and under different conditions has not been explored. In this work, we present a comprehensive analytical framework based on the principle of detailed balance to assess the performance limits of bifacial tandems spanning multiple architectures, including unconstrained, current-matched (CM), and voltage-matched (VM) configurations. Our methodology explores the performance benefits of incorporating area-decoupled subcells across layers and examines the impact of different bandgap arrangements (monotonic and non-monotonic) on the performance. We show that having non-monotonic arrangement of bandgaps under optimal albedo conditions can significantly enhance the performance of bifacial tandems. In addition, we analyze the performance resilience of each configuration and bandgap arrangement to spectral variations induced by environmental factors such as shading, fluctuations in temperature, and albedo. This provides crucial design guidelines for the design, fabrication, and estimation of the performance limits of these solar cell architectures in different conditions.</description></item><item><title>Performance Enhancement of Bifacial PV Modules on Horizontal Single-Axis Trackers in Desert Environments</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11206410</link><description>The adoption of bifacial photovoltaic (PV) modules has grown significantly due to their potential for higher energy yield.

Reliably managing high penetrations of solar PV within modern grids requires predictions that reflect the systemic consequences of fast renewable variability across cyber-physical energy infrastructure. This article proposes RR-LTNet, a ramp-rate (RR)-centric prediction architecture that elevates the RR as the core variability feature linking plant-level intermittency to grid-level operational risk. RR-LTNet first performs dynamic clustering of RR regimes to characterize rapid weather transitions and stability conditions. These regimes taken as feature for hybrid temporal learner that fuses recurrent memory with temporal convolution to capture multiscale dynamics. For predictive assessment, numerical experiments are conducted on one year solar power database of the Yulara Solar Project, Australia. The proposed RR-LTNet consistently outperforms other feature extraction methods by achieving up to 90% reductions in root mean square error (RMSE) for 5-min resolution. The reductions are significantly larger when baseline models are augmented with RR-aware features than when those features are absent. Cross-site validation on two additional PV plants with different capacity and data distribution confirms robustness and consistency required for system engineering deployment across fleets. By surfacing variability intelligence in real time, RR-LTNet supports PV-specific tasks central to reserve scheduling, advanced simulation of PV plant-grid interactions. This framework thus bridges PV monitoring analytics with system level reliability engineering, accelerating the integration of large-scale PV into modern power systems.</description></item><item><title>A 57.2 nW, 1.3&#8211;5 V VIN, &#8211;85 dB PSRR, 50 &#956;s Start-Up Time, Bandgap Reference Circuit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11127192</link><description>This article presents a low-power bandgap reference (BGR) featuring high power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) and fast start-up capability, operating across a wide supply voltage range of 1.3&#8211;5 V. A novel prebiased pulse current injection technique is proposed in the start-up circuit, achieving a 1% settling time of  $50~\mu $ s and a  $25\times $  speed gain during start-up. To enhance supply noise immunity, the proposed BGR employs a preregulated (PR)-based amplifier that effectively decouples the reference voltage from supply voltage fluctuations. Fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu $ m BCD process, the proposed reference occupies an active area of 0.0394 mm2. Under a 5 V supply, the circuit generates a 1.2 V reference voltage while consuming only 48 nA quiescent current. Operating down to a minimum supply voltage of 1.3 V, it maintains a low power consumption of 57.2 nW at room temperature. The reference exhibits an average temperature coefficient (TC) of 5.95 ppm/&#176;C across a wide temperature range ( $- 40~^{\circ }$ C to  $125~^{\circ }$ C) and achieves an outstanding line sensitivity (LS) of 0.00308%/V over the 1.3&#8211;5 V supply range. Furthermore, the measured PSRR reaches &#8722;85 dB at 100 Hz.</description></item><item><title>Low-Power Digital Temperature Compensation Technique for XO Wake-Up Timers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11153786</link><description>An accurate wake-up timer is crucial for low-power wireless Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Although duty cycling minimizes power consumption, synchronization with a base station or other devices requires periodic activation. Inaccuracies in the wake-up timer extend the active duration around the expected synchronization time, leading to increased energy consumption, which is especially critical in high-duty-cycle operations. This article presents a low-power digital compensation method to enhance the accuracy of a crystal oscillator (XO)-based wake-up timer over varying temperatures. The proposed approach dynamically adjusts the digital counter threshold value at each wake-up to compensate for XO frequency shifts caused by temperature changes. Delta-sigma ( $\Delta \Sigma $ ) modulation further reduces quantization noise for fractional time corrections. This work demonstrates the proposed technique on an existing low-power, miniature IoT system incorporating an exponential temperature sensor and employs two key strategies: 1) approximating the compensation curve as linear segments for simpler calculations and 2) replacing division-heavy operations with a successive approximation (SAR) method. These methods reduce the system&#8217;s time-shift error from 64.7 to 3.6 ppm using a single-point room-temperature calibration combined with adaptive temperature compensation, with a power overhead of only 7.92% (8.22 nW compensation +5.58 nW XO). Furthermore, a custom digital circuit for compensation minimizes the system power overhead to 5.07% (3.24 nW compensation +5.58 nW XO). Compared to state-of-the-art temperature-compensated XOs (TCXOs) using analog approaches, the proposed design reduces the power consumption by a factor of  $2.37\times $  while meeting the required time-error specification.</description></item><item><title>A 35.2-kHz, 75.4-dB Bulk-Driven OTA Using Degenerative Current Tram Structure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11147155</link><description>This article reports on the design of a high-performance operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) based on a degenerative current translation and mirroring (DI-Tram) circuit. The DI-Tram serves as the core of a high-performance, bulk-driven (BD), voltage-to-current (V/I) converter. The proposed OTA features a current mode, indirect Miller compensation technique, which improves the stability and gain&#8211;bandwidth (GBW) product. Fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS process, the OTA consumes as low as 39.1 nW of power when operated using a supply voltage of &#177;0.2 V.

Traditional DPD solutions are primarily designed for scenarios where PAs operate at a constant average power level (PL) and thus cannot be directly applied, as the PA is a dynamic nonlinear system significantly influenced by PLs. To address this issue, a self-adaptive residual long short-term memory (SAR_LSTM) neural network (NN) is proposed in this article for wide dynamic power range quadrature switched-capacitor PAs (SCPAs). The proposed model adopts a two-stage approach comprising a power variation module (PVM) and a residual LSTM (R_LSTM). In the first stage, the PVM generates a power variation-dependent feature vector, which is then multiplied with the original input signal. In the second stage, the adjusted input signal passes through the R_LSTM to perform the corresponding predistortion calibration. This process tightly integrates the underlying causes of power variation in the SCPA circuit with our model, enabling highly accurate self-adaptive calibration across a wide dynamic power range without requiring parameter updates. In the measurement, a 15-bit transformer-based quadrature SCPA chip with Class-G and IQ-cell-sharing techniques is implemented in a 28-nm CMOS process and employed to verify our method. For the 802.11ax 40-MHz 64-QAM signal at 2.4 GHz, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior linearization performance compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, with an average adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) of &#8722;39.5 dB and an average error vector magnitude (EVM) of &#8722;41.6 dB over a 30-dB dynamic power range.</description></item><item><title>Independently Reconfigurable Multiband All-Digital Transmitter Using SMASH Delta-Sigma Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11218024</link><description>A multiband reconfigurable all-digital transmitter (ADT) employing a sturdy multistage noise-shaping (SMASH) delta-sigma modulation (DSM) is proposed in this article. The N-stage SMASH DSM is presented digitally using unit signal transfer functions across cascaded stages, which supports arbitrary-stage extension for multiband transmission. Each stage is associated with a specific passband. By activating different stage numbers and adjusting only two parameters per stage, the numbers and frequencies of passbands are reconfigured simply and independently. Consequently, computational resources are significantly reduced, which is especially beneficial for four or more bands. Furthermore, the DSM outputs are directly extracted from individual stages to simplify the ADT architecture while the high efficiencies of subsequent power amplifiers (PAs) are maintained. By using the SMASH DSM, an ADT with multiband reconfigurable characteristics is proposed. With a resource-performance tradeoff, an ADT prototype based on a 2&#8211;2 SMASH DSM is implemented on a field programmable gate array (FPGA), which uses only 256 DSP48 slices. The transmissions are switched between single-band and dual-band configurations with carrier frequencies (CFs) independently tunable over 0&#8211;3.2 GHz. Measured adjacent channel leakage ratios (ACLRs) for 10- and 20-MHz dual-band signals are below &#8722;45 and &#8722;39.5 dBc, respectively, with error vector magnitudes (EVMs) below 1.6%. These results verify the agile multiband reconfiguration and excellent performance of the proposed SMASH DSM-based ADT.</description></item><item><title>High-Performance Gemmini-Based Matrix Multiplication Accelerator for Deep Learning Workloads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11153792</link><description>Transformer models have recently gained considerable attention in computer vision applications due to their capacity to capture relations among features, resulting in enhanced performance. Moreover, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been extensively researched due to their superior performance and applicability in several domains, including image classification, detection, and recognition. Matrix multiplications are crucial operations in Transformers and DNN, and computations such as weight stationary (WS) and output stationary (OS) are considered to meet the dataflow constraints. This work presents a systolic array (SA)-based general matrix multiplication (GEMM) architecture for Gemmini accelerators, enabling the performance of convolutions in neural networks and self-attention in Transformers. First, this work proposes a multiplier-optimized SA (MOSA) by integrating a novel multiplier. The multiplier is designed using a single-stage stacking-based 3:2 and 4:2 compressors. The proposed MOSA achieves significant improvements, with area savings ranging from 12% to 92% for 8-bit designs and 87%&#8211;89% for 16-bit designs across  $8 \times 8$ ,  $16 \times 16$ ,  $32 \times 32$ , and  $64 \times 64$  SAs. The proposed multiplier is employed to present a high-performance Gemmini SA for WS and OS dataflow; further modifications to the processing element (PE) are presented to achieve better performance over the existing Gemmini accelerator. In particular, the proposed WS PE achieves power-delay product (PDP) savings of 56%&#8211;59% and area-delay product (ADP) reductions of 45%&#8211;51%, while the OS PE shows PDP savings of 10%&#8211;46% and ADP reductions of 6%&#8211;42%. The analysis is further extended to both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers by integrating the proposed SA into complete inference pipelines, including AlexNet, MobileNetV2, and ResNet-50 for CNNs, and the self-attention mechanism of TinyBERT for Transformers. The MOSA-32 design delivers a GOPS improvement of 12%&#8211;91% across different CNN models and up to  $5.24\times $  for Transformer workloads. Similarly, MOSA-64 achieves up to 98% improvements across CNNs and up to  $6.14\times $  gains for Transformers. These improvements validate the effectiveness of the proposed energy-efficient PE design and its seamless integration into Gemmini SA, making the proposed architecture suitable for next-generation AI and Transformer accelerators for edge computing applications.</description></item><item><title>SteROI-D: System Design and Mapping for Stereo Depth Inference on Regions of Interest</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11180152</link><description>Machine learning algorithms have enabled high-quality stereo depth estimation to run on augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) devices.

This article introduces SteROI-D, a full-stereo depth system paired with a mapping methodology. SteROI-D exploits region-of-interest (ROI) and temporal sparsity at the system level to save energy. SteROI-D&#8217;s flexible and heterogeneous compute fabric supports diverse ROIs. Importantly, we introduce a systematic mapping methodology to effectively handle dynamic ROIs, thereby maximizing energy savings.

Lossless compression of the intermediate feature maps exhibits the plug-and-play feature without requiring additional evaluation or retraining. However, previous lossless compression hardware engines face challenges in the tradeoff between hardware complexity and compression ratio. To address this issue, this article proposes a hybrid-structured lossless compression and decompression engine of intermediate feature maps in vision neural networks. The proposed work combines multidimensional prediction, run-length encoding (RLE), and extended encoding (EE). In the predictive stage, delta and contextual prediction are employed to enhance sparsity for compression efficiency. In the encoding stage, RLE minimizes redundancy between adjacent bytes, and EE is used to select various compression methods to decrease bit-level redundancy dynamically. The average compression ratio of widely used vision neural networks is 48.42%, which is better than that of Huffman coding. Compared with the state-of-the-art works, it improves the average compression ratio by 20.90%. For hardware implementation, hardware reuse and data reuse are employed to achieve 17.95% and 21.18% reduction of the gate count and the power, respectively. Experimental results show that we achieve a throughput-per-area of 1.10 [(bits/cycle)/K GCs] and a throughput-per-power of 1.19 [(bits/cycle)/mW] in the 28-nm process node.</description></item><item><title>Resource Optimization in Polyphase-Filter STFT Based on Time-Multiplexed Constant Multiplication</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11165182</link><description>Real-time spectrum analysis is widely used in applications such as embedded audio analytics, digital acquisition instruments, electronic warfare, and micro-Doppler radar. These applications heavily rely on the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) engine, which delivers high throughput and leads to strict area and power budgets. However, current STFT architectures implemented on hardware still rely on massive arrays of generic multipliers or on-chip memories that store precomputed window coefficients, thereby limiting flexibility and increasing latency and resource consumption. The optimized windowing unit of the polyphase-filter STFT architecture proposed in this article is redesigned by time-multiplexed single and multiple constant multiplication (Tm-SCM/MCM) that are created from directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). The Tm-SCM-based design can replace the original generic multiplier. The Tm-MCM-based design can reduce the adders and multiplexers (MUXs) by analyzing the window function coefficients among different channels. Both methods can minimize the redundant adders and MUXs compared with the existing algorithms and remove all DSP generic multipliers. Experiments on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and ASIC show that the proposed Tm-SCM/MCM Hann window core reduces area and delay and lowers dynamic power. When the same cores are integrated into a 32-point STFT, overall slice count drops, all BRAM blocks in the windowing unit are removed, latency stays low, output SQNR matches recent polyphase and fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based designs, and figure-of-merit analysis confirms that the proposed architecture delivers the best overall balance of resources, speed, and power among the compared solutions. These findings show that optimization of windowing units by constant multiplication offers a cost-effective solution for upcoming high-overlap, real-time STFT applications by concurrently reducing resource footprint and maintaining spectral fidelity.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Polynomial Multiplication Accelerator for Lattice-Based Cryptography With a 2-D Winograd-Based Divide-and-Conquer Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11151218</link><description>Polynomial multiplication over rings constitutes one of the most computationally expensive operations in lattice-based cryptography. To accelerate it, the algorithm based on divide-and-conquer has received extensive attention because it has no strict parameter restrictions compared with the number theoretic transform (NTT). Among divide-and-conquer algorithms, apart from algorithms like Karatsuba and Schoolbook, the Winograd-based method has emerged as a new approach. This is because it can reduce the amount of computation while maintaining the scalability of parallelism. However, the parameters of the existing Winograd-based polynomial multiplication algorithm are conservative, and there is potential for further reducing the computational load. Therefore, we propose a novel and efficient 2-D Winograd-based polynomial multiplication (2-D WPM) algorithm. In this algorithm, we adopt the 2-D Winograd to alleviate the large denominator divisions and large-number multiplications that occur in the conventional 1-D Winograd as the parameter increases. We also propose a division elimination method to eliminate the inevitable divisions in the 2-D Winograd. When the polynomial length is 1024, compared with Schoolbook, 2-D WPM ( ${m} =3$ ,  ${r} =3$ ) can reduce the number of basic multiplications by 69%. In addition, an efficient polynomial multiplication accelerator for lattice-based cryptography named EPMA is proposed. In EPMA, we design reconfigurable modular arithmetic units to support both prime moduli and power-of-2 moduli. Keeping the full pipelined structure of EPMA, we also fully reuse the input data and the Winograd transformation results to achieve the conservation of hardware resources. EPMA is implemented on Xilinx FPGAs. Compared with previous works on FPGAs, under the same platform and parameters, the area efficiency of EPMA achieves an improvement of  $1.22\times $  to  $18.02\times $ . Compared with previous works on CPUs and GPUs, the computing speed of EPMA achieves an improvement of 9.25 to  $1294.51\times $ .</description></item><item><title>Coordinating Binary Trait: Accurate and Lightweight Runtime On-Chip Power Meter Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11135453</link><description>As heterogeneous platforms scale, power management issues grow increasingly critical. On-chip power awareness is fundamental to effective power management on such platforms. However, the integration of diverse components leads to higher power consumption and more complex power patterns, complicating the perception of power distribution. To address this challenge, this article presents COordinating BInary Trait (COBIT), which focuses on the design and optimization of on-chip power meters (OPMs) for heterogeneous design, enabling power management in large-scale systems. COBIT extracts essential bitwise wires as features, learns a boosting model based on binary trees, and implements the OPM for runtime power prediction. Additionally, multiobjective optimization algorithms are employed in the design space exploration of the power meter to ensure an accurate and low-overhead integration. Experimental results demonstrate the capabilities of COBIT on heterogeneous hardware. Using only 0.028% bitwise power proxies of all RTL wires in the NVIDIA deep learning accelerator (NVDLA) and 0.036% in the Berkeley out-of-order machine (BOOM) processor core, the per-cycle models achieve a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.69% and 2.49%, respectively. Regarding the success rate of predictions on power peaks in NVDLA, COBIT achieves a maximum performance improvement of 12.93% and an average improvement of 8.11% over existing methods. Moreover, the gate-area/power overhead of our OPM on BOOM and NVDLA is 1.25%/0.217% and 0.49%/0.097%, respectively, while performing per-cycle power prediction in just three cycles. Unlike previous approaches, which struggle with balancing accuracy and efficiency, COBIT effectively addresses both challenges, delivering unprecedented benefits for large-scale systems.</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid Stochastic-Binary Computing Batch Normalization Engine for Low-Power On-Chip Learning Spiking Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11148273</link><description>Batch normalization (BN) has proven to be a critical component in speeding up the training of deep spiking neural networks in deep learning. However, conventional BN implementations face significant challenges in terms of excessive off-chip memory bandwidth requirements and complex circuit designs, hindering their applicability for on-chip training in spiking neural networks (SNNs). This article introduces a novel hybrid stochastic-binary computing BN engine (HBN) that strikes an optimal balance between computational efficiency and hardware resource utilization, enabling efficient on-chip learning for SNNs. While conventional binary-mode BN engines offer temporal efficiency, they demand substantial hardware resources. In contrast, stochastic computing (SC)-based BN approaches reduce hardware overhead but introduce latency penalties and necessitate additional random number generation (RNG) circuits. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid architecture that seamlessly integrates binary and stochastic computing (SC) paradigms. Our co-designed methodology effectively balances computational latency and hardware footprint. This is achieved by a rounding-free SC multiplier unified with binary-circuit map ping, which eliminates latency and RNG overheads. Extensive validation across both static image datasets and neuromorphic datasets demonstrates that HBN maintains algorithmic fidelity while achieving unprecedented computational efficiency. Simulation results reveal 98.7% reduction in floating-point operations (FLOPs), 98.5% latency improvement, and 98.2% energy consumption reduction compared with conventional BN implementations. FPGA implementation on the ZCU102 platform demonstrates practical hardware advantages, including 74.9% reduction in look-up table (LUT) utilization, 83.6% decrease in flip-flop (FF) count, and 13.7% reduction in block RAM (BRAM) allocation. Notably, the design achieves 63.7% power reduction compared with state-of-the-art implementations while maintaining complete DSP-free operation.</description></item><item><title>Bitline-Paired 2T SOT-MRAM Cell for Energy-Efficient Memory Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11145964</link><description>Spin-orbit torque magnetic random access memory (SOT-MRAM) has recently gained great attention due to its various benefits on memory implementation. However, SOT-MRAM suffers from high read and write energy consumption, making it difficult to replace conventional CMOS-based memories. This article presents a novel bitline (BL)-paired 2T SOT-MRAM cell structure, where the read and write path can be decoupled without causing bit-cell area overhead. Thanks to the separation of the read and write path, the BL parasitic capacitance can be reduced, which ultimately reduces read energy consumption. In addition, the read scheme tailored to the bit-cell structure is proposed to further enhance the read energy. The proposed cell also shows considerable write energy improvement when applying the write termination techniques that require simultaneous read and write operations. The HSPICE circuit simulations using the 28-nm CMOS technology show that the proposed BL-paired 2T SOT-MRAM cell with BL sharing achieves an average of 42.9% read energy savings, and an average of 56.8% write energy reduction compared to the conventional 2T cell in a  $512\times 512$  array.

The emergence of neuromorphic vision systems, integrating event-driven cameras with spiking neural networks (SNNs), has recently gained attention as a promising paradigm for edge deployment of optical flow estimation due to their advantages in ultralow power and resource efficiency. However, current neuromorphic computing platforms lack specialized architectures optimized for this problem domain. Existing implementations either prioritize configurable architectures at the expense of energy efficiency or employ intricate hardware control mechanisms to manage the asynchronous and sparse computing patterns inherent in SNNs. To address these limitations, we present ASNA-Flow, an event-driven asynchronous neuromorphic accelerator featuring a pioneering algorithm&#8211;hardware co-design framework specifically tailored for event-based optical flow estimation. Our methodology encompasses three key innovations: 1) a hardware-aware algorithm optimization that maintains computational fidelity while enhancing implementation efficiency; 2) systematic data pattern analysis to inform architectural decisions; and 3) novel exploitation of optical flow&#8217;s spatial locality characteristics to enable efficient sparse computing. Implemented in TSMC 28-nm CMOS technology, ASNA-Flow achieves real-time performance of 104 frames per second (FPS) with ultralow power consumption of 7.9 mW, demonstrating superior energy efficiency of 0.3 pJ per synaptic operation (SOP). This work establishes the first dedicated neuromorphic computing solution that simultaneously addresses the temporal sparsity, event-driven processing, and energy constraints inherent in optical flow estimation tasks.</description></item><item><title>Unlimited Vector Processing for Wireless Baseband Based on RISC-V Extension</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11152337</link><description>Wireless baseband processing (WBP) serves as an ideal scenario for utilizing vector processing, which excels in managing data-parallel operations due to its parallel structure. However, conventional vector architectures face certain constraints such as limited vector register sizes, reliance on power-of-two vector length (VL) multipliers, and vector permutation capabilities tied to specific architectures. To address these challenges, we have introduced an instruction set extension (ISE) based on RISC-V known as unlimited vector processing (UVP). This extension enhances both the flexibility and efficiency of vector computations. UVP employs a novel programming model that supports non-power-of-two register groupings (RGs) and hardware strip mining, thus enabling smooth handling of vectors of varying lengths while reducing the software strip-mining burden. Vector instructions are categorized into symmetric and asymmetric classes, complemented by specialized load/store strategies to optimize execution. Moreover, we present a hardware implementation of UVP featuring sophisticated hazard detection mechanisms, optimized pipelines for symmetric tasks such as fixed-point multiplication and division, and a robust permutation engine for effective asymmetric operations. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that UVP significantly enhances performance, achieving up to  $3.0\times $  and  $2.1\times $  speedups in matrix multiplication and fast Fourier transform (FFT) tasks, respectively, when measured against lane-based vector architectures. Our synthesized register transfer level (RTL) for a 16-lane configuration using SMIC 40-nm technology spans 0.94 mm2 and achieves an area efficiency of 21.2 GOPS/mm2.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Parallel Testing and Implicit Cost-Driven Tuning of RF-MIMO Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11204724</link><description>Modern wireless communications systems deploy massive MIMO systems with large numbers of transmit and receive antennas and analog-digital RF transceiver architectures that admit RF beamforming. These systems need to be tested and tuned postmanufacture to ensure signal quality. In analog architectures, this poses a problem due to the lack of observability of internal circuit nodes and due to the convergence of multiple RF beamforming chains into a combined baseband signal from which it is difficult to de-embed individual RF chain behaviors. Existing test techniques estimate nonlinearities in RF chains up to the third order and require significant frequency bandwidth to test multiple RF chains in a MIMO system in parallel, thereby reducing the overall test time. In this research, to improve testing efficiency, overlapping test tones over a minimal frequency range are applied to each of the MIMO RF chains in parallel, allowing specifications of individual RF chains up to fifth-order distortion to be determined accurately. For postmanufacture tuning, a response feature clustering approach followed by an implicit cost-driven tuning procedure is proposed. Tuning for error vector magnitude (EVM) and signal-to-interference ratio (SiNR) is performed under power constraints. Experimental results show that the proposed parallel testing methodology is  $1.7\times $  more frequency-efficient than existing techniques, and the proposed postmanufacture tuning algorithm can tune a receiver with four RF chains in 1.8 ms.</description></item><item><title>POCA: First Power-on Chip Authentication and Key Exchange for Secure Provisioning in System-on-Chip</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11153572</link><description>In a horizontal business model, the manufacturing and testing of system-on-chip (SoC) design at offshore facilities has proven to be a cost-effective strategy for fabless design houses. This, however, has led to growing concerns about the security and reliability of chips manufactured by outsourced semiconductor foundries, assembly, and test entities. As such, untrusted entities have access to the entire chip design; they may exploit opportunities for IP piracy, overproduction, cloning, shipping defective or out-of-specification chips, and insecure boot. Design houses must address these concerns by securing the die/packaged chips and their assets in such an untrusted environment. Unfortunately, this cannot be accomplished by any of the current security primitives [e.g., physical unclonable functions (PUFs)] due to their inherent limitations at this stage. Furthermore, provisioning the security assets requires a secure key exchange protocol, which is difficult to accomplish with untrusted entities (tester and software proxies) existing between the die/chip under test and the secure cloud server. This article introduces a novel security primitive and a power-on chip authentication protocol called POCA, which enables the secure provisioning of security assets during wafer sort. POCA incurs a low area overhead and is resilient to any attacks known today.</description></item><item><title>Toward Reliable Onboard AI in Space: A Fault-Tolerant Soft GPU-Based System-on-Chip</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11130453</link><description>Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly relevant for space applications, reducing reliance on high-bandwidth downlinks. Its use, however, has primarily been demonstrated in low Earth orbit (LEO) using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. Extending its use to deep-space and long-duration missions requires computing platforms capable of operating in harsh radiation environments without incurring prohibitive costs. This is particularly important for systems implemented on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), which are widely used in space applications due to their scalability and support for various radiation-hardening profiles. This flexibility makes them preferable to application-specific integrated circuits, whose low production volumes often do not justify their use in space systems. This article details our efforts to develop a novel system-on-chip (SoC) featuring GPU@SAT, a soft graphic processing unit IP provided by IngeniArs S.r.l., with a focus on enhancing its robustness when implemented on the Xilinx radiation-tolerant XQRKU060 FPGA. This approach leverages FPGA reconfigurability and radiation tolerance alongside the high-performance capabilities of graphic processing units (GPUs), unlocking significant potential for accelerating compute-intensive tasks in edge-space applications. Building on this foundation, we employ a classification-based methodology to improve the fault tolerance of GPU@SAT, analyzing trade-offs on performance, power, and area. Additional IP cores, such as a watchdog timer (WDT), a dual RISC-V lockstep with rollback, and the Xilinx Soft Error Mitigation IP, are employed to further improve the SoC robustness. Fault injection on an FPGA prototype targeting essential configuration bits validates the approach, showing a  $15.4\times $  improvement in mean injections before failure over the baseline architecture, with only a  $1.2\times $  increase in hardware complexity.</description></item><item><title>A Time-Domain Integration Comparison Scheme With Noise Immunity for Wake-Up Receivers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11123760</link><description>Traditional wake-up receiver (WuRX) systems based on voltage-domain comparators for weak signal detection can readily suffer from false triggering due to noise. To address this issue, this work analyzes the mechanism of noise-induced failure in traditional voltage-domain comparator and proposes a time-domain comparator (TDCMP) scheme based on time-domain integration. By temporally integrating the input signal, the noise immunity of the comparator is significantly enhanced. To suppress process, supply voltage, and temperature (PVT) drift in the TDCMP, this work designs a frequency-locked loop (FLL) that employs a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) isomorphic to the TDCMP&#8217;s voltage-controlled delay line (VCDL) for drift calibration while simultaneously providing the clock signal for the WuRX. Implemented in a 65-nm CMOS process, the core chip area is 0.23 mm2, with a total system power consumption of 20.9 nW. The measurement results demonstrate that the proposed TDCMP enhances the WuRX sensitivity by 4 dB.</description></item><item><title>Camouflaged Logic Gates Using Threshold-Voltage-Defined Memory Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11145962</link><description>This brief proposes two types of camouflaged logic gates using threshold-voltage-defined memory cells (TVD-MCs). The proposed multiplexer-select TVD-MC (MS-TVDMC) gate consists of a target logic gate, several camouflage logic gates, a multiplexer (MUX), and TVD-MCs. All logic gates and MUX are implemented with standard threshold-voltage transistors. The TVD-MC is composed of two cross-coupled inverters with low- or high-threshold-voltage transistors. When its supply voltage increases from ground to  ${V} _{\text {DD}}$ , its data become &#8220;0&#8221; or &#8220;1&#8221; according to the threshold voltages of transistors in two inverters. The target logic gate is selected with the MUX by the data stored in the TVD-MCs. The data are defined by the threshold voltages of transistors, so that it is difficult to distinguish the target logic gate from the other camouflage logic gates. The proposed logic-merged TVD-MC (LM-TVDMC) gate merges all logic gates and MUX in the MS-TVDMC gate at the transistor level. The proposed camouflaged gates significantly reduce the delay, power consumption, and leakage current compared to the conventional dynamic enhanced-TVD (DE-TVD) camouflaged gate requiring the dynamic power and delay overheads and the conventional threshold-voltage-defined (TVD) switch camouflaged gate with large on-resistances in switch transistors.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Challenge Cross-Selection Physical Unclonable Function Based on MRAM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11134498</link><description>The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has triggered massive data transmission. Meanwhile, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) introduce new security vulnerabilities in device interactions. These challenges demand lightweight yet robust security solutions. In this context, physical unclonable functions (PUFs) serve as critical hardware security primitives, enabling reliable authentication for edge devices. Nevertheless, PUF is increasingly susceptible to novel threats, notably machine learning attacks. To address this security vulnerability to attacks, we propose a novel double-layer dynamic challenge cross-selection magnetoresistive random access memory PUF (MPUF). This design leverages the inherent process variation in spin-transfer torque magnetoresistive random access memory (STT-MRAM) as an entropy source. The proposed structure incorporates an obfuscation decode circuit (ODC) that combines xor gates and shift registers. It dynamically obfuscates interlayer relationships between two PUF arrays to enhance circuit nonlinearity. The simulation results demonstrate uniformity of 50.16%, uniqueness of 49.94%, a worst bit error rate (BER) of 2.34% for  $- 25~^{\circ } $ C to  $125~^{\circ } $ C and 1.56% for  $0.5\sim 1.1$  V. In addition, four common machine learning models are used to attack this PUF, achieving accuracies of 50.49%, 50.49%, 50.48%, and 58.41%, which are close to a random guess. Compared with traditional PUF implementations, this work exhibits higher reliability and enhanced security while maintaining low power consumption of approximately 9.975 fJ/bit.</description></item><item><title>A Fast and Energy-Efficient Level Shifter With Complementary Output Buffer for Energy-Constrained Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11132353</link><description>This brief presents a 55-nm level shifter (LS) that enables wide voltage range conversion from 80mV to 1.2V with high energy efficiency and fast transition speed. The proposed design incorporates a complementary output buffer and an assist discharge path to suppress the short-circuit current and enhance the transition speed. A multithreshold transistor strategy is adopted to expand the input range and reduce static power.

The proposed design implements two-stage energy conversion based on burst charging mode, achieving ultrahigh sensitivity by using an intermittent charging method that eliminates the charge pump&#8217;s loading effect on the RF rectifier. An all-nMOS RF--dc rectifier with internal  ${V}_{\mathrm {TH}}$  cancellation (IVC) technique achieves an ultrawide high-power conversion efficiency (PCE) input power range for an RF energy harvesting. Furthermore, a  ${V} _{\mathrm {TH}}$ -based voltage reference is introduced, enabling subthreshold operation of transistors with picowatt-level power consumption, thereby simultaneously improving both PCE and sensitivity.

The RX employs a quarter-rate clocking architecture to reduce the on-chip clock (CK) frequency and ensure reliable operation under stringent DFE timing constraints. The slicer output is fed back to the DFE weight selection MUX integrated into the second-stage slicer, achieving a short feedback loop latency. In the proposed architecture, the number of stacked transistors in the slicer is reduced to three, thereby reducing the CK-to-Q delay and overall DFE feedback loop latency. This optimized design increases the feedback speed and alleviates DFE timing constraints, ensuring stable operation even at low supply voltages. A prototype RX was fabricated using a 65-nm CMOS process and had an area of 0.004 mm2. The proposed RX achieved a measured bit error rate (BER) below  $10^{-12}$  at a data rate of 14 Gb/s with an insertion loss of &#8722;12 dB and achieved a power efficiency of 0.097 pJ/bit with a supply voltage of 0.75 V.</description></item><item><title>Cactus: A Multicore Spiking Neural Network Accelerator With Fine-Grained Structured Weight Sparsity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11170448</link><description>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are a promising alternative to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) due to their biologically inspired and event-driven characteristics. Similar to ANN, the weights in SNN also exhibit significant sparsity. How to make full use of the weight sparsity in SNN and coordinate hardware design to optimize resource utilization has become a challenge. In this brief, a multicore SNN accelerator named Cactus, based on a fine-grained and programmable structured pruning strategy is proposed. It is a balanced block pruning strategy, which achieves high accuracy in image and speech classification tasks while ensuring high processing elements (PEs) utilization. To increase flexibility, the block size can be configured as  $8\times 8$ ,  $16\times 16$ ,  $32\times 32$ ,  $64\times 64$  in Cactus.

The proposed capacitor-mismatch-error-free (CMEF) switching scheme intrinsically eliminates MSB digital-to-analog converter (DAC) mismatch errors through identical shift in the bottom-plate reference voltage, thereby realizing 0.9- and 2.9-dB improvements in the signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) and spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR), respectively, over the tri-level switching method. Fabricated in a 40-nm CMOS technology, the prototype NS-SAR ADC occupies a core area of 0.053 mm ${}^{\mathbf {2}}$  and consumes  $87.7~\mu $ W at 1.1-V supply. With an oversampling ratio (OSR) of 12 and a 50-kHz bandwidth (BW), it achieves 84.6-dB SNDR and 95.4-dB SFDR, yielding a Schreier figure-of-merit (FoM) of 172.2 dB and a Walden FoM of 63.2 fJ/step.</description></item><item><title>Erratum to &#8220;A 7-bit 1.15-GS/s 2.6-bit/Cycle Asynchronous SAR ADC Using Comparator Decision Skip Technique With Background Offset Calibration&#8221;</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11274465</link><description>In the above article [1], the effective number of bits (ENOB) was calculated using (70) in [2, Sec. 9.4], and the Walden figure of merit (FoMw) was derived from this ENOB value.

The CCCA achieves a high dynamic range (DR) due to its very low noise floor and is implemented with common low-voltage (LV) input devices, while the voltage-boosting power stage achieves a boosted output power ( $P_{\mathrm {OUT}}$ ) with good power efficiency due to its single-stage power delivery. Compared with prior-art CDAs utilizing a capacitive-feedback scheme with two off-chip inductors, this work uses only a single off-chip inductor and has additional output voltage ( $V_{\mathrm {OUT}}$ ) boost capability. The proposed DSVB modulation doubles the effective switching frequency to enhance the LC attenuation, leading to reduced differential-mode electromagnetic interference (EMI) and, unlike typical BD modulation, no modulation-induced common-mode EMI is generated. Compared with the other state-of-the-art LV digital-input CDAs, this work&#8217;s CDA, fabricated using a 0.5- $\mu $ m process, achieves the highest DR of 121.3 dB and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 115 dB, as well as a competitive minimal total harmonic distortion plus noise (THD+N) of 0.0019%. It can deliver a maximum  $P_{\mathrm {OUT}}$  of 1.6 W into an 8- $\Omega $  load with a peak power efficiency of 87.2%.</description></item><item><title>A 12.8-GS/s Time-Interleaved Sub-Sampling ADC Front End With 38-GHz Input Bandwidth and &gt;39-dB SNDR for 1&#8211;32 GHz in 22-nm FDSOI</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11143234</link><description>In this article, we present a  $4\times $  time-interleaved analog-to-digital converter (ADC) front end operating at 12.8 GS/s. We designed for a high tracking bandwidth (BW) of 38 GHz and optimized the SNDR up to the 5th Nyquist zone. This allows covering the targeted Ka-band frequencies of 27&#8211;31 GHz allocated for high-throughput Earth-to-satellite communication without the need for a dedicated mixer, enabling a wideband direct RF sub-sampling receiver approach. We employ an inductor-based input network together with co-optimized push&#8211;pull buffers and an active bootstrapping concept in the critical first track-and-hold (TH) for BW enhancement and improved linearity. Because the focus of this work lies in achieving a high SNDR at multi-ten-GHz inputs rather than maximizing the sampling rate  $f {_{S}}$ , we implement a single 1st-rank TH to eliminate the need for skew and BW mismatch calibration. A prototype of this two-rank TH is implemented in 22-nm FDSOI technology. Measurements of four different chip samples indicate SNDR &gt;39 dB up to 32-GHz input frequency at 12.8-GS/s operation while consuming 87 mW. A sweep of  $f {_{S}}$  from 4.8 to 15.2 GHz and &#177;10% supply variation causes &lt;1.3-dB SNDR fluctuation at a 30.2-GHz input. We estimate the total aperture jitter to about 25 fs, and an input  ${S_{{11}}{\lt }} {-}12$ dB is achieved up to 35 GHz.</description></item><item><title>A Compact and Ultra-Low-Power 32-kHz Conduction-Angle-Adaptive Crystal Oscillator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11151988</link><description>This article presents an ultra-low-power and compact 32-kHz crystal oscillator (XO) with intrinsic start-up capability for real-time clock (RTC) applications. The key idea is to operate a Pierce oscillator in a class-C-like fashion, with a digitally defined conduction angle generated based on the current oscillation amplitude. Hence, the XO can start-up when no oscillation is present and boosts its energy efficiency as the oscillation amplitude grows. Two circuit techniques based on the use of charge pumps are proposed in this work to generate this conduction angle information on-chip and regulate the oscillation amplitude. The proposed circuit topology, named the conduction-angle-adaptive XO (CAAXO), is verified through a fabricated integrated circuit (IC) implemented in 28-nm CMOS technology. Measurement results across ten samples demonstrate that under a 0.38-V supply, the proposed circuit functions well across a temperature range of  ${-} 20~{^{\circ } }$ C to  $85~{^{\circ } }$ C while only consuming 0.36 nW of power at  $25~{^{\circ } }$ C room temperature. Furthermore, the proposed CAAXO only occupies 820  $\mu $ m2 of core area, marking it the smallest XO among the state of the art.</description></item><item><title>A 14-b Energy-Efficient BW/Power Scalable CTDSM With a Frequency-Controlled Current Source</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11219048</link><description>This work presents a 14-bit energy-efficient bandwidth (BW)/power scalable continuous-time delta&#8211;sigma modulator (CTDSM) for sensor interfaces in IoT applications. To ensure low noise for small input signals and achieve BW/power scalability, it is built around Gm-C integrators biased via a linear frequency-controlled current source (FCCS). The FCCS enables the integrators to maintain a nearly constant output swing and linearly scalable power consumption across a wide sampling frequency ( $f_{s}$ ) range. Furthermore, multi-bit quantization and dead-band (DB) switches are applied to suppress the nonlinearity of the open-loop Gm-C integrator and DAC transient glitches, respectively. Fabricated in a standard 130-nm CMOS process, it occupies an active area of 0.29 mm2. With an input of &#177;80 mV, the proposed CTDSM demonstrates a nearly constant peak SNDR (~85 dB) and a stable energy efficiency over a  $225\times $  scaling range of  $f_{s}$  under a 0.9-V supply.

It uses a differential first-order RC low-pass filter (LPF) front end to convert parallel-plate capacitance to phase shift, which is further digitized by a high-resolution second-order CT phase-domain (PD) delta&#8211;sigma modulator (CT-PD $\Delta \Sigma $ M). The electrical field interference of the sensor, modeled as a capacitive-coupled charge on the common plate, is rejected by differential-mode readout and built-in bandpass interference filtering of the proposed architecture. To achieve a high temperature stability, the RC filter&#8217;s temperature coefficient (TC) is compensated by driving it using an RC frequency reference with the same temperature dependency. Fabricated in a standard 180-nm CMOS process, the sensor draws  $347~\mu $ A from a 1.8-V supply. The sensor offers common-mode rejection ratios (CMRRs) of &gt;119 dB near dc and &gt;97 dB around 100 MHz, providing reliable electrical field interference immunity.

Especially, the switched-capacitor voltage regulator (SCVR) becomes popular as the second-stage converter owing to its high efficiency and power density. However, the SCVR suffers from poor voltage regulation and limited load capacity. To address these limitations, this article presents a two-stage converter featuring a regulated resonant switched-capacitor (ReSC) second-stage design. Thanks to the resonant operation of the ReSC, the converter achieves the superior power density and load capacity using a compact sub-nano-henry trace inductor. In addition, the resonant operation paves way for the voltage regulation, which is further employed for enhancing transient performances. Finally, to overcome the inherent efficiency versus voltage regulation tradeoff for the ReSC, a collaborative control scheme is built between the first and second stages, which adaptively adjusts the intermediate bus voltage to maintain the ReSC always in the efficient non-regulation mode for the entire output voltage range, leading to a high efficiency for a wide voltage and current range. By employing discrete GaNFETs for the first stage and 65-nm CMOS technology for the ReSC and controller design, the proposed two-stage converter achieves a measured system peak efficiency of 89.3% for 12:1-V conversion. With a 4-A/20-ns load current step, the measured undershoot voltage is 26 mV.</description></item><item><title>A Symbol-Based Power-Tracking Supply Modulator Integrated With a 28-GHz CMOS PA for 5G FR2</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11159181</link><description>This article presents a supply-modulated power amplifier (PA) system architecture for a high-efficiency transmitter (TX) that utilizes a symbol-power-tracking (SPT) technique to support 5G new radio (NR) frequency range 2 (FR2) bands. Conventional analog envelope tracking (ET) supply modulators (SMs) suffer from limited supportable bandwidth due to a decoupling capacitor required at the PA supply node, which makes loop compensation difficult. As a result, analog ET techniques often require complex loop compensation circuits and struggle to meet the stringent specifications of next-generation communication systems. To support wider channel bandwidths, the proposed architecture adopts an SPT supply modulation technique, realized through a single-inductor multiple-output (SIMO) dc&#8211;dc converter, enhancing overall SM-PA system efficiency. The full integration of the SM and PA using a single process helps to mitigate voltage overshoot on the PA supply node during fast SPT transitions, contributing to enhanced device reliability and longer lifetime. In addition, an SPT-adaptive biasing scheme is implemented to adjust the PA bias according to the supply voltage, maintaining linearity across multiple supply levels for the PA. The SPT-PA system is fabricated using a 28-nm CMOS process. The SPT modulator achieves a 20-ns/V transition time with nonuniform supply voltage distribution. It supports a 400-MHz 5G FR2 64-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signal at a 28-GHz PA operating frequency, achieving a 21-mW power saving at a 10-dB power back-off (PBO) level. The die size is 1.5 mm2.</description></item><item><title>A 1.52-W Capacitor-Drop Sigma-Floating-SC AC/DC Converter for Grid Power to IoT Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11151982</link><description>This work proposes a switched-capacitor (SC)-based non-isolated ac&#8211;dc power converter, converting the ac mains (110V @ 60Hz or 230V @ 50Hz) input to a single-cell battery voltage (3.3&#8211;4.6V), optimized for the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and smart home devices.

Piezoelectric (PE) and electromagnetic (EM) transducers are widely used to convert vibration energy into electrical power. While hybrid PE&#8211;EM harvesters can deliver higher output power to support self-sustained systems, existing implementations invariably rely on at least one off-chip inductor for either PE bias-flip or dc&#8211;dc conversion, substantially increasing system volume. This article presents an inductor-less, capacitor-less PE&#8211;EM hybrid energy harvesting platform that eliminates this limitation. By leveraging the inherent phase synchronization between PE and EM sources, the proposed coil-sharing technique enables both bias-flip and dc&#8211;dc conversion without additional passive components, enabling the first fully integrated hybrid energy harvesting system. Fabricated in 0.18- $\mu $ m CMOS technology, the prototype delivers dual-regulated outputs at 1.8 and 5 V for multi-domain sensor nodes, achieving a maximum output power of 2.72 mW and a peak end-to-end (E2E) efficiency of 90%.

This PA features a symmetrical topology that effectively cancels dipole emissions, while its series inductors placed between the cross-connected high-side and low-side transistors that inherently block shoot-through currents. To address the resulting degeneration states of oscillation, we introduce small, actively driven transistors, whereas the original power transistors operate in a passively driven manner, with their gate charge recycled like in a Class-D oscillator. This preserves the advantage of low gate drive loss ( $P_{\mathrm { G}}$ ) in high-frequency oscillators. The frequency misalignment between the switching and oscillation frequencies leads to only minor efficiency degradation. This eliminates the requirement for switching frequency calibration, while enables the low-complexity frequency hopping to further reduce EMI. We fabricated the PA and the receiver (RX) chips using 0.18- $\boldsymbol {\mu }$ m bipolar&#8211;CMOS&#8211;DMOS (BCD) process and attached them with a 14.4-mm $\boldsymbol {^{2}}$  PCB transformer.

The converter achieves always-half-inductor current (AHI) in both directions compared to conventional bidirectional converters (CBCs) while using only 5-V transistors. This enables the elimination of high-voltage (HV) transistors, which have poor on-resistance ( $R_{\mathrm { ON}}$ ) performance and increase process costs. In addition, to address the challenge of varying charging current caused by changes in a battery voltage ( $V_{\mathrm { BAT}}$ ), we propose a normalized inductor current ( $N_{\mathrm { IL}}$ )-based adaptive target current controller that leverages the relationship between the inductor current ( $I_{L}$ ) and output current to effectively regulate the battery charging current ( $I_{\mathrm { BAT}}$ ). By utilizing the proposed controller,  $I_{\mathrm { BAT}}$  adaptively tracks the target charging current regardless of  $V_{\mathrm { BAT}}$ , which varies depending on the state-of-charge. The prototype chip was fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS process with a 4.7- $\mu $ H inductor, two 10- $\mu $ F flying capacitors, and a 10- $\mu $ F output capacitor.

The proposed design provides two regulated outputs in separate domains in the receiver (Rx) side with a single micro-transformer. These isolated Rxes achieve local voltage regulation and automatic energy distribution across domains through passive magnetic flux sharing (PMFS) without any shared controllers or communication links for coordination. The transmitter (Tx) achieves global power modulation by sensing Rx behaviors through the reflected impedance without using dedicated digital isolators as data links, thus enables closed-loop control with a fast transient response. The SLiMDO converter prototype consists of one Tx chip and two identical Rx chips for two outputs, all fabricated in 0.18- $\mu $ m CMOS using 3.3-V I/O devices.

For a centralized energy storage system in humanoid robots, its battery pack (heart) is located in the main body while the energy is mostly consumed through its legs and hands, demanding thick wires (strong blood vessels) to deliver power to the actuators (muscles). In this work, we present a high-voltage power transmission cable system, which utilizes two bidirectional dual-path boost&#8211;buck (DP-BB) converters and reuses the parasitic cable inductor as the power inductor for a compact and efficient power delivery. The proposed power system reduces the cable current by 50%&#8211;67% and reduces the cable weight by 50%. In addition, the proposed phase alignment scheme can reduce the cable current ripple in such high-voltage conversion case. The converter was fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu $ m BCD process, occupying an area of  $3.56\times 5.55$  mm2 and a volume of  $3.56\times 5.55\times 1.2$  mm3, including all the passive components. A 2-m 28 AWG power cable with a parasitic inductance of  $1.99~\mu $ H and a resistance of 959 m $\Omega $  is utilized. It achieves a peak power conversion efficiency of 96.7% at 16.5-W output power and supports a maximum power delivery capacity of 45 W.</description></item><item><title>A Calibration-Free Pipelined-SAR ADC With Cross-Stage Gain-Mismatch Error Shaping and Inherent Noise Shaping</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11236428</link><description>This article presents a calibration-free pipelined-successive-approximation-register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) based on the proposed cross-stage gain-mismatch-error shaping (CS-GMES) mechanism. The CS-GMES is realized by including the entire 2nd stage into MES operation to unify the gain error and the 2nd-stage mismatch error. A feedback capacitor provides cross-stage connection and mismatch reference, and prevents saturation issues. Besides, low-cost noise shaping (NS) is achieved by the inherent residue preservation of the 2nd stage. A negative-R-assisted residue integrator instead of an amplifier is proposed to realize high-efficiency residue summation and 1st-order error-feedback NS. With the proposed techniques, the prototype fabricated in a 55-nm CMOS process achieves a 93.3-dB signal-to-noise-and-distortion-ratio (SNDR) within a bandwidth of 156.25 kHz without any off-chip calibration. It consumes 306.88 uW from a 1.2-V supply and exhibits a 180.4-dB Schreier figure of merits (FoM). Among a gain error range of &#8722;33% to +50%, the SNDR drops less than 3 dB.</description></item><item><title>A Filter-Embedded Pipe-SAR ADC With Progressive Conversion and Floating Charge Transfer Amplifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11172702</link><description>This article presents a filter-embedded pipelined successive-approximation (SAR) (pipe-SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) architecture that achieves high efficiency and wide bandwidth for next-generation wireless applications. A progressive conversion technique is proposed to improve the conversion speed of filter-embedded SAR ADCs by parallelizing the filtering and SAR quantization phases, which also provides a more process&#8211;voltage&#8211;temperature (PVT)-robust and clock-scalable transfer function compared to active RC filters.

This small capacitance is enabled by its charge-injection digital-to-analog converter (CI-DAC), which maximally exploits the low thermal noise in the cryogenic environment. Despite its small input capacitance, this ADC maintains a high linearity by: 1) implementing a split CI-DAC with a bidirectional charge flow, which keeps the CI-DAC output common mode constant throughout the conversion; 2) by adopting a bottom-plate sampling scheme; and 3) by introducing a static preamplifier in the comparator. The resulting prototype ADC, implemented in a 40-nm bulk CMOS technology, has a core area of only 0.0056 mm2 and a full-scale input swing of 0.84 $V {_{\text {pp,diff}}}$ . It achieves an SNDR of 40.7dB, an SFDR of 64.1dB, and an effective resolution bandwidth (ERBW) of 2.5GHz at a temperature of 6.5K.

The proposed co-design exploits the low-jitter and fine phase resolution of the PLL output to inject energy into the XO precisely at low-impulse-sensitivity-function (ISF) points, enhancing XO performance and subsequently reducing the in-band phase noise of the PLL. In addition, a low-kickback reference buffer is introduced, utilizing a cascoded transistor to mitigate buffer-induced switching kickback and further suppress buffer phase noise. Fabricated in a 22-nm FDSOI process, the prototype occupies an active area of 1.14 mm2, with the pulse-injection driver consuming only 0.014 mm2.

The complete system consumes 7.24 mW, including 1.92 mW for the pulse-injection driver, and achieves a jitter figure-of-merit (FoM) of &#8722;256.7 dB, capturing the combined contributions of the PLL, XO, and reference buffer.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Noise Digital PLL With an Adaptive Common-Mode Resonance Tuning Technique for Voltage-Biased Oscillators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11222624</link><description>This work presents a digital phase-locked loop (PLL) incorporating an adaptive common-mode (CM) resonance tuning technique applied to a voltage-biased digitally-controlled oscillator (DCO). The method leverages the principle that the sensitivity of the oscillator frequency to a dither signal injected into the gate voltage of the cross-coupled transistors diminishes to near zero when the CM resonance is optimally tuned for minimal phase noise (PN). By detecting and nullifying this sensitivity, the proposed technique automatically adjusts the CM resonance to its ideal value. This background operation is continuous across the entire tuning range. The concept was validated through a digital PLL prototype fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process, which achieved a jitter of 45.9 fs, a power-versus-jitter figure-of-merit of &#8722;257 dB, and a PN of &#8722;146.6 dBc/Hz at 10-MHz offset from a 4.75-GHz carrier, all within an active area of 0.21 mm2.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Jitter Fractional-N Digital PLL Using a Quantization-Error-Compensating BBPD and an Orthogonal-Polynomial-Based LMS Calibration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11183652</link><description>This work presents a 10.0&#8211;11.5-GHz fractional- $N$  digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) using the quantization-error-compensating bang&#8211;bang phase detector (QEC-BBPD) that can minimize both the static delay ( $T_{\mathrm {S}}$ ) and the dynamic delay ( $T_{\mathrm {D}}$ ) required for removing the delta-sigma modulator&#8217;s ( $\Delta \Sigma $ M) quantization-error (Q-error). Since the proposed QEC-BBPD reduces additional thermal noise during the Q-error-compensation process, it allows the DPLL to achieve low in-band phase noise (PN) and low rms jitter. Along with the QEC-BBPD, this work also presents the orthogonal-polynomial-based least-mean-square multivariable calibration (OP-LMS MVC) to accelerate the calibration speed for the removal of the nonlinearities (NLs) of the QEC-BBPD with minimal hardware overhead.

To enhance the performance of the  $2 {\times } 20~{\mu }$ m GaN high electron mobility transistors (GaN HEMTs), AlN/GaN heterojunction, n+ GaN regrown, and 50-nm floating T-gate are employed with a transconductance of 880 mS/mm and an  ${f} {_{T}}$  ( ${f} {_{\max }}$ ) of 180 GHz (420 GHz). By utilizing multiband large-signal impedance correction technology, the optimal power matching impedance for GaN HEMTs was achieved without the need for a G-band load&#8211;pull testing system. As a result, a 50-nm GaN power amplifier monolithic microwave integrated circuit (PA MMIC) is designed with an output power of 100 mW at 216 GHz and a power density exceeding 1.35 W/mm at 216 GHz. The measured power-added efficiency (PAE) exceeds 2% across the entire frequency band. Furthermore, the circuit-package co-design technique integrates bonding wires, waveguide-to-microstrip transitions, and the packaging cavity into the matching networks of PA MMIC. It minimizes output power and bandwidth degradation due to the packaging parasitics. The presented SSPA module employs 32-way GaN PA MMICs with power combining and delivers &gt;1-W saturated output power across 216&#8211;226 GHz, peaking at 1.54 W at 223 GHz.

Switchless Class-G (SLCG) PA has a great potential in the RF bandwidth (BW), but shows limited signal BW and difficulty in parasitics absorption. The situation for Doherty PA (DPA) is exactly the opposite. To combine the merits of SLCG PA and DPA, we propose an SLCG-Doherty-continuum PA (SDCPA), which is constructed by simply inserting a frequency-adaptive transmission line (FATL) into SLCG PA. When the phase shift of FATL deviates from 0&#176; to &#177;90&#176;, SDCPA transfers from SLCG mode to Doherty mode gradually. The theoretical performance of SDCPA is analyzed in depth. Furthermore, a coupled resonator (CR) with inherent parasitics absorption and supply path is proposed to realize broadband FATL on chip. An SDCPA prototype is implemented in a 0.25- $\mu $ m GaN-HEMT process for validation. The fabricated SDCPA achieves a saturated output power of 36.6&#8211;38.6 dBm and a 6-/7.5-dB back-off drain efficiency (DE) of 38%&#8211;56%/37%&#8211;54% from 1.35 to 7.6 GHz with a compact chip size of  $2.1 {\times } 1.6$  mm2. The fractional BW (FBW) is up to 140%. Applying a 100-MHz LTE signal with a 7.5-dB peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), an average DE of 35%&#8211;49.2% is measured over the entire BW, and adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) before and after digital predistortion (DPD) are better than &#8722;25.3 and &#8722;46 dBc, respectively. Applying a 100-MHz 64-QAM signal with a 7.94-dB PAPR, the measured error vector magnitudes (EVMs) without DPD at 1.6/3.6/5.0/6.8 GHz are &#8722;33.5/&#8722;28.3/&#8722;29.4/&#8722;33.7 dB. Moreover, a maximum supported signal BW up to 350 MHz is recorded at 5 GHz. To the best of the authors&#8217; knowledge, the proposed SDCPA demonstrates the largest FBW among all reported integrated back-off efficient PAs without using digital techniques or reconfiguration.</description></item><item><title>CORDIC-Less Digital Polar Transmitter Architecture Based on Delta-Sigma Modulator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11175908</link><description>Conventional digital polar transmitters (TXs) suffer from limited power efficiency and linearity due to the multi-bit nature of intermediate signals. This work proposes a digital polar TX architecture that avoids such drawbacks by reducing the bit count of TX signals. The proposed TX oversamples and quantizes multi-bit I/Q inputs into three-level signals using simple delta-sigma modulators (DSMs), followed by a nine-state lookup table (LUT) to directly generate amplitude modulation (AM) and phase modulation (PM) signals. The complex coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) that is widely used in polar TXs is not required. The AM signal is truncated to two levels for on/off control of an intrinsically linear 1-bit power amplifier (PA). The PA avoids the linearity and switching loss issues of conventional switched-capacitor PAs (SCPAs). The PM signal is represented with 3 bits for eight-phase generation via edge selection from a  $4\times $  carrier local oscillator (LO), which offers better linearity and power efficiency than phase modulators based on multi-bit digital-to-time converters (DTCs). Therefore, the proposed approach enables simultaneous improvements in power efficiency and linearity. Fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, the proposed TX achieves a 33.5% peak power-added efficiency (PAE) at 24.2-dBm output power and supports wideband 50-MSymbol/s 256-quadratic-AM (QAM) signals without digital predistortion (DPD). A maximum system efficiency (SE) of 24.5% is achieved at &#8722;25.1-dB error vector magnitude (EVM), demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art DPD-less digital polar TXs.</description></item><item><title>A Blocker-Tolerant Receiver With VCO-Based Non-Uniform Multi-Level Time-Approximation Filter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11148079</link><description>A blocker-tolerant millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) receiver is presented using a multi-level time-approximation filter (mTAF), a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)-based integrator with embedded digitization, and non-uniform (NU) sampling to enhance filtering flexibility and efficiency. The mTAF approximates FIR filter responses using a digitally generated multi-level weighting pattern that controls gated integration over time. Compared with state-of-the-art reconfigurable blocker-tolerant receivers, the seven-level mTAF introduces more programmable notches, enables asymmetric filtering, and provides wider stopbands for improved blocker suppression. The VCO-based integrator simplifies circuit complexity and achieves competitive power efficiency compared with conventional Gm-C designs, while NU sampling further mitigates alias-band blockers.

The system integrates eight independent transmitters ( $8~{\times }~1$  TXs) and two four-channel phased-array receivers ( $2~{\times }~4$  RXs), achieving a  $4.76{\times }$  increase in detection range compared to single-input&#8211;single-output (SISO) architecture in long-range radar (LRR) mode and 1.79&#176; angular resolution with  $16 {\times } 4$  virtual array in short-range radar (SRR) mode. To realize a large chirp bandwidth while maintaining low voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) gain ( $K_{\text {VCO}}$ ), a zig-zag phase-locked loop (PLL)-based frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) generator is proposed, enabling continuous multi-subband chirping. By monitoring the voltage across the capacitance in loop filter ( $V_{\text {CAP}}$ ) for subband switching, the tuning voltage ( $V_{\text {TUNE}}$ ) is configured to the optimal switching voltage, eliminating the frequency ripple ( $F_{R}$ ) during subband switching. Each TX channel integrates switches to support a flexible number and positioning of 1&#8211;8 transmitters in TDM mode. To mitigate the leakage effect caused by variations in amplitude and phase due to the varying number and position of TX on-channels, a receiver architecture with three low noise amplifiers (LNAs) and a 4-bit phase shifter is designed to achieve low noise figure (NF) and high linearity. Furthermore, an I/Q mixer is designed to achieve orthogonal-ellipse-overlapping-shape NF and petal-shape linearity over a phase difference range of 0&#176;&#8211; ${360^{\circ } }~{\Delta \phi _{\text {leak}}}$  between the local oscillator (LO) and leakage. The chip achieves a measured maximum chirp bandwidth of 12.6-GHz spanning four zig-zag subbands.

We demonstrate this using 14nm and 5nm FinFET-based ring oscillators, by collecting data across varying supply voltages, temperatures, and process corners. Using three baseline ML models&#8212;XGBoost, Random Forest, and a Neural Network&#8212;we simulate real-world design scenarios where parameter fine-tuning may not always be feasible. Key tasks include predicting layout performance from schematic data, performance prediction across process corners, and fabricated chip performance. Our results show that these models can achieve less than 5% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for power and frequency prediction while reducing required simulations by more than  $2\times $ . When migrating from 14nm to 5nm, XGBoost and Neural Network achieve high accuracy (&gt;0.99  $R^{2}$ ) using just 10% of the otherwise required 5nm simulations. We also present an extensive robustness analysis to demonstrate that our results are not limited to a single data split or initialization. By varying random seeds across multiple runs, we evaluate the stability of each model with respect to algorithm initialization and the selection of training data subsets. This demonstrates that the observed accuracy is consistent and not the result of a specific, favorable configuration. This framework offers a promising approach to accelerating circuit design across technology nodes by reducing simulation costs while maintaining accuracy in predicting performance.</description></item><item><title>An Integer-N Reference-Double-Sampling PLL for Frequency-Multiplied Octa-Phase Clock Generation Achieving &#8722;251.9 dB FOMJitter-N</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11131491</link><description>This paper presents a reference double-sampling phase-locked loop (RDSPLL) that integrates frequency multiplication and octa-phase clock generation into a single system, significantly reducing power consumption. A differential ring oscillator (DRO) is employed to generate octa-phase clocks with high phase accuracy. The reference double-sampling technique extends the loop bandwidth, effectively suppressing phase noise from the ring oscillator and thereby reducing jitter. To achieve accurate and efficient phase error detection, we proposed a novel offset-compensated hybrid phase detector (OCH-PD), featuring an offset calibration and a comparator-ADC hybrid quantizer. The offset calibration utilizes the CDAC to dynamically compensate for the mismatch in double-sampling, improving jitter and spur performance. The hybrid quantizer supports dynamic mode switching based on different locking states: during the coarse frequency locking phase, it operates in the ADC mode to accelerate the locking process; once a stable lock is achieved, it switches to the comparator mode to enable low-power, high-speed quantization. Fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, the prototype achieves 674 fs RMS jitter at 2.4 GHz while consuming only 3.43 mW, resulting in a  $\text {FOM}_{\text {Jitter-N}}$  of -251.9 dB. With offset calibration, the reference spur at 100 MHz is suppressed from -56 dBc to -80 dBc, and the jitter is reduced from 1.42 ps to 674 fs. The locking time improves from  $10.5~{\mu }$ s to  $1.6~{\mu }$ s using the hybrid quantizer. The eight-phase accuracy remains better than 1&#176; over the frequency range of 2-2.8 GHz.</description></item><item><title>A Compact, Power-Efficient, and On-the-Fly I2C-to-SPI Converter for Distributed E-Textile Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11073551</link><description>This paper presents a 0.36-mm2 I2C-to-SPI converter chip designed for electronic textile (E-textile) applications, featuring an on-the-fly conversion scheme that eliminates the need for on-chip data buffers and internal clock generation. By leveraging the synchronous nature of both I2C and SPI protocols, the proposed design forwards each incoming I2C data bit, SDA (Serial Data Line) directly to the SPI output using the I2C serial clock line (SCL), thereby reducing both area and power consumption. Two versions of the chip are proposed: a &#8216;full&#8217; die and a &#8216;compact&#8217; die. The converter enables seamless integration into distributed in-textile architectures by minimizing silicon overhead. The &#8216;full&#8217; die implementation achieves a  $7.33\times $  area reduction compared to commercially available I2C-to-SPI converters, while the &#8216;compact&#8217; version further reduces the footprint by  $14.73\times $  through the use of a small corner seal-ring and a linear pad ring layout. Measurement results confirm robust operation at ultra-fast I2C frequency (5 MHz), consuming only 0.379 mW for the &#8216;full&#8217; die and 0.333 mW for the &#8216;compact&#8217; variant.

Three operation modes, the energy-saving (ES) mode, the normal (NM) mode, and the high-resolution (HR) mode, can be supported by reconfiguring the resolution of the internal SAR ADC (N ${}_{\mathrm {SAR}}$ ) and the oversampling rate (OSR), while the NTF optimization is realized by modulating locations of zeros and poles in the context of a specific mode to enhance the NS effect. The prototype ADC is fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS and operates under a 1.8-V supply. Operating at 5MS/s sampling rate, the ADC&#8217;s OSR can be configured as 8 or 16 in different operation modes, so its bandwidth can be configured as 312.5kHz or 156.25kHz. With NSAR and OSR reconfigured to be 8-bit and 8 for the ES mode, it achieves a signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) of 80.3dB and consumes  $201\mu $ W. Attributing to the NTF optimization, 27% power saving can be reached in the ES mode with respect to that when the optimization were disabled for the same SNDR. In the HR mode, NSAR and OSR are set to be 9-bit and 16, respectively. And a SNDR of 93.3dB is obtained at the expense of consuming  $280\mu $ W. It is evidenced that the SNDR can be boosted by 6.4dB owe to the NTF optimization, resulting in an optimal SNDR-based Schreier figure-of-merit (FoM ${}_{\mathrm {S}}$ ) of 180.8dB for the ADC. The values for NSAR and OSR are determined to be 9-bit and 8 for the NM mode, and the achievable SNDR is 88.2dB. The occupied core area is 0.537 mm2.</description></item><item><title>LearnAFE: Circuit-Algorithm Co-Design Framework for Learnable Audio Analog Front-End</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11044866</link><description>This paper presents a circuit-algorithm co-design framework for learnable analog front-end (AFE) in audio signal classification. Designing AFE and backend classifiers separately is a common practice but non-ideal, as shown in this paper. Instead, this paper proposes a joint optimization of the backend classifier with the AFE&#8217;s transfer function to achieve system-level optimum. More specifically, the transfer function parameters of an analog bandpass filter (BPF) bank are tuned in a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-aware training loop for the classifier. Using a co-design loss function LBPF, this work shows superior optimization of both the filter bank and the classifier. Implemented in open-source SKY130 130nm CMOS process, the optimized design achieved 90.5%&#8211;94.2% accuracy for 10-keyword classification task across a wide range of input signal SNR from 5 dB to 20 dB, with only 22k classifier parameters. Compared to conventional approach, the proposed audio AFE achieves 8.7% and 12.9% reduction in power and capacitor area respectively.</description></item><item><title>A 15&#8211;28 GHz Low-Noise Amplifier With 0.75-dB Gain Ripple Across the Full K-Band</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11060582</link><description>The design of a 15&#8211;28 GHz broadband low-noise amplifier (LNA) is presented, employing a magnetically coupled resonator (MCR) to achieve simultaneous bandwidth extension and output matching. To address the increased in-band ripple that occurs when enhancing bandwidth with limited on-chip inductor values, an emitter-collector feedback transformer is introduced to mitigate the MCR ripple by generating an additional pole.

It achieves a peak gain of 19.3 dB across a 3-dB bandwidth of 15&#8211;28 GHz, with a gain ripple of 0.75 dB within the 16&#8211;26.7 GHz range. The measured noise figure (NF) ranges from 2.9 to 3.9 dB. Additionally, the input 1-dB gain compression point ( $\text {IP}_{\text {1 dB}}$ ) remains stable between &#8722;27 and &#8722;24.5 dBm throughout the entire 3-dB gain bandwidth.

Many preclinical studies and clinical applications urgently require a portable, high-quality, low-cost, and fast imaging system. Thus, translating advanced image reconstruction algorithms into hardware implementations is highly desired. However, existing iterative PA image reconstructions, although exhibit higher accuracy than the delay-and-sum algorithm, suffer from high computational cost. In this paper, we introduce a novel model-based hardware architecture for palm-size PA tomography (palm-PAT), aiming at enhancing both the speed and performance of image reconstruction at a much lower system cost. To achieve this, we propose an innovative data reuse method that significantly reduces the consumption of hardware storage resources, achieving a reduction of approximately 75% in hardware storage requirements. We conducted experiments utilizing the FPGA implementation of the algorithm, using phantom, human finger data in vivo and ex vivo breast tumor data to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that our proposed architecture can substantially reduce system cost while maintaining high imaging performance. The novel hardware architecture design of the model-based algorithm achieves a speedup of up to approximately 270 times compared to the CPU, while the corresponding energy efficiency ratio is improved by more than 2700 times.</description></item><item><title>DCiROM: A High-Density Fully-Digital Compute-in-Read-Only-Memory Macro for Energy-Efficient Task-Level DNN Inference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11062902</link><description>Compute-in-memory (CiM) is a promising approach to alleviating the von Neumann memory wall bottleneck in data-intensive tasks. As a candidate to build CiM, static-random-access memory (SRAM) has become popular in accelerating deep neural networks (DNNs) because of its mature fabrication support and high flexibility. However, SRAM-based CiM suffers from low memory density, resulting in frequent weight reloading and increased power consumption during end-to-end inference tasks. Recently, read-only-memory (ROM)-based analog CiM (ACiM) has demonstrated the potential to deploy all DNN weights on-chip by leveraging high-density ROM. It may also achieve encouraging flexibility by exploiting the synergy between a small SRAM and a big ROM. Nevertheless, it faces challenges in achieving high computing density due to limitations in analog-to-digital converter (ADC) performance. Meanwhile, digital CiM (DCiM) improves computing density but incurs significant energy and area overhead due to the adder tree. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the first fully digital and flexible compute-in-read-only-memory (DCiROM) design approach. On the one hand, DCiROM introduces a novel ROM-logic fusion CiM that reduces the CiM area by 51% while maintaining high memory density and computing performance. On the other hand, DCiROM achieves high flexibility with minimal area overhead by proposing two innovative multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) resource-reusing techniques. This work has implemented a DCiROM chip with 3024Kb ResNet-56 parameters using a 65nm CMOS technology. This macro achieves 6.9-29.5x higher normalized FoM (memory density x computing density) than the state-of-the-art CiM works. Additionally, it reduces energy consumption per image inference by 2.9-9.9x compared to SRAM-based CiM works when off-chip access is considered.</description></item><item><title>A Bit-Partitioned Floating-Point 6T SRAM Computing-in-Memory Macro Based on Dual-Edge Time-Domain Structure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11080504</link><description>In the computing-in-memory (CIM) field, floating-point (FP) CIM is afflicted with high computing latency and energy consumption due to the intricate procedures involved in exponent computation and processing. In this work, an 8Kb FP time-domain (TD) static-random-access-memory (SRAM) CIM macro is presented. Fabricated with a 180nm process, this macro exhibits low computational latency and high energy efficiency. A novel FP computing architecture is proposed, which is capable of concurrently executing exponent summation, maximum value finding, difference generation, and mantissa shifting. This architecture effectively reduces the overall delay in exponent computation and processing, thereby enhancing the throughput. Furthermore, a bit-partitioned computing concept and an exponent sparsity scheme are introduced. In this scheme, sparsity judgment is made solely by processing the high 4 bits of the exponent, which significantly reduces power consumption in the remaining exponent computation and processing steps. Additionally, based on the bit-partitioned concept, a dual-edge TD exponent summation and mantissa multiplication-and-accumulation (MAC) circuit is devised. This circuit not only suppresses nonlinear errors during multi-bit computation but also exploits both the rising and falling edges of pulses for computation, thus accelerating the macro&#8217;s operation speed. Compared to previous approaches, an extra 24% power reduction is achieved. At a sparsity level of 90%, a normalized energy efficiency of 14.418 TFLOPS/W and a normalized area efficiency of 0.041 TFLOPS/mm2 are attained. When this work is applied to the ResNet-18 model with BF16 format for input, weight, and output, the accuracy loss on the CIFAR-100 dataset is merely &#8722;0.16%.</description></item><item><title>Booth-Assisted Mixed-Precision Reconfigurable Digital Computing-in-Memory Engine With Ternary-Input 1T2R ReRAM for Edge AI</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11128898</link><description>ReRAM has emerged as a promising candidate for computing-in-memory due to its excellent compatibility with advanced CMOS processes, high density, and non-volatility. Meanwhile, Digital Computing-in-Memory (DCIM) offers higher energy efficiency than its analog counterpart and supports full-precision processing. However, existing ReRAM-based DCIMs are hindered by error-prone readout and low input parallelism. The inefficient bit-width reconfiguration also incurs significant hardware overhead during neural network mapping. This paper reports a 64Kb DCIM engine based on 1T2R ReRAM bitcells for multiply-and-Accumulate(MAC) acceleration. The ternary-input Booth-assisted multiply-in-memory (TB-MIM) flow allows bi-state ReRAM with limited readout margin to achieve high-accuracy computation with high parallelism.

The proposed CIS employs a dual ramp generator and column-parallel gain control to enable two-stage analog gain (AG) adjustments, achieving up to 256 unique column-wise gain patterns. Additionally, this study introduces an innovative image synthesis method, which allows for HDR implementation without any loss of image resolution during the synthesis process. This ensures that the sensor maintains high-resolution imaging quality while adapting dynamically to illumination changes. These innovations allow for fine-grained HDR image synthesis within a single frame, eliminating motion blur and supporting real-time performance in dynamic environments. By combining these features, the proposed approach achieves a balance between high adaptability and high-quality imaging, meeting the stringent requirements of modern machine vision systems. Fabricated using a  $0.11~\mu $ m CMOS process, the prototype CIS integrates a  $1280\times 720$  pixel array, operates at 30 fps, and consumes 4.89 mW of power.

However, traditional CIM architectures face challenges such as high resource consumption, especially in data conversion, which can significantly impact chip area and energy efficiency. To address these challenges, this work proposes a computational CIM architecture utilizing multilevel analog memory, named AM-CIM, tailored for near-sensor (NS) computation of real-time KWS applications. Additionally, approximate memory technology is integrated into the AM-CIM architecture, employing data resilience scheduling for analog memory which contributes to significant reductions in hardware overhead. This integration facilitates a hardware-software co-design approach. To deploy KWS tasks in AM-CIM, a gated recurrent unit (GRU) network, referred to as MAC-GRU, is implemented. By employing Mel-energy as the input feature at the near-sensor end, the system achieves a 93.13% reduction in feature extraction power consumption. Evaluation results based on TSMC 180-nm technology demonstrate that the AM-CIM architecture achieves an accuracy of 88.51% for 10-keyword classification with a power consumption of  $546~\mu W$ , while reducing analog memory area by 43.32%.</description></item><item><title>MGARoute: Efficient Analog Routing With Multi-Stage Rip-Up and Rerouting Under Geometric and Symmetry Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11051139</link><description>Routing is a critical path-planning challenge in integrated circuit (IC) design, especially in analog IC design, where the complexity of the routing problem increases significantly owing to complex constraints and process parameters. Traditional automated routing techniques often rely on manual experience, limiting the effectiveness of the algorithms.

However, in real circuits, multiple inputs can switch simultaneously, resulting in a significant speed-up. This discrepancy can lead to circuit failures due to inaccurate early analysis, despite static timing analysis (STA) tools adopting conservative strategies. Consequently, multi-input switching (MIS) models have gained importance for timing libraries. For complex logic gates, however, the number of possible transitions that must be considered for characterization increases significantly, posing a substantial challenge in modeling MIS effects. We propose a novel approach to address this challenge by combining the power of satisfiability (SAT) solvers and machine learning (ML) techniques. First, we perform a logical analysis on the Boolean function of a given logic gate to identify input patterns that can lead to MIS-induced speed-up. This task is formulated as a SAT problem, and a SAT solver is utilized to extract all MIS-relevant transitions, thereby significantly reducing the characterization and modeling effort. Next, we leverage ML techniques to accurately capture the complex dependencies of MIS-induced speed-up under various circuit and environmental conditions. To streamline this process, we introduce an automated tool framework named LiMo (Library Model), which integrates a SAT solver, SPICE simulator, dataset optimization strategies, ML training/testing infrastructure, and multiprocessing capabilities to create MIS-aware timing libraries. The results on benchmark circuits reveal that ignoring MIS effects can result in relative root mean square errors (RRMSE) exceeding 40% in timing attributes. In contrast, LiMo-generated libraries achieve RRMSE errors below 7% compared to SPICE simulations, while delivering results  $\sim 10,000 \times $  faster, underscoring their suitability for incorporating MIS effects in STA for industrial designs.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Hybrid Dynamic Event-Triggered Bipartite Consensus Control for Multi-Agent Systems Against DoS Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11048444</link><description>This paper addresses the secure bipartite consensus control problem for multi-agent systems under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. A class of aperiodic time-sequence-based DoS attacks is considered, and its impact on both undirected and directed network topologies is analyzed. The stability analysis is conducted using a Lyapunov function approach combined with an iterative method. To reduce energy consumption and prevent Zeno behavior, a hybrid dynamic event-triggered mechanism is introduced. This mechanism incorporates an improved dynamic event-triggering condition, which determines when each agent updates its control signal and transmits its currently triggered state to neighboring agents. The proposed approach integrates this mechanism with the developed distributed control protocol and to ensure bipartite consensus even in the presence of DoS attacks. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through two simulation examples.</description></item><item><title>Autoencoder-Based Transceivers for Multiple Access Human Body Communication Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11054282</link><description>The Internet of Bodies (IoB) represents a transformative technological innovation that merges the bio-physical and digital realms through networks of intelligent devices positioned in, on, and around the human body. Human Body Communication (HBC) offers a promising method for enabling IoB networks, using the human body as a communication channel for multiple wearable nodes. Despite the prevalence of HBC peer-to-peer communication methods in the literature, the challenge of implementing multiple access techniques for HBC at the physical layer remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a new multiple access HBC (MA-HBC) system that leverages autoencoders to design and implement low-power and efficient transceivers sharing a common channel. The proposed MA-HBC system consists of multiple autoencoder-based transceivers trained jointly to optimize overall network performance. It supports various data rates ranging from 164 kbps to 5.25 Mbps, making it suitable for a wide range of IoB applications. To validate the design, a prototype implementation is presented. Additionally, to ensure suitability for wearable devices, a low-power hardware transceiver architecture is provided with an estimated energy efficiency of 105 pJ/b when implemented using TSMC 65nm LP technology. The results show that the proposed MA-HBC system outperforms traditional IEEE 802.15.6 based transceivers for two users with time Sharing, achieving a 3.9 dB improvement in Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at a block error rate of  $10^{-2}$ .</description></item><item><title>Continuous Flow 4096-Point FFT/IFFT Hardware Architecture for 5G Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11073142</link><description>This paper presents a high-throughput, low-latency 4096-point FFT/IFFT hardware design tailored for 5G applications.

The desired features of a theoretical framework for DPs are heavily inspired on classical phasor theory: the ability to transform time differential equations into equivalent algebraic complex equations, while maintaining the familiar notions of phasors, magnitudes and phases, and describing instantaneous power by two components, active and reactive power. Current frameworks rely on integral transforms which need approximations and truncations to allow for practical computation and application and do not offer a theory of nonstationary power. Further, the integral transforms are difficult to operate with and are not suitable to transform any generic nonstationary signal due to convergence requirements and frequency resolution challenges. This paper presents a new theoretical framework for DPs, based on differential operators, that offers a natural and efficient framework to transform nonstationary sinusoidal signals into Dynamic Phasors, while also offering a solid theory on nonstationary power extending the conventional well defined active and reactive power definitions.</description></item><item><title>Online Distributed Convex Optimization for Unbalanced Varying Graphs With Delayed Feedback</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11081829</link><description>Feedback signal delays present a common challenge in the online decision-making processes of various real-world systems, such as real-time economic dispatch in power systems. These delays, primarily induced by limited computational capabilities or unknown parameter changes, can significantly hinder the performance or even effectiveness of online decision-making strategies. This study investigates distributed optimization over time-varying unbalanced networks with delayed feedback signals. We propose discrete-time distributed online algorithms for both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems. Each node in the network has access only to its individual time-varying local objective function with a delayed time sequence. At each decision-making step, each node selects the appropriate local online behavior, which depends on the information from its neighbor nodes, towards the minimization of global cumulative cost function value. We demonstrate that sublinear regrets can be ensured as long as the time-varying unbalanced communication networks maintain  $\mathcal {B}$ -strong connectivity. For a general convex or  $\mu $ -strongly convex local objective function, the network regret and individual regret grow as  $\mathcal {O}((\ln (T))^{2})$  and  $\mathcal {O}(\sqrt {T})$ , respectively, and are intrinsically related to the feedback delays and step sizes. To validate the proposed algorithms, numerical studies are carried out on constrained distributed time-varying economic dispatch problems.</description></item><item><title>Constant Voltage Regulation of Delayed Inductive Power Transfer Systems: A Data-Driven Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11048450</link><description>This paper delves into the constant voltage output regulation problem for delayed inductive power transfer (IPT) systems with linear matrix inequality region constraints.

By integrating adaptive gain and zero-crossing for adapting to system uncertain states, adjusting the control direction, and suppressing chattering. The advantages of integral-type NTSM help eliminate singularity issues during global convergence, further compensate steady-state errors through an integral control architecture, the proposed method overcomes key limitations of conventional sliding mode approaches.

Ever increasing interface speed has resulted in multi-phase clock distributions (e.g., half-rate, quarter-rate architecture) becoming a reality over single / complementary phase clock distribution for performance reasons. Conventional techniques of clock distribution often involve distributing multi-phase clocks in pairs of complementary clock phases with proper shields around these phases to avoid coupling with other non-complementary clock phases of multi-phase clock distribution. However, these schemes suffer heavily when speeds/datarates and routing length of clock distribution increase. A mutually coupled multi-phase clock distribution scheme is proposed that overcomes signal integrity issues observed in the conventional multi-phase clock distribution scheme. Two schemes, correct by design (CD) and correct by layout (CL) are proposed to boost performance over conventional methods. Mutual coupling is effectively used between N-phase clocks and matched clocks are distributed with minimal/zero power overhead. Implemented in 7nm FinFET technology, the proposed schemes improve clock swings by ~4.75%-8%, random jitter (RJ) by ~4%-10%, rise/fall times by 10%-23% and achieve perfect matching between N phases of the clock.</description></item><item><title>A 31.25 MHz Bandwidth 52.4 dB SNDR VCO-Based ADC With on-Chip Non-Linearity Correction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11054050</link><description>This brief presents a method for correcting nonlinearities in voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) based analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).

However, achieving this promise has remained elusive due to the lack of suitable training algorithms. Analog memory devices exhibit asymmetric and nonlinear switching behavior in addition to device-to-device variation, meaning that most, if not all, of the current off-the-shelf training algorithms cannot achieve good training outcomes. Recently introduced algorithms have attracted limited attention, as they require bi-directionally switching devices of unrealistically high symmetry and precision and are highly sensitive. A new algorithm, chopped TTv2 (c-TTv2), has been introduced, which leverages the chopped technique to address many of these challenges. In this brief, we evaluate the accuracy and the performance of the c-TTv2 algorithm for analog TL using ResNet and Swin-ViT models, pre-trained on the CIFAR10 dataset, on a fine-tuning task using two subsets of the CIFAR100 dataset. We also investigate the robustness of our algorithm to changes in some device and circuit non-idealities, including weight transfer noise, write noise, symmetry point skew, symmetry point variability, pulse update noise, mean pulse response, device-to-device variability, the number of states, output noise, I/O resolution, and the minimum and maximum conductance device-to-device variability. We demonstrate that the c-TTv2 algorithm mostly surpasses the performance of analog/digital training and narrows the performance gap between analog and digital TL while being robust to changes in device and circuit non-idealities.</description></item><item><title>Smart Watchdog for RISC-V: A Novel Spiking Neural Network Approach to Fault Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11051055</link><description>Watchdog mechanisms must detect permanent and transient faults with minimal power and area overheads, but their own reliability is vital, as failures can jeopardize system integrity.

This work introduces ESTU, a compact spiking transformer hardware architecture tailored for edge deployment. ESTU has been designed with resource minimization in mind in order to fit in power and resource constrained FPGAs, as the Lattice iCE40UP5K. We validated ESTU on available Spiking Transformer models at the State of the Art and on a sEMG classification application addressing NinaPro DB-5, demonstrating improved accuracy of over 2% compared to the results of a vanilla SNN, fully unlocking spiking transformers capability at the edge at the cost of 3.76 mW during inference.</description></item><item><title>Accurate Prediction of Nonlinear Distortion of Multi-Carrier Signals</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11223667</link><description>Nonlinearities in power amplifiers adversely affect multi-carrier modulation techniques. Accurate prediction of nonlinear distortion is essential for making design trade-offs between output power and network throughput. We use the series form of the characteristic function (ch.f.) method to predict distortion spectra for sparse multi-carrier transmissions. This method results in efficient calculations of individual signal and distortion components. The method is validated both theoretically and practically. Theoretical validation is performed by modeling the signal as a bandpass Gaussian process that is hard limited, and it is shown that the series ch.f. method produces results that are identical with the classical Price&#8217;s theorem. Practical validation is shown by considering an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal with a fragmented spectrum which is then applied to an amplifier driven into compression for which application of Price&#8217;s theorem is difficult, and the predicted output spectrum corroborates laboratory measurements. Part of the computational efficiency is realized in that the nonlinearity can be expressed as the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of samples of its forward scattering parameter (i.e., S21) or transconductance function (including AM-PM effects), and distortion contributions of the signal can be expressed as numerical autoconvolutions of the clean spectrum. Signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) can be easily computed and parameterized across variables of interest, such as overdrive level.</description></item><item><title>A 12-MHz GaN-Based DC&#8211;DC Buck Converter Featuring Dual Reverse Conduction Controllers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11215820</link><description>This brief presents a 12-MHz 30V-to-12V GaN-based DC-DC buck converter incorporating a high-efficiency gate driver IC with dual (high-side and low-side) reverse conduction controllers (RCCs). The proposed dual RCCs dynamically minimize dead time and reverse conduction losses in the half-bridge GaN power stage. An active bootstrap circuit is also integrated to suppress bootstrap capacitor overcharging during reverse conduction. In addition, the gate driver IC includes a feedback control block and integrates nearly all essential building blocks (such as a PWM generator, a bias generator, and protection circuits) eliminating the need for external controllers. Fabricated in a 180-nm 30-V BCD process, the proposed gate driver IC occupies an active area of only 0.91 mm2. Measurement results show that the proposed buck converter achieves reverse conduction times of only 3.04 ns (V ${}_{\mathbf {SW}}$  rising edge) and 3.5 ns (V ${}_{\mathbf {SW}}$  falling edge), resulting in a 6.1% improvement in conversion efficiency, achieving a peak power efficiency of 85.75%.</description></item><item><title>LLC Resonant Converter With Reconfigurable Secondary-Side for Output Voltage Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11216413</link><description>This brief proposes a reconfigurable LLC resonant converter that enables the regulation of a tailored portion of the output voltage through a novel adaptive transformer turns ratio scheme implemented on the secondary rectifier. The converter employs a center-tapped transformer and a switch to reconfigure the secondary rectifier and adjust the effective turns ratio. Using the proposed concept, voltage regulation is achieved with a reduced number of switches and devices in the current&#8217;s path, no modification to the primary side, and fixed-frequency operation. A laboratory prototype rated at 4 kW with a 1 kV input voltage is implemented and tested to validate the feasibility and performance of the proposed converter.</description></item><item><title>Optimized Power Decoupling Control for Grid-Forming Converter Under Different R/X Ratios of Grid Impedance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11129106</link><description>In this brief, the power decoupling mechanism of grid-forming converter is analyzed, which indicates that the suitable voltage compensation is crucial for decoupling.

Meanwhile, this article proposes a multiobjective spider wasp optimizer (MOSWO) based on a spider wasp optimizer (SWO) to solve the problem. First, incorporating an external archive allows MOSWO to obtain and store Pareto optimal solutions. Second, an important-objective trend operator and improving SWO&#8217;s mating behavior enhance the algorithm&#8217;s optimization ability. Finally, A spherical divergence operator is introduced to reduce the redundancy of sensor nodes. To compare the coverage optimization performance of the proposed algorithm, MOSWO MOAAO, MOEA/D, MOPSO, MOAHA, and NSGA-II are used to solve the MCO problem of 3-D HWSNs in obstacle and no-obstacle scenes. The experimental results show that the Pareto front of MOSWO is optimal compared to the Pareto fronts of MOAAO, MOEA/D, MOPSO, MOAHA, and NSGA-II. MOSWO performs effectively in improving coverage and network connectivity, reducing energy consumption.</description></item><item><title>Para-Pipe: Exploiting Hierarchical Operator Parallelism of ML Computational Graphs on SoCs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10993487</link><description>As edge-based deep learning applications become more complex, optimizing performance on heterogeneous System-on-Chips (SoCs) presents unique challenges. Traditional pipelining techniques distributing the computation across different on-chip processing units, while effective for throughput, do not address the latency demands posed by modern neural networks with complex interdependencies and extensive operator parallelism. There is a potential in leveraging operator parallelism to enable concurrent execution across multiple processing units, thereby reducing inference latency. However, prioritizing pipelining or parallel execution often necessitates a compromise, where optimizing one performance metric adversely impacts the other. This article introduces Para-Pipe, a hierarchical mapping framework that integrates intra- and interstage operator parallelism within a pipelined architecture. Para-Pipe navigates the tradeoff between throughput and latency by selectively fine-tuning parallelism levels within and across pipeline stages. This strategy can significantly reduce interprocessor communication overhead, significantly improving energy efficiency. Our evaluation demonstrates that Para-Pipe generates multiple Pareto-optimal configurations, achieving a balance between throughput and latency on an Amlogic SoC equipped with ARM big.LITTLE CPUs and GPU, as well as the Black Sesame Technology SoC featuring a deep learning accelerator and two DSPs. More importantly, throughput-optimized configurations under Para-Pipe on Amlogic SoC show an average energy efficiency improvement of 11.0% over purely pipelined strategies and 23.3% relative to nonpipelined parallel execution.</description></item><item><title>Mitigating Computation Errors of In-RRAM Computing Through Network Retraining With IR-Drop and Data Allocation Effects</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10982297</link><description>In recent years, In-RRAM Computing (IRC) has been a promising technique for deep neural network (DNN) applications. Combined with the proper pruning technique, the cost and energy of DNN computation can be further reduced. However, IRC often suffers from accuracy issues due to the nonideal effects in RRAM arrays, such as the sneak path and IR-drop, as well as its data allocation. To mitigate those nonideal effects, network retraining with extra error injection is often adopted to alleviate the accuracy degradation of IRC designs in the real environment. Conventional random disturbance and equation-based approaches did not consider the data allocation issue, which may incur larger errors for the sparse matrix generated by data pruning techniques. In this article, a fast and accurate IR-drop model is proposed to reflect the data-dependent effects, which is able to offer accurate error injection in the DNN training phase with sparse matrixes. As shown in the experimental results, the proposed simple model is successfully integrated into the network retraining flow with little overhead, which helps to alleviate the computation errors of IRC designs in the real environment.</description></item><item><title>A Sub- 10 &#956;s In-Memory-Search Collision Detection Accelerator Based on RRAM-TCAMs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002546</link><description>Collision detection can account for over 90% of the total calculation time in motion planning, which makes it critical to optimize the collision detection process. Previous hardware accelerators can hardly maintain fast computation speed for real-time collision detection while supporting a large roadmap. In this work, we present a novel in-memory-search accelerator. The accelerator achieves an impressive sub- $10~\mu $ s time for collision detection in 800-MB scale roadmaps with 100000 edges. Such accelerator leverages an in-memory-search architecture that can perform search operation in massively parallel manner with low energy consumption. It is powered by ternary content-addressable memories (TCAMs) based on large-scale nonvolatile resistive random-access memory (RRAM) arrays, which not only store a large roadmap on chip, perform look-up table function in a single clock cycle to accelerate collision detection by combining with the unique logic encoding scheme. Importantly, the RRAM-based TCAM eliminates the need for extensive data transfer between memory and computing units during collision detection, leading to significant energy and delay saving. As the pioneering TCAM-based in-memory-search accelerator for collision detection, the structure achieves 210&#8211; $2225\times $  times speedup compared with previous application-specific integrated circuit-based accelerators, and more than 33 $879\times $  times speedup compared with CPU-based collision detection. Such accelerator well exceeds the speed requirement for collision detection (&lt;1 ms), and is suitable for a number of applications, such as robot motion planning in dynamic environment, animation, machining and manufacturing.</description></item><item><title>Denoise on Sensor: A Near-Sensor Compute-in-Memory Macro for Visual Perception Denoising via Concatnation-Eliminating</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11004071</link><description>Noise is one of the most common and significant factors leading to image degradation. In recent years, due to the rapid development of neural networks, the performance of denoising algorithms has seen a substantial improvement. However, state-of-the-art denoising models often entail large-scale models and heavy computational requirements, making deployment challenging. In addition, we have observed that the location of denoisers in the entire image processing pipeline has a significant impact on resource consumption and denoising effectiveness. Deploying the denoiser closer to the image acquisition stage will be more effective in separating noise from the image. In this article, we propose a near-sensor compute-in-memory macro for visual perception denoising (Denoise on Sensor, DoS) along with its corresponding Edge Denoise U-net (EDU) architecture. DoS employs a mixed-signal circuit implementation for neural network inference, offering a notable advantage in terms of high speed and low power consumption compared to FPGA- or GPU-based approaches, making it feasible to deploy denoising tasks at the near-sensor edge. The simulation results show that the energy efficiency of DoS can reach 21.98 TOPS/W, and EDU deployed on DoS can achieve around 30 dB PSNR and 0.83 SSIM on KODAK, BSD300 and SET14 datasets.</description></item><item><title>Synthesis of a CNTFET-Based Ternary Full Adder Using a Carry-Less Ternary Half Adder</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11003064</link><description>The full adder (FA) is an essential element within arithmetic units, significantly contributing to their computational efficiency. Contemporary research endeavors are actively exploring optimized FA circuit designs. The integration of carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNTFETs) and multiple-valued logic (MVL) in circuit implementations holds great promise for achieving exceptional performance gains. This article proposes novel complete and partial ternary FA (TFA) architectures utilizing 76 and 55 CNTFETs, respectively, realized through a streamlined design methodology. The design strategically incorporates a proposed carry-less ternary half adder to compute the sum of the primary inputs. The resulting sum output then serves as a control signal in both TFA configurations. The TFA circuits are further implemented utilizing three unary operators, transmission gates, and pass transistor logic. HSPICE simulation results, conducted using Stanford 32-nm CNTFET technology at a  $V_{DD} \; {=} \; 0.9$  V, demonstrate that the proposed complete TFA design outperforms its counterparts with a 24.24% improvement in delay, a 5.81% reduction in power consumption, and a 28.71% decrease in energy consumption. Meanwhile, the proposed partial TFA offers 19.13% faster operation, 14.4% lower power consumption, and 30.74% better energy efficiency. The superiority of the proposed complete TFA is further substantiated through the creation of a three-trit ripple-carry adder.</description></item><item><title>VariPar: Variation-Aware Workload Partitioning in Chiplet-Based DNN Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10993501</link><description>Chiplet-based DNN accelerators have been extensively explored to save design and manufacturing costs. Previous works regard all chiplets as identical and employ uniform workload partitioning strategies. These workload partitioning strategies overlook various real-world factors that contribute to remarkable performance variations among chiplets, including manufacturing process variation, thermal condition, physical placement, and power supply condition. When considering these performance variations, a variation-aware workload partitioning can achieve superior performance. This article introduces VariPar, a systematic framework to employ variation-aware partitioning strategy in chiplet-based DNN accelerators. VariPar models performance variations for each chiplet and partition workloads accordingly. VariPar includes a simulator with multifactor variation modeling and a heuristic search engine to generate near-optimal partitioning within a reasonable time. Experiment results show that VariPar achieves  $1.45{\times }$  performance and  $1.82{\times }$  energy efficiency improvement on average when compared to uniform partitioning (UP) strategy.</description></item><item><title>Impact of Interconnect on Ferroelectric FinFET-Based Logic-in-Memory Circuits at 3-nm Technology Node</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11007562</link><description>This study delves into the impact of interconnects on ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) devices, employing ferroelectric materials in the gate stack for nonvolatile memory at the 3-nm technology node. Specifically, the study investigates the impact of interconnect on logic-in-memory (LiM) circuits. As the impact of interconnect become more pronounced at sub-nanometer scales, they are known to have a significant influence on circuit characteristics beyond the intrinsic properties of the components. Leveraging a newly developed path-finding process-design-kit (PDK), encompassing FeFET characteristics and interconnect properties, we explored various circuit configurations, such as full-adder (FA) and ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM). Our investigation revealed that FeFET-based LiM circuits offer advantages in area, propagation delay, and power consumption compared to traditional CMOS-based circuits. While interconnects still influence FeFET-based circuit characteristics, their impact is somewhat tempered in comparison. We meticulously quantified these impacts. The simulation of how the next generation of advanced interconnect processes can further enhance FeFET-based LiM circuit performance was conducted using the PDK. Through this analysis, we proposed guidelines for the layout design of future FeFET-based LiM circuits.</description></item><item><title>An Ultraspeed Middle Voltage and Timing Analyzer With Near-SPICE Accuracy for Charge-Recycling Buses</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10994426</link><description>By stacking two data channels between  $V_{DD}$  and  $V_{SS}$ , charge recycling buses (CRBs) halve the voltage swing on interconnects, achieving significant power savings for energy-efficient on-chip data transmission. However, the middle voltage ( $V_{MID}$ ) between the two channels may fluctuate dynamically due to the diversity of input data, which significantly impacts data propagation delay and reliability. Unfortunately, existing SPICE-based simulators do not run fast enough to identify the worst-case  $V_{MID}$  fluctuation and propagation delay, posing great challenges in CRB design. In this article, we present a dedicated CRB Simulator for fast and accurate  $V_{MID}$  and timing analysis. A highly condensed  $V_{MID}$  fluctuation model, which integrates each cycle&#8217;s  $V_{MID}$  changes into a single closed-form formula, is embedded in the simulator to predict  $V_{MID}$  values at clock edges. In addition, a speed-monitoring algorithm is developed to track the continuously changing signal propagation speed under intracycle  $V_{MID}$  fluctuations for accurate delay estimation. Both the  $V_{MID}$  fluctuation model and the delay estimation algorithm involve only a small number of arithmetic operations, thus featuring remarkably low computational complexity. Compared with HSPICE, our CRB Simulator runs &gt; $1.0\times 10^{5} $  times faster on average across various CRB circuits, with a  $V_{MID}$  prediction error of only 1.3 mV and a delay estimation error as low as 0.6%. The significant speed improvement combined with high accuracy makes our CRB Simulator an efficient and reliable solution for  $V_{MID}$  and timing analysis in CRB circuit design.</description></item><item><title>Theseus: Exploring Efficient Wafer-Scale Chip Design for Large Language Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981855</link><description>The emergence of the large language model (LLM) poses an exponential growth of demand for computation throughput, memory capacity, and communication bandwidth. Such a demand growth has significantly surpassed the improvement of corresponding chip designs. With the advancement of fabrication and integration technologies, designers have been developing wafer-scale chips (WSCs) to scale up and exploit the limits of computation density, memory capacity, and communication bandwidth at the level of a single chip. Existing solutions have demonstrated the significant advantages of WSCs over traditional designs, showing potential to effectively support LLM workloads. Despite the benefits, exploring the early-stage design space of WSCs for LLMs is a crucial yet challenging task due to the enormous and complicated design space, time-consuming evaluation methods, and inefficient exploration strategies. To address these challenges, we propose Theseus, an efficient WSC design space exploration framework for LLMs. We construct the design space of WSCs with various constraints considering the unique characteristics of WSCs. We propose efficient evaluation methodologies for large-scale NoC-based WSCs and introduce multifidelity Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore the design space. Evaluation results demonstrate the efficiency of Theseus that the searched Pareto optimal results outperform GPU cluster and existing WSC designs by up to 62.8%/73.7% in performance (with the same or lower power) and 38.6%/42.4% in power consumption (with the same or higher performance) for LLM training, while improving up to  $23.2\times $  and  $15.7\times $  for the performance and power of inference tasks. Furthermore, we conduct case studies to address the design tradeoffs in WSCs and provide insights to facilitate WSC designs for LLMs.</description></item></channel></rss>
