However, the traditional thermal network model is difficult to predict the temperature information of power devices at multitimescale accurately. This article proposes a multitimescale thermal network model for power devices, with metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect-transistor (mosfet) as an example. First, we establish a finite-element model for temperature calculation of power devices and then reduce the order of the finite-element model based on the proper orthogonal decomposition algorithm. The reduced-order model is converted into an equivalent circuit model by the node voltage method and integrated into the circuit simulation software. To demonstrate its general applicability, this article also establishes thermal network models for both insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) and SiC mosfet devices, and validates the multitimescale thermal network models through ANSYS/transient thermal software and experiments. The temperature calculation results of the three power devices all indicate that the proposed multitimescale thermal network model can calculate the temperature of power devices faster than the ANSYS/transient thermal model and has less than 5% error under test conditions. This article is accompanied by a video demonstrating a comparison of the computational speed of the multitimescale thermal network model with a finite-element model. Finally, a case study of junction temperature calculation in a buck converter is presented to illustrate the application method of the thermal network model.</description></item><item><title>Fault-Tolerant Multiparallel Three-Phase Two-Level Converters With Adaptive Hardware Reconfiguration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10381814</link><description>This letter proposes a fault-tolerant multiparallel converter with adaptive hardware reconfiguration. The proposed topology maximizes open-switches&#8217; fault tolerance with minimal hardware redundancy, efficiently covering a broad spectrum of potential fault scenarios. Another pivotal feature of the proposed topology is its adaptive hardware reconfiguration capability in the event of an insulated gate bipolar transistor failure. Significantly, this adaptability is achieved without additional control circuits, simplifying the overall control complexity. The proposed topology achieves a more harmonic balance with minimal hardware redundancy, maximal fault coverage, and minimum control complexities. Finally, the prototype of the proposed fault-tolerant topology has been constructed. This prototype and the proposed postfault control strategies have been thoroughly validated through experimental investigations, demonstrating their effectiveness and resilience.</description></item><item><title>Virtual Arm Impedance Emulation and Stability Improvement in Modular Multilevel Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10384740</link><description>The arm impedance in a modular multilevel converter (MMC) influences both the internal dynamics and the converter impedance, significantly impacting the overall system stability. This article proposes a damping method with virtual arm impedance to suppress the small-signal oscillations caused by impedance interactions and improve the MMC stability. The virtual arm impedance, including both a resistance and a reactance component, is emulated based on the common-mode (CM) second-harmonic circulating current, which is injected to optimize the capacitor voltages of MMCs. Different from existing virtual impedance methods, the steady-state operation of the MMC is not influenced by the CM virtual arm impedance. It is shown that the virtual reactance of the same impedance has a better damping effect, compared with the virtual resistance. Selection guidelines of virtual reactance are also provided considering both the stability margin and dynamic performance. Moreover, the stability improvement is quantified by a stability boundary map and validated by real-time grid interaction studies and experimental results. This paper is accompanied by a video file demonstrating the experimental validation of the proposed virtual arm impedance emulation methods.</description></item><item><title>Asymmetrical-Bidirectional Input-Series&#8211;Output-Parallel Modular DC&#8211;DC Converter in DC Distribution Grids With Renewables</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10306310</link><description>Interlinking dc&#8211;dc converters are essential in urban-area dc distribution grids to interconnect the medium-voltage and low-voltage (LV) buses. The increasing installation of renewable energy sources at the LV side will result in backward power flow through these converters, which is usually less than the forward power. This letter presents an asymmetrical-bidirectional input-series&#8211;output-parallel (AB-ISOP) dc&#8211;dc converter with a partial-scale backward power rating to satisfy the above realistic requirement. Single-active bridge (SAB) and dual-active bridge (DAB) converter modules are combined in the proposed structure: the unidirectional SABs process most of the forward power, whereas the bidirectional DABs provide passage for the backward power flow. A string of embedded nonisolated resonant DAB converters is constructed at the input stage to realize natural power coupling and voltage sharing. Compared with the all-DAB ISOP scheme, the proposed one requires fewer devices and presents higher conversion efficiency as active switches are omitted at the secondary side of SABs. Experiments conducted on the downscale prototype verify the operating principles and performance of the proposed converter.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive Enhanced Complex-Coefficient Filter-Based PLL in Variable Frequency Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10342708</link><description>The complex-coefficient filter-based phase-locked loop is widely used in state estimation for the constant frequency grid system. However, its performance under power systems with a variable frequency is generally unacceptable and related applications are consequently rare. This letter proposes an adaptive enhanced complex-coefficient filter-based phase-locked loop (AECCF-PLL) that accurately estimates the operational state of variable frequency grids. By deriving the relationship between model parameters and frequency, a frequency adaptive module is established to dynamically correct the model parameters in real time. Furthermore, a stability analysis of the system is provided to meet the requirements of stability and fast response for state estimation in more electric aircraft variable frequency grids and the computational workload is relatively small. Experimental tests show strong evidence for the effectiveness and validity of the proposed AECCF-PLL method.</description></item><item><title>Fuzzy-Based Adaptive VOC Methods for Parallel Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10349946</link><description>This letter is focused on different kinds of virtual oscillator control (VOC) schemes that can be used to regulate the power inverters. Deadzone oscillator (DZO), Van der Pol oscillator (VdPO), and New-VdPO-based VOC techniques are presented in this work. The output voltage falls as the load increases with the aforementioned control methods, which might be problematic for sensitive equipment that demands a constant voltage. To overcome this limitation, the authors proposed adaptive VOC methods (DZO-Adaptive, VdPO-Adaptive, and New-VdPO-Adaptive) based on fuzzy logic algorithms (FLAs). The proposed New-VdPO-Adaptive-based VOC controller has good voltage regulation and lower total harmonic distortion (THD). The simulation and hardware results of the FLA-based adaptive VOC methods are presented to determine the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes.</description></item><item><title>A Discrete Selective Harmonic Elimination Formulation With Common-Mode Voltage Elimination Ability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10376306</link><description>Common-mode voltage (CMV) is harmful to high-power converter-fed drive systems, thus actively suppressing the CMV that is of great significance. Compared with CMV reduction, CMV elimination is a better choice as it can totally avoid the influence of CMV. In this letter, a discrete selective harmonic elimination (SHE) formulation with CMV elimination ability is proposed, which uses output voltage levels as variables to be optimized instead of switching angles as in conventional SHE models. In this formulation, the optimization objective is low-order harmonic elimination, while CMV elimination is used as a constraint. The output result is the complete full SHE- pulsewidth modulated waveform over one fundamental period, where selected low-order harmonics and CMV have both been eliminated. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed formulation, and some comparison results are also provided.</description></item><item><title>A Small-Sized High-Precision Digital Closed-Loop Modulation Method for Dead-Time Compensation for Flying Capacitor Three-Level Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10379116</link><description>This article proposes a small-scale high-precision digital closed-loop modulation method for a flying-capacitor three-level inverter to eliminate the influence of dead time. The proposed method only uses a resistive voltage divider to collect the state information, without the need for a current sensor and an analog-to-digital converter, enabling a small footprint. This method does not require complex calculations, can be applied to high switching frequencies, and is independent of the original control system, so it is easy to integrate into a controller or a stand-alone IC. Finally, a 450-W/400-Hz prototype is built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Effective Field Grading at 200 &#176;C of a Nonlinear Resistive Polymer Nanocomposite Coating for Medium-Voltage Power Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10384759</link><description>Medium-voltage silicon carbide power modules have the potential to enable a more renewable, resilient, and reliable electric grid. However, their electrical insulation, especially the partial discharge around the module's triple point, remains a challenge. To address this, we have applied a nonlinear resistive coating made of a polymer nanocomposite to the module's triple point and have shown its effectiveness in reducing the electric field stress at room temperature. In this research, we assessed the performance of the coating at high temperatures up to 200 &#176;C. A test setup capable of measuring the partial discharge of a substrate at high temperatures was built. We found that from 25 &#176;C to 200 &#176;C, the coated samples maintained an 85% higher partial discharge inception voltage than that of the uncoated samples. The temperature dependence of the nanocomposite's electrical conductivity was measured and used in field simulations. Over the tested temperature range, the observed increase in partial discharge inception voltage agrees with the decrease in the simulated electric field stress caused by the nanocomposite coating. This research marks the first experimental demonstration of effective nonlinear resistive field-grading at 200 &#176;C for medium-voltage power modules, potentially hastening their adoption in grid-tied applications.</description></item><item><title>A Strongly Coupled Vehicle-to-Vehicle Wireless Charging System for Emergency Charging Purposes With Constant-Current and Constant-Voltage Charging Capabilities</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10388485</link><description>One current issue concerning rapidly developing electric vehicles (EVs) is range anxiety, especially when no charging station is around. A simple and expandable vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) wireless charging scheme has been proposed to satisfy urgent charging needs. In the proposed V2V system, one EV serves as a mobile charger for the other. Two power relay coils without compensating capacitors are adopted, forming a strong coupling with the coils in the EV. Thus, power can be transferred from one EV to the other via the ac magnetic relay. The mathematical models of the existing loosely coupled V2V system and the proposed strongly coupled V2V system are established. The constant-voltage and constant-current operations for the proposed V2V system are explored. The experimental results reveal that, compared with the existing loosely coupled V2V system, employing the proposed strongly coupled V2V system can improve efficiency and reduce weight, volume, and cost.</description></item><item><title>Nonlinear Inductor-Based Single Sensor Current Balancing Method for Interleaved DC&#8211;DC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10402083</link><description>The nonlinear characteristics of inductors, especially those with soft magnetic powder cores, are often perceived as undesirable and should be typically either avoided or mitigated. However, this letter presents an innovative method to take advantage of the nonlinear behavior of inductors in interleaved dc&#8211;dc converters. By analyzing the total current shape after interleaving, a novel single-sensor current balancing method is proposed, which is realized by using peak current sampling and exploiting the inductor's nonlinearity. The proposed method not only achieves low-cost current balancing with just one current sensor but also reduces the hardware volume and complexity of the converter. In addition, it also provides inspiration for various current balancing applications. Experimental validations for an interleaved dc&#8211;dc converter confirm the effectiveness of the proposed current balancing scheme.</description></item><item><title>Improving dv/dt Immunity of Reverse Blocking IGCT for Hybrid Line-Commutated Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10411065</link><description>The dv/dt induced turn-on is an undesirable triggering event of integrated gate-commutated thyristor (IGCT). In this letter, we aim to improve the dv/dt immunity of the IGCT in the hybrid line-commutated converter (H-LCC), which is a newly proposed topology that can reduce the commutation failure probability. First, the mechanism of the dv/dt induced turn-on is revealed. Second, it is proved evidentially that both the dv/dt applied time and the temperature significantly impact the dv/dt immunity. Third, three distinct snubber topologies to improve the dv/dt immunity are proposed and compared based on the above analysis. It is experimentally demonstrated that the topology comprising a capacitor, resistor, and normally on junction field effect transistors (JFETs) is the most effective; the dv/dt immunity at 50 &#176;C is improved from 144 to 655 V/&#956;s when the dv/dt applied time is 5 &#956;s, satisfying all requirements of the H-LCC successfully.</description></item><item><title>A Control Strategy for Solid-State Transformers With Coupled Load Disturbance Attenuation Ability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10376302</link><description>The architecture of solid-state transformers (SSTs) is usually comprised with three-stage cascaded converters. The control of cascaded multistage SSTs is conventionally designed considering decoupled stages. Furthermore, the isolating stage, which is typically implemented with dual active bridge converters, employs a closed-loop control with a much larger bandwidth (BW) than the ac&#8211;dc stage. This disparity in the BWs can put a strain on the intermediate dc-link capacitors that connect the ac&#8211;dc and isolating stages, resulting in large capacitor voltage excursions when the load changes. In fact, this can result in ac&#8211;dc stage overmodulation and even large current overshoots through the isolating stage's high-frequency transformers. This necessitates advanced SST control strategies that can mitigate the aforementioned challenges. This article proposes a control design in which the state variables are selected as the sum of capacitor energies and differences in capacitor energies. Unlike the state-of-the-art SST controllers, the proposed integrated control approach creates a more balanced and safe distribution of energies among the dc-link capacitors during load transients. The control design is simplified as the difference in the control-loop BWs between the stages does not affect this disturbance attenuation ability. The effectiveness of the proposed control is demonstrated by experiments using a 1-kVA SST with two strings.</description></item><item><title>High-Performance Control and Power Decoupling of a Grid-Tied Differential Boost Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10376288</link><description>This work proposes the control of a grid-tied differential boost inverter that achieves active power decoupling of the second harmonic ripple in the power drawn from the dc voltage source. The control strategy employs partial feedback linearization, a technique that enables precise positioning of the closed-loop poles of the linear representation of a part of the system obtained via coordinates transformation and nonlinear feedback. This approach allows for obtaining an excellent dynamic response in the active power decoupling control loop. The validity and effectiveness of the proposal are demonstrated through experimental and simulation results.</description></item><item><title>A Multienergy Interface Electric-Drive- Reconstructed Onboard Charger for EVs With Integrated Control Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10379144</link><description>In this article, an innovative multienergy interface electric-drive-reconstructed onboard charger (MEI-EDROC) and its derivative integrated control strategy (ICS) are proposed for a solar-powered electric vehicle that is equipped with a six-phase machine drive. The proposed MEI-EDROC is capable of dc charging, single-phase charging, in-motion charging, and normal driving with applications for single-phase ac grid, dc grid, and photovoltaic energy input interfaces. In particular, all the operation modes are implemented by the ICS extended from the vector control of the six-phase permanent-magnet synchronous machine. First, the topology and operation modes of the proposed MEI-EDROC are discussed. Then, operation principles for all work scenarios are studied in detail, and the concept of integrated control is proposed. Thereafter, based on the vector control strategy, the ICS is designed. Finally, a 2-kW experimental test rig is built, and the obtained results verify the steady-state and dynamic performances, as well as the mode switching operation.</description></item><item><title>Switched Active Power Control of a Grid-Connected Inverter With Reduced RoCoF and Frequency Overshoot</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10380738</link><description>In this article, a switched active power control of the grid-connected inverter is proposed. First, the principle of the proposed control is demonstrated with the phase trajectory analysis. The proposed control allows for direct adjustment of the maximum rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) and frequency overshoot of the inverter, thereby enhancing the frequency stability. Next, the stability of the proposed control is examined using the Lyapunov function. For the active power control loop of the inverter, the proposed control has been proven to ensure global asymptotic stability. Then, the parameters of the proposed control are designed. Due to the clear physical meaning, the proposed control allows for explicit derivation of the relationships among RoCoF, frequency overshoot, response time, and active power overshoot of the inverter. Therefore, the controller parameters can be directly designed using the derived analytical equations, simplifying the application of the proposed control. Finally, the proposed control is clarified through detailed comparisons to highlight its advantages. The proposed control achieves a lower RoCoF and frequency overshoot compared to existing controls while maintaining the same active power overshoot and response time. This is demonstrated through theoretical, simulation, and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithm Based Reinforcement Learning Controller for Single-Inductor Multiple-Output DC&#8211;DC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10381868</link><description>Due to its advantages, such as simple structure, high power density, and strong scalability, single-input multiple-output (SIMO) dc&#8211;dc converters exhibit vast application prospects. However, a significant challenge arises in the control design of SIMO converters. This challenge stems from the shared usage of the inductor in the main circuit by all loads, inevitably leading to mutual interference and cross-regulation among the output voltages. Consequently, research on control methods for SIMO dc&#8211;dc converters has been a widely discussed topic. In this article, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm based reinforcement learning (RL) controller. The proposed control method is applicable to multivariable and nonlinear control systems, offering excellent regulation performance and robustness. It effectively addresses the issues of mutual interference and cross-regulation among the outputs of SIMO dc&#8211;dc converters. This approach also enhances the steady-state performance and dynamic regulation capabilities of the converter when operating in continuous conduction mode. Simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed RL multivariable controller. The results demonstrate that SIMO converters, when controlled by the RL multivariable controller, exhibit improved steady-state and dynamic response performance. This approach effectively mitigates the cross-regulation issues among the outputs of SIMO converters.</description></item><item><title>Review of Topologies, Application Areas, Modeling, and Control Methods for Switched Capacitor Circuits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10381836</link><description>Switched capacitor (SC) circuits have been widely used for low-power and high-power areas, such as the integration circuit power supply, energy conversion for wearable devices, and power supply for data centers and electrical vehicles.

In this article, a model predictive control (MPC) scheme for a single-phase IBC is proposed for the first time. The IBC repurposes the motor drive, which consists of a three-phase induction motor and a three-phase inverter, for charging purposes. The proposed MPC scheme is implemented with the objective of minimization of switching frequency using double prediction algorithm, along with maintaining a sinusoidal grid current profile at unity power factor (UPF) during charging mode. Furthermore, the proposed scheme addresses the issue of ripple power at the dc link with twice the grid frequency, which is inherently present in a single-phase IBCs. This ripple component is effectively suppressed by using active power decoupling by reutilizing one of the stator windings of the induction motor along with the inverter legs without any additional hardware requirement. Additionally, the power reversal capability of IBC is also demonstrated. The control scheme was implemented on hardware by using Texas instruments$^{\prime }$ DSP TMS320F28335.</description></item><item><title>Stability Analysis of Input-Series/Output-Parallel Solid-State Transformers Equipped With Second-Order Harmonic Active Power Filters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10384781</link><description>Solid-state transformers (SSTs) with input-series/output-parallel (ISOP) configuration offer a convenient solution for ac/dc conversion due to their scalability and modularity. In this configuration, each module experiences a second-order harmonic ripple caused by local single-phase ac/dc conversion. To neutralize this ripple, active power filters (APFs) can be installed, eliminating the need for oversized dc-bus capacitances. However, the presence of multiple APFs, working at the same time, can lead to dynamic interactions and potential instability due to the coupling between different ISOP SST modules. This study examines the mutual dynamics arising from multiple APFs in ISOP SSTs. It is shown that ensuring stability for the operation of a single APF does not automatically guarantee the overall stability when all APFs are simultaneously enabled. To study this phenomenon, an analysis approach based on the generalized Nyquist criterion for multi-input/multi-output systems is derived. Through the proposed approach, the closed-loop stability only needs to be verified toward two equivalent SST impedances that intrinsically considers the mutual coupling. This provides a simple design and verification tool for the APF controller, and the results are validated experimentally using a single-phase ISOP SST.</description></item><item><title>An Energy-Based Model of Four-Switch Buck&#8211;Boost Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10388278</link><description>The four-switch buck&#8211;boost (FSBB) topology is often used in combination with other isolated converters to extend the voltage range capability of the overall structure. In such applications, the duty-cycles of the two legs of the FSBB are independently controlled, and a phase shift is typically used to shape the inductor current ripple and, thus, achieve zero voltage switching. This article proposes a nonlinear average model, and the corresponding linearized small-signal model for the FSBB operating in the described way. Notably, the proposed approach is based on the modeling of the inductor energy, which allows the correct description of the dynamics related to the phase shift, in addition to those related to the duty-cycles. The derived models are shown to be in excellent agreement with simulation results and are also validated by measurements on an experimental prototype.</description></item><item><title>Insights on the Dynamic Performance of Nonminimum-Phase Boost Converters Exploiting Inductor-Current-Feedback RHPZ Mitigation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10398513</link><description>Inductor current feedback (ICF) has been recently proposed to mitigate the adverse effect of the right-half-plane zero (RHPZ) in nonminimum phase boost converters. Basically, ICF is used to move the RHPZ into the left-half-plane, leading to increased closed-loop stability. This article systematically investigates the impact of the ICF mitigation technique on the dynamic performance of the converter. It is shown that both line and load transient responses are still limited by the RHPZ despite the exploitation of ICF. Compared to a boost converter equipped with a properly designed proportional-integral-derivative controller, the use of ICF leads to a load transient response with similar peak overshoots/undershoots but slower settling time, whereas the line transient response shows a significant reduction in the peak overshoots/undershoots. The theoretical analysis and the proposed design guidelines are verified with SIMetrix/SIMPLIS and MATLAB/Simulink simulations. Experimental results from a prototype boost converter designed for 2.3&#8211;4.5 V to 5 V voltage conversion, 800 mA load current capability, provide further validation.</description></item><item><title>Subsynchronous Damping by Battery Storage System in Grid-Forming Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10400798</link><description>Wind farms are susceptible to subsynchronous oscillation (SSO) issues due to the interaction between the grid-side converter (GSC) and the weak-grid impedance. Integration of battery energy storage system (BESS) to damp SSO became popular due to its ability to also provide various grid services. Generally, BESS can be externally integrated at the PCC or internally integrated at the dc link of the wind turbine (WT). In case of external BESS integration, grid-forming (GFM) control is usually applied to the BESS GSC. Proper increase of the GFM damping coefficient contributes to a better SSO damping, at the cost of a higher BESS power rating due to its droop meaning. Reconfiguring power loop of GFM to decouple the damping and the droop coefficient enables GSC to realize similar SSO damping performance while reducing the BESS power rating. In case of internal BESS integration, a virtual GFM control is proposed as an ancillary control of the WT GSC. This enables GSC to emulate the output behavior of two parallel converters, operated in grid-following and GFM mode, respectively. Consequently, similar SSO damping performance can be realized without an external GFM converter. Simulation and experimental results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Comparative Study on High-Temperature Electrical Properties of 1.2 kV SiC MOSFET and JBS-Integrated MOSFET</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10337796</link><description>For 4H-SiC mosfets, the parasitic PiN body diode causes problems such as significant forward voltage drop of body diode and poor reverse recovery characteristics during high-temperature operation. A reasonable solution is a mosfet with an integrated Schottky barrier diode to deactivate the PiN body diode. Since SiC mosfets can operate at extremely high temperatures, the characterization of electrical parameters at high temperatures and changing with the temperature are very important for high power applications and system reliability. However, there is a lack of comparison and analysis of the two devices on electrical properties at ultrahigh temperatures. In this article, a 1.2 kV conventional mosfet and a mosfet integrated with a junction barrier Schottky diode (JBSFET) were fabricated with a consistent process flow. In the temperature range from 300 to 575 K, analytical models of the temperature-dependent electrical parameters of these two devices were established and compared, which were successfully verified by the measurements. These models can provide guidance for ultrahigh temperature applications of JBSFETs. Temperature-related expressions can also be used for junction temperature monitoring of temperature-sensitive electrical parameters. Experimental results show that JBSFET has better third quadrant conduction characteristics and higher temperature stability below 450 K, but loses obvious performance advantages at 575 K. So, the recommended operating temperature range of JBSFET is from 300 to 450 K. Finally, the continuous operation performance of the body diodes in buck converters is analyzed. The higher efficiency of buck converter based on JBSFET's body diode indicates its great application potential in compact converters, especially in the recommended temperature range.</description></item><item><title>Reduction of CM Noise by Minimizing Near-Field Effects in a DC&#8211;DC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10337757</link><description>Enabled by the adoption of wide-bandgap power devices, converters in many applications continue to push switching frequency and power density. These trends have the unintentional effect of strengthening parasitic inductive and capacitive couplings between different areas of the power converter. If not properly addressed, these parasitic near-field couplings may increase the converter's conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI). This article investigates the impact of parasitic near-field couplings on conducted common-mode (CM) noise in a buck converter with the EMI filter. Magnetic and electric coupling mechanisms are studied using near-field measurements. A CM model with capacitive couplings is developed and shown to accurately predict the CM noise spectrum under two different test conditions. The model is analyzed and two critical capacitive couplings are identified. Finally, shielding techniques are demonstrated to reduce CM noise up to 35 dB, and a novel shielded-windings PCB inductor structure is proposed.</description></item><item><title>A Clamped Interlocking Isolated Resonant Gate Driver for High-Frequency LLC-DCX</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10319065</link><description>This article proposes a clamped interlocking isolated resonant gate driver (CIRGD) to provide multiple isolated complementary drive signals for the LLC dc transformer (LLC-DCX). The CIRGD clamps the gate voltage to 0&#8211;Vg using clamped mosfets, reducing conduction loss caused by the circulation current in the drive circuit and further improving system efficiency. With appropriate parameter design, the CIRGD generates gate drive signals with the necessary deadtime, enabling soft switching of the LLC-DCX. The working principle, parameter design, loss analysis, and comparative study of the CIRGD are presented in detail. Finally, a prototype with an operating frequency of 1.3 MHz, and a power output of 48 V&#8211;6 V/30 A was developed. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional voltage source drive circuit, the proposed CIRGD can significantly enhance efficiency and reduce gate drive power loss by nearly 85%.</description></item><item><title>Bipolar Current-Fed DC&#8211;DC Converter With Automatic Voltage Balance and Full Range ZVS for Bipolar DC System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10356717</link><description>The bipolar dc microgrid is attracting attention for its high efficiency and reliability, but the bipolar dc bus is susceptible to unbalanced power. This article proposes a bipolar current-fed dc&#8211;dc converter with automatic voltage balance under phase-shift plus pulsewidth control.

LCL exhibits similar soft switching characteristics and enhanced voltage gain regulation capability with a simpler resonant tank than the existing classic CLLC. The operating principles, mode distribution, and power transfer properties of LCL during bidirectional operations are presented and analyzed in detail utilizing TDM. By incorporating TDM, the low accuracy deficiency of the first harmonic approximation for wide voltage applications is completely eliminated, and the implementation of full-range zero-voltage switching (ZVS) with time-domain accuracy becomes feasible. An LCL resonant parameters optimization method that is capable of providing the required voltage gain and guaranteeing the achievement of ZVS with reduced reactive power under desired load conditions during bidirectional operations is proposed. Finally, the revealed experimental results from a 1-kW prototype validated the correctness of the TDM theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed optimization method.

Both additional series-connected converters and their adjacent transformers are necessitated when controlling the power flow among multiple transmission lines. Such implementation will further increase the cost and volume of the equipment owing to the port expansion.

This device presents several advantages, including low cost, lightweight, fast dynamic response characteristics, and easy port expansion. Therefore, the MTUPFC has significant advantages in power grids with complex configurations and large-scale renewable energy integration. The operation principle and control strategies of the proposed MTUPFC are elaborated. The feasibility and effectiveness of the MTUPFC are verified by a 60-MVA simulation model and a 2.5-kVA scaled-down experimental platform, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Development of a MHz Pulsed Power Supply for Kicker Magnet in SHINE</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375743</link><description>Shanghai high repetition rate X-ray free electron laser and extreme light (SHINE) project is a superconducting linear electron accelerator-based facility under construction at the Shanghai Advance Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Conventional power loss evaluation methods separate the theoretical analysis and experimental verification stages. Consequently, these methods often suffer from irreconcilable disparities between the analytical predictions and measurement outcomes. This article introduces a transfer learning (TL)-based refinement approach for power loss evaluation, which can be iteratively improved with ongoing experimental data. Our method entails the creation of an extensive source domain dataset for training a source domain model, followed by fine-tuning in the target domain. Consequently, a self-adaptive and refined power loss evaluation model is established with a small amount of experimental data.

Leveraging a dataset of 2 33 280 simulation samples and 45 experimental samples, our refined power loss evaluation model achieved a remarkable 50% reduction in average power loss error compared with conventional methodologies. Guided by the TL refined power loss model, the peak efficiency and corresponding optimal control parameters can be obtained.</description></item><item><title>Topology and Hybrid Modulation of Six-Level Switched-Capacitor HC Converter With Improved DC-Link Capacitor Voltage Balancing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10384793</link><description>Neutral point (NP) voltage imbalance blocks the deployment of carrier-based clamped converters for specific scenarios due to the limited adjustment capability of NP current by zero-sequence voltage (ZSV) injection. Therefore, a novel six-level switched-capacitor (SC) hybrid clamped (6L-SCHC) converter is proposed, which has compromised voltage stress, and utilizes the discrete voltage boost and capacitor voltage self-balancing features of the SC circuit to simplify control complexity. On this basis, a carrier-based hybrid modulation is developed, which simplifies the complexity of SC voltage control, and ensures the voltage natural balance of SC and dc-link center capacitor to minimize voltage ripples. Furthermore, a reasonable functional relationship between average NP current and reference modulation voltage is explored. As the result, the proposed 6L-SCHC converter has extremely powerful NP voltage balancing capability compared with other carrier-based clamped converters in theory, especially at high modulation indexes and low power factors. Capacitor voltage ripple models are also derived to achieve voltage independent controls of all capacitors. Comparative simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed topology and modulation greatly reduce the low-frequency voltage ripples of dc-link upper and lower capacitors, and provide excellent NP voltage balancing performance over a wide range of modulation indexes and power factors.</description></item><item><title>A High-Efficiency High-Density Three-Phase CLLC Resonant Converter With a Universally Derived Three-Phase Integrated Transformer for On-Board-Charger Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10400842</link><description>This article proposed a universal method of integrating magnetizing inductance with built-in leakage inductance based on multiple perfectly coupled transformers (PCTs).

When combined with high output power, magnetic optimization becomes crucial in the pushing of the boundaries of magnetic shrinkage. Among those applications in need of power dense systems, aircraft is considered one of the most restrictive due to its ultrahigh reliability and miniaturization in both volume and mass. On-board equipment transfers the responsability to the power stage classifying it as mission-critical. The selection of a multiphase converter enables the desired magnetic components' shrinkage.

This article introduces a reconfigurable half-bridge gate driver (GD) for SMPSys, with an open-drain output configuration, electrostatic discharge self-protection, and two dead-time management modes to address these challenges. The first mode is an externally tunable fixed dead-time generator (FDTG) capable of achieving a wide dead-time range from 5 to 200 ns. The second mode is a self-adjusting dead-time generator (SDTG), designed to adapt to delay mismatches between the GD's channels, regardless of process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations, while minimizing dead-time and preventing cross-conduction. The GD was fabricated in an HV 0.18-&#956;m silicon-on-insulator CMOS process technology, supporting a high-side floating bias voltage rail up to 100 V and occupying a core area of 0.285 mm2. It was tested in a buck converter system using a gallium nitride (GaN)-based half-bridge with a switching frequency of 0.5 to 1 MHz. It achieves a total propagation delay of 11.4 ns and a minimum dead-time of 3.6 ns (3&#215; smaller than state-of-the-art) using its SDTG mode. The system achieved a peak efficiency of 90.5% at an output load of 8 W. Notably, the SDTG mode improves the overall efficiency by up to 20% over the FDTG mode, specifically at higher switching frequencies, showing its effectiveness in enhancing the performance of SMPSys.</description></item><item><title>Multicell-to-Multicell Equalizer With Hybrid Pulsewidth Modulation and Phase-Shift Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10355888</link><description>In this article, an any-cells-to-any-cells equalizer based on the multiwinding transformer is proposed to reduce the component number and increase the balancing speed.

The proposed circuit topology exhibits a high voltage conversion ratio and a reduced current ripple. On the transformer primary side, a quasi-switched-capacitor (QSC) circuit mitigates voltage stress on switching devices and achieves a 3:1 voltage step-down ratio. The proposed transformer-interleaved circuit on the secondary side features the 2:1 voltage conversion ratio and minimizes the battery current ripple without adding extra switching or magnetic components. The 6:1 voltage conversion contributes to a simpler winding structure, smaller transformer size, and lower transformer loss in high voltage gain application.

That is studied by many researchers. In addition, using dual-mode control can improve the line-to-line output voltage waveform to be more easily filtered into sine wave. Thus, the traditional method to determine the LC filter parameters is unreasonable and will cause over filtering. The redundant design of filter will bring unnecessary volume, weight and loss on inductor and capacitor of the inverter, while decrease the power density. To solve this issue, this article derives the line-to-line output voltage harmonic components calculation formulas for the conventional two-stage inverter and the dual-mode inverter by using double Fourier integral analysis. By comparing the harmonic components calculation results around switching frequency, a new LC filter parameters design method for dual-mode inverter is proposed. Through the proposed method, the LC filter parameters are declined by 50%, which significantly reduces the volume, weight and cost of the inverter under other conditions of constant performance. Calculation and experimental results based on a 1 kW prototype verify the validity of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Fast-Transient Radiation-Tolerant LDO-cum-Latching Current Limiter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10379868</link><description>The low-dropout regulator (LDO) and the latching current limiter (LCL) are two important constituent components of the power management system in satellites, including for the impending 6G satellite communications. In this article, we present a fast-transient radiation-tolerant LDO-cum-LCL realized in CMOS (vis-&#224;-vis III/V or BiCMOS exotic processes). The LCL therein detects load current anomalies, thereby protecting the load against current anomalies (when the load suffers from single-event-latch-up, a radiation effect). The fast-transient response is realized by our proposed triple-feedforward-path technique that is efficacious over wide range of load currents (up to 3A) and off-chip capacitors (100 to 880 &#956;F). The LDO-cum-LCL is monolithically realized in a 130 nm CMOS process. The dropout voltage is 210 mV at the full load, and the overshoot and undershoot are 14.2 and 11.8 mV, respectively, at fast 3A load transitions. The load regulation is 0.15 mV/A while the power supply rejection is &#8722;52.3 dB@100 kHz. These parameters of the LDO-cum-LCL are very competitive when benchmarked against reported LDOs, albeit the reported LDOs not featuring radiation tolerance.</description></item><item><title>Ultrafast Self-Powered Circuit for Gate Driving of Normally On Wide-Bandgap Transistors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10379848</link><description>Normally on wide-bandgap (WBG) devices switch faster and have lower power loss compared to similarly rated normally off devices. However, their application in voltage-fed power electronic converters is limited due to the risk of the dc-link short-circuit condition. Several techniques are proposed in the literature to address this problem. However, some drawbacks exist, first, the use of several additional components; second, slow response to the short-circuit condition; and third, increased power losses.

However, one big challenge is the mismatch of overvoltage withstand capability of electromagnetic transformer and converters in the HTs. The limited overvoltage capacity of the converter limits the overall performance of the HT in overvoltage events in the power grid.

The voltage-clamped circuit, which consists of a gap and a metal oxide varistor, ensures the safe operation of the VCS without the risks of breakdown during overvoltage period. Thus, this scheme allows the high-voltage HT to take advantage of the surge resistance of electromagnetic transformers and keep the enhanced controllability normally during transient surges. An experimental platform was built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed VCS, and simulation results demonstrated the usefulness of the high voltage HT with proposed scheme in power delivery systems subjected to different transient surges.</description></item><item><title>A High-Order Harmonic Compound Rotor Based Brushless Dual-Electrical-Port Dual-Mechanical-Port Machine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10195929</link><description>The brushless dual-electrical-port dual-mech- anical-port machine (BLDDM) is increasingly developed as an effective power split device for continuously variable transmission due to its compactness and high control flexibility.

However, the unsuppressed torque ripple of IPMSM will cause declined torque quality, increased vibration, and reduced reliability. This article presents a novel composed T-shaped notching rotor to suppress torque ripple for IPMSM. The mathematical models of cogging torque and winding factors considering T- shaped notches are established, respectively. Although the principle of the novel rotor design is clearly explained by mathematical models, the accurate dimensions of the composed T-shaped notch are difficult to calculate. Therefore, two-dimensional finite element analysis and multiobjective design optimization are employed to calculate the T-shaped notch dimensions. The electromagnetic performance of the proposed rotor machine is compared with that of the commonly notching rotor machine. In addition, the mechanical strength of the novel rotor is verified by calculations of stress and deformation. Finally, the proposed prototype with a novel rotor is fabricated, and extensive experiments are conducted. The results show that the torque ripple of IPMSM can be significantly reduced by the novel composed T-shaped notching rotor.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Highly Efficient Torque-Sharing Algorithm for Dual Stator Winding Induction Machines for Various Speed Regions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10168138</link><description>This article proposes a novel and highly efficient torque-sharing algorithm for dual stator winding induction machines (DSWIMs). This algorithm introduces three modes of operation for DSWIMs based on the command speed and the required load power. Implementing this algorithm makes accurate flux calculation and control possible in very low-speed regions, including zero speed. In higher speed regions, if one of the winding sets is able to supply the required power solely, the other is switched off to augment the overall efficiency. In higher required powers, both winding sets cooperate to supply the load torque, and the required electromagnetic torque division between the two winding sets is fulfilled based on their power ratings. This guarantees overloading avoidance in various operation conditions. Moreover, the optimal flux condition is guaranteed in various speed regions free of the torque sharing. In addition, this algorithm is general and can be implemented in direct torque control and field-oriented control schemes in various reference frames. The proposed algorithm has been experimentally implemented in a 3.3-kW vector-controlled DSWIM drive system. In this flux and speed control system, the flux is controlled such that a search-based maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) algorithm is realized. The proposed MTPA strategy is insensitive to DSWIM parameters and load variations.

The current-source charge pump (CS-CP) PFC converter has the advantages of simple structure, easy control, and low cost, but it can only obtain a high power factor (PF) over a narrow input range. The operation principle of the CS-CP PFC converter and the input voltage range are analyzed in this article. In order to obtain a high PF over a wide input voltage range, in this article, a variable turn ratio CS-CP PFC converter is proposed. By adjusting the turn ratio according to the variation of the input voltage, the proposed converter can obtain a high PF over a wide input voltage range, reduce the voltage stress of the bus capacitor, and solve the problem of insufficient voltage gain at low input voltage. The operating modes and the wide input voltage range of the proposed converter are analyzed, and the relevant parameters are given. A 40-W experimental prototype operating with the input voltage range of 100&#8211;242 Vac is built to verify the theoretical analysis. The proposed converter obtains the PF of 0.946&#8211;0.991 and its total harmonic distortion of current can satisfy the IEC 61000-3-2-2020 Class-C Standard in the whole input voltage.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Capacitor Voltage-Balancing Method for Multiwinding Resonant Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10183679</link><description>Isolated dc/dc converters play a key role in electric vehicle applications, and novel multiwinding resonant converters have recently been proposed for on-board and off-board charging applications. Some of these topologies have two series capacitors at the dc bus with a mid-point connection to the windings. Parameter mismatch due to manufacturing differences will cause voltage unbalance on these capacitors, which can lead to safety and reliability concerns. However, the well-known capacitor balancing strategies proposed for other topologies are not applicable to these new resonant multiwinding topologies. Thus, this article proposes a novel capacitor voltage-balancing method for a resonant multiwinding converter. The method uses a simple table to decide on balancing switching states. Time-domain analysis is performed to quantify the control cycles required, and an adaptive control strategy is proposed. Experimental results with multiple bus capacitor sizes validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, use of the proposed method is found to slightly increase efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Automatic Tuning Resonant Capacitor to Fix the Bidirectional Detuning With ZVS in Wireless Power Transfer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10190168</link><description>The power transfer efficiency of a wireless power transfer is degraded by mismatch between LC resonant frequency and TX switching frequency. One of the drawbacks of conventional resonance tuning methods is that only increment of capacitor is allowed. Even if some conventional tunings allow both increment and reduction of capacitance, they fail zero-voltage switching (ZVS) at the increment of capacitance, which practically limits their tuning range. To solve the issue, we propose an automatic tuning resonant capacitor (ATRC), which can both increase and decrease the resonant capacitor. The tuning mosfets achieve zero-voltage turn-on (ZVS) both at the capacitor-reduction mode and the capacitor-increment mode. These two (decrement/increment both are possible, and ZVS for both modes) are the advantages compared to conventional autotuning methods. Additionally, low dv/dt turn-off is achieved at capacitor-increasing mode in proposed method. Hence, the delivered power and overall efficiency is improved. The proposed method is suitable for any LC network to solve the detuning problem. A 200 W prototype is fabricated and tested experimentally. The measurement results show that the proposed ATRC can improve the overall PTE by 25%&#8211;63% point when the operating frequency is detuned ranging 75&#8211;125 kHz for 100 kHz nominal LC resonant frequency.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Practical Evaluation of Dimmable Passive Light-Emitting Diode Drivers for Smart Lampposts</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10199135</link><description>Passive light-emitting-diode (LED) drivers have recently been adopted by the lighting industry in street lighting applications due to their high robustness against extreme weather conditions, long lifetime, and high percentage of recyclable components. With the increasing trend of smart lamp posts, there are new requests for dimmable passive street lighting systems. This article presents a novel dimmable technology for passive LED drivers. By adding a switchable parallel capacitor across the input current-limiting inductor, a small freewheeling period between the inductor and capacitor can provide an artificial dead angle, which reduces the power for a passive half-bridge voltage doubler LED driver. The operating principle of this new dimming mechanism is explained, and a full analysis is included. The new dimmable mechanism has been practically confirmed in a 120-W passive LED system. The theoretical and practical results are in good agreement.</description></item><item><title>Simultaneous Wireless Power and Data Transfer System With Single Coil Based on Multifrequency Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10189817</link><description>The existing energy modulation simultaneous wireless power and data transfer (EM-SWPDT) system will cause severe load voltage drop and power efficiency reduction at the data transmitting. Besides, those methods can only achieve simplex communication. To solve these problems, this article proposes a single coil half-duplex communication EM-SWPDT system using a novel multifrequency modulation, which can enhance data transmission performance. By modulating the conduction angle of the converter with desired signal frequency, the steady state and sinusoidal fluctuating states are realized, which compose different data wave, respectively. Because the data transmission relies on frequency information instead of amplitude information, the load voltage drop can be reduced. And the phase-shifting equivalent current model is constructed to evaluate the influence of data transmission on load voltage. Since the data modulation is performed by the converters of wireless power transfer system, additional auxiliary data circuits, such as signal generators and wave trappers are omitted and branch crosstalk is reduced. Therefore, the influence of data transmission on power transmission efficiency is weak. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed EM-SWPDT system with a novel multifrequency modulation is verified by experimental platforms.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Voltage Stiffness Control Technique for a Virtual Oscillator-Based Grid- Forming Controller</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10163995</link><description>Voltage stiffness is a vital parameter for grid-forming inverters. With a very high voltage stiffness, an inverter picks up all the reactive power demands of the point of common coupling. In contrast, with a very low voltage stiffness, the inverter does not participate in voltage regulation at all. Hence, any grid-forming controller should be able to control voltage stiffness dynamically. Virtual oscillator-based controllers (VOCs), the latest and most advanced grid-forming controllers, provide all the steady-state functionalities of the conventional droop controllers and, in addition, time-domain synchronization with a connected network. However, existing VOCs cannot control voltage stiffness dynamically. As a result, limiting reactive power output during a higher voltage sag, especially when connected to a weak grid, is challenging for VOCs. The only existing solution for a VOC in such conditions is to enter into current control mode, which leads to ineffective synchronization, output power oscillation, and, finally, inefficient grid-forming operation. Integrating a dynamic voltage stiffness controller inside a VOC is not as straightforward as a droop controller. Because, unlike phasor-based droop controllers, VOCs have time-domain implementation. In this article, we introduce virtual impedance-based dynamic voltage stiffness control technique for VOCs with systematic design procedures and rigorous stability analysis.</description></item><item><title>High-Efficiency Time-Division Multiplexing Modulation Technology for Modular Multiactive Bridge Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10194423</link><description>In this article, a time-division multiplexing (TDM) modulation technology is proposed to enhance the efficiency of modular multiactive bridge (MMAB) converters in multiport power electronic transformers over a wide operating range. The TDM modulation retains the simplicity of single phase-shift (SPS) modulation while achieving efficiency improvement by adopting different structures (i.e., half-bridge and full-bridge) under different operating conditions with dc bias capacitors. However, determining the optimal structure under the same operating condition poses a significant challenge due to the strong coupling among MMAB ports. To address this issue, this article analyzes a dual-active bridge converter to investigate the steady-state characteristics of different structures, including the root-mean-square current and zero-voltage switching. By decomposing the MMAB converter into different transmission branches, the optimal combination structure of half-bridge and full-bridge are selected based on the branch powers, forming a simple and efficient TDM modulation technology. Finally, an experimental prototype of a four-port MMAB converter is established and tested. The results demonstrate that the proposed TDM can increase efficiency up to 19.09% compared to SPS, validating the correctness and effectiveness of the theoretical analysis.</description></item><item><title>Efficiency Enhancement for Alkaline Water Electrolyzers Directly Driven by Fluctuating PV Power</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10163951</link><description>Hydrogen production from photovoltaic arrays is a promising way to fully utilize the solar energy and to relieve consumption pressure of the power system. The low-cost and mature alkaline water electrolysis is suitable for large-scale hydrogen production. However, the low-load inefficiency of alkaline water electrolyzers greatly limits their operation range (usually 40%&#8211;100% of rated load). Hence, alkaline water electrolyzers are hard to follow the fluctuating photovoltaic power in full range. Focusing on this problem, this article analyzes the inefficiency mechanism of low-load alkaline water electrolyzers. It is found that through modifying the excitation electric field, the low-load performance of alkaline water electrolyzers can be greatly enhanced. Based on this, an optimal current pulsewidth modulation control strategy and the corresponding prototype converter are proposed to regulate alkaline water electrolyzers directly driven by photovoltaic arrays. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a 2 Nm3/h commercial alkaline water electrolyzer. Experimental results show that compared to the conventional dc power supply, 1) the maximum efficiency improvement can exceed two times, and 2) the alkaline water electrolyzer can follow the fluctuating photovoltaic power well.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Power Balancing Control Method for Energy Storage DC/DC Parallel Supply System With Low-Frequency Pulsed Load</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10197235</link><description>For the energy storage dc/dc parallel supply system with low-frequency pulsed load, an unbalanced dynamic power distribution problem will occur due to the inconsistent dc inertia of each converter, even resulting in a severe continuous low-frequency power oscillation. For this, a dynamic power balancing control method is proposed to reshape their dc inertia to be consistent and realize dynamic power balancing distribution among multiple converters without low-frequency power oscillation. Meanwhile, by analogy with the rotor swing equation of the synchronous machine, the power&#8211;voltage equivalent model with introducing the dc inertia parameter is established. Afterward, the essential mechanism of power oscillation with a low-frequency pulsed load is revealed. Furthermore, the principle of the proposed control method is clarified, and the control parameters are reasonably designed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control method is verified experimentally.</description></item><item><title>Model Predictive Control for Intersubmodule State-of-Charge Balancing in Cascaded H-Bridge Converter-Based Battery Energy Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10179256</link><description>In the operation of battery energy storage systems based on the cascaded H-bridge converter, it is beneficial to balance the state of charge of batteries in different submodules within the converter phase-arm. This is achieved by distributing the active power among the submodules. Although multiple methods have been proposed for this purpose, they face the challenge of rendering optimal active power distributions that maximize balancing speed while meeting power constraints in the battery energy storage system. To overcome this challenge, a model predictive control scheme is developed in this article. The proposed method is remarkably robust against parametric uncertainties (battery voltage, capacity, etc.), as evidenced by its ability to tolerate a substantial 50% uncertainty in the parameters, resulting in a mere 0.05% steady-state error. Furthermore, because the predictive control can be executed at a low frequency, the computational burden is comparable to other existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Event-Triggered Hybrid Anti-Islanding Protection Scheme Based on Q-Axis Disturbance Injection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10190124</link><description>Distributed generators are required to be integrated with sophisticated anti-islanding protection system (AIPS). However, most conventional AIPS fails to detect unintentional islanding event during perfectly matched loading conditions. To overcome this issue, in this article, a hybrid islanding detection algorithm has been proposed based on the rate of change of kinetic energy and root-mean-square value of absolute frequency deviation at the point of common coupling (PCC). The methodology presents a significant contribution prior to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of the disturbance injection mechanism through the q-axis current control loop of the grid-tied inverter. The method activates the disturbance signal injection mechanism only when an unintentional islanding event is suspected based on monitoring certain parameters at the PCC. This mechanism has been proposed to have zero nondetection zone, very fast operation, straightforward implementation, and significantly less impact on the power quality and stability of the power electronics system. The performance of the proposed method has been evaluated by conducting 200+ islanding and nonislanding case studies in simulation as well as an experimental platform. The proposed method is robust, accurate, and fast enough to detect an islanding event cleverly with a detection time as small as 120 ms.</description></item><item><title>A Current-Stress-Optimized Design Method for Dual Active Bridge Converters With Improved ZVS Capability Under Wide Output Voltage Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10185988</link><description>In dual active bridge (DAB) converters, the current stress seriously impacts the switching losses, and thus is tightly relevant to the efficiency.

The proposed approach utilizes a multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) technique to coordinate multiple control objectives. During the offline training stage, each DRL agent supervises a submodule (SM) of the DCSST, and outputs real-time actions based on the received states. Optimal phase-shift ratio combinations are learned using triple phase-shift modulation, and soft actor-critic (SAC) agents optimize the neural network parameters to enhance controller performance. The well-trained agents act as fast surrogate models that provide online control decisions for the DCSST, adapting to variant environmental conditions using only local SM information. The proposed distributed configuration improves redundancy and modularity, facilitating hot-swap experiments. Experimental results demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed multiagent SAC algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Impedance Specifications for Stability Design of Grid-Connected DC Distribution Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10195858</link><description>In practical application, it is more expected that the impedance-based stability criteria can provide intuitive system design guidance. However, the existing stability criteria for the complicated systems always aggregate all equipment/subsystem impedances. As a result, it is difficult to determine the port impedance specification that each equipment/subsystem should meet to ensure the system stability and a certain stability margin. In this article, the impedance specifications for the stability design of grid-connected dc distribution power systems are proposed. First, the stability conditions for impedance specification design are presented based on the dc-side subsystem impedance ratio criterion. On this basis, the ac-side admittance specifications and dc-side impedance specifications are proposed to ensure system stability. The former is used to constrain the ac-side admittance of voltage-source converter (VSC), and the latter restricts the dc-side impedance of grid-connected VSC and the input impedance of each converter-based load. The proposed impedance specifications are mainly related to grid impedance, transmission power, dc-bus voltage, two specific frequencies, and the required stability margin. As long as the proposed impedance specifications are met, the whole system must be stable and has sufficient stability margin. Finally, the case studies and experiments validate the proposed impedance specifications.</description></item><item><title>Power Balancing Strategy for Cascaded H-Bridge Inverter in a Grid-Connected Photovoltaic System Under Asymmetrical Operating Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10183673</link><description>Cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverter is a well-established technology for photovoltaic systems. Power imbalance occurs in the system because of the environmental dependence of photovoltaic modules, damage and dusting of panels, and the ageing effect. Subsequently, the power handled by H-bridge modules is unequal. As a result of power imbalance, the H-bridge modules carrying higher power are likely to get overmodulated, increasing the distortion in grid current. Due to this, reliability of the system is affected. The ability of existing harmonic compensation techniques to counter this issue is limited to a modulation index of $4/\pi$. In the view of this adversity, a voltage alteration method along with an optimization algorithm is proposed in this article to alleviate the power imbalance issue. The presented simulation and experimental results validate the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Design and Implementation of an Interleaved High Efficiency and High Voltage Gain Converter With Minimum Switch Count for Renewable Energy Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10173751</link><description>This article proposes a new nonisolated, interleaved, high step-up, soft-switching converter for renewable energy applications. The proposed converter is a boost topology designed to have a continuous input current with low ripple.

Using the proposed structure of the components to form the SDLCN, the converters A and B have continuous input current, better efficiency due to lower voltage and current stress, and minimum component count compared to some of the conventional dc&#8211;dc converters. To analyze the controllability of these converters, a switched linear system model is developed for the proposed converters. For better accuracy, the effect of parasitic elements is considered in the model. The controllability is validated by experiments on a 380 V, 50 kHz, and 200 W laboratory prototype. From the switched linear system model, a small-signal model and nominal transfer functions are obtained, and validated experimentally. Using the stability boundary locus technique and Kharitonov's first method, the PI controllers are designed. This technique selects a resilient performance zone for closed-loop converter operation by considering source and load-side disturbances. The developed PI controllers are implemented in the Xilinx System Generator and the closed-loop performance is validated experimentally.</description></item><item><title>Current-Referencing Electrified Synchronous Machine to Emulate a Synchronous Machine via a Voltage-Source Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10203000</link><description>The gradual decrease of the grid inertia in contemporary power grids is one of the significant problems caused by the expansion of renewable energy sources. As the inertia provided by the kinetic energy in the rotating mass of conventional fossil fuel-based synchronous generator decreases, the stability of the grid frequency deteriorates. Virtual synchronous machines (VSMs) that emulate the properties of a conventional synchronous machine through voltage-source inverters have gained attention as a solution to support the grid frequency. In this study, a current-referencing electrified synchronous machine (CURESYM) is proposed as a new control method that allows an inverter to have properties of a conventional synchronous machine. The CURESYM supports grid frequency through the inertial and damping responses. In addition, the CURESYM regulates the current in the synchronous reference frame according to the intended transient response, which is separately determined from the inertial and damping responses. A droop control was also implemented via current references independent of the damping response. The performance of the CURESYM is verified through experiments. Furthermore, the advantages of the CURESYM are examined by comparing with existing VSM topologies.</description></item><item><title>s-Domain Model of Single-Sampling and Multisampling DPWM DC&#8211;DC Converter Based on Discrete-Time Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10163961</link><description>This article proposes a general s-domain model of the single-sampling and multisampling digital pulsewidth modulation (DPWM) dc&#8211;dc converter. The proposed model has two main characteristics. First, the PWM delay is modeled by both time delay and state feedback rather than the time delay only. The time delay and state feedback are decided by the type of converters and carriers together. Therefore, the proposed model can explain the different effects of the PWM delay in different converters and carriers. Then, the time delay in the proposed model is decided by the switching frequency rather than the sampling frequency. Therefore, the multisampling cannot reduce the time delay of DPWM, which introduces ripples instead. For different converters and carriers, the influence of the ripple is varying. Therefore, based on the proposed model, the multisampling does not always improve the stability of converters, which is more in line with the actual situation. Compared with existing models, the proposed model reflects the complex effects of the PWM delay more accurately. To demonstrate these advantages intuitively, the stability of basic converters is judged by the proposed method, whose results are compared with existing models and experiment results.</description></item><item><title>Observer-Based Variable Impedance Control Using Moving Horizon Estimation for Robot Machining Thin-Walled Workpieces</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10188400</link><description>Adaptability is one of the most important survival and living abilities in nature and human society, which needs to perceive the environment and regulate self-behaviors.

No insect-scale jumping robots have yet demonstrated accurate trajectory following. Here, we propose a miniature origami omnidirectional jumping robot (Moobot) capable of high-accuracy feedback control of its jumping trajectory. The robot is based on a four-bar origami structure and shape memory alloys. Two strain gauges and an inertial measurement unit were used to control the jumping force and takeoff angle, respectively, and a reliable jumping mechanism and novel supporting leg were designed to improve jumping stability and trajectory accuracy. Unlike typical externally powered miniature robots, we constructed a 5 cm, 6 g untethered prototype. The error and the standard deviation of the jumping distances were both less than 1.5 cm; this represents a significant improvement relative to all previous insect-scale jumping robots. Furthermore, we integrated the yaw control and conducted omnidirectional jumping experiments, showing that Moobot was capable of accurately traversing different platforms from all directions.</description></item><item><title>An Energy-Based Anisotropic Vector Hysteresis Model for Rotational Electromagnetic Core Loss</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10188384</link><description>In this article, a model that describes the anisotropic behavior and core loss of electrical steel sheets over a wide range of rotational excitation is developed. Based on the definition of the effective field, the macroscopic anisotropy field is deduced from a weighted average of the magnetocrystalline energy of a single crystal. An anisotropic vector hysteresis model is then proposed by applying the effective field to the energy-based model. Experimental measurements are used to fit and validate the model. Either alternating or rotational measurements with a maximum magnetic flux density 1.55 T under 10 Hz are employed to fit the model parameters and the remaining set of measurements is used for validating the model accuracy. The results show that the model can naturally account for the drop in the rotational losses at high flux densities regardless of whether it is identified from alternating or rotational measurement data. The generality of the model is demonstrated through continuous angle results and modeling of another material.</description></item><item><title>Modulated FCS-MPC Based on Zero-Sequence Component Injection Algorithm and Vector Synthesis Algorithm With NPP Deviation Suppression</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10191041</link><description>Conventional finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) for three-phase three-level (3P-3L) converters suffers from cumbersome weighting factor design, variable switching frequency, and performance compromise in neutral point potential (NPP) and current.

However, influenced by noise and mutation information, vibration-based prediction methods remain in the preliminary phase for precise prediction of power transformer. To address this issue, a contrastive adversarial sparse model is proposed to predict the progress of power transformer faults in the early phases. First, a sparse transformer improves the feature extraction ability of the bidirectional recurrent gated network to reduce noise and extracts significant information from original signal. Then, the mutation information is suppressed by a contrastive adversarial method, based on which discrimination layer predicts the power transformer fault. Finally, to constrain the network, a contrastive loss based on feature matching is proposed to learn more extra information distinct from sparse transforms. Datasets are collected using wireless vibration sensors from a 10-kV real power transformer. Under an identical parameter setting, experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms comparison algorithms in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient, symmetric mean absolute percentage error, and mean absolute error. Especially, the RMSE of the proposed model is 0.0242, exceeding the performance of the conventional model in power transformer fault prediction.</description></item><item><title>Leak Detection for Natural Gas Gathering Pipelines Under Multiple Operating Conditions Using RP-1dConvLSTM-AE and Multimodel Decision</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10190156</link><description>Real-time leak detection for natural gas gathering pipelines is critical to guarantee the safe transportation of energy in the source of production. Since leak samples are scarce in real pipelines, modeling healthy data becomes one of the mainstream solutions. However, due to the lack of prior knowledge of leaks, more effective feature learning for multivariate time series (MTS) of pipeline data is a prerequisite for reliable leak detection. Moreover, in-service gathering pipelines usually involve multiple operating conditions (MOCs), where the leak characteristics of MOCs could be significantly different. This poses a serious challenge to accurate leak detection. To address the abovementioned problems, we propose a hybrid leak detection method for gathering pipelines under MOCs. First, anomaly processing and long&#8211;short sequence construction are designed to provide high-quality data for leak detection. Then, reconstruction- and prediction-one-dimensional convolutional long short-term memory autoencoder is proposed to enhance the feature learning for MTS. Based on the learned features, a multimodel decision scheme with one-class support vector machine is developed to deal with leak detection under MOCs. Finally, experimental results on supervisory control and data acquisition data obtained from real-world natural gas gathering pipelines demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Combined Model-Based and Data-Driven Fault Diagnosis Scheme for Lithium-Ion Batteries</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10203013</link><description>Diagnosing potential faults is of great importance to ensure reliability of battery management systems. This is because a current or voltage sensor fault often results in an inaccurate state-of-charge estimate. A temperature sensor fault will cause abnormal thermal management. A battery internal resistance (BIR) fault can lead to an increase in energy and power losses, capacity fading, and further degradation of health. In addition, frequent data transmission to fault diagnosis unit will cause a great waste of communication resources. To this end, a combined model-based and data-driven fault diagnosis scheme for lithium-ion batteries is proposed in this article. First, a model-based fault estimation method with sliding mode observer is developed to estimate the voltage, current, and temperature sensor faults. By integrating an adaptive event-triggered mechanism, the communication resource costs are alleviated. Second, a data-driven gap metric approach is presented to detect the BIR fault. By combining the model-based and data-driven strategies, the fault diagnosis logic is put forward to isolate the BIR fault.

However, most studies on securing CPPS rarely considered resource constraints, resulting in the unsatisfactory performance of security solutions in practical applications. To gain insight into attack behavior in realistic scenarios, this article fully develops the concept of load redistribution (LR) attacks and designs an intelligent version that considers both concealment property and resource limitation. Then, aiming to develop an effective countermeasure, this article provides a novel attack detection method based on power load pattern learning, which consists of a power load predictor and subsequent attack detector, to determine the existence of intelligent LR attacks. Specifically, a multichannel power load predictor based on the SARIMAX model is proposed to capture both temporal and spatial correlations of power load data for accurate prediction. Using augmented features, a dictionary-learning-based attack detector that can handle the class imbalance problem by unsupervised learning is capable to detect the intelligent LR attacks. Finally, experiments on numerical simulation and the CPPS-HITL platform are conducted to verify the effectiveness and practical availability of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive-Optimization-Based Digital Simulation Database for Nonuniform Aging Diagnosis of Transformer Insulation System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10196011</link><description>The trend toward intellectualization is pervasive in the field of power equipment fault diagnosis. However, due to the sample database's limitations, intelligent diagnosis of transformer insulation aging states near the internal hotspot regions remains a challenge. To address this issue, an optimization-design-based simulation model is proposed for the development of a frequency domain spectroscopy (FDS) database for diagnosing nonuniform aging states of power transformer. The simulation model is developed in the current work using distributed relaxation circuits and fast Fourier transforms, and the electric parameters used are identified using adaptive iteration particle swarm optimization. Finally, verification established that the extended simulation model was capable of simulating the FDS of a system with nonuniformly assigned aging states. In this regard, the contribution will aid in the establishment of a trustworthy FDS database for the purpose of advancing intelligent diagnosis of the aging state of transformer oil&#8211;paper insulation at hotspots.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Multiband Rectifier System for Stabilized Wireless Energy Harvesting at Flexible Distances and Dynamic Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10209271</link><description>The unpredictable propagation of ambient radio frequency (RF) waves may cause significant randomness in power densities against the propagation distance, time, and locations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel adaptive rectifier system with stabilized output dc power against dynamic power densities. A novel detection circuit is designed to identify the frequency range and receiving power level. Then the received RF power is amplified to the saturated level by referring to the detected frequency and power information for adaptive dc biasing control for an integrated power amplifier. Doing so makes the input power to the rectifier constant regardless of the power and frequency variations. The experimentally validated system can output a stabilized power under the time-varying power range of &#8722;10 to 0 dBm and location varying within 0.5 m at 1.8, 2.1, and 2.6 GHz. Compared with conventional designs, this system has realized stabilized and enhanced conversion efficiency (61% at 1.8 GHz, 64% at 2.1 GHz, and 53% at 2.6 GHz) and therefore could be adopted for wireless powering distributed sensors and Internet of Thing (IoT) devices continuously and steadily at flexible conditions.</description></item><item><title>Mitigating the Impact of Photovoltaic Power Ramps on Intraday Economic Dispatch Using Reinforcement Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10080978</link><description>The rapid growth of large-scale photovoltaic (PV) power generation has received considerable attention, where a major challenge is that PV power ramp events can adversely affect the operations of integrated power systems. Therefore, effective forecast and dispatch methodologies are critical. However, it is relatively difficult to predict an accurate PV power ramp rate. Another issue is that, since forecast and dispatch are typically considered in research as two separate problems, forecast modeling does not involve the knowledge of dispatch. In this case, unbiased PV forecast is unpractical for PV ramp events, increasing their negative effects. Besides, such a unified optimization with both forecast and dispatch cannot be solved easily since the problem is strongly nonlinear. Motivated by these challenges, a reinforcement forecasting framework is proposed for intraday economic dispatch in this study. First, the PV power ramp rate forecasting is categorized into two tasks of multi-classification and class expectation prediction, where the class continuity is considered in order to improve the forecast distribution. Next, a reinforcement learning agent is established for connecting PV forecast and system dispatch, which adjusts PV power generation schedules based on real-time system feedbacks. Comparative studies are conducted on an intraday system dispatch environment with energy storage. The results of the studies indicate that the proposed framework can provide higher economic benefits than those under benchmark schemes.</description></item><item><title>Hardware in the Loop Wave Energy Converter Control Under Control Faults and Model Mismatch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122770</link><description>Ocean wave energy conversion is operated in a challenging environment featuring massive and impulsive stresses and is subjected to large amounts of biofouling and marine growth. As most wave energy converter technologies are off-shore, operation, maintenance, and repair costs may be significant. Therefore, any cost-effective control and operation of Wave Energy Converters (WECs) must be robust to faults and changes in the operational environment. This paper presents a Bayesian policy gradient-based WEC control approach that is responsive and adaptive to faults in controller feedback, controller actuation, and changes in the plant model. The controller is tested via Hardware in the Loop real-time testbed. The results show that the proposed control is capable of adapting its policy to the loss of information from one or two sensors and recovering nearly full power operation. In the case where sensor loss occurs, after the loss of plate excitation force estimation and displacement sensors, the power decreases to 215.2 kW from 252.7 kW before recovering to 238.4 kW mean power over 20 minutes. Moreover, the Bayesian RL-based control model proves its adaptability by compensating a large portion of power loss due to PTO failures and rapid changes to the dynamic system because of non-destructive damage to the float structure.</description></item><item><title>Grid Forming Fast Frequency Response for PMSG-Based Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10091242</link><description>Electric power systems are undergoing a rapid transition from fuel-based generation using synchronous generators to renewable generation interfaced by power electronics. In this context, a key challenge is using renewable generation with limited controllability to contribute to power system stability. In this work, we investigate grid-forming control of permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) wind turbines. The proposed control and curtailment strategy supports the entire spectrum of standard functions of grid-following (e.g. maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and grid-forming control (e.g., primary frequency control) without explicit mode switching. A detailed case study is used to compare the performance of the proposed control at operating points corresponding to MPPT and frequency control with standard grid-forming and grid-following controls. The results demonstrate that (i) the proposed energy balancing grid forming control is self-synchronizing in MPPT mode, (ii) the (limited) energy storage and controllability of wind turbines can be adequately utilized to provide grid support, and (ii) the proposed control exhibits good performance under variable wind speeds and does not result in a significant increase of wind turbine fatigue loads.</description></item><item><title>A Coordinated Optimal Operation of a Grid-Connected Wind-Solar Microgrid Incorporating Hybrid Energy Storage Management Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10089547</link><description>The hybrid-energy storage systems (ESSs) are promising eco-friendly power converter devices used in a wide range of applications. However, their insufficient lifespan is one of the key issues by hindering their large-scale commercial application. In order to extend the lifespan of the hybrid-ESSs, the cost functions proposed in this paper include the degradation of the hydrogen devices and the battery. Indeed, this paper aims to develop a sophisticated model predictive control strategy for a grid-connected wind and solar microgrid, which includes a hydrogen-ESS, a battery-ESS, and the interaction with external consumers, e.g., battery/fuel cell electric vehicles. The integrated system requires the management of its energy production in different forms, i.e., the electric and the hydrogen ones. The proposed strategy consists of the economical and operating costs of the hybrid-ESSs, the degradation issues, and the physical and dynamic constraints of the system. The mixed-logic dynamic framework is required to model the operating modes of the hybrid-ESSs and the switches between them. The effectiveness of the controller is analyzed by numerical simulations which are conducted using solar and wind generation profiles of solar panels and wind farms located in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Such simulations, indeed, show that the proposed strategy appropriately manages the plant by fulfilling constraints and energy requests while reducing device costs and increasing battery life.</description></item><item><title>Probabilistic Prognosis of Wind Turbine Faults With Feature Selection and Confidence Calibration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10114598</link><description>With the ever-increasing expansion of the installed capacity of wind power generation, reliable condition monitoring for wind turbines (WTs) has become increasingly important. To this end, this paper proposes a probabilistic WT fault prognosis (WTFP) scheme to output reliable fault probabilities in addition to class predictions. First, a multivariate time series (MTS) based mutual information estimator (MIE) is developed to integrate with combinational optimization, selecting features that contain more beneficial temporal data patterns for WTFP. Then, a multi-fault prognosis model for WTs is trained based on the selected features and MTS learning network. Next, a confidence calibration (CC) post-processing module is appended to re-construct the mapping relation between network logits and posterior probabilities by minimizing negative log-likelihood, thereby calibrating confidence estimates to approximate the true correctness likelihood as much as possible while keeping the high accuracy of the trained MTS learning network. These components finally drive a comprehensive WTFP model. Test results on the field data of WT verify the efficacy of MTS-based MIE and CC, and show that the proposed probabilistic WTFP scheme can provide more reliable probability estimates, contributing to better decision-making.</description></item><item><title>On Power Control of Grid-Forming Converters: Modeling, Controllability, and Full-State Feedback Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10111054</link><description>The popular single-input single-output control structures and classic design methods (e.g., root locus analysis) for the power control of grid-forming converters have limitations in applying to different line characteristics and providing favorable performance. This paper studies the grid-forming converter power loops from the perspective of multi-input multi-output systems. First, the error dynamics associated with power control loops (error-based state-space model) are derived while taking into account the natural dynamical coupling terms of the power converter models. Thereafter, the controllability Gramian of the grid-forming converter power loops is studied. Last, a full-state feedback control design using only the local measurements is applied. By this way, the eigenvalues of the system can be arbitrarily placed in the timescale of power loops based on predefined time-domain specifications. A step-by-step construction and design procedure of the power control of grid-forming converters is also given. The analysis and proposed method are verified by experimental results and system-level simulation comparisons in Matlab/Simulink.</description></item><item><title>Incentivizing Prosumer Voltage Regulation for Unbalanced Radial Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10121692</link><description>Voltage regulation in distribution networks is becoming extremely challenging with the increased penetration of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) generation. Many recent studies demonstrate the effectiveness of power control of smart inverters for voltage regulation purposes. However, how to fully incentivize demand-side participation in voltage regulation is yet to be answered. This article seeks to address this challenge by designing a comprehensive voltage regulation incentive scheme for customers to control their smart inverters in unbalanced radial distribution networks. A three-phase residential network from a Distributed Network Service Provider (DNSP) in Australia is modelled in the open-source distribution system simulator OpenDSS with real load and PV data, and an control algorithm to optimize the households' smart inverters in a distributed fashion is developed using game theory. The proposed algorithm is implemented in MATLAB, which is guaranteed to approach the optimal solution. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves better voltage regulation performance as the widely adopted localized voltage-var droop control method and, at the same time, with lower costs to the prosumers.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Carbon Footprint Management of Electric Vehicles and Emission Abatement in Electricity Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122732</link><description>Electric vehicles (EVs) are believed to play an important role in mitigating carbon emissions in the transportation sector. However, EVs may still cause carbon emissions in the power sector if they are charged by electricity generated from burning fossil fuels like coal. Researchers have focused on managing emissions on the power generation sector. However, the underlying driver of carbon emissions is the demand of consumers. Given this background, a probabilistic carbon footprint management strategy is proposed for EVs in this paper. First, the conventional deterministic carbon emission flow model is extended to a probabilistic one (PCEF) to track the carbon footprint of EVs considering various kinds of uncertainties based on non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) and the two-point estimation method (2PEM). Second, a stochastic chance-constrained carbon footprint management model for EV charging is presented to address the carbon obligation allocation of EVs from the perspective of consumption and provide a technical basis for demand-driven stimulation to reduce carbon emissions. Third, an efficient method is proposed to solve the formulated chance-constrained problem based on nonparametric Bayesian modeling and inference. The proposed model and method are demonstrated by the IEEE 39-bus power system. The feasibility of the proposed PCEF model is validated. According to simulation results, the computation speed of the proposed PCEF model is enhanced from 3456.8 seconds to 1341.3 seconds compared with the Monte Carlo simulation by sacrificing the accuracy within 2%. Besides, the proposed emission control strategy can attain a better emission control performance compared with the other state-of-art methods.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Modeling of Microgrid Transient Dynamics Through Modularized Sparse Identification</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10115474</link><description>Modularized sparse identification (M-SINDy) is developed in this paper for effective data-driven modeling of the nonlinear transient dynamics of microgrid systems. The high penetration of power-electronic interfaces makes microgrids highly susceptible to disturbances, causing severe transients, especially in the islanded mode. The M-SINDy method realizes distributed discovery of nonlinear dynamics by partitioning a higher-order microgrid system into multiple subsystems and introducing pseudo-states to represent the impact of neighboring subsystems. This specific property of the proposed algorithm is found to be very useful while working with re-configurable and scalable microgrids. The governing equations of the subsystems are identified through regression by mapping the nonlinear system's data to a linear system in a large functional space. The effectiveness of the M-SINDy method is tested and validated through numerical examples and comparisons with other existing identification models on a typical islanded microgrid. The method can simultaneously compute the governing equations of different subsystems and is examined to be robust to measurement noises and partial observations. This paper highlights the advances of data science in providing a potent tool for modeling and analyzing higher-order nonlinear microgrid systems. Dynamic discovery of system transients from measurements can be beneficial for designing control strategies that improve the overall microgrid stability and reliability.</description></item><item><title>Encoding Carbon Emission Flow in Energy Management: A Compact Constraint Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122721</link><description>Decarbonizing the energy supply is essential and urgent to mitigate the increasingly visible climate change. Its basis is identifying emission responsibility during power allocation by the carbon emission flow (CEF) model. However, the main challenge of CEF application is the intractable nonlinear relationship between carbon emission and power allocation. So this article leverages the high approximation capability and the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) representability of the deep neural networks to tackle the complex CEF model in carbon-electricity coordinated optimization. The compact constraint learning approach is proposed to learn the mapping from power injection to bus emission with sparse neural networks (SNNs). Then the trained SNNs are transformed equivalently as MILP constraints in the downstream optimization. In light of the &#8220;high emission with high price&#8221; principle, the blocked carbon price mechanism is designed to price emissions from the demand side. Based on the constraint learning and mechanism design, this article proposes the carbon-aware energy management model in the tractable MILP form to unlock the carbon reduction potential from the demand side. The case study verifies the approximation accuracy and sparsity of SNN with fewer parameters for accelerating optimization solution and reduction effectiveness of demand-side capability for mitigating emission.</description></item><item><title>An Improved PSO-Based MPPT Technique Using Stability and Steady State Analyses Under Partial Shading Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122737</link><description>Partial shading (PS) conditions create challenging issues for the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms in photovoltaic (PV) systems such as getting stuck in the local maximum power points (LMPP), slow tracking time and fluctuations in the generated power during tracking the global maximum power point (GMPP). To address these issues, this article brings contributions by proposing an improved PSO-based MPPT technique tailored for PS conditions. First, to highlight the weakness of the traditional PSO-MPPT technique, its stability and steady state behavior in the PS conditions is analyzed in depth. Second, the required criteria to achieve a stable response are obtained. Finally, a novel technique to estimate the convex area of the power versus voltage (P-V) curve is presented where the GMPP is located using two voltage boundaries. The performance of the proposed MPPT technique is experimentally validated. The results highlight the capabilities of the proposed technique in finding the GMPP with a rapid convergence and small fluctuations. The proposed MPPT is applicable to most PV inverters under any PS conditions.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Dimensional Economy-Durability Optimization Method for Integrated Energy and Transportation System of Net-Zero Energy Buildings</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10123098</link><description>With the increasing penetration of renewable energy and zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), the integrated energy and transportation system (IETS) is considered a promising solution for achieving net-zero energy buildings (NZEBs). However, the tight coupling and the conflict of interests between the transportation and energy systems increase the difficulty of collaborative operation scheduling. Therefore, this article proposes a multi-dimensional economy-durability (MDED) optimization method for IETS of NZEBs. The multidimensionality includes multiple subjects of energy, transportation, and IETS, and multiple time scales of day-ahead and intraday. In the day-ahead stage, the comprehensive cost-optimal scheduling strategy with joint intelligent parking lot (IPL) is constructed for the collaborative operation of IETS. In the intraday stage, two scheduling strategies are applied to satisfy the operation of the transportation and energy systems, respectively. For the transportation system, a coordinated scheduling strategy based on charging service satisfaction (CSS) is presented to coordinate ZEVs demands with diverse vehicle types and service manners. And for the energy system, a rolling optimization strategy based on a dynamic economy-health matrix (DEHM) is designed to track the day-ahead scheduling plan. The results indicate that the proposed method resolves the conflict between the charging needs and the comprehensive cost of the IETS system. In addition, the economic potential and coordination capability of fast charging services in IETS coordinated scheduling are verified. Finally, the proposed DEHM has significant advantages for the system cost and health compared to the conventional weighting matrix.</description></item><item><title>An Analytical Polytope Approximation Aggregation of Electric Vehicles Considering Uncertainty for the Day-Ahead Distribution Network Dispatching</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10124003</link><description>The integration of large-scale heterogeneous electric vehicles (EVs) into the distribution network increases the system management complexity significantly. Due to the flexible charging/discharging operation and shiftable energy consumption during the parking time, EVs possess a great dispatching potential for the distribution network. This article develops an analytical polytope approximation (APA) aggregation model to efficiently depict the dispatchable regions of large-scale EVs with uncertainties and proposes a bilevel cooperative optimization approach for EV aggregators to participate in the distribution network day-ahead optimal scheduling. Uncertainties of EVs are modeled by chance constraints with different confidence levels to accommodate various regulatory requirements. The proposed approach can obtain large-scale EVs dispatchable capabilities with minimum flexibility loss and realize the regulation command disaggregation without violations. Numerical case studies are conducted on IEEE 33-bus and 141-bus distribution networks based on real data sets, which show that the proposed approach outperforms other state-of-art methods in terms of low operation flexibility conservatism, high system economics, and computational efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Allocation of Dynamic Operating Envelopes in Distribution Networks: Technical and Equitable Perspectives</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10123018</link><description>A Dynamic Operating Envelope (DOE) specifies the available capacity to import/export power for Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) or connection points of a distribution network in a time interval without violating its physical and operational constraints. This article proposes a two-stage, top-down approach to allocate DOEs in MV-LV (medium voltage-low voltage) integrated distribution networks. In the first stage, Distribution System State Estimation (DSSE) and Capacity Constrained State Optimisation (CCSO) techniques are employed to allocate DOEs at transformer connection points. Using network data from available metering infrastructure, DSSE estimates the current operational state of the network, whereas CCSO facilitates the DOE allocations at transformer connection points considering technical, soft-equitable and equitable perspectives. In the second stage, the allocated DOEs, containing available aggregate export/import power, are distributed among DERs of LV networks ensuring network integrity. Real-world data of an Australian MV-LV network is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approach. Test results show that technical perspective can offer maximum allocated export/import power, whereas, minimum disparity of allocated power among different connection-points is attained for equitable perspective. Further, insightful performance studies of DOE and existing fixed export policies are conducted considering the condition of present as well as future power systems expecting substantial proliferations of renewables.</description></item><item><title>Optimal HVAC Energy and Regulation Reserve Scheduling in Power Markets</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10132017</link><description>This paper considers the optimal scheduling of the hourly energy consumed and regulation reserve capacity offered by a Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) system participating in a day-ahead electricity market. We formulate an Integrated hourly energy and regulation reserve Scheduling and Deployment (ISD) problem that optimizes the hourly costs and benefits resulting from the power consumed, the regulation reserve capacity offered, the occupant thermal comfort utility, and the expected Intra-Hour Costs (IHCs) due to HVAC's imperfect tracking of the regulation signal broadcasted by the Independent System Operator every few seconds. Addition of the IHCs to the objective function is the major innovation of this paper. It enables optimal HVAC scheduling to internalize expected regulation signal tracking error cost traded-off against incremental occupant thermal discomfort that may result from perfect tracking. The cost causation circle closes by noting that a high hourly regulation reserve offer may result in higher expected IHCs by increasing the associated tracking error and the incremental occupant discomfort. The paper's innovation is achieved by (i) estimating an analytic function of the hourly HVAC scheduling decision and state variables that approximates the expected IHCs, and (ii) including this exogenously estimated analytic function in the objective of the hourly ISD optimization problem. Non-convexities introduced to the optimization problem resulting from high fidelity HVAC model and the inclusion of the expected IHCs, are addressed efficiently through piecewise convex relaxations that provide tight optimality bounds. Extensive numerical results are provided to demonstrate the applicability and performance of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>A Rule-Based Bionic Energy Management System for Grid-Connected Community Microgrid Using Peer-to-Peer Trading With Rapid Settlement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10129832</link><description>This article applies the bionics theory to the design of energy management system (EMS) for the grid-connected community microgrid. Drawing lessons from the humoral regulation mechanism, a rule-based bionic EMS is proposed for the grid-connected community microgrid, with the aim of keeping the supply-demand level of the system approaching self-sufficiency in real time, so as to reduce the dependence of the community microgrid on the utility grid and improve the local utilization of distributed generations in the community microgrid. To realize the bionic EMS, a novel peer-to-peer trading model with rapid settlement is proposed. Fuzzy control is used to cope with the complex real-time control issue, and the basic principles of the adopted fuzzy controller are to maintain the supply-demand ratio close to 1 and extend battery life. Simulation results demonstrate that the bionic EMS has the ability to keep the real-time supply-demand level of the grid-connected community microgrid approaching self-sufficiency. Compared with the optimization-based EMS, the bionic EMS has excellent real-time performance and good robustness, and does not rely on prediction data. Experimental results on the testbed are consistent with the simulation results and validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the bionic EMS in the practical applications.</description></item><item><title>Target Voltage Iterations Based Global Flexible Power Point Tracking Algorithm Under Partial Shading Photovoltaic Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10144415</link><description>Global flexible power point tracking (GFPPT) is proposed to realize the flexible power point tracking (FPPT) of photovoltaic systems under partial shading conditions (PSC). Because the working process of GFPPT is similar to global power point tracking (GMPPT), the performance of GFPPT can be improved by applying the existing advanced GMPPT algorithm. However, the improvement of GFPPT is limited while applying the existing advanced GMPPT algorithm directly. So, a target-voltage-iterations (TVI) based GFPPT algorithm is proposed in this article to further increase the performance of GFPPT during PSC. Compared with the advanced GFPPT algorithms, the proposed TVI-based GFPPT algorithm shows the advantages of fast-tracking speed and little energy difference during the tracking by skipping the voltage section without the reference power. Followed by theoretical analysis, the simulation and experimental evaluation validate the claimed advantages of the proposed TVI-based GFPPT algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Voltage Control and Renewable Accommodation Using Spatial-Temporal Graph Information</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10143277</link><description>Renewable energy resources (RERs) have been increasingly integrated into distribution networks (DNs) for decarbonization. However, the variable nature of RERs introduces uncertainties to DNs, frequently resulting in voltage fluctuations that threaten system security and hamper the further adoption of RERs. To incentivize more RER penetration, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based strategy to dynamically balance the trade-off between voltage fluctuation control and renewable accommodation. To further extract multi-time-scale spatial-temporal (ST) graphical information of a DN, our strategy draws on a multi-grained attention-based spatial-temporal graph convolution network (MG-ASTGCN), consisting of ST attention mechanism and ST convolution to explore the node correlations in the spatial and temporal views. The continuous decision-making process of balancing such a trade-off can be modeled as a Markov decision process optimized by the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm with the help of the derived ST information. We validate our strategy on the modified IEEE 33, 69, and 118-bus radial distribution systems, with outcomes significantly outperforming the optimization-based benchmarks. Simulations also reveal that our developed MG-ASTGCN can to a great extent accelerate the convergence speed of DDPG and improve its performance in stabilizing node voltage in an RER-rich DN. Moreover, our method improves the DN's robustness in the presence of generator failures.</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid Model for Long-Term Wind Power Forecasting Utilizing NWP Subsequence Correction and Multi-Scale Deep Learning Regression Methods</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10144668</link><description>The accuracy of long-term wind power forecasting (WPF) is crucial for the efficient operation of grid systems. However, wind power generation is highly stochastic and intermittent due to the influence of weather, which makes long-term WPF less effective. Numerical weather prediction (NWP) data contains valuable weather forecast information, which can mitigate the negative effects of stochastic weather fluctuations on WPF. However, the accuracy of NWP data decreases over time, and multiple NWP data can have redundancy and errors that make it challenging to extract valid information. Reducing the variety and errors in NWP data and using more effective information extraction methods are essential for improving long-term WPF performance. In this article, we propose a novel long-term WPF hybrid model that corrects NWP wind speed and uses multi-scale deep learning regression prediction to exclude excessive NWP data. We use only the corrected NWP wind speed data to establish a nonlinear mapping relationship with actual power data. The validation case study shows that our proposed model reduces the mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) by 65.0% and 43.8%, respectively, compared to the current state-of-the-art time series forecasting model in a seven-day forecasting scenario.</description></item><item><title>An Optimal Wind Farm Operation Strategy for the Provision of Frequency Containment Reserve Incorporating Active Wake Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10158926</link><description>This study proposes a novel operation strategy for wind farms' optimal Frequency Containment Reserve (FCR) provision that simultaneously distributes FCR and optimally controls wake formation. The power reserve allocation is dynamically decided at the wind farm supervisory control level, considering the intermittent wind power and direction, grid frequency stochasticity, and the aerodynamic complexity of the wake. A two-stage stochastic programming approach supports decision-making for an optimal contribution to day-ahead energy/FCR markets considering sub-hourly wind power and grid frequency uncertainty. Moreover, a novel method is used to reduce the computational complexity by employing a data-driven surrogate model of wake formation in the optimizer. This surrogate model consists of a neural network trained on the Gauss-Curl-Hybrid wake model in FLORIS. This deep learning approach allows fast estimation of the wake control parameters, i.e., the optimal yaw angles and axial induction factors. Then, a coevolutionary-based multi-objective particle swarm optimization searches for the optimal deloading of the WTs and maximizes the total power production and kinetic energy while minimizing wake. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on the C-Power wind farm layout in the North Sea. Simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the wind farm's overall performance for different operational conditions.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Frequency Regulation of Multi-Terminal HVDC-Linked Grids With Deloaded Offshore Wind Farms Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10145805</link><description>This paper proposes a new decentralized strategy for optimal grid frequency regulation (GFR) in an interconnected power system, where onshore grids and offshore wind farms (OWFs) are linked using a multi-terminal high-voltage direct-current (MTDC) system. In the proposed strategy, grid- and OWF-side optimal controllers are developed to coordinate the operations of synchronous generators and the MTDC converter, and the OWF and the MTDC converter, respectively, thus achieving optimal generator power and deloaded OWF power sharing of the interconnected grids and minimizing frequency deviations in each grid. Full-order dynamic models of an MTDC-linked grid and an OWF are implemented, and given each dynamic model, grid- and OWF-side decentralized linear quadratic Gaussian regulators are designed for optimal GFR of the MTDC-linked grids and supporting GFR through optimal deloading operation of the OWFs, respectively. Eigenvalue analyses are conducted with a focus on the effects of system parameter uncertainties and communication time delays. Comparative case studies are also performed to verify that the proposed strategy improves the effectiveness and stability of real-time GFR in MTDC-linked grids under various conditions.</description></item><item><title>A Coordinated Consensus Control Strategy for Distributed Battery Energy Storages Considering Different Frequency Control Demands</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10146450</link><description>With the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs), ensuring frequency stability is becoming urgent for the power system. The distributed battery energy storage systems (DBESs) is one of the promising solutions to this problem. In this paper, a consensus control-based strategy is proposed for coordinating the DBESs to participate in the frequency regulation. Firstly, the system frequency response (SFR) model with the DBESs is introduced, and different frequency control demands are analyzed in detail, based on which the designing principles of the strategy are elaborated. Then, a revised dead band of frequency response is proposed to improve the frequency control performance under severer and more frequent RESs power fluctuation, reduce the possibility of frequency variation crossing the thresholds, and fully utilizes the DBESs&#8217; frequency regulation capability. Further, a developed consensus strategy derived from droop control is proposed, which enables the DBESs to participate in different frequency control demands simultaneously. The proposed strategy can prolong the service time when DBESs involved in frequency control as an aggregator, avoid unexpected energy exhaustion during frequency regulation, and reduce the frequency variation. The performance of the proposed control strategy is validated by the simulation cases with different operating scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Physics-Aware Degradation Model of Lithium-ion Battery Energy Storage for Techno-Economic Studies in Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10154547</link><description>Power system operation and planning decisions for lithium-ion battery energy storage systems are mainly derived using their simplified linear models. While these models are computationally simple, they have limitations in how they estimate battery degradation, either using the energy throughput or the Rainflow method. This article proposes a hybrid approach for lithium-ion battery system modeling suitable for use in power system studies that enhances representation of battery degradation at a reasonable computational cost. The proposed hybrid model combines a physics-based model for improved degradation estimates with a simple and linear energy reservoir model commonly used to represent a battery storage system. The advantage of constructing the battery model with this vision is that it allows its smooth integration into the mixed-integer optimization frameworks. The proposed model is evaluated using both power- and energy-based use cases from the electrical grid. The simulations demonstrate that degradation could be reduced by 45% compared to other modeling strategies while generating the same level of operation profits. The net result of using the proposed hybrid model could be an extended lifespan through better informed planning and operating decisions for energy storage assets.</description></item><item><title>A Novel ANN-Based GMPPT Method for PV Systems Under Complex Partial Shading Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10148801</link><description>In this article, a new two-stage global maximum power point tracking (GMPPT) algorithm based on artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed. The novel ANN architecture is presented first, which requires fewer sampling points than other ANN-based GMPPT approaches, thereby reducing both the tracking time and power loss involved in the tracking. In addition, it does not require costly illuminance or temperature sensors and can be realized using a low-cost digital signal controller. According to the simulation results, the proposed method has the best performance among all methods in terms of tracking speed, tracking accuracy, and tracking loss for all the three tested shading patterns (SPs). The simulated results of 252 SPs show that the performance indexes (PIs) of the proposed method are the best among all the compared methods, which are: the average tracking time 0.18 seconds, average power loss 0.01 W. In addition, the proposed method can correctly predict the GMPP positions of all 252 SPs. Furthermore, the PIs of the proposed method are also the best among all the compared methods according to the experimental results, which are: the tracking speed 0.21 seconds, tracking accuracy 99.66%, and tracking loss 12.58 W, all the above are average values.</description></item><item><title>Frequency Reserve Allocation of Large-Scale RES Considering Decision-Dependent Uncertainties</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10147366</link><description>The proliferation of renewable energy sources (RES) imposes significant challenges on system frequency dynamics. By synthetic inertia and droop control, RES units can provide fast response to sudden frequency events. However, the reserved power and available power of RES units are featured as decision-dependent uncertainties (DDUs), posing challenges to both post-contingency frequency security and system balancing under normal conditions. This article develops a frequency-constrained unit commitment and reserve allocation (FC-UC&amp;amp;RA) model that co-optimizes the reserve allocation and energy dispatch among synchronous generators and RES units. An analytic frequency dynamic model is embedded in the FC-UC&amp;amp;RA problem to accurately assess the system's frequency performance under heterogeneous responses of synchronous and inverter-based units with limited reserve deliveries. To cope with the DDUs stemming from RES generation capabilities scheduled as reserves, a robust FC-UC&amp;amp;RA model is proposed and an adaptive column and constraint generation (C&amp;amp;CG) algorithm is developed to solve the DDU-integrated robust optimization. Comparative case studies verify the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed model and solution approach.</description></item><item><title>Data-Based Control Synthesis and Performance Assessment for Moored Wave Energy Conversion Systems: The PeWEC Case</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10149212</link><description>With a model-based control strategy, the effectiveness of the associated control action depends on the availability of a representative control-oriented model. In the case of floating offshore wave energy converters (WECs), the device response depends upon the interaction between mooring system, any mechanical parts, and the hydrodynamics of the floating body. This study proposes an approach to synthesise WEC controllers under the effect of mooring forces building a representative data-based linear model able to include any relevant dynamics. Moreover, the procedure is tested on the moored pendulum wave energy converter (PeWEC) by means of a high-fidelity mooring solver, OrcaFlex (OF). In particular, the control action is computed with and without knowledge of the mooring influence, in order to analyse and elucidate the effect of the station-keeping system on the harvested energy. The performance assessment of the device is achieved by evaluating device power on the resource scatter characterising Pantelleria, Italy. The results show the relevance of the mooring dynamics on the device response and final set of control parameters and, hence, a significant influence of the station-keeping system on control synthesis and extracted mechanical power.</description></item><item><title>Coordinated Power Smoothing Control Strategy of Multi-Wind Turbines and Energy Storage Systems in Wind Farm Based on MADRL</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10158038</link><description>The randomness and volatility of wind power greatly affect the safety and economy of the power systems, and the wake effect of the wind farm aggravates the wind energy loss and the wind power fluctuation. Taking into consideration the wake effect of the wind farm, a new coordinated wind power smoothing control strategy for multi-wind turbines (M-WT) and energy storage systems (ESS) is proposed. The proposed method is based on a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL), in which the relationship between output power and wake effect is firstly analyzed, and a power smoothing control model of the M-WT and ESS is established. MADRL is then introduced to optimize the power control of M-WT and ESS. In order to further increase the learning and training efficiency, an improved MADRL algorithm based on the partitioned experience buffer and prioritized experience replay is proposed, where the experience buffer is divided into positive, negative, and neutral experiences, and the experiences are sampled according to experience priority. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified on the SimWindFarm platform. The results show that the proposed control strategy can maximize the economic benefits while further smoothing wind power fluctuations and increasing power generation.</description></item><item><title>Local Energy Market Design for Power- and Hydrogen-Based Microgrids Considering a Hybrid Uncertainty Controlling Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10159501</link><description>Despite the significant merits of plugin electric vehicles (PEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), their enormous rise has posed serious challenges in terms of energy supply. This research proposes a sustainable energy platform to integrate PEVs and FCEVs under the concept of microgrid (MG) with power and green hydrogen as energy carriers, so-called integrated power, and hydrogen MG (IPHMG). In addition, a decentralized market clearing model is developed to enable the nearby IPHMG to interact in a local energy market (LEM). The LEM is run by a central manager for both power and hydrogen. To do so, the mobile edge computing (MEC) system is proposed to move the computation from a central cloud server to decentralized edge servers, causing to reducing the computational burden and increasing data security and privacy. Moreover, the fast alternating direction method of multipliers (fast-ADMM) is employed to decompose the problem. Further, this work advances the state-of-the-art in uncertainty management by introducing a tri-level uncertainty controlling approach to fully consider the uncertain parameters. According to the obtained results, the community of IPHMGs could reduce 5.86% of total cost by trading energy in the LEM and the presented hybrid uncertainty management model could protect the community against uncertainties by reducing the total cost by 8.08%.</description></item><item><title>Stochastic Planning for Power Distribution System Resilience Enhancement Against Earthquakes Considering Mobile Energy Resources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10184456</link><description>Earthquakes, which are high-impact low-probability extreme events, can cause severe damage to electrical infrastructure. This article studies the stochastic planning of resilient power distribution systems (PDSs) against earthquakes. Specifically, the portfolio of resilient measures including hardening distribution lines (DLs), and investing Mobile Emergency Generators (MEGs) and Mobile Energy Storage Systems (MESSs) are investigated in a stochastic environment. A stochastic spatial seismic damage model is developed to geographically characterize the random damages of earthquakes. Based on the stochastic model, the PDS planning problem is formulated as a risk-averse two-stage stochastic bi-level programming problem. The upper-level minimizes the total investment cost and the expected interruption cost. The lower-level minimizes the expected loss of load through MEG and MESS coordination, including co-allocation and energy exchange. To solve this problem, a scenario aggregation method based on graph theory and community detection is proposed to reduce the size of scenario set, and an endogenous uncertainty relaxation method is developed to address the DL hardening decision-dependent uncertainty. Then, the PDS planning problem with minmax form is reformulated into a standard bi-level programming problem with minmin form. A decomposition method is also proposed to break up the problem into two separate sub-problems to speed up the computation. The effectiveness of the proposed PDS planning strategy against earthquakes is evaluated through case studies based on the IEEE 37-Node Test Feeder and the IEEE 123-Node Test Feeder.</description></item><item><title>Distribution Network Planning Towards a Low-Carbon Transition: A Spatial-Temporal Carbon Response Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10179921</link><description>Recently, the ambitious targets of emission reduction worldwide have triggered a new trend to focus on low-carbon planning in not only the transmission networks but also the demand-side distribution networks. The existing planning approaches aim to effectively obtain a trade-off solution between emission reduction targets and system economic benefits. In this article, the distribution system planning method with a specific emission reduction target is proposed, in which the emission target is embedded in the objective function via the exterior point method rather than considered as a constraint. Simultaneously, a spatial-temporal carbon response model is proposed, which is based on geographically dispatchable loads (GDLs) incorporating distributed data centers (DDCs) and mobile energy storage systems (MESSs). This model can be extended to further mitigate system emissions without changing the current system framework. The proposed planning method is tested on the modified IEEE 33-bus and 123-bus benchmark systems. According to the simulation results, the impact on system cost and emission results owing to specific emission reduction targets and spatial-temporal carbon response model are analyzed. The results demonstrate that the proposed model and method can achieve a reduction in emissions of more than 30% within 5% of increasing system costs. The effectiveness and scalability of the proposed model have also been verified.</description></item><item><title>On the Low Risk of SSR in Type III Wind Turbines Operating With Grid-Forming Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10197565</link><description>We have shown in previous work that the risk of subsynchronous resonance between wind power plants with Type III wind turbines and series-compensated transmission lines is low when the wind turbines are operated in grid-forming (GFM) mode instead of the standard grid-following mode. This article explains the fundamental mechanism behind the improved damping characteristics by modeling the positive- and negative-sequence impedances of Type III wind turbines in GFM control mode. It is discovered that the GFM control naturally acts against the negative resistance behavior of Type III wind turbines at subsynchronous frequencies that results from an interaction between the rotor-side converter current controller and negative slip. The developed impedance models in the sequence domain and the improved damping behavior are verified using PSCAD simulations of a 2.5-MW Type III GFM wind turbine. The modeling predictions are also supported by experimentally measuring the impedance response of a 2.5-MW Type III wind turbine in GFM mode.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Design of V2G Incentives and V2G-Capable Electric Vehicles Parking Lots Considering Cost-Benefit Financial Analysis and User Participation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10226205</link><description>The deployment of electric vehicles parking lots (EVPLs) has been suggested as a solution that could serve the charging needs of electric vehicles (EVs) parked in public spaces. Due to their nature, EVPLs offer some advantages that public charging stations cannot offer. The availability of numerous EV batteries over a long period in the EVPL means that the storage capacity of EVs in EVPLs could be utilized in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) schemes through the installation of bi-directional chargers (BD) that allow injection of power back into the grid. However, it is imperative to determine the optimal number of BD in an EVPL given their high costs and the lack of clear evidence that many EV users will participate in the provision of V2G programs. Therefore, this article aims to develop a model for the optimal design of a V2G-capable EVPL via which the financial model of V2G services and V2G incentive-participation scheme for EV users are incorporated in the decision of installing different types of chargers. The model integrates a multi-mode objective that allows for the maximization of EVPL owner profit and/or EVPL social responsibility using control parameters incorporated in the model. The model also decouples the intertwined economic dynamics of EV charging and V2G services in the EVPL via revenue models targeting each service separately. This allows optimal pricing of services with respect to the invested capital. Actual survey data and historical operating information are used to verify the validity and feasibility of the model. The results show that the proposed model effectively meets design targets and charging/discharging requirements. By providing V2G services, including DR services to the grid, the profit margin of EVPL owners can increase by up to 12.16%.</description></item><item><title>Novel Fast-Speed Partial-Shading-Tolerant Flexible Power Point Tracking for Photovoltaic Systems With Explicit Key Points Estimation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10223421</link><description>Recent power curtailment-based photovoltaic (PV) flexible power point tracking (FPPT) algorithms mainly adopted intricate curve fitting or sophisticated curve-scanning mechanisms to ensure the grid supportive functionalities under partial shading conditions (PSCs), showing the limitations of mathematical solidity or system dynamics improvement. Accordingly, a novel fast-speed partial-shading-tolerant FPPT (PST-FPPT) algorithm is proposed in this article. Regarding the proposed scheme, a modified explicit PV model is developed to express the key operation points with the assistance of several representative current-voltage samples from the initialization process, which is beneficial to computational burden reduction and irradiance sensors removal. Additionally, to guarantee the tracking speed to system dynamics, a set point estimation-based direct voltage regulation strategy is proposed in this article, eliminating the redundant searching in approaching the predefined power command. Simulation and experimental evaluations under various PSCs and operational circumstances validated the effectiveness of the proposed control.</description></item><item><title>Power-Transfer-Distribution-Factor-Based Sensitivity Factors for Integrated Energy Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10236470</link><description>The stronger the electric power, district heating and gas system are linked in an integrated energy system (IES) the larger their flexibility potential but also their complexity. To ensure a secure system operation, the effect of a coupling unit's power change on the overall system state must be analyzed before the power change is carried out. Otherwise, coupling units can unintentionally cause limit violations in one energy system. Currently, for such analyses a power flow calculation must be performed, which is computational expensive and time-consuming. This article presents sensitivity factors extending Power Transfer Distribution Factors from electric power system analysis to IES. The sensitivity factors include the dynamic behavior of district heating and gas systems as we derive the sensitivity factors from a joined quasi-steady-state power flow calculation. In two case studies we profoundly test the applicability of the IES sensitivity factors, their accuracy, and limitations. We show that the sensitivity factors are on average ten times faster in estimating a new system state after a unit's power change compared to a power flow calculation. Also, the sensitivity factors can provide good estimates and have a higher accuracy than sensitivity factors which are derived from a steady-state power flow calculation.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Grid-Support Strategy With Inverter-Interfaced Distributed Generators for Short-Term Voltage Stability Improvement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10207767</link><description>With the increasing integration of renewable energy sources into distribution networks, short-term voltage stability (STVS) has become a prominent issue. Considering grid impedance and maximum rated current, a novel dynamic voltage support (DVS) control strategy for inverter-interfaced distributed generators (IIDGs) is proposed in this article for improving STVS. Furthermore, the impact mechanism of load dynamics and load spatial distribution on the STVS-support strategy are elucidated. For maximizing the STVS of the system, due to the difficulty of obtaining analytical closed-form expressions, a practical optimization method for multi-IIDG is proposed for the optimal control parameters. The optimization is solved alternately based on the time-domain simulation (TDS) and the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) algorithm. The STVS is evaluated by a proposed quantitative indicator. According to the operation state of the system, the control strategy can be adjusted online. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified based on two test systems. Compared with other DVS capabilities, the STVS is further improved by considering distributed dynamic loads. The applicability and computational efficiency of the proposed method are discussed under various key conditions.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Fault Ride-Through Operation Strategy Based on Model Predictive Control for High Power Wind Turbine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10210001</link><description>This article presents an advanced fault ride-through control strategy based on model predictive control (MPC) of high-power wind turbine (WT), which is able to provide voltage support for power grid under symmetrical and asymmetrical grid faults. An optimal cost function is first established to realize multi-objective control of wind power converter, considering current regulation, neutral-point voltage balance, and switching frequency control. The flexible positive and negative sequence control (FPNSC) method is applied to generate the current references complying with converter current and voltage limitations. Simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experimental verification are implemented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed fault-ride through operation strategy. The verification results show that the proposed strategy is able to effectively support voltage and implement fault ride-through (FRT) during grid faults with optimized neutral-point voltage and average switching frequency. The proposed MPC strategy can address different fault conditions with good adaptivity. It thus enhances the operation performance of high-power WT during faults events.</description></item><item><title>A Fault Ride-Through Method for LVDC Networks With Photovoltaic Energy Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10214031</link><description>Fault ride-through (FRT) is key to DC distribution networks for both avoidance of system blocking and improvement of the safety of flexible DC devices in the face of faults. This article proposes an FRT method for low-voltage DC distribution networks with a photovoltaic energy storage system, which achieves rapid fault detection and constraint of fault current contributed by DC solid-state transformers (DCSST), making non-blocking FRT viable. An inductor-based current-limiting module (CLM) is designed to cooperate with capacitors on the output terminal of a DCSST to restrain current and maintain voltage in the wake of faults. The system voltage can recover to a stable level swiftly after the FRT process under temporary faults. Correspondingly, permanent faults can be reliably isolated by DC circuit breakers after a reasonable FRT delay to minimize their impacts. Finally, a DC distribution network with a CLM is modeled in PSCAD/EMTDC and a hardware-in-the-loop test platform to verify and validate the overall effects and performance of this proposed method. Consequently, effectiveness and superiority of this method is justified in the test, where the results highlight its quick, stable and controllable fault current suppression capabilities compared with existing FRT methods under various fault conditions.</description></item><item><title>Coordinative Planning of Public Transport Electrification, RESs and Energy Networks for Decarbonization of Urban Multi-Energy Systems: A Government-Market Dual-Driven Framework</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10225407</link><description>Synergy among renewable energy sources (RESs), energy network (EN) expansion and electrified transport provides a potential pathway toward low-carbon energy systems. However, the ambition of deep decarbonization may not be achieved by connecting all stakeholders through single market-wise effort. To this end, this article presents a coordinative planning framework of public transport electrification (PTE), RESs and ENs for decarbonization of urban multi-energy systems (UMESs). The framework is formulated as a three-level programming and driven by both government incentives and market signals. In the upper-level, the investment decision models of RESs, ENs and PTE are developed. Particularly, public transport hubs (PTHs) are viewed as flexible multi-energy demands whose potential of implementing demand response is incorporated in PTE planning model. In the middle-level, a carbon emission-security assessment subproblem is proposed, where market equilibriums are captured by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions; then the nested Benders decomposition and Lagrangian relaxation approach are utilized to synthetize capacity incentives paid by governments. In the lower-level, a hybrid energy pricing mechanism is designed to obtain integrated energy-carbon prices. The above hierarchical model is solved by an iterative algorithm where all investors update their planning decisions in a decentralized manner based on customized government incentives and market prices. Numerical studies prove that our proposed approach can effectively coordinate all stakeholders and promote the low-carbon transition of UMESs.</description></item><item><title>SoilingEdge: PV Soiling Power Loss Estimation at the Edge Using Surveillance Cameras</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268055</link><description>Solar panels are exposed to various pollutants in outdoor environments, such as dust, sediment, and bird excrement, which can cause the power generated by the panels to drop by up to 50%. To accurately estimate the power generated by photovoltaic (PV) systems, it is necessary to take into account the effects of soiling on the panels. In this article, we propose a deep learning approach that uses edge devices such as micro-controllers to estimate the power loss due to soiling based on images captured by surveillance cameras. The proposed model, called SoilingEdge, is based on MobileNet and has been implemented on several platforms, including CPUs, edge tensor processing units (EdgeTPUs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and vision processing units (VPUs). We present a comparative study of the performance of SoilingEdge on these different platforms and show that FPGA offers a balanced compromise between cost and inference performance, while VPU is the most cost-effective option, but has a slower execution time. Furthermore, the article also investigates the interpretability of the model through the visualization of attention maps, thus providing useful insights for researchers and engineers in understanding the model behaviors.</description></item><item><title>Impact of Battery Ramp Rate Limit on Virtual Synchronous Machine Stability During Frequency Events</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10234653</link><description>The fast growing penetration of renewable energy sources has led to increasing retirement of conventional power plants, which affects operational stability of electricity networks. Therefore, researchers have proposed virtual synchronous machine (VSM) techniques for inverter-based renewable generators to address the related instability issues. However, most of the studies consider a stiff or infinite DC source of VSMs, which does not reflect the reality of battery storage with limited ramp rates. In this article, a thorough investigation has been conducted to evaluate the impacts of VSM battery ramp rates on system stability during frequency events. Then, the mechanism of VSM instability with slow ramp rates has been analysed. The results show that the system may lose stability during the frequency events since the ramp rate significantly impacts the energy delivered during such contingency. The eigenvalues analysis has also been performed to investigate the impact of ramp rate limit on system stability. Potential solutions are proposed after analysing the mechanism of this instability, such as reducing the AC voltage control speed. This also reveals that VSMs with DC ramp rate restriction can not achieve a high AC voltage loop bandwidth as the traditional synchronous machines.</description></item><item><title>Rapid Active Power Support by Regional PV Aggregation Considering Physical Topological Correlation and Communication Delay</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10243633</link><description>Harnessing the rapid active power regulation potential of aggregated distributed photovoltaics (PVs) to support the bulk power system is crucial under high-penetration PV scenarios. In this article, based on a hierarchical architecture, the optimization and control strategies of distributed PVs are proposed to realize rapid active power support. In the upper level, to achieve reliable and rapid active power allocation, an optimal active power flow model incorporating the prediction uncertainty of distributed PVs and active power transmission loss is constructed, which can be solved in real-time by Chebyshev graph convolutional network (ChebNet). In the lower level, given the electrical interaction between distributed PVs, the optimal active power tracking of the distributed PVs is realized through reference voltage and current tracking control. Further, a delay-dependent distributed coordinated $ H_{\infty }$ controller is designed to achieve stable tracking in the presence of communication delays and load perturbations. Finally, simulations are performed on the modified IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 118-bus test systems, and the results verify the effectiveness and superiority of ChebNet, as well as the good accuracy, tracking speed, and robustness of the proposed control method.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Modeling and Stability Control Strategy of Integrated Energy System in Multi-Time Scales</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10239532</link><description>In this article, the overall framework of integrated energy system (IES) is established including the integrated dynamic models of electricity, gas, and heat networks. The operation mechanism, dynamic coupling, energy flow constraints, and multi-time scale coordination of IES are fully considered as the basis of stability control. Then, an innovative multi-time-scale stability control strategy is proposed to simultaneously control the dynamic stability of voltage, frequency, flow, pressure, and temperature based on discrete model predictive control (DMPC). The outputs of outer loop control in long-time scale are regarded as the model inputs and control objectives for the inner loop control in short-time scale. The optimal solutions of electricity, heat, and gas are simultaneously obtained without decoupling based on the established integrated dynamic models. The proposed stability control method simplifies and unifies the stability control mode of different energy forms. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the proposed scheme can synchronously achieve the control objectives (frequency/voltage/temperature/mass flow/pressure regulation).</description></item><item><title>Analysis of Wave Energy Conversion for Optimal Generator Sizing and Hybrid System Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10258409</link><description>The effective integration of offshore wind and wave energy is highly challenging due to their distinct intermittency characteristics. The power take-off (PTO) level power smoothing in the wave energy converter (WEC) is needed to reduce its power variations and optimize the generator and associated converter sizing. However, there is a lack of understanding of the impact of mechanical storage systems at the PTO on the WEC operation; hence, a guide on the selection of the electrical generator rating under a wide range of wave climates is missing. This article addresses these research gaps by using a representative point absorber WEC with a hydraulic PTO system. A general method of selecting the optimum generation system rating is proposed from the technical and economic viewpoints. In addition, the impacts of two mechanical storage systems (added inertia and gas accumulator) on WEC system efficiency and availability are investigated under four distinct levels of practical wave climates (399 sea states). It is shown that both mechanical storage methods can effectively reduce the generator ratings but their impacts vary under different wave climates. It is also concluded that the storage systems have limited impact on the optimal generator ratings, while wave specifications at various sea locations present a greater impact.</description></item><item><title>A Dynamic Equivalent Energy Storage Model of Natural Gas Networks for Joint Optimal Dispatch of Electricity-Gas Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10261292</link><description>The development of energy conversion techniques enhances the coupling between the gas network and power system. However, challenges remain in the joint optimal dispatch of electricity-gas systems. The dynamic model of the gas network, described by partial differential equations, is complex and computationally demanding for power system operators. Furthermore, information privacy concerns and limited accessibility to detailed gas network models by power system operators necessitate quantifying the equivalent energy storage capacity of gas networks. This article proposes a multi-port energy storage model with time-varying capacity to represent the dynamic gas state transformation and operational constraints in a compact and intuitive form. The model can be easily integrated into the optimal dispatch problem of the power system. Test cases demonstrate that the proposed model ensures feasible control strategies and significantly reduces the computational burden while maintaining high accuracy in the joint optimal dispatch of electricity-gas systems. In contrast, the existing static equivalent model fails to capture the full flexibility of the gas network and may yield infeasible results.</description></item><item><title>Protection of Doubly Fed Induction Generator-Based Wind Turbines Against Loss of Excitation of the Rotor Winding</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10265142</link><description>The doubly fed induction generator-based wind turbine (DFIG-WT) has an excitation system in the rotor winding (RW), provided from the machine terminal through a back-to-back converter which may be lost partially and/or completely due to the fault in the rotor-circuit. Accordingly, this article outlines a novel protection system for DFIG-WT against loss of excitation (LOE) of the RW. For this purpose, two parameters of the reactive power (Qs) and DC-link voltage (Vdc) have been comprehensively analyzed theoretically and through typical simulation studies. The results show that, although they have the potential for detecting the complete LOE (CLOE), the partial LOE (PLOE) cannot be detected by means of them. Hence, to precisely detect the CLOE, the derivative of multiplication of the parameters has been implemented. On the other hand, further exploration to find the suitable parameter to address the PLOE show that, the stator current (Isr) considering the proper settings, can be the most suitable indicator. The results from evaluation of the developed algorithm on a typical test system in MATLAB/Simulink (2017b) environment show its reliability and swiftness in addressing the LOE events.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Sizing and Siting of BESS in High Wind Penetrated Power Systems: A Strategy Considering Frequency and Voltage Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10269003</link><description>Battery energy storage system (BESS) is a prominent option to provide frequency and voltage support in high wind penetrated power systems. However, the high investment cost of BESS makes its optimal allocation a critical issue. To address this issue, this article proposes an optimal sizing and siting strategy of BESS in high wind penetrated power systems considering the coordinated frequency and voltage control. The key feature of this strategy lies in the fact that the control scheme is incorporated into allocation process, thus achieving the optimal allocation in a dynamic context. Specifically, the allocation problem is a linear programming problem with the objective of minimizing BESS investment cost. Meanwhile, the control scheme is established based on model predictive control (MPC) with the aim of frequency and voltage grid support. The MPC control problem is then embedded into the linear allocation problem, resulting in an integrated multi-objective optimization problem, which links the allocation domain and control domain. The generalized Benders decomposition is introduced to decompose the integrated optimization problem into a master problem and a set of subproblems, which can be solved iteratively and alternately. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Feedback Based Online Aggregate EV Power Flexibility Characterization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286155</link><description>As an essential measure to combat global warming, electric vehicles (EVs) have witnessed rapid growth. Flexible EVs can enhance power systems' ability to handle renewable generation uncertainties. How EV flexibility can be utilized in power grid operation has captured great attention. However, the direct control of individual EVs is challenging due to their small capacity and large number. Hence, it is the aggregator that interacts with the grid on behalf of the EVs by characterizing their aggregate flexibility. In this article, we focus on the aggregate EV power flexibility characterization problem. First, an offline model is built to obtain the lower and upper bounds of the aggregate EV power flexibility region. It ensures that any trajectory within the region is feasible. Then, considering that parameters such as real-time electricity prices and EV arrival/departure times are not known in advance, an online algorithm is developed based on Lyapunov optimization techniques. We provide a theoretical bound for the maximum charging delay under the proposed online algorithm. Furthermore, real-time feedback is designed and integrated into the proposed online algorithm to better unlock EV power flexibility. Comprehensive performance comparisons are carried out to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Joint Granular Model for Load, Solar and Wind Power Scenario Generation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286981</link><description>The main thrust of the article is the development of a joint stochastic model for electricity demand, and wind and solar power production in a given region. The model hinges on special statistical data analysis techniques including the estimation of heavy tail distributions, graphical LASSO fitting procedures, and conditional Monte Carlo simulations. Assuming the availability of point forecasts, we model the deviations from these forecasts instead of modeling the actual quantities of interest. The resolution of the model is determined by the resolution of the forecast data. For the sake of illustration, we implement our model and the corresponding simulation algorithms on data made available by NREL for the Texas region with hourly time resolution, load data at the zone level, and wind and solar power production at the generation asset level. Our numerical simulations confirm that the dependencies identified through the fitting algorithm are consistent with the relative locations of the production assets and the geographical load zones over which the data were collected.</description></item><item><title>A New Closed-Loop Solar Power Forecasting Method With Sample Selection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10288077</link><description>In this article, a new short-term solar power forecasting method is proposed which has a closed-loop structure composed of point-estimating and range-classifying parts. If the forecasts generated by these parts for solar power are inconsistent, the feedback loop sends appropriate signals to them to correct their predictions. The feedback loop iterates until consistent forecasts are generated for the solar power by the point-estimating and range-classifying parts. This enables the proposed closed-loop forecasting method to enhance its solar power prediction accuracy and reliability. Furthermore, a novel sample selection approach, different from feature selection methods, is devised to mine the historical data for finding the most informative training samples for training the proposed forecasting engine. The effectiveness of the proposed solar power forecasting method is illustrated by testing it on some real-world solar farms and comparing its results with the results of several state-of-the-art solar power prediction methods.</description></item><item><title>On the Forecastability of Solar Energy Generation by Rooftop Panels Pointed in Different Directions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10169105</link><description>By increasing the penetration of small-scale rooftop solar panels, forecasting their output has become important to both homeowners and distribution systems operators. In many areas, the roof of residential houses is not such that all solar panels are installed pointing in one direction; so, they are installed pointing in different directions. In this letter, the effect of this phenomenon on the forecastability of the day-ahead solar panels' power output is experimentally investigated. To perform day-ahead energy forecasting, a feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) is created using historical data and weather conditions of a similar day along with the forecast weather conditions of the day for which the forecast is to be performed. A similar day selection algorithm based on Euclidean distance is used to determine the reference day. Two forecasting approaches have been compared: forecasting each panel output and forecasting the total output. Moreover, Long short-term memory (LSTM) is used to validate the conclusion made by the feedforward ANN. The results evidently show that considering different directions of the solar panels increases the forecastability of the rooftop solar power plant.</description></item><item><title>Control Solution to Over-Modulation of DFIG Converter for Asymmetrical Fault Ride Through</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10119222</link><description>This letter proposes a control solution to mitigate the problem of converter over-modulation in doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbine generators (WTGs). Overmodulation is a critical reason in failing to ride through asymmetrical faults and inject positive- and negative-sequence reactive currents (I1R and I2R) per grid code requirements. Analytical expressions are first proposed to independently calculate the transient, positive- and negative-sequence current components. The I2R injection factor is then optimized to mitigate the problem of steady-state over-modulation. The transient components are eliminated in the inner-loop control to mitigate the problem of transient over-modulation. The proposed control solution is validated with EMT-type simulations. The results show that the transient performance and the fault ride through (FRT) capability are significantly improved.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Stochastic Frequency Constrained Micro-Market Model for Isolated Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10103548</link><description>With the developments of isolated microgrids (IMGs) and prosumers in remote areas, energy trading has emerged as a critical aspect of IMGs. However, the lack of an upstream network and the low inertia of the system may threaten the secure operation of these networks. This paper proposes a Micro-Market  $(\mu \text{M}$ ) model for IMGs that includes a precise hierarchical control structure. To address the IMG&#8217;s low inertia and high intermittency of renewable energy sources (RES), the proposed  $\mu \text{M}$  manages the active-reactive power and schedules primary and secondary active reserves to maintain the frequency within in a predefined range. Additionally, a bidirectional linearized AC power flow is established to schedule the reactive reserve and the proposed model is formulated as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear problem (MILP) to maximize social welfare (SW) over the next 24 hours. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, the  $\mu \text{M}$  is tested on an IMG based on a CIGRE medium-voltage benchmark system, and different operational cases are simulated. The results demonstrate that the proposed model, which takes into account hierarchical control levels and technical issues of the IMG, is a cost-effective way to maximize social welfare while ensuring the secure operation of the IMG.</description></item><item><title>Coordinated Predictive Secondary Control for DC Microgrids Based on High-Order Fully Actuated System Approaches</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10102303</link><description>The problem of voltage recovery and current balancing has been a hot research topic in the field of DC microgrids. How to build a model that reflects the circuit and component-level control (e.g., inner control loops) characteristics and design a secondary controller based on it to accomplish the above output regulations is the concern of this paper. Accordingly, in this paper, based on the large-signal model of microgrids, the corresponding high-order fully actuated model is developed for DC microgrids, which is not only simple in form but also able to capture the details of the actual power system, such as the relationship between voltage and current. Further, a distributed predictive fully actuated secondary control strategy is proposed based on the developed model to achieve voltage recovery and accurate current sharing. Allowing one to design the secondary controller free from the constraints of physical coupling in the microgrid is one feature of this control strategy, while the other is the arbitrarily assignable closed-loop poles. An analytical model of the closed-loop DC microgrid system with predictive fully actuated secondary control is developed, and the analysis of stability and output current consensus is presented therewith. Extensive tests on a hardware system of a DC microgrid with solar panels and an MPPT controller are performed to validate the performance of the designed controller.</description></item><item><title>A General Framework for the Power Flow Solution in Radial and Meshed AC/DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10109775</link><description>The advent of AC/DC microgrids generated the need to research and develop power flow algorithms to assist in the planning of these microgrids. The main objective of the research carried out in this paper is to present a general framework for the power flow in AC/DC microgrids with multiple interlinking converters. This framework is based on the superposition principle and the solution of small nonlinear subproblem to determine the angular frequency, power flow through interlinking converters and voltages at the reference nodes. This framework was used to derive two algorithms: one based on the Current Summation Method, for radial microgrids, and another based on the Gauss-Zbus Method, for meshed microgrids. Test results with 45 and 906 nodes microgrids showed that the proposed power flow algorithms have: (i) the same accuracy as the Newton-Raphson Method; (ii) good scalability in terms of computational cost; (iii) robustness against random variations in microgrid parameters (the number of iterations varies only from 4 to 5) and branches contingencies; (iv) computational costs savings of 81% to 98% compared to the Newton-Raphson Method; (v) speed up from 5 to 44 times in relation to the Newton-Raphson Method; (vi) fast convergence characteristic.</description></item><item><title>Control of Distributed Converter-Based Resources in a Zero-Inertia Microgrid Using Robust Deep Learning Neural Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10117561</link><description>Considering the evolution of future microgrids (MGs) towards zero-inertia level due to the penetrations of distributed converter-based resources (DCRs), a large number of data produced by these generations will lead the control decisions to be more complicated than conventional power systems. This paper presents a control strategy for a zero-inertia MG with DCRs using a robust deep learning neural network (RDeNN). In a training phase, a sub-space state-based identification method is employed to monitor and analyze the data regarding stability indices, i.e., damping and frequency of dominant modes, and robustness against uncertainties. In addition, a mixed  $H_{2}/H_{\infty }$  control strategy is applied to enhance the training efficacy in the frequency and voltage control loops of DCRs. The trained RDeNN is activated to make quick and effective control decisions by using only measured signals from the MG. Simulation results are verified in the zero-inertia MG (or the grid with 100% DCRs) and compared with several existing control techniques. The study results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed RDeNN in many aspects such as low computational time, require-less physical controller models, fast and flexible stabilizing responses, and high robustness against various time delays, data quality issues, and MG uncertainties.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Secondary Frequency Control of Autonomous Microgrids via Adaptive Robust -Gain Performance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10124785</link><description>This paper presents an innovative passivity-based  $L_{2}$ -gain performance  $(L_{2}$ -GP) adaptive robust control method for the design of primary and secondary frequency control in the low-inertia microgrid with lines and the inverter-interfaced generation. First, by exploiting and analyzing the internal structural properties, the Port-controlled Kuramoto-Hamiltonian model with dissipation for the microgrid system is derived. Combining the dynamics of Kuramoto oscillators with energy viewpoints and following the physical features of dynamic energy coordination in the microgrid, an adaptive robust  $L_{2}$ -GP decentralized secondary control is developed to guarantee frequency restoration and active power sharing. An adaptive mechanism is adopted to estimate the electrical parameters so that the parameter randomness can be overcome and fast transient response, high performance, and robust stability can be achieved. Via local measurements, the decentralized framework accordingly obviates the need of any communication links for information broadcast or exchange. Finally, the comprehensive case studies are presented to validate satisfactory performance under rapid randomness and flexibility during plug-and-play operations.</description></item><item><title>Inverter PQ Control With Trajectory Tracking Capability for Microgrids Based on Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10128154</link><description>The increasing penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) calls for an advanced active and reactive power (PQ) control strategy in microgrids. To enhance the controllability and flexibility of the IBRs, this paper proposes an adaptive PQ control method with trajectory tracking capability, combining model-based analysis, physics-informed reinforcement learning (RL), and power hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments. First, model-based analysis proves that there exists an adaptive proportional-integral controller with time-varying gains that can ensure any exponential PQ output trajectory of IBRs. These gains consist of a constant factor and an exponentially decaying factor, which are then obtained using a model-free deep RL approach known as the twin delayed deeper deterministic policy gradient. With the model-based derivation, the learning space of the RL agent is narrowed down from a function space to a real space, which reduces the training complexity significantly. Finally, the proposed method is verified through numerical simulation in MATLAB-Simulink and power HIL experiments in the CURENT center. With the physics-informed learning method, exponential response time constants can be freely assigned to IBRs, and they can follow any predefined trajectory without complicated gain tuning.</description></item><item><title>Stabilization of DC Microgrids Under Cyber Attacks-Optimal Design and Sensitivity Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10130073</link><description>Due to increased efforts on digitizing the modern power electronic systems and microgrids, their operational reliability and stability are prone to the risk of cyber attacks. In this paper, we inspect the overlooked stability issues caused by cyber-attacks, and present an overall design insight for stabilization of microgrids under cyber attacks. Firstly, we shed light on the optimal design policy and sensitivity aspects of the solution for microgrids under cyber-attacks. These results are based on a describing function-based modeling method to map the stability region. Secondly, the sensitivity impact due to system parameter variations and stabilization gains on stability is theoretically investigated. In addition, the range of sensitivity of parameter variations with respect to cyber attacks are calculated. Based on different design requirements, optimal values are theoretically obtained and then tested on microgrids having different parameters in a simulation environment, which justifies the ruggedness of the proposed design approach. We provide a generalized philosophy, which can be easily extended to the overall design, stability and parameter sensitivity of cyber-physical energy systems.</description></item><item><title>Large-Signal Stability Analysis of AC Micro-Grid Under Quadratic Droop Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10138078</link><description>Quadratic droop control is an innovative control strategy for power network, aiming to respect the inherently quadratic nature of reactive power flow. However, the system stability under quadratic droop control has not been addressed completely so far. This paper mainly focuses on the large-signal stability analysis of the AC network under quadratic droop control. We firstly analyze the stability of each equilibrium, it is concluded that the high-voltage equilibrium is stable as long as it exists while all low-voltage equilibria are unstable. Secondly, an analytical energy function for the system under quadratic droop control is established. It is proved that the high-voltage equilibrium is the local minimum of the proposed energy function while all the low-voltage equilibria are saddle points. Thirdly, to estimate the region of attraction (ROA) of the high-voltage equilibrium, an innovative method based on the analytical energy function is proposed. Comparing with the closest UEP method, the proposed ROA method significantly reduce the amount of computations. Simulation results verify the proposed theorems.</description></item><item><title>Aging Rate Equalization Strategy for Battery Energy Storage Systems in Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10136844</link><description>It is urgent to reduce the maintenance burden and extend the service life of recycled batteries used in microgrids. However, the corresponding balancing techniques mainly focus on the state of health (SOH) balancing for unique converter structures or with complex SOH estimators. This paper proposes an aging rate equalization strategy for microgrid-scale battery energy storage systems (BESSs). Firstly, the aging rate equalization principle is established based on the relationship among throughput, state of charge (SOC), and injected/output power of a BESS, which is obtained according to the semi-empirical life model of the battery. Second, based on the established principle, the droop coefficients of energy storage systems (ESUs) are designed in the lower-level control, which can ensure the aging rate equalization of ESUs in one. The upper-level control optimizes the output of multiple microgrids. Then, the stability of the proposed aging rate equalization strategy is proven by a small-signal analysis. The performance analysis shows that the proposed aging rate equalization can also realize SOC balance. Finally, the RTLAB hardware-in-the-loop tests are carried out to illustrate the outstanding performance of the proposed strategy for extending the battery service life and ensuring microgrid operation stability.</description></item><item><title>Reinforcement Learning-Based Integrated Control to Improve the Efficiency of DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10154007</link><description>The hierarchical control of the DC microgrid regulates the terminal voltages of the interfacing converter to achieve proportional load sharing and good voltage regulation at the DC bus. In doing so, the difference of the voltage at different nodes increases which results in higher circulating current and leads to higher losses. In this paper, a Reinforcement Learning Based Integrated Control (RLIC) is proposed which will minimize the circulating current and power losses in the transmission. The proposed RLIC consists of a primary and secondary controller. The primary controller is a robust sliding mode controller which receives the voltage references from secondary controller and regulates the terminal voltage and source current accordingly. The secondary control consists of a proportional integral control (PI), and a Deep Neural Network (DNN) surrogate model with implementation of Q-Learning as reinforcement method. A novel DNN based surrogate model uses the droop value from the PI controller and estimates the power loss and the local and global loading difference for a particular node, for a set of operating condition. This surrogate model is used by the Q-Learning based reinforcement technique which adjusts the droop constants and provide the voltage reference to primary controller to maintain load sharing and reduce the power losses, there-by leading to an improved overall efficiency. The proposed control structure is verified to improve efficiency while maintaining the load sharing and bus voltage regulation.</description></item><item><title>An Extended State Observer Based Adaptive Backstepping Controller for Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10158046</link><description>This paper proposes development of a robust distributed secondary control scheme for a photovoltaic (PV) source integrated and inverter-interfaced islanded AC microgrid (MG). The control objective is to regulate the voltage, frequency, and achieve the desired active and reactive power sharing among the distributed generations (DGs) while supporting plug and play operation (PnP) and handling abnormal situations. The above objectives are to be achieved in face of uncertainties in inverter switching pulses, intermittent nature of PV source, dynamic load changes, and disturbances. A backstepping (BS) controller is designed to track the nominal voltage and frequency, whilst an extended state observer (ESO) is designed to estimate the disturbance. The stability of the MG with ESO-BS controller is proved by using Lyapunov stability theory, and graph theory. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller, both numerical simulation in MATLAB, and experimentation on OPAL-RT at different operating conditions are pursued. The proposed controller is compared with the distributed averaging based secondary control (Simpson-Porco et al., 2015), secondary controller based on MG centralized controller (MGCC) (Shafiee et al., 2014). It is observed that the proposed controller outperforms in terms of enhanced robustness and steady-state performance.</description></item><item><title>Systematic Methods to Eliminate the Transient Circulating Powers in the Multi-VSGs System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10158393</link><description>When multiple virtual synchronous generators (VSG)s operate in parallel in an islanded microgrid, the sudden load power change could lead to significant transient circulating (and oscillating) power. In this paper, the transient circulating power is first analyzed with the two-VSGs small signal model. On this basis, the paper defines parameter design principles that theoretically eliminate all transient circulating power. Due to the line impedances uncertainty in practice, the ideal parameter design is not always available. Then, to suppress the remaining transient circulating power, an enhanced VSG (EVSG) control strategy is further proposed, by deriving and revising a two-VSGs transfer function from load disturbance to power angles difference. The proposed parameter design principles and the EVSG can be applied sequentially, so that the transient circulating power can be systematically suppressed without the side-effects as in existing methods. An experimental platform with 3 VSGs is established. The parameter design principles and the EVSG are thoroughly validated by experimental results. This is also the first time the 3-VSGs experimental results are reported, while all the existing literature has 2-VSGs data. It confirms that the two-VSGs analytical results can be extended to systems with more VSGs.</description></item><item><title>An Edge Computing-Oriented Islanding Detection Using Differential Entropy and Multi-Support Vector Machines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10159133</link><description>This paper presents an edge computing-oriented islanding detection paradigm using multi-support vector machines (SVM) and differential entropy. The proposed methodology can detect islanding events and locate which microgrid was disconnected in a distribution system with microgrid cluster. The proposed method employs multi-SVMs in the cloud to detect and locate potential islanding events in power distribution systems. The accuracy and reliability of the results of SVMs are enhanced by introducing differential entropy for quantitative evaluation. Additionally, the method decomposes the SVM inference process at the edge, enabling edge devices with low computational power and limited resources to support data-driven algorithms without compromising accuracy and speed. An extensive study is performed on the modified IEEE123 distribution system established in real-time digital simulation. Simulation results elucidate that the proposed method can accurately and promptly detect system islanding operations with zero non-detection zone. Comparison with other methods illustrates the superiority of the proposed method in terms of discrimination accuracy, detection time, and reliability.</description></item><item><title>Robust Energy Management for Multi-Microgrids Based on Distributed Dynamic Tube Model Predictive Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10167773</link><description>Multi-microgrids (MMGs) provide an effective modality to integrate high-penetration renewable energy as well as other distributed sources. However, the inherent uncertainties from nature and load demand significantly impact the secure operation of the MMGs system. Considering these challenges, this paper proposes a novel intraday robust energy management framework based on the distributed dynamic tube model predictive control (DD-TMPC) method for autonomous multi-microgrids, which has less conservativeness and more economic efficiency. The proposed strategy can dynamically capture the security operation range of the microgrid system based on the set theory and utilize two cooperative MPC controllers to decompose the original uncertainty optimal problem into two different time scale deterministic uncertainty-free scheduling problems, which have lower computation complexity. Furthermore, in order to better balance the robustness and economy of system operation, a game theory-based intraday distributed energy trading mechanism is designed which considers both the transaction expectations of the market participants and the efficiency of the equilibrium solution. Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed DD-TMPC strategy.</description></item><item><title>Physics-Informed Graphical Representation-Enabled Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robust Distribution System Voltage Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10113230</link><description>The anomalous measurements and inaccurate distribution system physical models cause huge challenges for distribution system optimization. This paper proposes a robust voltage control method that can deal with them by systematically integrating a representation network, the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method, and the surrogate model. The partial observation of the distribution network is first represented as a graph with tree topology that is processed by a physics-informed global graph attention network (GGAT) and a deep auto-encoder (DAE) to achieve informative and robust representation of the real-time and pseudo-measurements. The extracted features are then fed into the soft actor-critic algorithm, during the training of which a graphical-learning-based power flow surrogate model is developed to provide a reward signal for the DRL algorithm. This allows the proposed method to reduce reliance on accurate distribution system parameters. The embedding of the structural information by the GGAT and the informative features extracted by the DAE further enhances the robustness of the proposed method against anomalous measurements. The proposed method is validated using IEEE 33-node and 119-node systems. Simulation results show the robustness of the proposed method against anomalous measurements.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Affinely Adjustable Robust Volt/VAr Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10108906</link><description>Recent years have seen the increasing proliferation of distributed energy resources with intermittent power outputs, posing new challenges to the voltage management in distribution networks. To this end, this paper proposes a data-driven affinely adjustable robust Volt/VAr control (AARVVC) scheme, which modulates the smart inverter&#8217;s reactive power in an affine function of its active power, based on the voltage sensitivities with respect to real/reactive power injections. To achieve a fast and accurate estimation of voltage sensitivities, we propose a data-driven method based on deep neural network (DNN), together with a rule-based bus-selection process using the bidirectional search method. Our method only uses the operating statuses of selected buses as inputs to DNN, thus significantly improving the training efficiency and reducing information redundancy. Finally, a distributed consensus-based solution, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), for the AARVVC is applied to decide the inverter&#8217;s reactive power adjustment rule with respect to its active power. Only limited information exchange is required between each local agent and the central agent to obtain the slope of the reactive power adjustment rule, and there is no need for the central agent to solve any (sub)optimization problems. Numerical results on the modified IEEE-123 bus system validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed data-driven AARVVC method.</description></item><item><title>Multiplexing Power Converters for Cost-Effective and Flexible Soft Open Points</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10109836</link><description>The feasible set of real powers that can be transferred by a three-terminal Soft Open Point (SOP) can be increased by selecting non-uniform power ratings for each of the three ac/dc legs of the SOP, then connecting a multi-terminal switch (multiplexer) to the ac side of each of those converters to facilitate reconfiguration. This paper generalizes this concept, considering the real and reactive power that  $n$  multiplexed ac/dc converters can transfer at an  $m$ -feeder bus. The performance of the device is studied numerically for a number of ac/dc sizing strategies through the volume of the feasible set of power transfers (the &#8216;capability chart volume&#8217;, CCV) and distribution system loss reduction benefits (as an exemplar network service). Upper bounds on device performance are defined by considering the performance of a novel, idealised SOP consisting of a continuum of infinitesimal reconfigurable converters. Results demonstrate that the CCV can be more than doubled, with 99% of the relative performance improvement of the idealised converter achieved with designs consisting of as few as four converters. SOP equipment costs reductions of 24% are reported, with it concluded that reconfigurable, judiciously sized ac/dc legs can yield flexible and lower cost SOPs than conventional, hard-wired approaches.</description></item><item><title>A Simulation-Assisted Proactive Scheduling Method for Secure Microgrid Formation Under Static and Transient Islanding Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122619</link><description>Microgrids (MGs) provide a promising solution to ensure the constant power supply under extreme conditions due to their islanding ability. However, unintentional islanding caused by emergencies may trigger significant a power imbalance in MGs, leading to unsuccessful MG formation in the event that static or transient operational constraints are violated. To address this challenge, we propose a proactive distribution system scheduling method to continue serving critical loads in emergencies by forming reliable MGs. The power flow on the lines is restricted prior to interruption to mitigate the power imbalance in MGs when equipment failures occur. Both static and transient constraints are incorporated into the proposed model to ensure the adequacy of MGs in supplying demands and transient security during the islanding transition. Note that the inclusion of nonlinear transient constraints makes it difficult to solve the model directly. Thus, a two-level simulation-assisted solution approach is presented, where simulation level sends the maximum allowable power imbalance in the MGs to optimization level to determine optimal scheduling schemes. By interfacing with a transient simulation of MGs, the frequency dynamics are exactly incorporated into the constraints. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in secure islanding transition and MG survivability improvement.</description></item><item><title>Chance-Constrained Optimization of Storage and PFC Capacity for Railway Electrical Smart Grids Considering Uncertain Traction Load</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10124245</link><description>To foster the utilization of regeneration braking energy and suppress voltage unbalance (VU), a railway electrical smart grid (RESG), intergraded with power flow controller (PFC) and energy storage (ES), is proposed as an important part of next-generation electrified railways. However, under the uncertain traction load, how to design the optimal size of PFC-ES is a challenge during the planning period. Hence, this paper proposes a chance-constrained two-stage programming approach. The first-stage aims to minimising the overall cost of RESG&#8217;s devices. The second-stage aims to arrange the energy flow of the PFC-ES with the objective of minimising the expected operation cost under the dynamic VU restriction, and the stochastics characteristics of traction load are transformed into a chance constraint by using a scenario approach. Then, traction power predictions are combined with multivariate Gaussian Mixture Model (multi-GMM) model to generate correlated traction power flow scenarios and to assess VU probabilistic metrics distribution with different confidence levels. Finally, a novel algorithm is designed to select the confidence level and violation probability so that the capacity planning results can ensure the high-efficient and high-quality operation of the RESG. Case studies based on an actual electrified railway demonstrate that the proposed PFC-ES sizing approach can reduce the overall cost by up to 13%.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Agent Safe Graph Reinforcement Learning for PV Inverters-Based Real-Time Decentralized Volt/Var Control in Zoned Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10128717</link><description>To realize real-time voltage/var control (VVC) in active distribution networks (ADNs), this paper proposes a new multi-agent safe graph reinforcement learning method to optimize reactive power output from PV inverters. The network is divided into several zones, and a decentralized framework is proposed for coordinated control of reactive power output in each zone to regulate voltage profiles and minimize network energy loss. The VVC problem is formulated as a multi-agent decentralized partially observable constrained Markov decision process. Each zone has a central control agent that embeds graph convolution networks (GCNs) in the policy network to improve the decision-making capability. The GCN extracts graph-structured features from the ADN topology, reflecting the relationship between VVC and grid topology, and can filter noise and impute missing data. The training process includes primal-dual policy optimization to rigorously satisfy voltage safety constraints. Simulations on a 141-bus distribution system demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively minimize network energy loss and reduce voltage deviations, even in the presence of noisy or incomplete input measurements.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Design of Volt/VAR Control Rules for Inverter-Interfaced Distributed Energy Resources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10136392</link><description>The IEEE 1547 Standard for the interconnection of distributed energy resources (DERs) to distribution grids provisions that smart inverters could be implementing Volt/VAR control rules among other options. Such rules enable DERs to respond autonomously in response to time-varying grid loading conditions. The rules comprise affine droop control augmented with a deadband and saturation regions. Nonetheless, selecting the shape of these rules is not an obvious task, and the default options may not be optimal or dynamically stable. To this end, this work develops a novel methodology for customizing Volt/VAR rules on a per-bus basis for a single-phase feeder. The rules are adjusted by the utility every few hours depending on anticipated demand and solar scenarios. Using a projected gradient descent-based algorithm, rules are designed to improve the feeders voltage profile, comply with IEEE 1547 constraints, and guarantee stability of the underlying nonlinear grid dynamics. The stability region is inner approximated by a polytope and the rules are judiciously parameterized so their feasible set is convex. Numerical tests using real-world data on the IEEE 141-bus feeder corroborate the scalability of the methodology and explore the trade-offs of Volt/VAR control with alternatives.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Quasi-Power Differential Protection Scheme for Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10153766</link><description>With the massive integration of distributed generations (DGs), distribution networks gradually become more active and flexible. Conventional overcurrent protection is difficult to adapt to such active distribution networks (ADNs). Current differential protection (CDP) is a good choice for solving this issue, but the multi-branch structure of ADNs especially the unmeasured T-connected load branch affects the protection&#8217;s sensitivity. Therefore, the paper proposes a quasi-power differential protection (QDP) scheme based on Tellegen&#8217;s theorem. First, the feasibility of applying Tellegen&#8217;s theorem to ADNs was analyzed. On this basis, reasonable protection criteria were designed for different scenarios of ADNs. Then, an adaptive protection scheme was established, which can automatically adjust the criteria depending on the presence of T-connected branches within the protected section. Finally, extensive simulations were carried out in an ADN model using PSCAD/EMTDC software. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protection scheme has excellent adaptability to network topologies, fault types, fault resistances, and network structures of ADNs.</description></item><item><title>Supply Restoration of Data Centers in Flexible Distribution Networks With Spatial-Temporal Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10154016</link><description>The reliable operation of Internet data centers (IDCs) is crucial to digitization transformation of society. However, the extreme fault on the IDC-located distribution network is fatal to IDC operation. The evolution of flexible distribution networks (FDNs) can satisfy the deep dependence of IDC on high-quality and reliable power supply. In FDNs, AC/DC feeders with multiple voltage levels can be flexibly interconnected and adjusted by flexible stations (FSs). It is promising to flexibly enhance operation performance of crucial IDCs after fault isolation in FDNs. In this paper, a coordinated supply restoration method of IDCs in FDNs with spatial-temporal regulation is proposed to minimize IDC data-dropping loss under complex faults. First, a spatial-temporal transfer strategy of IDC workloads is precisely formulated and an FS-based network reconfiguration strategy is proposed. Then, a mixed-integer second-order conic programming model is established for efficient solving. Spatial-temporal coordination among the source, network, storage, and demand sides can be realized without violating physical feasibility. Finally, the proposed method is validated on the modified IEEE 33-node and modified IEEE 123-node test cases. Case studies show that total outage loss is effectively reduced with sufficient utilization of available power. Operational performance of FDN is also enhanced under extreme faults.</description></item><item><title>Fast and Generic Energy Flow Analysis of the Integrated Electric Power and Heating Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10098886</link><description>Energy flow analysis is a fundamental tool to determine the network states of the integrated energy systems (IES). For the widely deployed IES with coupled power grids (PG) and heating networks (HN), we still lack a generic tool that can be easily employed to calculate the quasi-dynamic energy flows of it. In this paper, we have developed a generic code package (named as MATHN) for energy flow analysis of the quality-regulated HN. After that, a generic solution framework that leverages MATPOWER and MATHN to realize decomposed energy flow calculation of PG and HN is proposed. Behind the MATHN tool, a model reformulation technique is proposed to eliminate the massive indirect variables of the basic HN model discretized by finite difference, which finally derives a compact matrix formulation (similar to the network equation of power grid:  $\boldsymbol {I}=\boldsymbol {Y}\boldsymbol {U}$ ) for generic description of any HN and also slashes the original model scale by around 20 times. Moreover, the solution strategy behind the MATHN tool further converts this matrix formulation into a standard system of non-homogeneous linear equations, with which some existing well-recognized algorithms can be directly applied for efficient and accurate solution. Case studies on three different scales of test systems demonstrate the generality, efficiency and accuracy of our methods. All the codes and input data are packaged into the MATHN tool and are made open-source for non-commercial use.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Scheduling of Micro-Energy Grid Based on Pareto Frontier Under Uncertainty and Pollutant Emissions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10120983</link><description>With the continuous improvement of micro-energy grid, in order to reduce carbon emissions and environmental pollution, a multi-objective optimization operation strategy considering the distributed energy generation uncertainty, environmental factors, and self-supply rate is proposed in this paper. First, to simulate the uncertainty of distributed energy, we used the three-parameter Weibull distribution to simulate the wind power. Then, for the load side, an innovative electric and thermal comprehensive demand response model is proposed. Different from the traditional micro energy network that only considers the heat energy balance, this paper also considers the thermal inertia of buildings to more accurately describe the characteristic of the heat load. Meanwhile, on the basis of economic factors, the abandon rate of distributed energy, environmental coefficient and self-sufficiency rate are also regarded as three objective functions. Finally, in order to obtaining a set of solutions at the Pareto front, the entropy-weighted TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) method is introduced to obtain the global optimal solution. Simulation study of multiple scenarios shows the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with the method that considers only economic costs, the pollutant emissions are reduced by 50kg and self-power supply rate is increased by 20%.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Model Predictive Consensus Control for Stable Operation of Integrated Energy System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10153774</link><description>The stable operation of the integrated energy system (IES) is affected by the fluctuation of heat or electricity loads, energy or communication problems, and the interaction of different energy networks. To overcome above challenges, firstly, the integrated dynamic models with three-time scales are established for control design, fully considering dynamic behaviors, energy coupling, and constraints of power flow including electrical, heat and gas on network stability. Then, a novel distributed model predictive control (DMPC) consensus algorithm with process control and trajectory control is proposed to achieve stable operation for IES based on second-order cone programming (SOCP). A unified distributed cooperative control mode is formed in IES by implementing the proposed stability control method, which is suitable for different forms of energy. The control design takes into account the different dynamic characteristics of energy equipment and the energy coupling feature, which realizes the multi-scale time cooperation and dynamic process control for IES by tuning the control parameters. The optimal solution is obtained by rolling optimization for achieving frequency/voltage/temperature/pressure/flow regulation and consensus objectives. Finally, the proposed model and method are validated in various simulation scenarios, such as load variation, energy flow variation, nodes removed, and topology change.</description></item><item><title>Exploiting the Flexibility Potential of Water Distribution Networks: A Pilot Project in Belgium</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10113853</link><description>Flexibility, and in particular, energy storage is expected to assume a key role in the efficient and secure operation of the power system, and thus, in the transition towards a carbon-free electricity sector. In this paper, we propose a methodology for exploiting the flexibility existing in water distribution systems from water storage in reservoirs. The methodology relies first on a modelling approach, from which an optimization problem is defined. The resolution of this optimization problem leads to an operating pattern for the pumps. The methodology assumes that all the electricity is bought on the day-ahead market, where the bids are placed by constructing and solving an optimization problem. The uncertain water consumption and the electricity market prices are predicted using machine learning techniques. The methodology is tested on a real-life water distribution network in Belgium and the results from the pilot project indicate a cost reduction up to 11%.</description></item><item><title>Sequential Clearing of Network-Aware Local Energy and Flexibility Markets in Community-Based Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10124246</link><description>In this paper, network-aware clearing algorithms for local energy markets (LEMs) and local flexibility markets (LFM) are proposed to be sequentially run and coordinate assets and flexible resources of energy communities (ECs) in distribution networks. In the proposed LEM clearing algorithm, EC managers run a two-stage stochastic programming while considering random events by scenario generation and network constraints using linearized DistFlow. As one of outcomes, maximum available up- and down-regulations provided by ECs are estimated in LEM and communicated to LFM. In the distributed LFM clearing algorithm, an iterative auction is designed using a dual-decomposition technique (Augmented Lagrangian) which is solved by consensus alternating direction method of multipliers. The LFM algorithm efficiently dispatches the flexibility provided by ECs in operating time while considering flexibility local marginal price as pricing method. Network constraints are included in the algorithm with an AC distribution optimal power flow for dynamic network topology in which branches and buses are decomposed to solve the problem in distributed fashion. The designed LFM algorithm can respond to exogenous and endogenous signals for flexibility requests. The simulation results in a test case display effectiveness of two proposed LEM and LFM algorithms for an efficient provision of flexibility.</description></item><item><title>Carbon-Aware Operation of Resilient Vertical Farms in Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10158433</link><description>Vertical farming is an emerging sustainable solution to enhance the resilience of the food supply and mitigate the carbon emissions of the agriculture sector amidst population growth, geopolitical risks, and climate change concerns. The proximity of food production to consumers enhances food supply resilience. Besides, the potential to leverage renewable resources to energize Vertical Farms (VF s) paves the way to mitigating their food carbon emissions. At the same time, VF s will introduce new challenges and opportunities within Active Distribution Networks (ADN s). While the electricity demand will increase within the ADN, the flexibility in VF &#8217;s electricity demand provides system operators with demand-side management opportunities. This paper proposes a model to explore the demand of various systems within a VF and their coordination with other assets within the ADN, such as Electric Vehicles (EV s) and photovoltaic (PV) systems. To this end, a framework to procure the optimal operation schedule of VF s under demand and solar generation uncertainties with convexified AC power flow constraints is presented. It is shown that the proposed framework also enhances the dispatchability of renewable Distributed Energy Resources (DER s). The formulated two-stage robust optimization problem is reformulated as a Mixed-Integer Second-Order Cone Programming (MISOCP) problem to be solved by reliable off-the-shelf solvers. It is shown that the demand response of VF s can mitigate the carbon emissions of the electricity and agriculture sectors by up to 70% and decrease the operation cost of the electricity network by 10% for the IEEE-33 bus system compared to utilizing an inflexible schedule for VF s.</description></item><item><title>Assessing Quantum Computing Performance for Energy Optimization in a Prosumer Community</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10153446</link><description>The efficient management of energy communities relies on the solution of the &#8220;prosumer problem&#8221;, i.e., the problem of scheduling the household loads on the basis of the user needs, the electricity prices, and the availability of local renewable energy, with the aim of reducing costs and energy waste. Quantum computers can offer a significant breakthrough in treating this problem thanks to the intrinsic parallel nature of quantum operations. The most promising approach is to devise variational hybrid algorithms, in which quantum computation is driven by parameters that are optimized classically, in a cycle that aims at finding the best solution with a significant speed-up with respect to classical approaches. This paper provides a reformulation of the prosumer problem, allowing to address it with a hybrid quantum algorithm, namely, Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), and with a recent variant, the Recursive QAOA. We report on an extensive set of experiments, on simulators and real quantum hardware, for different problem sizes. Results are encouraging in that Recursive QAOA is able, for problems involving up to 10 qubits, to provide optimal and admissible solutions with good probabilities, while the computation time is nearly independent of the system size.</description></item><item><title>Duck Curve Aware Dynamic Pricing and Battery Scheduling Strategy Using Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10159172</link><description>The duck curve is becoming a global problem in energy technology due to the rapid increase in solar power adoption and the rise of prosumers. To address this issue, a resource aggregator (RA) has emerged to provide flexible solutions through aggregating the prosumers and demand response such as dynamic pricing. This paper proposes an optimal strategy for the RA that dispatches dynamic pricing to the prosumers and leverages the battery system at both RA and prosumer levels. The proposed method is based on a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to optimize each prosumer&#8217;s retail prices and schedule usage of the RA&#8217;s battery power station. An objective reward function is used to maximize the RA&#8217;s profit, minimize the prosumer&#8217;s cost, and maximize the improvement of the duck curve. The performance of the proposed DRL-based strategy was demonstrated by simulation experiments using actual wholesale price, demand, and PV generation data. The results show that the proposed strategy can improve the standard deviation and peak-to-average ratio of net load by up to 57.1% and 23%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Economic Model Predictive Control for Microgrid Optimization: A Review</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10098893</link><description>Microgrids have emerged as a promising solution to integrate distributed energy resources (DERs) and supply reliable and efficient electricity.

To tackle this challenge, a fault current unified calculation (FCUC) method is proposed to achieve high-accuracy and high-speed mathematical analytical calculations of DFIG&#8217;s output fault current during FRT. The proposed FCUC method mainly includes: 1) Whole process unified state space model, which contains transition stage, crowbar protection stage, demagnetization stage, reactive current compensation stage, and dc-chopper protection stage, is established to thoroughly consider FRT&#8217;s different internal protection circuits and control strategies; 2) Stator output fault current is conducted by the unified state space model based on the stator residual voltage and the stator flux linkage; 3) Grid side converter (GSC) output fault current, which considers both injection mode and absorption mode, is developed based on the grid residual voltage and the unified state space model; 4) Fault current contribution mechanism, which is aggregated from both stator and grid side converter, is revealed based on Laplace transform from time-frequency-time domain, and is first expressed as an unified fault current expression. Extensive simulation/experimental/calculation results under different voltage sags have validated the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed FCUC method.</description></item><item><title>High Performance Platform to Detect Faults in the Smart Grid by Artificial Intelligence Inference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10109818</link><description>Inferring faults throughout the power grid involves fast calculation, large scale of data, and low latency. Our heterogeneous architecture in the edge offers such high computing performance and throughput using an Artificial Intelligence (AI) core deployed in the Alveo accelerator. In addition, we have described the process of porting standard AI models to Vitis AI and discussed its limitations and possible implications. During validation, we designed and trained some AI models for fast fault detection in Smart Grids. However, the AI framework is standard, and adapting the models to Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) has demanded a series of transformation processes. Compared with the Graphics Processing Unit platform, our implementation on the FPGA accelerator consumes less energy and achieves lower latency. Finally, our system balances inference accuracy, on-chip resources consumed, computing performance, and throughput. Even with grid data sampling rates as high as 800,000 per second, our hardware architecture can simultaneously process up to 7 data streams.</description></item><item><title>A Fully Distributed ADP Algorithm for Real-Time Economic Dispatch of Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10117499</link><description>This paper proposes a fully distributed approximate dynamic programming (FD-ADP) algorithm framework for real-time economic dispatch of a microgrid (MG). Firstly, a modified distributed consensus-based algorithm (DCBA) framework with power restriction factors is proposed to distributedly obtain the real-time ED decision of MG containing distributed energy resources with linear cost functions, which improves the convergence stability compared with the traditional DCBA framework. Then, combined with the approximate dynamic programming (ADP) theory, a FD-ADP algorithm is proposed to deal with data uncertainties. To this end, the piece-wise linear (PWL) function is applied to approximate the value function, and a distributed slope update approach is proposed to embed empirical knowledge into the value function while ensuring the distributed property in off-line training. With the well-trained PWL function assisting in decision, the distributed real-time ED strategy of MG with approximate global optimality is obtained by the proposed FD-ADP algorithm during the entire schedule horizon (e.g., 24 hours). Finally, case studies on the modified IEEE 6-bus MG system and IEEE 123-bus MG system demonstrate the superiority of solution convergence, validity of distributed training, and optimality of distributed schedule of the proposed FD-ADP algorithm.</description></item><item><title>A Two-Level Coordination Strategy for Distribution Network Balancing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10121816</link><description>Uncertain distributed energy resources and uneven load allocation cause the three-phase unbalance in distribution networks (DNs), which may harm the health of power equipment and increase the operational cost. There are emerging opportunities to balance three-phase DNs with a number of power electronic devices installed in the system. In this paper, we propose a novel two-level coordination strategy to improve the network balancing performance, where soft open points (SOPs) and phase switch devices (PSDs) are hierarchically coordinated in the network. At the upper level, a new type of SOPs with the function of phase switching is designed to explore the cross-phase power transfer ability; at the lower level, PSDs are utilized to flexibly allocate individual loads to specific phases. The two-level coordination strategy is typically formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. To solve the model accurately and efficiently, we develop a successive linearization algorithm to approximate it to a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem at each iteration. On this basis, we propose a heuristic time-independent fixing algorithm to further ease the computational burden by eliminating a large number of integer variables in the MILP problem. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Characteristics Analysis of Current-Controlled VSCs for Periodic Forced Oscillations Excited by Grid Frequency Disturbance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122628</link><description>Uncontrolled forced oscillations can jeopardize the power system security. Most modeling and analysis methods for forced oscillations in previous publications were linearization methods such that some new nonlinear oscillation phenomenon can not be reproduced powerfully. Based on the considerations above, this paper hopes to provide clearer understandings and recognitions to forced oscillations by theoretically reveal the characteristics. First, a dynamic model of the current-controlled VSCs system based periodic forced oscillations is established to describe the relationships between system parameters and intrinsic quantities. Then, the multi-scale method is introduced to derive the mathematical expressions of approximate analytical solutions and relationship equation. Next, these characteristics, containing jumping phenomenon, frequency shift, doubling frequency response, and frequency coupling, are found and described by analyzing the mathematical expressions. Final, all the results are tested and verified on simulations and experiments.</description></item><item><title>Transient Stability of Multiple Phase-Locked-Loop-Type Voltage Source Converters System Based on Amplitude Mapping Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122617</link><description>Compared to the traditional power grids, the multiple converters integration system are more vulnerable to the disturbances from transient events. However, the high-order characteristics of the system model is still a barrier not ignored. Inspired by averaging method of nonlinear vibration, the amplitude mapping model (AMM) is firstly proposed to evaluate the transient stability for multiple phase-locked-loop-type (PLL-type) voltage source converters (VSCs) system in this paper. Specifically, the origin and meaning of amplitude mapping model is introduced. Next, the mathematical model of the PLL-type VSCs system is derived. Based on AMM, the stability evaluation strategy of the PLL-type VSCs system is obtained. After that, the influence of key parameters, including the system gSCR, d-axis current reference, and PLL control parameters, on the system stability and the coupling effect between the VSCs are analyzed. Finally, a 6-VSCs 14-nodes system is applied to verify the correctness of the method proposed in this paper.</description></item><item><title>Battery Energy Storage System Planning Based on Super-Resolution Source-Load Uncertainty Reconstruction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10153756</link><description>Low-time resolution electricity data have been used to drive battery energy storage system (BESS) planning due to data barriers. However, the coarse-resolution time series cannot reflect real power variation, and the planning results may be inappropriate due to the unrealistic representation of source-load uncertainties. To this end, this paper proposes a BESS planning method based on super-resolution (SR) source-load uncertainty reconstruction. The Gramian angular field (GAF) is employed to transform the 1D time series into 2D images to enrich the time dependency of signals. With advanced computer vision (CV), the entropy decrease generative adversarial network (EDGAN) based on information-growth attention is designed to recover the source-load profile from low resolution to high resolution. To depict source-load uncertainties in BESS sizing, a two-stage multi-distributionally robust optimization (2S-MDRO) is established under SR ambiguity sets. Case studies validated the accuracy of the proposed SR method and proved the effectiveness of the proposed sizing model. The recommended time resolution for BESS planning is presented in the comparative results.</description></item><item><title>Fast Tuning-Free Distributed Algorithm for Solving the Network-Constrained Economic Dispatch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10159429</link><description>With the increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) and their participation in the electricity market, it becomes more desirable to apply distributed algorithms for resource allocation in order to address the resulting computational and communicational challenges. Most of the existing distributed algorithms for solving the network-constrained economic dispatch (NCED) problem require the tuning of certain auxiliary parameters. As a result, the robustness of these algorithms against the varieties in DERs is greatly undermined. In this paper, a new distributed algorithm, optimality condition consensus (OCC), is proposed to solve the NCED problem by using distributed power flow (DPF) and ratio consensus as fundamental tools. It inherits the advantages of existing distributed algorithms for the NCED problem but removes the need for parameter tuning to improve performance in practice. The effectiveness of the proposed distributed algorithm in terms of efficiency, scalability, and robustness is demonstrated through detailed case studies.</description></item><item><title>Collective Asset Sharing Mechanisms for PV and BESS in Renewable Energy Communities</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10159415</link><description>The energy sector transition to more decentralized and renewable structures requires greater participation by local consumers, which may be enabled by innovative models such as the setup of renewable energy communities (RECs). To maximize the self-consumption of local renewable energy generated by assets normally connected to the low voltage distribution grid, these RECs typically involve jointly owned assets such as collective photovoltaic solar panels (CPVs) and collective energy storage systems (CESS). This work proposes a novel mathematical model for a REC, accounting for three distinct economic approaches to the redistribution of collective benefits among community members. The main objective of this study is to understand how the participation of community members in collective assets (CAs) can help increase the fairness and equity of RECs. An illustrative REC case comprising members with individual and collective ownership of the assets is used to assess the proposed economic approaches. Extracting several answers, among them that the most advantageous configuration comes from agents with quotas in the CESS and CPV. An important conclusion is that depending on the selected economic approach, the social welfare and agent&#8217;s revenue vary significantly. In any case, CESSs increase equity among REC members.</description></item><item><title>An Active Learning-Based Approach for Hosting Capacity Analysis in Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10167824</link><description>With the increasing amount of distributed energy resources (DERs) integration, there is a significant need to model and analyze hosting capacity (HC) for future electric distribution grids. Hosting capacity analysis (HCA) examines the amount of DERs that can be safely integrated into the grid and is a challenging task in full generality because there are many possible integration of DERs in foresight. That is, there are numerous extreme points between feasible and infeasible sets. Moreover, HC depends on multiple factors such as (a) adoption patterns of DERs that depend on socioeconomic behaviors and (b) how DERs are controlled and managed. These two factors are intrinsic to the problem space because not all integration of DERs may be centrally planned, and could largely change our understanding about HC. This paper addresses the research gap by capturing the two factors (a) and (b) in HCA and by identifying a few most insightful HC scenarios at the cost of domain knowledge. We propose a data-driven HCA framework and introduce active learning in HCA to effectively explore scenarios. Active learning in HCA and characteristics of HC with respect to the two factors (a) and (b) are illustrated in a 3-bus example. Next, detailed large-scale studies are proposed to understand the significance of (a) and (b). Our findings suggest that HC and its interpretations significantly change subject to the two factors (a) and (b).</description></item><item><title>Event-Triggered Distribution System State Estimation: Sparse Kalman Filtering With Reinforced Coupling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10109025</link><description>A novel distribution system state estimation (DSSE) method is proposed for power distribution networks with low-observablity, where the measurements come from only a few distribution-level phasor measurement units (D-PMUs). The proposed DSSE method is event-triggered, which means the state variables are updated based on the information that is extracted from the events in the power distribution system. In this regard, the estimations of the state variables during the previous events are used as priori information to predict the state variables at the current event. Accordingly, a novel data-driven method based on elastic net regression analysis is proposed to learn the event-triggered state transition matrix. The DSSE problem is formulated as a generalized group Lasso problem, which is augmented based on the knowledge on the sparsity patterns of the state variables that are extracted from the analysis of the events. Here, in the absence of direct power measurements, we enhance our ability in sparse recovery by developing a new reinforced physics-based coupling method among the state variables, in which we add a novel set of linear differential power flow equations to the DSSE problem formulation in forms of virtual measurements. Finally, two different approaches are proposed to solve the formulated sparse event-triggered DSSE problem. The first approach is exact but computationally expensive, as it requires conducting a batch alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) analysis. The second approach is approximate, but it is much faster as it works based on a novel modified Kalman filter/smoother in the presence of  $\ell _{1}$ -norm.</description></item><item><title>A Remedy to Losing Time Synchronization at D-PMUs, H-PMUs, and WMUs in Event Location Identification in Power Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10130079</link><description>Recent advancements in synchronized sensor technologies has introduced an unprecedented level of visibility in power distribution systems. Apart from the Distribution-level Phasor Measurement Units (D-PMUs), a.k.a. micro-PMUs, that have been widely used in recent years, other synchronized sensors have also been developed in this field, including Harmonic Phasor Measurement Units (H-PMUs) and Waveform Measurement Units (WMUs). However, in practice, it is common for these sensors to lose time synchronization over some periods of time and for different reasons. In this paper, we propose new and customized solutions to tackle loss of time synchronization in D-PMUs, H-PMUs, and WMUs, whereby addressing the unique challenges in each case. Our focus is on solving the event location identification problem, for different types of steady-state and transient events. We show that, our methods can maintain high accuracy in event location identification, despite losing time synchronization, whether we use D-PMUs, H-PMUs, or WMUs.</description></item><item><title>ORCA: Outage Root Cause Analysis in DER-Rich Power Distribution System Using Data Fusion, Hierarchical Clustering and FP-Growth Rule Mining</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10140164</link><description>Power outages have been an inevitable part of power delivery systems. In case of large scale outages with conflicting information in the distribution network with distributed energy resources (DER), recognition of the root causes becomes increasingly complex. Root cause detection is very important for routing the crew and for faster restoration. Number of studies have been conducted on analysis of the outages, planning predictive actions, and improving the restoration process for minimization of the load outages using various statistical and data processing. A comprehensive methodology with the ability to find root causes in quick and efficient manner is still missing. This work proposes an Outage Root Cause Analysis (ORCA) tool, with various internal modules. The proposed ORCA utilizes the available data from diverse set of sensors (Distribution Phasor Measurement Units, metering and relay) within the distribution system (DS) to: a) aggregate using data fusion algorithm: an Ensemble Extended Kalman Filter (EEKF) approach, b) classify events at broader level (fault, breaker operation or cyber-attack with/without load outage) using hierarchical agglomerative clustering in online and offline manners, and c) narrow down the outage root cause to the possible nuanced identified causes (vegetation, animal, weather, wildfire, protection, equipment failure, planned) using the available historical data and the Frequent Pattern-Growth data mining approach. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach compared to the other existing key approaches using two different test systems and multiple outage with different locations case scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Tariff Bounding and Cooperation Stability in Power-Traffic Nexus: A Social Entity Perspective</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10109826</link><description>The growing interdependence between power distribution networks (PDNs) and transportation networks (TNs) has driven recent research on power-transportation coordination. This paper identifies three important gaps in current literature. First, the upper-bounding issue of the tariff-based incentives (road toll, charging service fee, etc) is not well addressed, which might raise drivers&#8217; dissatisfaction or compromise system performance. Second, the TN-PDN cooperation is generally built upon a simple assumption without any guarantee on its existence or stability. Third, the autonomy of network operators in tariff setting, operating goals, and data privacy is overlooked in prevailing bi-level social-cost-minimization frameworks. To bridge the above research gaps, this article proposes a novel tri-level framework where a social entity (SE) at the upper level sets the tariff bound towards the lowest social cost and dispenses subsidies towards a stable TN-PDN cooperation, network operators at the middle level jointly manage TNs and PDNs towards the optimal status, and travelers at the lower level decide charging&amp;amp;route choices to minimize individual travel cost. Cooperative Game Theory is adopted to characterize the cooperation and cost allocation between the middle-level operators, while the Core size is introduced to quantify the coalition stability and to guide the SE&#8217;s subsidization. A slope-identification based algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve the tri-level problem in a privacy-preserving manner, and a geometric analysis is conducted to deduce the Core size and the required subsidies. Extensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methods.</description></item><item><title>A Fast Polytope-Based Approach for Aggregating Large-Scale Electric Vehicles in the Joint Market Under Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10121812</link><description>The aggregation of electric vehicles (EVs) has been advocated as an effective means to manage and control large-scale plug-in EVs. However, the efficient aggregation is challenging due to the heterogeneity and uncertainty of individual EVs. To cope with this challenge, this paper puts forth a fast polytope-based aggregation approach, which could deal with the time-coupled, uncertain, and heterogeneous individual EV models. First, the feasible region of each EV&#8217;s power profiles is expressed as a polytope under H-representation considering various operational constraints. To improve the aggregation efficiency, H-representation reconstruction and polytopic projection processes are designed to address the heterogeneity of EVs. The uncertainties of EVs are modeled by the distributionally robust joint chance-constrained programming. The original individual and aggregate feasible region of EVs are subsequently inner approximated by the homothets of a basic prototype. Last, a day-ahead optimal bidding model for charging service provider in a joint market, including energy, peak-shaving and reserve markets, is developed. Numerical simulation results based on real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed aggregation method can improve both the computation efficiency and accuracy of approximate feasible region.</description></item><item><title>A Bilevel EV Charging Station and DC Fast Charger Planning Model for Highway Network Considering Dynamic Traffic Demand and User Equilibrium</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122631</link><description>The rapid electric vehicle (EV) adoption and relatively short EV driving range urge city planners to expand charging infrastructure (i.e., EV charging stations (EVCSs) and direct current fast chargers (DCFCs)) in the highway network for supporting long-distance intercity EV travels. To properly address distinct roles as well as interactions of the EVCS planner, traffic network, power distribution networks (PDNs), and drivers, this paper explores a bilevel planning model in which the upper level determines EVCS and DCFC construction plans and the two lower-level subproblems describe the user equilibrium-based traffic assignment model of the traffic network and the operation model of PDNs. Moreover, the statistical charging time is modeled in the traffic network subproblem as a function of statistical charging demand and the number of DCFCs, leveraging the macro traffic pattern and micro charging behavior of individual drivers with balanced accuracy and computational complexity. The proposed model also captures the impacts of social factors, charging infrastructure, and driver behaviors on dynamic EV traffic demands. Reformulation and linearization techniques are applied to convert the proposed bilevel problem into a tractable single-level mixed-integer linear programming model for effective computation. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested on an intercity highway network with multiple PDNs. The findings from numerical case studies highlight the important interplay among the construction plans of EVCSs and DCFCs, the PDN constraints, the user equilibrium traffic network, and the EV drivers. Case studies illustrate the feasibility and necessity of considering the number of DCFCs to calculate the macro-perspective charging time in the user equilibrium traffic network model. The dynamic traffic demand, induced by social factors and traffic demand elasticity, was also found to be a crucial factor in reshaping EV traffic. Thus, properly considering these important factors would lead to a more accurate quantification of traffic demands and ultimately result in a more reasonable charging facility construction plan.</description></item><item><title>A Game-Theoretic Approach for Electric Vehicle Aggregators Participating in Phase Balancing Considering Network Topology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10124247</link><description>With the increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs), uncontrolled charging of single-phase plug-in EVs will result in severe three-phase unbalance problem in distribution networks. To solve the problem, a phase balancing (PB) scheme performed by EV aggregators (EVAs) based on the linear multiphase power flow model is proposed in this paper. In the scheme, the PB compensations are provided to encourage EVAs to help the distribution system operator reduce the phase unbalance of the entire grid. Considering all EVAs are selfish and rational, the PB scheme is formulated as a game problem, in which each EVA competes with other EVAs to determine its charging strategy to minimize the charging cost minus the PB compensation. The consideration of coupling voltage constraints leads this game model to a challenging generalized Nash equilibrium problem (GNEP). By employing the theory of variational inequality, the properties of solutions for the GNEP are investigated. Furthermore, a two-level distributed algorithm is designed to find the unique variational solution, a fair and stable solution. Finally, comprehensive case studies are conducted on the IEEE-13 and IEEE-123 test systems to corroborate that the proposed PB game model can effectively mitigate voltage unbalance and cut EV users&#8217; costs.</description></item><item><title>EV Charging Command Fast Allocation Approach Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning With Safety Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10143999</link><description>Efficient real-time management of electric vehicle (EV) charging in a charging station (CS) is vital to the integration of large-scale EVs in power grids. It faces critical challenges such as frequent changes in the grid&#8217;s dispatch commands, the complexity of EVs&#8217; costs, and the uncertainties in the EVs&#8217; charging/traveling behaviors and in the future dispatch commands. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based allocation approach that optimally and efficiently allocates the grid&#8217;s commands to the EVs and controls their charging in real time. It includes two stages. Stage 1 includes a data-driven EV cost quantification method, which efficiently quantifies the EVs&#8217; flexibility contributions with long-term return consideration. Stage 2 proposes a high sample efficiency DRL-based allocation method, which optimizes the EVs&#8217; charging and addresses the EV- and grid-related uncertainties. The proposed allocation has a fast computational speed. Finally, to address the security risk due to DRL&#8217;s stochastic exploratory actions, two safety modules are developed which ensure the EV charging security and the allocation accuracy.

However, the large access of EVs brings tremendous passive influence on the stability and performance of power grid operation. Thus, it is valuable to investigate the charging power management method to improve charging experience of EV drivers while maintaining normal bus voltage of the power system. This paper builds the charging power control problem of multiple EVs as a hierarchical Markov decision process (MDP) model and propose a hierarchical multi-objective reinforcement learning method (Hamlet) to obtain the real-time charging power control decisions. Specifically, by treating EVs with the same remaining charging time as the same agent, this paper addresses the dynamic state and action spaces issue and significantly reduce the input dimension of both state and action spaces. Besides, this paper quantifies drivers&#8217; anxiety about the battery volume and distributes the comfort reward over the entire charging interval, which overcomes the delayed comfort reward issue. In order to alleviate the influence of multiple objectives on training stability, this paper develops a multi-objective learning method to dynamically adjust the optimization direction. Simulation results on IEEE 33 bus and 69 bus test feeders prove the validity of the proposed method in mitigating voltage fluctuation, minimizing bill payment and maximizing battery comfort.</description></item><item><title>An Augmented Lagrangian-Based Safe Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Carbon-Oriented Optimal Scheduling of EV Aggregators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10163488</link><description>This paper proposes an augmented Lagrangian-based safe off-policy deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for the carbon-oriented optimal scheduling of electric vehicle (EV) aggregators in a distribution network. First, practical charging data are employed to formulate an EV aggregation model, and its flexibility in both emission mitigation and energy/power dispatching is demonstrated. Second, a bilevel optimization model is formulated for EV aggregators to participate in day-ahead optimal scheduling, which aims to minimize the total cost without exceeding the given carbon cap. Third, to tackle the nonlinear coupling between the carbon flow and power flow, a bilevel model with a carbon cap constraint is formed as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). Finally, the CMDP is efficiently solved by the proposed augmented Lagrangian-based DRL algorithm featuring the soft actor-critic (SAC) method. Comprehensive numerical studies with IEEE distribution test feeders demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve a fine tradeoff between cost and emission mitigation with a higher computation efficiency compared with the existing DRL methods.</description></item><item><title>A Resilience Enhanced Secondary Control for AC Micro-Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10104161</link><description>Communication-based distributed secondary control is deemed necessary to restore the state of islanding AC microgrids to set points. As its limited global information, the microgrids become vulnerable to cyber-attacks, which by falsifying the communicating singles, like the angular frequency, can disturb the power dispatch in the microgrids or even induce blackout by pushing the microgrids beyond the safe operation area and triggering the protection. To make the microgrids more cyber secure, adaptive resilient control for the secondary frequency regulation is proposed. It assumes that each converter is communicating with its adjacent converters. With the proposed control, the weight of the communication channel being attacked is automatically reduced, and the more the communicating signals are falsified, the further the weight of that communication channel is weakened. The proposed approach does not rely on attack detection and thereby is easy to implement; Besides, it still works when challenged by a combination of multi-attack signals; Moreover, it applies to multiple communication lines getting attacked cases. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed resilient control scheme are validated by both simulations and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Cyberattack on Phase-Locked Loops in Inverter-Based Energy Resources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10108042</link><description>This article reveals power grid vulnerabilities by manipulating the phase-locked loop (PLL) in an inverter-based energy resource (IBER). An attacker can exploit the off-nominal frequency operation of a power grid coupled with stability and tracking properties of an IBER PLL to manipulate the inverter and grid operations during strong and weak grid conditions. Employing a modified IEEE-14 bus system, simulation studies show that PLL-based attack can cause: (i) revenue losses to IBER operators in weak and strong grid conditions, (ii) voltage limit violations and voltage profile deterioration at IBER bus under weak grid condition, and (iii) system-wide power-angle instability under weak and strong grid conditions. To detect the PLL-based attack, we propose attack severity index (ASI) by generating a detection error signal from local grid voltage measurements and PLL estimation. The attack is mitigated by incorporating security as an integral part of the PLL design, yielding a security-aware PLL.</description></item><item><title>Reliability Analysis of Cyber&#8211;Physical Energy Hubs: A Monte Carlo Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10109148</link><description>In this paper, the reliability of cyber-physical energy hubs (CPEHs) is evaluated based on the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method. Previous works in the related literature are generally focused on the physical layer of energy hubs (EHs). However, the security of EHs heavily relies on the reliable and safe performance of the cyber system. Therefore, this study considers the failure of cyber-physical components, data packet errors, and information transmission delay to improve the reliability assessment accuracy. The physical layer of the proposed CPEH is divided into two sections, namely heat and power sections, and reliability indices are calculated for both sections. Various scenarios are suggested to precisely analyze the effects of the cyber layer consideration on the CPEH reliability results. Sensitivity analysis on the failure rate of the components is also conducted to understand better the performance of the CPEH in situations with a higher risk of heat components&#8217; failure. The notable impacts of the cyber layer disturbances on the CPEH reliability evaluation are demonstrated through the simulation results.</description></item><item><title>Secure Particle Filtering With Paillier Encryption&#8211;Decryption Scheme: Application to Multi-Machine Power Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10113238</link><description>This paper is concerned with the encryption-decryption-based state estimation problem for a class of multi-machine power grids with non-Gaussian noises. For the purposes of security enhancement and data privacy protection, the Paillier encryption-decryption scheme is adopted to map the measurement data into the ciphertext space before being transmitted through the communication network. The aim of this paper is to develop a novel secure particle filter algorithm to cope with the nonlinearity/non-Gaussianity from the system plant and the decrypted signals after the measurement transmission. In particular, a modified likelihood function is proposed to obtain the importance weights where the encryption-decryption process of the measurement data is taken into full consideration. The developed algorithm is applied to multi-machine power grids, and it is demonstrated via simulation studies (on three test scenarios of the IEEE 39-bus power system) that our proposed secure state estimation scheme possesses the desired performance index in terms of security and accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Towards Resilient Energy Forecasting: A Robust Optimization Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10113854</link><description>Energy forecasting models deployed in industrial applications face uncertainty w.r.t. data availability, due to network latency, equipment malfunctions or data-integrity attacks. In particular, the case when a subset of features that has been used for model training becomes unavailable when the model is used operationally poses a major challenge to forecasting performance. Ad-hoc solutions, e.g., retraining without the missing features, may work for a small number of features, but they soon become impractical, as the number of models grows exponentially with the number of features. In this work, we present a principled approach to introducing resilience against missing features in energy forecasting applications via robust optimization. Specifically, we formulate a robust regression model that is optimally resilient against missing features at test time, considering both point and probabilistic forecasting. We develop three solution methods for the proposed robust formulation, all leading to Linear Programming problems, with varying degrees of tractability and conservativeness. We provide an extensive empirical validation of the proposed methods in prevalent applications, namely, electricity price, load, wind production, and solar production, forecasting, and we further compare against well-established benchmark models and methods of dealing with missing features, i.e., imputation and retraining. Our results demonstrate that the proposed robust optimization approach outperforms imputation-based models and exhibits similar performance to retraining without the missing features, while also maintaining computational practicality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that introduces resilience against missing features into energy forecasting.</description></item><item><title>Cyber-Resilient Automatic Generation Control for Systems of AC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10114674</link><description>In this paper we propose a co-design of the secondary frequency regulation in systems of AC microgrids and its cyber security solutions. We term the secondary frequency regulator a Micro-Automatic Generation Control  $(\mu $ AGC) for highlighting its same functionality as the AGC in bulk power systems. We identify sensory challenges and cyber threats facing the  $\mu $ AGC. To address the sensory challenges, we introduce a new microgrid model by exploiting the rank-one deficiency property of microgrid dynamics. This model is used to pose an optimal  $\mu $ AGC control problem that is easily implemented, because it does not require fast frequency measurements. An end-to-end cyber security solution to the False Data Injection (FDI) attack detection and mitigation is developed for the proposed  $\mu $ AGC. The front-end barrier of applying off-the-shelf algorithms for cyber attack detection is removed by introducing a data-driven modeling approach. Finally, we propose an observer-based corrective control for an islanded microgrid and a collaborative mitigation scheme in systems of AC microgrids. We demonstrate a collaborative role of systems of microgrids during cyber attacks. The performance of the proposed cyber-resilient  $\mu $ AGC is tested in a system of two networked microgrids.</description></item><item><title>FLLF: A Fast-Lightweight Location Detection Framework for False Data Injection Attacks in Smart Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10121794</link><description>This paper proposes a fast-lightweight location detection framework (FLLF) for false data injection attacks (FDIAs). The location detection of false data injection attacks is traditionally realized by computationally intensive neural networks, which can cause large detection delays due to the limited computation power and storage resources of the detection device. By contrast, the proposed method is lightweight and can be deployed on low-cost devices such as embedded devices, significantly improving detection speed while reducing power consumption. The proposed method consists of an efficient FDIA location detection model and an automatic model search algorithm. The model is a lightweight model that enables fast and accurate attack location detection through a combination of the early exiting mechanism and mixed-precision quantization (EE-MPQ). Then, an automatic model search algorithm is designed to enable the EE-MPQ model to match the smart grids with different structures. Finally, it is shown that the proposed method can accurately detect and locate FDIAs through numerical analysis on the IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus power systems.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Detection Scheme for Zero-Dynamics Attack on Wind Power System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10136373</link><description>In a wind farm, wind power system is key to maintaining continuous generation of point energy. Since Zero-Dynamics attack poses a major risk to future wind farms, investigation on the effect of Zero-Dynamics attack against wind power systems has both theoretical and practical importance. In this paper, we consider a scenario in which a wind power system is subject to Zero-Dynamics attack in power generation chain. Firstly, we transform a semi-direct D-PMSG into an equivalent circuit to establish mathematical model of wind power system under Zero-Dynamics attack. Then, we analyze and prove the advantages and limitations of Zero-Dynamics attack by divide the equation of state into a stable part and an unstable part with the help of system relative degree  $\rho $ . In addition, to better achieve desired attack effect, adjustments are made for Zero-Dynamics attack based on its limitations. Finally, we combine an Multiple Linear Regression (MRL) predictive control model with Byrnes-Isidori normal form to protect wind power system. The theoretical results were verified on designed small wind power system.</description></item><item><title>A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Undetectable Attacks Against Automatic Generation Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10159364</link><description>Automatic generation control (AGC) is an essential functionality for ensuring the stability of power systems, and its secure operation is thus of utmost importance to power system operators. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of AGC to false data injection attacks that could remain undetected by traditional detection methods based on the area control error (ACE) and the recently proposed unknown input observer (UIO). We formulate the problem of computing undetectable attacks as a multi-objective partially observable Markov decision process. We propose a flexible reward function that allows to explore the trade-off between attack impact and detectability, and use the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm for learning efficient attack policies. Through extensive simulations of a 3-area power system, we show that the proposed attacks can drive the frequency beyond critical limits, while remaining undetectable by state-of-the-art algorithms employed for fault and attack detection in AGC. Our results also show that detectors trained using supervised and unsupervised machine learning can both significantly outperform existing detectors.</description></item><item><title>Learning Distribution Grid Topologies: A Tutorial</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10113752</link><description>Unveiling feeder topologies from data is of paramount importance to advance situational awareness and proper utilization of smart resources in power distribution grids. This tutorial summarizes, contrasts, and establishes useful links between recent works on topology identification and detection schemes that have been proposed for power distribution grids. The primary focus is to highlight methods that overcome the limited availability of measurement devices in distribution grids, while enhancing topology estimates using conservation laws of power-flow physics and structural properties of feeders. Grid data from phasor measurement units or smart meters can be collected either passively in the traditional way, or actively, upon actuating grid resources and measuring the feeder&#8217;s voltage response. Analytical claims on feeder identifiability and detectability are reviewed under disparate meter placement scenarios. Such topology learning claims can be attained exactly or approximately so via algorithmic solutions with various levels of computational complexity, ranging from least-squares fits to convex optimization problems, and from polynomial-time searches over graphs to mixed-integer programs. Although the emphasis is on radial single-phase feeders, extensions to meshed and/or multiphase circuits are sometimes possible and discussed. This tutorial aspires to provide researchers and engineers with knowledge of the current state-of-the-art in tractable distribution grid learning and insights into future directions of work.</description></item><item><title>An Integrated Transfer Learning Method for Power Generation Prediction of Run-Off Small Hydropower in Data-Scarce Areas</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10129165</link><description>Historical data scarce and varying patterns of new built run-off small hydropower (RSHP) limits precise power generation prediction. Unforeseen hydropower can induce uneconomic power grid operations. To address this issue, a novel transfer learning method enabling integration of public RSHP knowledge is proposed. First, a RSHP data matching algorithm is proposed to pre-filter similar source domain data and produce a RSHP database matching patterns of target RSHP. This algorithm allows us to improve performance of transfer learning model. Next, public prediction knowledge implicated in the RSHP database is learned towards a CNN-BiLSTM hybrid pre-trained network. Then, the pre-trained network is transferred to the target RSHP prediction models by hyper-parameter fine-tuning algorithm, which reduces divergence between the pre-trained network outputs and the target domain data. As a result, accurate new RSHP prediction models can be generated under the challenge of data lack. At the last, the RSHP prediction models are fed back to the fine-tuning algorithm such that generalizability of the models enables life-long self-renewal. The real-world case demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method in terms of accuracy and data utilization. The average prediction error of the proposed method is 16.27% lower than the best traditional alternative.</description></item><item><title>Load Recognition in Hardware-Based Low Voltage Distribution Grids Using Convolutional Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10136822</link><description>Due to climate targets of the German government, the share of renewable energy in the power grid will be increased and the number of grid participants connected to the low voltage level of the power grid will rise. This leads to new requirements in voltage control, especially in low voltage distribution grids. In order to achieve a stable power grid in future, further development of control strategies is necessary. In this paper, a load recognition concept, which was tested on simulative data in previous work, is further developed to reduce simulation effort. Additionally, the concept is adapted for real hardware influences and active grid participants complicating the recognition task. Thus, the main contribution of this study is the successful application of the methodology within a hardware-based test grid containing a charging electric vehicle. Using a convolutional neural network in a time series classification setting, the recognition rates in this use-case exceeded 99 % while benefiting from an asymmetric charging behavior. Due to these promising results, future voltage control strategies could be supported based on gained information through integration of the presented concept.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Residential Load Forecasting With Baseline-Refinement Profiles and Bi-Attention Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10168194</link><description>With the development of smart grid and renewable energy technologies, residential load forecasting has become an increasingly important task. Short-term residential load forecasting is not only conducive to power dispatching and peak-shaving and valley filling of the grid, but also good for residents to obtain higher economic benefit from renewable energy. This paper proposes a new baseline-refinement forecasting framework consisting of two main steps, baseline profile construction and refinement predictions. Firstly, a baseline profile construction method is proposed to forecast the baseline load profile based on the similarity and cyclic patterns of daily load profiles. Secondly, for the refinement predictions, a bi-attention mechanism is proposed by combining self-attention mechanism and external attention mechanism to fulfill the feature transformation and is included in the temporal convolutional network to refine the baseline profile. The final load forecasting results are obtained by aggregating the baseline profile and the refinement predictions. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework has smaller forecasting errors and higher forecasting stability than the commonly used models on two load forecasting metrics.</description></item><item><title>A Light Blockchain for Behind-the-Meter Peer-to-Peer Energy Transactions in Cyber-Physical Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10097637</link><description>Household-level distributed energy sources, such as rooftop photovoltaic, microturbines, and energy storage, become important behind-the-meter (BTM) resources. BTM resources can meet all or part of users&#8217; demands. Establishing a peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading network among these users will further promote the utilization of BTM resources. However, such a proposal faces the problem that cyber trading and physical dispatching are difficult to coordinate. Therefore, this paper proposes the architecture of the behind-the-meter peer-to-peer (BTM-P2P) energy trading system, including the cyber layer and physical layer. To ensure that users strictly execute the cyber trading results in the physical layer, a trading mechanism considering credit is designed, and the user&#8217;s credit has an impact on the bidding priority, which in turn urges the user to strictly execute in subsequent tradings. Then, a light blockchain suitable for energy trading is developed, ensuring that both the trading results and the actual dispatching results are not tampered with. Database technology is inserted in the light blockchain to improve efficiency. Finally, a BTM-P2P cyber-physical testbed coupling physical dispatching with cyber trading is built, providing technical support for the implementation of BTM-P2P.</description></item><item><title>A High-Efficiency and Incentive-Compatible Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10102333</link><description>Due to the rapid development of demand response management and distributed energy resources, prosumers are becoming more proactive, which also promotes the emergence of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading mechanisms. However, we find that it is quite difficult to simultaneously achieve high computational efficiency, decentralized operations and solution optimality in a P2P energy trading mechanism, which is called the &#8220;P2P energy trading trilemma&#8221;. In this paper, we first propose a novel negotiation mechanism for P2P energy trading that can maximize social welfare in a decentralized manner and respect physical network constraints. Then, the local optimization problem is transformed into a closed-form alternating update algorithm (AUA), so that the computational efficiency can be greatly improved. Therefore, our proposed mechanism solves the &#8220;P2P energy trading trilemma&#8221; to a certain extent. Another challenge is that the locational marginal price (LMP)-based market mechanism cannot satisfy the incentive-compatible property. To encourage prosumers to cooperate in a lack-of-trust environment, a novel incentive-compatible mechanism is proposed for P2P energy trading using consensus mechanism inspired by proof of solution (PoSo) and smart contract (SC). Finally, we simulate the functionality of the mechanism in terms of convergence performance, reliability, scalability, computational efficiency, and SC operations.</description></item><item><title>Blockchain-Based Decentralized Frequency Control of Microgrids Using Federated Learning Fractional-Order Recurrent Neural Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10103197</link><description>This paper presents a blockchain-based decentralized frequency control of an islanded microgrid (MG) using a novel federated learning fractional order recurrent neural network (FL-FORNN). A self-adaptive proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is proposed using FL-FORNN to handle the uncertainties of power generation by the prosumers while participating in the trading of the islanded MG. In this work, the frequency oscillations during peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading are regulated through the appropriate design of an adaptive controller and the implementation of a smart contract participation matrix (SCPM) for balancing the generation and consumer demand. A Proof-of-Authority (PoA) private blockchain-based SCPM has been developed to secure the contract among peers. The SCPM provides the power demand information from a consumer to a prosumer who participates in the P2P energy market. It also provides power reference to the prosumer distributed generation as a supplementary control, in addition to the secondary frequency control of the system. To study this, an islanded MG comprising four source nodes (prosumers) and three demand nodes (consumers) are tested with the implementation of the PoA-based blockchain framework. With its SCPM calculation running in the blockchain framework, the decentralized control of prosumers is implemented by interfacing the OPAL-RT with Raspberry Pi devices. The robustness of the proposed FL-FORNN controller has been verified with the FORNN tuned PID controller. Furthermore, a comparative analysis is made with the centralized scheme and traditional decentralized frequency control technique.</description></item><item><title>A Generalizable Method for Practical Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring via Metric-Based Meta-Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10090473</link><description>Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) has become a research boom due to its energy-saving benefits as the smart grid develops and the greenhouse effect intensifies. However, existing NILM models may perform poorly in the target domains collected from different sources, or those containing unseen appliance types, blocking the rollout of NILM. In contrast to the methods that update the trained model on the unseen data to handle domain shift or heterogeneous label space, this paper proposes a novel generalizable NILM method based on metric-based meta-learning and supervised pre-training. It beforehand learns the cross-domain meta-knowledge through meta-training to eliminate the need for parameter updates in the target domain. Moreover, this method is specifically designed for practical deployments at the edge where both labeled instances and computation resources are limited. The proposed method transforms the appliance current into a metric vector via lightweight 1D convolution and then uses the relation module to propagate the labels via similarity. The experimental results on three public datasets and the proposed dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve high generalization performance in different datasets, user&#8217;s houses, appliance brands, and appliance types.</description></item><item><title>A Survey of Power System State Estimation Using Multiple Data Sources: PMUs, SCADA, AMI, and Beyond</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10153770</link><description>State estimation (SE) is indispensable for the situational awareness of power systems. Conventional SE is fed by measurements collected from the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. In recent years, available data sources have been greatly enriched with the deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs), advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), intelligent electronic devices (IEDs), etc. The integration of multiple data sources provides unprecedented opportunities for enhancing the performance of SE, but also presents major challenges to resolve, including optimal multi-type-sensor co-placement, multiple reporting rates and asynchronization, diverse types of measured quantities, correlations between measurements, integration of online and historical data sources, and system and measurement uncertainties. This paper outlines the state of the art and research opportunities in this area by providing a comprehensive literature review and extensive discussions. It starts by presenting the motivations and challenges, followed by a summary of existing data sources for SE in power systems. Subsequently, for both transmission system (static and dynamic) and distribution system SE, existing methods are systematically reviewed and categorized based on the addressed challenges. Interesting attempts of using novel measurements in SE are also studied. Finally, the paper concludes by providing a detailed discussion on the remaining research gaps and future research directions to be explored.</description></item><item><title>Appliance Identification via Combinatorial Fusion Analysis-Assisted Bayesian-Optimized Classifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10154009</link><description>Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) aids in estimating the individual energy consumed by different appliances using aggregate signals measured at point of common connection. This paper explores various unexplored aspects concerning load classification in NILM. Rich feature sets are extracted from load signatures using auto-correlogram, Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), and Wavelet Packet Tree (WPT) decomposition. Typically, previous works employ a single Feature Selection (FS) technique to earmark the relevant features for improved performance of NILM. However, each FS technique behaves uniquely, and the effects of using different FS techniques or their combinations have yet to be explored for NILM. Hence, Combinatorial Fusion Analysis (CFA), which surpasses the performance of a single FS technique by considering an optimal combination of multiple FS techniques, is used in this paper. The final selected features are fused and provided to a classifier. Rather than manually tuning or performing an exhaustive search for setting the classifier&#8217;s hyper-parameters, as prevalent in previous works, the present work utilizes Bayesian Optimization (BO) comprising surrogate and acquisition functions. The proposed work&#8217;s efficacy is validated on publicly available data-sets in a host computer and an embedded device, namely, R-Pi, via comparison with previous works.</description></item><item><title>Distribution System Flexibility Characterization: A Network-Informed Data-Driven Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10298800</link><description>A distribution system can flexibly adjust its substation-level power output by aggregating its local distributed energy resources (DERs). Due to DER and network constraints, characterizing the exact feasible power output region is computationally intensive. Hence, existing results usually rely on unpractical assumptions or suffer from conservativeness issues. Sampling-based data-driven methods can potentially address these limitations. Still, existing works usually exhibit computational inefficiency issues as they use a random sampling approach, which carries little information from network physics and provides few insights into the iterative search process. This letter proposes a novel network-informed data-driven method to close this gap. A computationally efficient data sampling approach is developed to obtain high-quality training data, leveraging network information and legacy learning experience. Then, a classifier is trained to estimate the feasible power output region with high accuracy. Numerical studies based on a real-world Southern California Edison network validate the performance of the proposed work.</description></item><item><title>Average Channel Capacity Bounds of a Dynamic Vehicle-to-Vehicle Visible Light Communication System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268069</link><description>As vehicles trajectories are unpredictable and changing dynamically, vehicle-to-vehicle visible light communication (V2V-VLC) experiences a dynamic channel. In this work, we conduct measurements taking into account different realistic inter-vehicle distances and ambient noise levels at different times of the day in order to model and verify the dynamic V2V-VLC channel. We also derive the average channel capacity bounds by considering the impact of traffic at different times of the day, atmospheric turbulence and fog. Considering both peak and average optical power levels constraints, we derive the upper and lower bounds by using sphere packing and constraint relaxation methods, as well as truncated-exponential and truncated Gaussian distributions, respectively. The results show that the constraint relaxation method provides an improved estimation for the upper bound, whereas the truncated exponential distribution tightens the lower bound with a minimum gap of 0.4 b/s/Hz during rush hour and in a clear weather condition. We also show that the average capacity bounds of V2V-VLC are less affected by atmospheric turbulence and fog, and that the capacity during rush hours is higher by 0.7 b/s/Hz than during late hours.</description></item><item><title>A 3D Geometry-Based Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces-Assisted mmWave Channel Model for High-Speed Train Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10271728</link><description>In this article, a 3D geometry-based millimeter-wave channel model is proposed for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted high-speed train communications. Remarkably, the RIS is attached to surface of train window to guarantee the channel between RIS and receiver is quasi-static, and radiation pattern of RIS element and penetration loss caused by train carriage are taken into account. Furthermore, two RIS phase optimization cases are presented and compared, and a heuristic vector method is applied to further describe RIS phase optimization algorithms for LoS and NLoS scenarios. Based on the proposed model, channel statistical characteristics, namely, spread function and space-time correlation function are derived and analyzed, and impacts of RIS phase optimization cases and channel parameters on channel statistical properties are investigated. The results demonstrate that effective RIS phase optimization schemes increase amplitude of channel impulse response and mitigate small-scale fading caused by high-speed movement and multipath effect, and the phase optimization case that phase of sum of SBR and MBR components to align with the phase of BS-Rx link can achieve higher received power. Moreover, RIS phase optimization cases enhance correlation coefficients in space and time domains by adjusting phase in real time. It is found that correlation functions of RIS phase aligned with LoS components are more stable than case that phase of SBR plused MBR components aligned with phase of BS-Rx link for arbitrary carrier frequencies, angle spread, time instant, number of RIS elements, and moving speed. These observations can be used to provide a foundation for designing and developing RIS-assisted high-speed train communication systems.</description></item><item><title>Sliding Mode Control for High-Speed Train via Event-Triggered Strategy Under Energy-Limited Deception Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10242018</link><description>The event-triggered sliding mode control (ETSMC) for high-speed train (HST) is addressed under the energy-limited deception attacks (DA), where the multibody, transmission delay and network bandwidth of HST are considered in unity. Firstly, the error equation of HST with transmission delays is built with the time-varying running resistance. Then, the sliding mode surface (SMS) function is constructed, and the event-triggered mechanism is established to balance the transmission frequency and HST stability. Next, under the energy-limited DA, sufficient conditions are deduced and converted into linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). An ETSMC scheme is established to guarantee the reachability condition of SMS within a finite time. Finally, an example from Japan Shinkansen HST is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed ETSMC.</description></item><item><title>A Novel mmWave Beam Alignment Approach for Beyond 5G Autonomous Vehicle Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10246397</link><description>Nowadays, directional communication represents a high potential solution for Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication in Beyond-Fifth-Generation (B5G) vehicular networks, using the millimeter wave (mmWave) technique. Due to the high mobility in the vehicular environment and to ensure a higher data rate to establish a reliable V2X communication link, an efficient beam alignment is needed to point the optimal direction between the moving vehicle and the mmWave base station. To deal with this issue, we propose in this paper a new beam alignment method to select the optimal beam angle of Departure (AoD) from the mmWave base station, used further to transmit data toward the moving vehicle directly. The novelty of our proposal concerns the suggestion of an original hybrid beam alignment approach, combining a 128-filters-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and 4-layers based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM). The selected angle is performed automatically for each vehicle position with the lowest error probability and the highest received signal power. The performance of our proposed CNN-BiLSTM model was evaluated using popular regression metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and root-mean-square error (RMSE). The results show that our model achieved values of at least 0.0107, 0.0765, and 0.103 for MSE, MAE, and RMSE, respectively, outperforming other machine learning algorithms such as KNN regressor, SVR, BiLSTM, and CNN-LSTM.</description></item><item><title>Authentication and PHY-Security Schemes for Electric Vehicle Dynamic Wireless Charging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10261276</link><description>This article proposes authentication and physical layer security schemes to improve secure communications between the electric vehicle (EV) and charging infrastructure in dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) systems. In particular, a double-encryption with the signature (DoES) scheme is proposed for session key exchange between EV and charging station which provides data authenticity and integrity. To enable low-latency authentication between EV and power transmitter (PT) in DWPT systems, a sign-encrypt-message (SEM) authentication code scheme is designed leveraging symmetric keys for dynamic charging, which ensures privacy and resistance to tampering attacks. The artificial noise-based physical layer security (AN-based PLS) scheme is also proposed at the physical layer to degrade the wiretapped signal quality of multiple eavesdroppers operating in non-colluding and colluding cases. Closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and intercept probability (IP) of the considered system with the non-colluding case are derived to show that the proposed AN-based PLS scheme provides lower SOP and IP than the conventional ones without AN. The distance between eavesdroppers and the PT also affects the system SOP and IP in both non-colluding and colluding cases. Moreover, the EV using the DoES scheme takes 52 ms for obtaining session keys from the charging station while it only spends 8.23 ms with the SEM scheme to authenticate with PT for the charging process.</description></item><item><title>A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Eco-Driving in Connected and Automated Hybrid Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10261312</link><description>Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), in particular those with multiple power sources, have the potential to significantly reduce fuel consumption and travel time in real-world driving conditions. In particular, the eco-driving problem seeks to design optimal speed and power usage profiles based upon look-ahead information from connectivity and advanced mapping features, to minimize the fuel consumption over a given itinerary. In this work, the eco-driving problem is formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), which is then solved with a state-of-art Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) Actor Critic algorithm, Proximal Policy Optimization. An eco-driving simulation environment is developed for training and evaluation purposes. To benchmark the performance of the DRL controller, a baseline controller representing the human driver, a trajectory optimization algorithm and the wait-and-see deterministic optimal solution are presented. With a minimal onboard computational requirement and a comparable travel time, the DRL controller reduces the fuel consumption by more than 17% compared against the baseline controller by modulating the vehicle velocity over the route and performing energy-efficient approach and departure at signalized intersections, over-performing the more computationally demanding trajectory optimization method.</description></item><item><title>Intelligent Underwater Object Detection and Image Restoration for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10262183</link><description>Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) have been reliable and economical technological solutions to perform undersea monitoring tasks in comparison to manned vehicles. However, in many situations, UUV is unable to fulfill complex undersea research tasks since target objects appear distorted due to light absorption and scattering. Besides, ocean surveying undergoes severe power requirements compared to terrestrial systems because of battery-driven low-storage vehicles like Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs). Therefore, limited power supply, motion resistance of water medium, and distorted target object appearance can delay the mission and reduce the efficiency of UUV in their underwater operations. Considering the resource-constrained undersea monitoring setup, we propose an intelligent two-stage framework for expeditious monitoring of underwater scenes. First, an effective deep neural network is employed for underwater object/region of interest (ROI) detection. Then the detected ROI is restored using an efficient restoration method, thereby improving the visual quality of the degraded images and aiding the navigating and monitoring tasks of UUVs. Our method has been objectively and subjectively assessed using 9 evaluation metrics and our key results reveal mAP of 94.35% and an Underwater Color Image Quality Evaluation (UCIQE) score of 3.09, surpassing state-of-the-art methods for object detection. Furthermore, the execution time of 0.550 secs is required for object detection and dehazing, making this proposal suitable for UUVs to perform automatic undersea object detection and dehazing within operational running requirements.</description></item><item><title>Area Surveillance With Low Detection Probability Using UAV Swarms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10267876</link><description>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) deployed as a swarm can offer a flexible and cost-efficient solution for surveillance missions in large-scale adversarial environments. UAV swarms possess superior real-time surveillance capabilities in detecting time-sensitive targets with speed and security, surpassing alternative techniques such as satellites and ground-based sensors. However, the area surveillance problem in adversarial scenarios using UAV swarms necessitates careful consideration of factors such as swarm positioning, flight attitudes, antenna directionality, the threat posed by adversary detection systems (ADSs), and swarm network topology. To address this challenge, we propose the Integrated Low Detection Probability (ILDP) deployment method for UAV swarms, which incorporates the Danger Avoidance Distributed Motion control algorithm (DADM) for swarm collaboration and the Low Detection Probability Topology Control algorithm (LDPTC) for swarm networking. The DADM algorithm facilitates swarm cooperation in achieving area coverage and evading ADSs by leveraging neighboring, environmental, and threat information in adversarial scenarios. Furthermore, the LDPTC algorithm establishes a topology optimization model that comprehensively considers swarm distribution and the impact of directional antenna sidelobes to reduce transmitting energy leakage on the ground. Our strategy significantly decreases the detection probability of UAV swarms by ADSs, ensuring the operational effectiveness of UAV swarms in dynamic adversarial scenarios. Extensive simulations validate the superiority of our proposed ILDP method, demonstrating considerably lower detection probabilities compared to other approaches in static and dynamic adversary environments across various swarm scales. Moreover, our method excels in real-time surveillance capabilities with lower computational complexity, freeing up computing resources for UAVs to fulfill additional tasks.</description></item><item><title>Novel Method for Insulation Degradation Location of Rail Transit System Based on Fiber Grating</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10255312</link><description>The insulation performance of fasteners in the running rails is one of the important factors affecting stray current leakage. Thus, it is of great significance for realizing the detection of insulation degradation location to the safe operation of rail transit system. In this work, insulation degradation location method of rail transit system is proposed based on the central wavelength variation of fiber grating voltage sensor. In this method, the potential distribution of insulation fasteners under different insulation damage conditions was studied for unilateral power supply. Results show that voltage drop of insulation fasteners can serve as the detection parameter of insulation degradation location. Combined with the distributed monitoring requirements of rail insulation degradation, a high-resolution two-end cemented FBG sensor was proposed with optimized structure. The effects of cementation layer and fiber grating (FBG) pasting process on strain transfer and sensitivity of fiber grating voltage sensors were investigated. Finally, an experimental system for the insulation degradation location of rail transit system based on FBG voltage sensor was built for performance verification. Different insulation degradation positions were set to analyze the voltage drop distribution of insulation fasteners. Experimental results indicate that the voltage drop distribution of the insulation fasteners is obviously affected by the location of insulation degradation, and accurate determination of these locations can be achieved by identifying abrupt changes in the central wavelength variation distribution.</description></item><item><title>Gaussian Process With Automatic Relevance Determination Predictive Model for Energy Management of Electric Direct-Drive Wheels: Experimental Validation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10258308</link><description>Energy consumption by direct-driven electric in-wheel motors is massively crucial for optimized power management.

The proposed antenna mainly comprised a 2 &#215; 2 MMW subarray, an 8-element DSRC subarray and a corresponding 5-port feeding network. The radiating patches of the MMW subarray are excited by two pairs of coaxial-to-substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) transition (CST) feeding networks that are comprised of two 3-dB couplers, two 90$^{\circ }$-phase shifters, and four power dividers (PDs), which provide in-phase and differential-phase output signals to achieve single-beam and conical-beam radiation patterns. On the other hand, the 8 monopoles of the DSRC subarray arranged around the aforementioned MMW radiator are excited by a coaxial-to-SIW-to-coaxial transition (CSCT) feeding network that includes a 1-to-4 SIW PD and four 1-to-2 microstrip PDs to form an omni-directional radiation and achieve a large frequency ratio (LFR). Measured results indicate that wide bandwidths of 15.44% (24.14-28.18 GHz), 16.09% (24.29-28.54 GHz), 15.01% (23.85-27.72 GHz), and 14.29% (24.05-27.75 GHz) with corresponding high peak gains of 10.97$\pm$1.03 dBi, 11.71$\pm$1.32 dBi, 10.84$\pm$1.00 dBi, and 11.29$\pm$1.28 dBi are obtained by the four MMW subarray ports, while a bandwidth of 11.40% (5.46-6.12 GHz) with an azimuth-plane gain of 0.64 dBi and a peak gain of 4.29$\pm$0.19 dBi for the DSRC subarray port are also obtained. Besides, low cross-polarization (X-pol) levels of &#8722;24 dB and &#8722;27 dB are achieved for the two subarrays, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Control Allocation-Based Automatic Transmission Upshift Control Strategy for Inertia Phase</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10269760</link><description>The development of a vehicle equipped with a step-ratio automatic transmission (AT) requires manual calibration to enhance the shift quality. This involves labor-intensive iterations in a prototype vehicle to balance shift time, smoothness, and energy for every realizable gear combination. An improved shift control method is desired to deliver optimized shift quality with reduced calibration needs. This article proposes a hierarchical optimal control strategy for AT upshift aimed at optimizing shift time, comfort, and thermal loss during the inertia phase with minimal calibration effort for faster product development. The strategy consists of a static model-based predictive controller coupled with an optimal control allocation algorithm. The superimposed variable-gain feedback controller commands the AT input torque required to complete the inertia phase in the specified time. The optimal control allocation algorithm coordinates two clutches and the engine by solving a constrained quadratic programming problem to deliver the desired input torque, and minimize AT output torque tracking error and clutch power loss for shift comfort and thermal efficiency, respectively. The modulation of the off-going clutch allows fast, yet comfortable shifts as compared to the conventional shift control. The online performance of the control strategy is verified by realistic shift simulations and compared to the optimal profiles established through off-line control parameter optimization. The ease of shift calibration is demonstrated by setting different targets for shift time and output torque profile. The control robustness is verified against clutch torque and engine torque delivery errors.</description></item><item><title>Joint Trajectory and Resource Optimization of MEC-Assisted UAVs in Sub-THz Networks: A Resources-Based Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization DRL With Attention Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10238831</link><description>The use of Terahertz (THz) technology in sixth-generation (6G) networks will bring high-speed and capacity data services. But limitations like molecular absorption, rain attenuation, and limited coverage range cause communication losses. To overcome these losses and improve coverage in rural areas, a high number of base stations are required. Hence, an aerial communication platform, which uses line-of-sight (LoS) communication to avoid losses, is needed. To address this, we study the deployment and optimization of multi-access edge computing (MEC)-powered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for sub-THz communication in remote areas. To this end, we solve an optimization problem to minimize energy consumption and delay for MEC-UAV and mobile users. The formulated problem is a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. As the problem is an MINLP, we decompose the main problem into two subproblems. Due to its convex nature, we solve the first subproblem with a standard optimization solver, i.e., CVXPY. To solve the second subproblem, we design a resources-based multi-agent proximal policy optimization (RMAPPO) deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm with an attention mechanism. The considered attention mechanism is utilized for encoding a diverse number of observations. This is designed by the network coordinator to provide a differentiated fit reward to each agent in the network. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmark and yields a network utility that is 2.22%, 15.55%, and 17.77% more than the benchmarks.</description></item><item><title>Downlink Analysis and Evaluation of Multi-Beam LEO Satellite Communication in Shadowed Rician Channels</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10243147</link><description>A multi-beam low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite delivers widespread coverage by forming spot beams that tessellate cells on the surface of the Earth. In doing so, co-channel interference manifests between cells when reusing frequency spectrum across spot beams. To permit forecasting of such multi-beam satellite communication system performance, this work characterizes desired and interference signal powers under the Shadowed Rician (SR) sky-to-ground channel model, along with SNR, INR, SIR, and SINR. Specifically, we present a framework for analyzing system performance by capitalizing on the fact that the desired and interfering signals travel along almost the same path in such multi-beam satellite systems. We then introduce a minor approximation on the fading order of SR channels that significantly simplifies the probability distribution function and cumulative distribution function of these quantities and facilitates performance analyses of LEO satellite systems. We conclude this article with an evaluation of multi-beam LEO satellite communication in SR channels of varying intensity with shadowing parameters fitted from existing measurements. Our numerical results highlight the effect satellite elevation angle has on SNR, INR, and SINR, which brings attention to the variability in system state and potential performance as a satellite traverses across the sky along its orbit.</description></item><item><title>Design and Analysis of Clustering-Based Joint Channel Estimation and Signal Detection for NOMA</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10246432</link><description>We propose a joint channel estimation and signal detection approach for the uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) using unsupervised machine learning. We apply a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to cluster the received signals, and accordingly optimize the decision regions to enhance the symbol error rate (SER) performance. We show that, when the received powers of the users are sufficiently different, the proposed clustering-based approach achieves an SER performance on a par with that of the conventional maximum-likelihood detector (MLD) with full channel state information (CSI). We study the tradeoff between the accuracy of the proposed approach and the blocklength, as the accuracy of the utilized clustering algorithm depends on the number of symbols available at the receiver. We provide a comprehensive performance analysis of the proposed approach and derive a theoretical bound on its SER performance. Our simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and verify that the calculated theoretical bound can predict the SER performance of the proposed approach well. We further explore the application of the proposed approach to a practical grant-free NOMA scenario, and show that its performance is very close to that of the optimal MLD with full CSI, which usually requires long pilot sequences.</description></item><item><title>A Neural Network-Aided Detection Scheme for Index-Modulation DCSK System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10246421</link><description>The accuracy of index-bit detection greatly affects the overall bit-error-rate (BER) performance of index modulation aided differential chaos shift keying (IM-DCSK). To improve the BER performance of index bits, a novel neural network (NN)-aided IM-DCSK detection scheme, referred to as NN-IM-DCSK detection scheme, is proposed in this article. The proposed scheme can be applied to various IM-DCSK systems, such as carrier index DCSK, pulse position modulation DCSK, and code index modulation DCSK systems. The NN-IM-DCSK detection scheme uses a two-layer long short-term memory unit and multiple fully connected layers to extract the features and the correlation of IM-DCSK signals. By estimating the index bits from the configured NN framework, the scheme can make correct correlation to retrieve modulated bits. Therefore, the NN-IM-DCSK detection scheme that benefits from the advantage of both the NN and traditional energy detection can improve transmission reliability. The complexity of the NN-IM-DCSK system is analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed detection scheme can achieve better BER performance than the traditional detection scheme, such as the energy detection scheme, in IM-DCSK systems over multipath Rayleigh fading channels.</description></item><item><title>Res-GAN for Behavioral Modeling and Pre-Distortion of Power Amplifiers in OFDM-Based Satellite Communication System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10258313</link><description>In satellite communications, the power amplifier (PA) plays a vital role in enhancing the transmission performance of signals. However, the non-linearity of PAs often distorts the transmitted signals, degrading communication performance. Digital pre-distortion (DPD) is one of the most effective linearization technologies to address the abovementioned issue and improve PA performance. Neural networks (NNs) outperform traditional models in PA behavioral modeling and linearization due to their strong nonlinear fitting capability, but the lack of learning data distributions limits the performance. Hence, this article proposes a novel behavioral and linearization model for PA, utilizing the residual generative adversarial network (Res-GAN). The proposed model can extract deep features of the PA with enhanced accuracy, thereby improving PA linearization performance. Simulation results show that the proposed Res-GAN behavioral model achieves the normalized mean squared error (NMSE) of &#8722;55.737 dB. Additionally, the Res-GAN DPD outperforms traditional DPD models by a reduction in the NMSE of about 2 dB and the adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) of about 2-4 dBc.</description></item><item><title>UAV-Enabled Multi-Pair Massive MIMO-NOMA Relay Systems With Low-Resolution ADCs/DACs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10251558</link><description>In this article, we consider an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled massive multiple-input multiple-out (MIMO) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) full-duplex (FD) two-way relay (TWR) system with low-resolution analog-to-digital converters/digital-to-analog converters (ADCs/DACs), where the UAV provide services for multi-pair ground users (GUs). By employing maximum ratio combining/maximum ratio transmission (MRC/MRT), the approximate closed-form expressions for sum spectrum/energy efficiency (SE/EE) with imperfect channel state information (CSI), imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) and quantization noise are derived. To evaluate the effects of the parameters on system performance, the asymptotic analysis and the power scaling laws are further provided. Finally, an optimization scheme is proposed to maximize the SE of the considered system. The numerical results verify the accuracy of theoretical analysis and show that the interference and noise can be effectively eliminated by deploying large-scale antennas and applying proper power scaling law. We also demonstrate that the proposed system can obtain better SE by adjusting the height of the UAV. Moreover, the system performance is related to the ADCs/DACs quantization bits, where the SE saturation values increase by increasing number of quantization bits, while the EE first increases and then decreases. Finally, the SE/EE trade-off at low precision ADCs/DACs can be achieved by choosing the appropriate number of quantization bits, and the trade-off region grows as Rician factor increases.</description></item><item><title>Resource Allocation for Joint Communication and Positioning in mmWave Ad Hoc Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10251988</link><description>Joint communication and positioning will be a critical driver in future wireless networks for emerging application areas. Supporting mobility, Ad-hoc networks can freely and dynamically self-organize an arbitrary and temporary network topology without any pre-existing infrastructure. Combined with millimeter-wave (mmWave), Ad-hoc networks can construct communication links with less time and higher directivity due to directional antennas and building blockage. The wide spectrum of mmWave could provide a high-oriented channel for positioning, which is significant for multi-user conditions. In this article, we concentrate on high-efficiency algorithms to allocate spectrum and power to different services and achieve a performance tradeoff between the communication and positioning process. Besides, the severe interference between users would degrade the actual system performance. To address these challenges, this article proposes an optimal clustering algorithm based on the mmWave Line of Sight (LoS) probability to form two different sub-nets for communication and positioning services, respectively. Then, the available spectrum resources are divided into two parts for the above sub-nets under the Filtered-Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (F-OFDM) technique, which could design sub-bands independently. Finally, we proposed an optimal algorithm to allocate sub-bands and power to improve the performance of the communication sub-net while guaranteeing the positioning performance in the corresponding sub-net. Numeric simulation results demonstrate that the proposed resource allocation algorithm could achieve better performance both in the communication and position process.</description></item><item><title>Aerial-Terrestrial Networks With Multi-Antenna Transmissions: How Many UAVs Need to Be Deployed?</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10254357</link><description>Due to the flexibility and affordability of low-cost aerial base stations (ABSs), the coexistence of ABSs and terrestrial base stations (TBSs) equipped with a large number of antennas can be a promising solution to meet the high throughput and coverage needs of future wireless networks. In this article, we propose an analytical framework for three-dimensional (3D) heterogeneous aerial-terrestrial networks, where the TBSs are equipped with large antenna elements, and ABSs provide seamless connectivity from air to ground user equipment (GUE). Using tools from stochastic geometry, we derive exact analytical expressions for association probability, coverage probability, area spectral efficiency (ASE), and average ergodic rate (AER) while considering the maximum biased received power association scheme, path loss with line-of-sight (LoS)/non-line-of-sight (NLoS) link and Nakagami-m fading for aerial communications. The derived expressions are validated using Monte Carlo simulations, and a close match is observed between the analytical and simulated results. Simulation results demonstrate that the use of multi-antennas TBSs in conjunction with the ABSs leads to better network performance. However, the overall performance depends upon the density of the aerial and terrestrial network nodes, ABSs altitudes, and the number of antennas per TBS. Furthermore, it is observed that the dense deployment of ABSs leads to higher aerial interference. However, deploying a higher number of TBS antennas while optimally selecting other network parameters results in improved network performance.</description></item><item><title>Cost-Efficient Wireless Friendly Jamming and Interference Mitigation: No Pains, No Gains</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10256030</link><description>In this article, we investigate a friendly jamming and mutual interference mitigation problem, where a friendly jammer equipped with a directional antenna is deployed to exert adversarial interference to the hostile user in a confrontational scenario. However, the side lobe of the signal of friendly jammer may cause unintended interference to ally users. Power control and jammer position are jointly designed to significantly impede the hostile users' radio communication at the cost of self-inflicted performance loss. The friendly jammer-to-hostile users channel is assumed to be a flat Rayleigh fading channel, while the friendly jammer-to-ally users channel gain is of finite states governed by the probability mass function (PMF). Cost-efficiency is defined to characterize the trade-off between the expected sum-capacity of the ally users, the outage-capacity loss of the hostile users, and the friendly jammer risk costs. We formulate the cost-efficiency maximization problem under ally users' transmission rate constraints. The block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods are applied to effectively solve the problem by optimizing: 1) coordination of the internal interference among the ally users; 2) the friendly jammer jamming power; and 3) the jammer position. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is illustrated. The impacts of power/risk costs and rate threshold of ally users on the utility have been demonstrated. Numerical results verify that the proposed scheme rapidly converges to a near-optimal solution and outperforms uniform power allocation or fixed jamming position policies.</description></item><item><title>Channel-Aware Jammer Selection and Power Control in Covert Communication</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10256033</link><description>This paper considers a multi-jammer-assisted covert communication scenario, where a transmitter communicates with a receiver without being detected by a warden under the assistance of multiple friendly jammers. The transmission rate maximization problem subjecting to the covertness constraint by jointly optimizing the jammer selection strategy and power control of the transmitter is studied under the following three channel models: 1) Additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel; 2) Block fading channel without channel state information (CSI) acquisition cost; 3) Block fading channel with CSI acquisition cost. Under the AWGN channel, considering achievable schemes of the transmitter, relative entropy is adopted to lower bound the detection error probability at the warden. We decouple the joint optimization problem into two sub-problems and prove that selecting one jammer with the maximum ratio of the jamming power at the warden to that at the receiver is optimal with proper transmit power control in an interference-limited environment. Motivated by this key analytical conclusion, we then study the second channel model's optimal single jammer selection strategy. Considering the worst case that the warden employs the optimal detector, we analytically show that the optimal selection criterion in this channel model is choosing the jammer with the maximum ratio of the average jamming power at the warden to the instantaneous jamming power at the receiver. Given this selection criterion, we then study the problem of how many jammers should be explored when the acquisition cost of jammers' CSI cannot be ignored. We formulate the optimization problem as an optimal stopping problem and propose two optimal strategies for two cases that whether the previously explored jammers are allowed to select. The numerical results evaluate the theoretical results and show the superiority of the proposed jammer selection strategies. Furthermore, we also present the impact of some key parameters on the covert rate, such as the covertness constraint, the number of jammers, and the CSI acquisition time of one jammer, which provide more valuable insights.</description></item><item><title>Joint User Association and BS Operation for Green Communications in Ultra-Dense Heterogeneous Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10265204</link><description>Ultra-dense heterogeneous networks (UDHNs) have been widely regarded as a long-term and reliable solution for enhancing system performance and reducing cost efficiency. To guarantee these gains in UDHNs, some problems need to be properly tackled, which include more capital/operational expenditures, more complicated, severe and average interferences, and more energy consumption caused by network densification. To this end, in this article, the BS (base station) on/off operation is introduced into the design of user association mechanisms in UDHNs with a general multi-slope channel model. Specifically, we jointly perform the BS (on/off) operation and user association to maximize the sum of weighted downlink long-term rates. Such rates are closely related to users' signal strengths and the load levels of associated BSs. Considering the finally formulated problem is in a mixed-integer and fractional form, we first need to convert it into a parameterized polynomial one. Then, we design a three-layer iterative algorithm to find the solution to a transformed problem, where the first layer tries to find the introduced Lagrangian multipliers and parameters using a Newton-like method, the second layer optimizes the user association and on/off indices alternately, and the third layer optimizes these indices separately. Simulation results show that the designed algorithm can achieve better user association performance than other existing ones.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Beam Control Considering Location Inaccuracy for Anti-UAV Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10266713</link><description>The threat posed by drones has significantly increased in recent years, necessitating the development of robust anti-UAV systems capable of detecting and preventing malicious UAVs. However, the anti-UAV system requires accurate UAV location detection capabilities to counteract UAVs robustly. For example, when employing jamming technology as a countermeasure, the anti-UAV system can enhance its defence performance by concentrating the jamming signal towards the detected UAV location, a technique known as a directional jamming signal. However, obtaining accurate UAV location information is challenging due to the small size, high velocity, and maneuverability of UAVs, which pose difficulties in detecting and tracking UAVs. Inaccurate UAV location data can significantly impair the defence performance of anti-UAV systems. In the jamming system, it causes the misalignment between the directional jamming signal and the malicious UAV and jamming failure. Therefore, addressing the problem of inaccurate location information is crucial for the anti-UAV system to achieve robust jamming performance. This article investigates the impact of UAV detection errors in an anti-UAV system that employs radar for detection and jamming technology as a countermeasure. We design the UAV detection algorithm to analyze the influence of UAV location detection errors. Furthermore, a beam control scheme is proposed for the jamming system to mitigate the effects of detection errors in the anti-UAV system. The proposed scheme utilizes a wide beam width when location information is inaccurate to avoid beam misalignment. In contrast, a narrow beamwidth is employed when the location information is precise to enhance jamming power efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method ensures stable jamming performance even when faced with inaccurate UAV location information.</description></item><item><title>Joint Trajectory Design and Power Allocation in NOMA-Based UAV Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10271708</link><description>The employment of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as communication platform has drawn a lot of interest recently. Although previous studies have presented the performance gain by utilizing the UAV's mobility and communication, they concentrate on the UAV trajectory for homogeneous devices with the same requirements of data size and latency constraints. The UAV trajectory for groups with heterogeneous devices can affect the UAV's service capabilities. Additionally, the technique of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been deemed as a promising technique in future communication networks since it can improve the spectral efficiency and support more device connections. The UAV can integrate with NOMA to further enhance the situation. In this article, we consider a NOMA-based UAV system, where a UAV provides services to ground devices in different groups. We aim to maximize the total throughput under the constraints of data rate, sum transmit power, and atomicity of devices' tasks. To tackle this problem, we first derive the closed-form expression of transmit power based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Then, we formulate a group-based auction algorithm to decide the service order of UAV to device groups, where a latency estimation algorithm is constructed to design the auction bidding. Additionally, an adaptive device admission algorithm is put forward to settle the device scheduling problem within one group. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme acquires a significant performance gain in terms of the total throughput, compared with other benchmark schemes.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Split Learning for Map-Based Signal Strength Prediction Empowered by Deep Vision Transformer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10266792</link><description>This article focuses on predicting the received signal strength (RSS) of mobile users, which is a fundamental problem for improving the coverage of cellular networks. Traditional methods for RSS prediction are based on ray tracing or stochastic radio propagation models. However, the former requires detailed environmental information that may not be practically available, while the latter cannot use the environmental data to its full potential and is not accurate enough. To address these issues, we design a practical RSS prediction system utilizing the trajectory information of users and satellite maps around base stations without sharing raw data. Specifically, we propose a map-based deep neural network (DNN) for the RSS prediction, empowered by the deep vision transformer (DeepVIT). Furthermore, to avoid sharing raw data, a novel split learning (SL) framework is developed. It splits the map-based DNN into two parts, which are deployed on the server and the user sides, respectively. The proposed models are evaluated by eight real-world data sets provided by an Australian Telecom operator, including 307,500 data samples. Simulation results show that in terms of prediction accuracy, the proposed map-based DNN significantly outperforms the 3GPP Urban Macro model and the long short-term memory method in centralized scenarios, while its SL variant outperforms the sequential SL and federated learning (FL) approaches in distributed scenarios. In addition, the communication overhead and the on-device computational burden of the proposed SL model are much lower than that of the FL approach.</description></item><item><title>Multidimensional Signal Space Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access With Imperfect SIC: A Novel SIC Reduction Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268637</link><description>The power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) performs reasonably well under perfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) conditions. However, under imperfect SIC, the average sum-rate (ASR), outage performance, and $\epsilon -$outage capacity of PD-NOMA diminish drastically. This work introduces a new PD-NOMA system called multidimensional signal space NOMA (MD-NOMA) to mitigate this sudden decrease in performance. Employing multidimensional signal space significantly reduces the number of SICs, leading to less stringent constraints on the power allocation, reducing the detection delay, and decoding complexity. The analytical expressions of ASR, outage-probability (OP), $\epsilon -$outage capacity, and diversity order of MD-NOMA, Quadrature-NOMA (Q-NOMA), and PD-NOMA are evaluated under Nakagami-$m$ fading channel with the help of order statistics for a generalized-$K$ user scenario. It is noticed from the analysis that MD-NOMA, with a higher number of signal spaces, significantly outperforms all other systems under imperfect SIC and exhibits comparable performance with them under perfect SIC. Furthermore, the analytical expression for bit error rate (BER) and average-BER (ABER) is determined for MD-NOMA. It is noticed that MD-NOMA can withstand higher modulation order ($M$), whereas the performance of all other systems degrades drastically as $M$ increases. Furthermore, numerical results demonstrate there is a tradeoff between ABER and spectral efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Robust Secure Beamforming Design for GEO-Based Satellite Communication Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268504</link><description>Compared with terrestrial communication, satellite communication has played a crucial role in 6G communication as a result of wide-area coverage characteristics. Among them, beamforming scheduling and information security are critical research issues to improve system transmission performance. However, in geostationary earth orbit (GEO)-based satellite communication systems, owing to the wide-area coverage, ground users are susceptible to inter-beam interference caused by multibeam antennas at the satellite, and the information received by terrestrial users may be eavesdropped by air or terrestrial eavesdroppers. To this end, in this article, we propose a new robust security transmission strategy by combining beamforming and artificial noise (AN) techniques. Specifically, based on the actual satellite communication network scenario, the uncertain channel models are formulated as bounded uncertainty sets by considering the impact of imperfect channel state information of both legitimate and wiretap channels. Then, we build a bounded-constrained beamforming optimization to maximize the sum rate of legitimate users, while guaranteeing the constraints of total transmit power on the satellite and the minimum security rate of each legitimate user. Since the original problem is non-convex and mathematically intractable, we jointly exploit the successive convex approximation, Taylor series expansion, S-Procedure, and the semi-definite relaxation approach, with which the original problem can be transformed into a tractable one with a series of linear matrix inequality constraints. Furthermore, we propose an iterative algorithm to obtain the optimal beamforming and AN vectors. Finally, simulation results show that, compared with the existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm has better security and robustness.</description></item><item><title>BASIC: Distributed Task Assignment With Auction Incentive in UAV-Enabled Crowdsensing System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10202566</link><description>With the wide adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in our daily life, using UAVs to collect sensing data from the surrounding environment has become a practice. Notably, people use UAVs to capture videos and upload them to Youtube. Accordingly, using distributed UAVs in the city to collect real-time data represents a key enabling approach for smart city, e.g., air pollution and traffic monitoring. To achieve this goal, in this work, we develop a UAV-based crowdsensing system that allows UAVs to dynamically join and contribute to data collection. We make three contributions. First, due to UAVs' highspeed spatial mobilities, diverse sensing capabilities, and limited energy reserves, it is key to stimulate UAVs to cooperatively perform sensing tasks. To address this issue, we develop a game-theory-based distributed UAV incentive scheme, named BASIC. Second, to make BASIC work fully distributed and scalable, we first develop a mathematical model to characterize the interdependent operations of task requesters and collaboratively data sensing. We then devise a centralized auction mechanism with truthful bidding for UAVs. A heuristic algorithm is then devised to select the winning UAVs for sensing tasks and determine the proper payments to winners. Last, we perform extensive simulations to validate the effectiveness of proposed scheme and show that BASIC can provide effective incentive as compared to the existing schemes.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Hop Task Routing in Vehicle-Assisted Collaborative Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10239502</link><description>Collaborative edge computing has emerged as a novel paradigm that allows edge servers (ESs) to share data and computing resources, effectively mitigating network congestion in traditional multi-access edge computing (MEC) scenarios. However, existing research in collaborative edge computing often limits offloading to only one hop, which may lead to suboptimal computing resource sharing due to challenges such as poor channel conditions or high computing workload at ESs located just one hop away. To address this limitation and enable more efficient computing resource utilization, we propose a multi-hop MEC approach that leverages omnipresent vehicles in urban areas to create a data transportation network for task delivery. Here, we propose a general multi-hop task offloading framework for vehicle-assisted collaborative edge computing where tasks from users can be offloaded to powerful ESs via potentially multi-hop transmissions. Under the proposed framework, we formulate an aggregated service throughput maximization problem by designing the task routing path subject to end-to-end latency requirements, spectrum, and computing resources. To efficiently address the curse of dimensionality problem due to vehicular mobility and channel variability, we develop a deep reinforcement learning, i.e., multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient, based multi-hop task routing approach. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing benchmark schemes.</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Jointly Optimizing Offloading and Resource Management in Vehicular Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10239463</link><description>Satisfying the quality of service of data-intensive autonomous driving applications has become challenging. In this work, we propose a novel methodology that optimizes communication, computation, and caching configurations in a vehicular Multi-access edge computing (MEC) system to minimize the average latency of the tasks from the vehicles and maximize the number of tasks finished within the latency requirements. The communication model characterizes bandwidth and power allocation of uplink and downlink transmission in the vehicular MEC system. Our caching model includes variables for each edge server in determining the trade-off between flexibility and hit rate. Finally, the computation model characterizes computation resource allocation. Our method for solving the optimization problem consists of two main steps. First, the deep Q-learning algorithm deals with the optimal assignment of tasks to the edge servers. Then, a greedy approach is applied to the communication, computation, and caching subproblems to decide the bandwidth and power, CPU, and caching strategy, respectively. Simulation results show that our algorithm outperforms several baselines in minimizing latency and maximizing the number of tasks finished within latency requirements, and verify the benefit of including different resource allocation variables in our optimization.</description></item><item><title>Resource Scheduling for High-Capacity Multicast Service in Ultra-Dense LEO Satellite Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10242022</link><description>Ultra-dense low earth orbit (LEO) network has been envisioned as a promising solution to improve communication coverage and reliability. In this article, we investigate the resource scheduling for the downlink multigroup multicast cooperative transmissions in an ultra-dense LEO network, where multiple LEO satellites serve as aerial base stations to cooperatively offer high-capacity multicast service for ground users (GUs) within the coverage. To obtain the system max-min fair (MMF) capacity, we formulate a weighted MMF downlink beamforming and subchannel assignment problem. As the formulated problem is NP-hard and non-convex, we adopt a many-to-many matching model to solve the subchannel assignment, and apply the successive convex approximation (SCA) coupled with Gaussian randomization and cochannel power control to obtain the downlink beamforming during the matching process. Furthermore, the matching algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a two-side exchange stable matching within finite iteration steps. Extensive numerical results are provided to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed resource scheduling scheme for cooperative multicast transmissions.</description></item><item><title>Parameter Estimation-Aided Edge Server Selection Mechanism for Edge Task Offloading</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10244085</link><description>As the extension of cloud computing, edge computing has witnessed remarkable progress in the last few years. In edge computing, task offloading from edge device to edge server is becoming a promising technique that substantially enhances the quality of service for edge devices. Nevertheless, appropriate edge server selection for task offloading remains a challenge if multiple edge servers are selectable nearby. In this article, we propose a parameter estimation-aided edge server selection scheme for task offloading (PEESS) with multiple potential edge servers. The proposed scheme jointly leverages Baum-Welch algorithm and forward algorithm of hidden Markov model. That is, PEESS leverages Baum-Welch algorithm to estimate the parameters of potential edge servers based on their time-sequential incoming task records. Subsequently, the forward algorithm is utilized for the probability calculation of the observations based on the estimated parameters. Eventually, the probability calculation results are sorted in descending order, and the edge device selects the target edge server based on the sequence of sending requests to the available edge servers from optimal to suboptimal. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that PEESS outperforms other conventional and state-of-the-art edge server selection schemes in terms of time consumption and energy consumption.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Data Transmission and Computing for Vehicles in the Internet-of-Intelligence</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10247591</link><description>Efficient scheduling of vehicle resources is of great significance to guarantee vehicle safety and to achieve a higher level of automated driving. Considering the performance fluctuations in data transmission and processing during driving, this paper proposes an adaptive data transmission and computation optimization scheme, where the concept of the Internet-of-Intelligence is introduced to improve the resource decision-making efficiency through knowledge sharing instead of data sharing among vehicles. Specifically, the joint optimization problem is formulated to minimize the long-term energy consumption with the consideration of the average queuing latency guarantees. To provide a stable and fast solution, Lyapunov optimization method is first leveraged to transform the formulated stochastic problem into a series of short-term deterministic optimization subproblems. Afterwards, both the optimization-based solution and the learning-based solution are presented to fully illustrate the performance advantages of Internet-of-Intelligence applied to vehicle networks. The former can output the global optimal solution by iteration, while the latter aims at accelerating the distributed optimization decision-making through building a fast deep reinforcement learning framework based on shared knowledge among vehicles. Simulation results show the advantages of the proposed scheme in stability, energy consumption, and latency, and it also verifies the convergence speed and training accuracy of the proposed fast deep reinforcement learning framework.</description></item><item><title>Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation in Ultra-Dense Networks With EMBB and URLLC Users Coexistence</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10254301</link><description>Ultra-dense network (UDN) is an important technology to provide high data rate services in hot areas. Efficient resource allocation schemes are vital, in order to ensure the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of users. In this article, we consider the resource allocation problem in a UDN with both enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) users to find ways to improve energy efficiency (EE) and satisfy the diverse QoS requirements. We consider a more realistic power consumption model and interference model, in order to better satisfy the QoS requirements and mitigate the performance degradation caused by strong interference. Then, we construct an EE maximization problem with QoS constraints. In order to solve this non-convex combined integer fractional programming problem, we decompose it into two sub-problems: resource block (RB) allocation and power allocation problems. Algorithms based on continuous convex approximation and difference of convex programming are proposed to solve the sub-problems, respectively. Then we propose an alternating optimization algorithm to obtain a sub-optimal solution to the original problem and analyze the convergence and complexity of the algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can converge quickly and has obvious advantages in improving EE and guaranteeing the QoS requirements of eMBB and URLLC users.</description></item><item><title>Secure Attack Detection Framework for Hierarchical 6G-Enabled Internet of Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10258449</link><description>The Sixth Generation Heterogeneous Network (6G HetNet) is a global interconnected system that serves a myriad variety of applications and services across multiple domains such as satellite, air, ground, and underwater networks. It provides a platform for the development of novel Internet of Things (IoT) applications and services, particularly for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), which encompasses all devices involved in intra-vehicle and inter-vehicle communications. However, this evolution towards a unified and huge cellular infrastructure creates new security challenges that require an intelligent attack detection framework to safeguard the network against cyber-security threats. This article proposes a hierarchical attack detection framework for 6G-enabled IoV. This framework relies on the processing capacities of edge nodes to satisfy the main 6G Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as trustworthiness, latency, connectivity, data rate and energy consumption. Federated Learning (FL) and non-cooperative gaming are used to train attack models and improve the detection process over time. The cooperative detection process based on FL is executed by security entities, IoV devices, edge servers and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) to improve the detection accuracy over time. To harden the security of the proposed attack detection framework, a robust Stackelberg security game is developed to identify malicious IoV devices and edge servers, and select suitable IoV devices and edge servers to participate in the training and attack detection processes. The identification and selection process mainly relies on computing a reputation score based on the activities of these IoV devices and edge servers. As compared to current security monitoring and detection solutions, our framework balances detection accuracy and reduced network overhead, specifically as the system scales up, i.e., when the malicious traffic is high. In addition, it mitigates threats from both external and internal adversaries.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Federated Learning in Resource-Constrained Edge Intelligence Networks Using Model Compression</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10258354</link><description>We investigate energy-efficient federated learning (FL) in computation and communication resource-constrained edge intelligence networks using model compression. An edge device selection strategy is designed to select appropriate edge devices for participating in FL at the beginning of each training iteration. An optimization problem is then formulated to jointly optimize the pruning ratio, CPU frequency, uplink power, and bandwidth allocation for the selected edge devices. Due to the non-convexity of the optimization problem, it is decomposed into three subproblems, and closed-form solutions or efficient algorithms are developed for each subproblem. Based on these solutions, an alternating optimization algorithm is constructed to solve the original problem. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms baseline schemes in improving the energy efficiency of FL.</description></item><item><title>IMRSG: Incentive Mechanism Based on Rubinstein-Starr Game for Mobile CrowdSensing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10261277</link><description>Exploiting mobile crowdsensing to conduct data collection and analysis has become an emerging trend in IoT computing models. However, in practice, mobile users in crowdsensing networks are unwilling to participate in perceptual tasks without effective stimulation due to limited resources and strategic selfishness. To tackle the problem, a new incentive mechanism is proposed by adopting game theory in this article. Specifically, the mobile users' preference is considered comprehensively and their energy is changed dynamically through the scheme. Furthermore, the users' preference and energy changes are exploited as equation factors between subsequent users and the platform. To motivate users, we introduce the concept of virtual currency and set a price function that rewards users for participating in sensing tasks in the form of virtual currency. To fit into practical scenarios, we map task interactions to a Rubinstein-Starr bargaining game between a user and sensing platforms based on a fully informative turn-based bargaining model. Through multiple rounds of games between users and crowdsensing platforms, we prove that there is a unique Nash Equilibrium point in the sub-game process of both parties. The analysis based on these models lays a theoretical foundation on the incentive process of mobile crowdsensing. The soundness of modeling and the accuracy of analysis are verified through extensive simulation, which also guides the design of more sophisticated incentive schemes.</description></item><item><title>Parallel Offloading and Resource Optimization for Multi-Hop Ad Hoc Network-Enabled CBTC With Mobile Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10261251</link><description>The emergence of communication-based train control (CBTC) system within urban rail transport has improved the efficiency of safe train operations. At the same time, the CBTC system enhances the reliability of the train system and lowers latency of the data transmission. Nevertheless, there are still certain critical issues that need to be considered in the CBTC: 1) limited coverage and high maintenance costs of wayside equipment; 2) multiple ground devices configuration and complex system architecture; and 3) insufficient computing capacity of the train leads to heavy latency and energy consumption. To cope with the above problems, in this article, the multi-hop ad hoc network coexisting with train-to-train communication and train-to-wayside communication is applied to simplify the networking architecture, together with the employment of mobile edge computing (MEC) servers to provide massive computing and communication resources for trains. Meantime, a new CBTC framework is developed for computing offloading and resource allocation via multi-hop ad hoc network and MEC. Offloading decisions, offloading ratio, computing and communication resource allocation are integrated to minimize latency and energy consumption. Furthermore, the proposed problem is a mixed-integer non-convex problem that is transformed into a solvable convex problem, and the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers-based (ADMM) algorithm is employed to solve the problem. The simulation results show that our proposed method has remarkable advantages over other schemes.</description></item><item><title>Mission-Aware UAV Deployment for Post-Disaster Scenarios: A Worst-Case SAC-Based Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10368309</link><description>In remote areas, natural disasters owing to extreme weather or other causes can easily spread regionally. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are regarded as pioneers for exploration and sensing in post-disaster scenarios due to their characteristics of flexible deployment and low cost. Considering the network disconnection caused by the long distances between the sensing area, UAVs, and the ground station (GS), this article aims to maximize the spatial exploration ratio (SER) while minimizing energy consumption with connectivity maintenance. To ensure that the UAV swarm successfully transmits as much post-disaster data as possible back, we develop a worst-case soft actor critic (WCSAC) based deployment algorithm with role management for UAVs. First, we formulate the three-dimensional (3D) UAV deployment problem as a real-time single-step Markov decision process (CMDP), together with role management that includes role assignment and role switching for each UAV. Next, to avoid unlimited energy consumption for complete coverage of remote mission areas, we separate the reward and cost functions and translate the energy consumption minimization to the residual energy constraints with a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). Finally, visualizations and numerical results prove that the proposed WCSAC-cntRM can strike a better trade-off among the valid SER, energy consumption, and network connectivity than other benchmarks, especially when the emergency mission is dynamically triggered in the corner area.</description></item><item><title>Joint Optimization of Server and Service Selection in Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Edge Computing Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10266782</link><description>The convergence of terrestrial and non-terrestrial (e.g., satellite communications) infrastructures has been attracting more and more attention from connectivity stakeholders given the forthcoming future sixth-generation (6G) communication paradigm, thanks to ubiquitous coverage and broadcast/multicast capabilities offered by SatCom. With the advent of promising concepts such as the Internet of Space Things (IoST), the potential for applying edge computing in space has become particularly appealing. In particular, in-orbit computing services are provided employing edge servers placed on satellites, which can inherently offer storage and computation capacity. However, an open problem is to find out onboard which satellite edge servers should be placed and how distributed edge computing services could be offered. In this respect, this article proposes satellite-terrestrial integrated edge computing networks (STECN), aiming at minimizing the average response latency and average energy consumption by jointly selecting the optimal deployment of servers and services. First, we propose a general network framework for the STECN. Then, we develop a heuristic algorithm based on K-medoids clustering and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) to solve the optimization problem. Specifically, we achieve the optimal placement of edge servers by exploiting the K-medoids clustering method. In terms of service deployment, the conducted performance analysis shows that the proposed solutions can approach the Pareto Front using the NSGA-II technique. Finally, the proposed heuristic algorithm is compared with two benchmark algorithms by means of simulations, verifying the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first work considering server placement and service deployment in STECN.</description></item><item><title>Asynchronous Random Access Systems With Immediate Collision Resolution for Low Power Wide Area Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10285046</link><description>Low power wide area networks (LPWAN) have adopted pure ALOHA systems as medium access control (MAC) protocol. Since pure ALOHA works asynchronously, it can reduce the cost of the system and devices and make the devices small by eliminating the time-synchronization hardware. However, its maximum throughput is limited only up to 0.183 (packets/sec). To overcome such a low throughput limit, this work proposes a novel asynchronous random access (RA) system that can yield the maximum throughput as good as slotted ALOHA (S-ALOHA). In the proposed system, the users transmit their packets as in pure ALOHA but trigger their feedback timer upon (re)transmission. When a collision occurs, the feedback timers enable the users who have transmitted the first and last packets in the collision to retransmit one after another right after the collision. Under some conditions, one or two users can retransmit successfully right after the collision, which improves the throughput significantly. This work analyzes the saturation throughput of the proposed system and proposes an optimal online backoff algorithm to maximize the throughput of the unsaturated traffic system.</description></item><item><title>Alliance Makes Difference? Maximizing Social Welfare in Cross-Silo Federated Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10266707</link><description>As one of the typical settings of Federated Learning (FL), cross-silo FL allows organizations to jointly train an optimal Machine Learning (ML) model. In this case, some organizations may try to obtain the global model without contributing their local training power, lowering the social welfare. In this article, we model the interactions among organizations in cross-silo FL as a public goods game and theoretically prove that there exists a social dilemma where the maximum social welfare is not achieved in Nash equilibrium. To overcome this dilemma, we employ the Multi-player Multi-action Zero-Determinant (MMZD) strategy to maximize the social welfare. With the help of the MMZD, an individual organization can unilaterally control the social welfare without extra cost. Since the MMZD strategy can be adopted by all organizations, we further study the case of multiple organizations jointly adopting the MMZD strategy to form an MMZD Alliance (MMZDA). We prove that the MMZDA strategy can strengthen the control of the maximum social welfare. Experimental results validate that the MMZD strategy is effective in obtaining the maximum social welfare and the MMZDA can achieve a larger maximum value.</description></item><item><title>UAV Trajectory Planning With Interference Awareness in UAV-Enabled Time-Constrained Data Collection Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268076</link><description>This article studies the UAV trajectory planning (UtraP) problem in a UAV-enabled data collection (DC) system where a UAV executes a DC mission in a geographical area with multiple ground monitoring areas and multiple ground base stations (GBSs). The problem is formulated as an optimization problem aiming to minimize the UAV's mission completion time by jointly optimizing GBS and UAV association variables, the UAV's flying speeds, and the UAV's path, taking into account the time constraint of data, the energy consumption constraint of the UAV, and the mitigation of interference on ground users. To solve the formulated problem, we decompose the problem into three sub-problems: GBS and UAV association optimization, UAV speed optimization and UAV path optimization. Three successive convex approximation based algorithms are proposed to solve the sub-problems. In addition, a block coordinate descent based trajectory optimization algorithm (BCD-TO) is further proposed to solve the formulated problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed BCD-TO algorithm outperforms a benchmark algorithm in terms of the mission completion time.</description></item><item><title>Physical Layer Security in Full-Duplex Millimeter Wave Communication Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268039</link><description>In this article, we investigate physical layer security in full-duplex (FD) millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication system, where an FD receiver generates the jamming signal at the destination to protect the confidential message. Secrecy rate and secrecy throughput are selected as metrics to characterize the secrecy performance. We analyze and derive closed-form expressions for secrecy metrics for both cases with the availability of global and partial channel state information (CSI), respectively. Specifically, we jointly design beamforming at the source and destination to enhance the secrecy performance to the greatest extent possible. With joint optimization of the power allocation ratio, between the source and destination, and the secrecy outage probability constraint, we can further obtain the maximum secrecy rate and secrecy throughput. This study determines that the optimal hybrid beamforming matrix for the jamming signal is a rank-1 matrix. Simulation results illustrate that our designed secrecy transmission scheme with FD jamming receiver outperforms conventional half-duplex (HD) methods even when residual self-interference (SI) is considered. As a result of adequately designing the beamforming of the jamming signal, the secrecy of FD mmWave system is no longer constrained by SI in the multi-antenna case. Furthermore, our results also find that there always exists an optimal pair of the power allocation ratio and secrecy outage probability constraint to maximize the secrecy throughput given a fixed transmit power.</description></item><item><title>Accurate Wideband Localization in Massive MIMO Systems With Low-Resolution ADCs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10239699</link><description>This article investigates the localization of a mobile station (MS) in a quantized massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system, in which the base station (BS) uses low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) to quantize the received signals. Specifically, a novel two-stage localization scheme is proposed. In the first stage, we try to finely estimate the channel parameters by resorting to the generalized turbo (GTurbo) and the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) methodologies. In the second stage, we estimate the MS position using the obtained estimates of the channel parameters, where the Gauss-Newton algorithm is used to minimize the involved nonlinear least square objective function. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing counterparts, and can approach the localization Cram&#233;r-Rao bound (CRB) in the medium-to-high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime.</description></item><item><title>Index-Modulation OAM Detectors Resistant to Beam Misalignment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10239524</link><description>Orbital angular momentum with index modulation (OAM-IM) has a great potential of providing high spectral efficiency and energy efficiency by utilizing the indices of the orthogonal OAM modes. However, the harsh requirement of perfect alignment of the transceiver beams introduces great challenges to OAM-IM wireless communications. Therefore, we first propose an angle of arrival (AoA)-based robust detector for the misaligned OAM-IM system, which explicitly estimates the AoA of the OAM beam and then utilizes the estimate to detect the transmitted symbols. To further reduce the system overhead and complexity, we propose another deep learning (DL)-based robust detector, which implicitly estimates the AoA and directly recovers the transmitted information bits. By using the dataset collected through simulation, the first step is to train the DL-based robust detector offline to minimize the mean-squared error, and the second step is to use the trained model for real-time OAM-IM signal detection online. Numerical simulations validate that the both proposed robust detectors can address the channel distortion in OAM channels with beam misalignment and achieve superior bit error rate (BER) performance at high spectral efficiency. Moreover, the proposed DL-based robust detector is less complicated on runtime than the traditional OAM-IM detector.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Hybrid Beamforming Design for Dual-Function Radar-Communication Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10243136</link><description>This paper investigates dynamic hybrid beamforming (HBF) for a dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) system, where the DFRC base station (BS) simultaneously serves multiple single-antenna users and senses a target in the presence of multiple clutters.

Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA)-assisted Ambient Backscatter Communication (AmBC) has proven to be capable of offering great spectral efficiency at low power. In contrast, Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) has proven to be capable of improving coverage. Consequently, efforts have been made to integrate those technologies. However, thorough model development and analysis are necessary to benefit from such coexistence. In this study, we analyze the performance of a Power Domain (PD)-NOMA-enabled base station acting as a source in a multiple-user IRS-assisted AmBC system. The main approach we take is to use PD-NOMA to send a signal from the base station to the IRS that has both modulated (with a primary message) and unmodulated carrier components. In addition to relaying the primary message, the IRS will then send its (secondary) message to user devices utilizing the unmodulated carrier and Binary Phase-shift Keying (BPSK). Then, using a Band Pass Filter (BPF) and Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC), the user devices decode their respective messages from the received signals. To obtain further understanding, we derived novel closed-form expressions for the Outage Probabilities (OPs) and also provided asymptotic assessments of the OPs. Our results show that raising the IRS element count enhances the OPs. Additionally, devices' outage performance is impaired due to the imperfections in SIC. Furthermore, we found that a device's OP rises as the power allocation factor increases. Lastly, we found that the NOMA-based IRS-assisted system outperforms OMA-based systems in terms of outages.</description></item><item><title>QoS-Aware Resource Allocation of RIS-Aided Multi-User MISO Wireless Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10251031</link><description>In this article, it is investigated a multi-user multiple-input single-output wireless communication scenario (MISO) in which a base station (BS) serves multiple users with the assistance of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS).

By employing Zero-Forcing (ZF) beamforming at the BS, the beamforming optimization is converted the power allocation. Then, we alternately optimize QoS provisioning power allocation schemes and RIS phase shifts. In particular, we derive a closed-form expression for the optimal power allocation scheme based on the Lagrangian method and the Karoosh-Koon-Tucker (KKT) condition. Meanwhile, the RIS phase shift strategy is optimized by employing the gradient descent method. Finally, the performance of the proposed joint optimal schemes for RIS-assisted wireless communication is verified by simulations. The simulation results demonstrate that the optimization scheme effectively guarantees the user's delay QoS requirements and the TEC significantly outperforms the random reflecting phase shift scheme.</description></item><item><title>AoI Minimization in RIS-Aided SWIPT Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10254294</link><description>This paper studies the age of information (AoI) minimization design in a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system.

The considered problem is decomposed into three subproblems, and then solved by a proposed alternating optimization-based algorithm. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is analyzed. Simulation results demonstrate the impacts on AoI by adopting RIS and NOMA as well as the system parameters. Besides, the trade-off between information freshness and the EH is revealed through the impact of EH requirement on the IU selection and UL/DL time allocation.</description></item><item><title>Average Error Probability for UAV-RIS Enabled Short Packet Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10258406</link><description>This article analyzes the performance of an aerial-empowered reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided communication system under finite channel blocklength.

Existing works have demonstrated that the use of hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has the potential to reduce the energy consumption of orthogonal multiple access (OMA)-based MEC offloading, but these works are based on various strong assumptions about the network statuses, e.g., the number of users, and the users' choices between OMA and NOMA. Unlike these existing works, this article considers a general and arbitrary network status, and rigorously investigates the performance of the three MEC offloading strategies, namely pure OMA, pure NOMA and hybrid NOMA. The considered NOMA-MEC energy minimization problem is first formulated, and a Pareto optimal solution is then obtained. The analytical results available in the literature about the property of hybrid NOMA are shown to be true in a special case, and a more general conclusion is drawn to reveal the dynamic choices of the users for time and power allocation. Therefore, these new analytical results yield essential insights about the capability of hybrid NOMA to reduce the energy consumption of MEC offloading.</description></item><item><title>Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Aided User-Centric Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10262335</link><description>With the capability of controlling the wireless channels and alleviating multiplicative fading effects, active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can enhance the spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) of user-centric (UC) networks. This work formulates the SE maximization problem for active RIS-aided UC networks considering the connecting capability of the access points (APs) and the quality of service (QoS) of the users. Due to the non-convexity of the problem, we divide it into three subproblems and propose a joint optimization framework for optimizing the user association, the precoding of the APs, and the reflection coefficients of the active RIS. For the user association subproblem, we propose a gradually approaching upper bound (GAUB) algorithm to construct a moderate and efficient association. Besides, the subproblems with respect to the transmit precoding and reflection coefficients optimization are solved by the fractional programming and Taylor approximation. Compared with existing benchmark schemes, simulation results show that the proposed joint optimization framework for active RIS-aided UC networks can obtain good SE and high EE.</description></item><item><title>Active STAR-RIS Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO: A Performance Study</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10264149</link><description>This paper investigates the spectral efficiency (SE) of an active simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (aSTAR-RIS) aided cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) system under correlated Rayleigh fading. In order to improve the system quality-of-service (QoS) and suppress the pilot contamination, fractional power control and an appropriate pilot assignment are adopted. Furthermore, a large-scale fading decoding (LSFD) method is introduced, based on which the analytical SE expression for the considered system is derived. Numerical and simulation results show that the adopted LSFD detection leads to higher SE than maximal ratio combining does, and as compared to an equivalent active RIS scheme, aSTAR-RIS significantly improves the SE of the CF-mMIMO system.</description></item><item><title>Offline-Online Design for Energy-Efficient IRS-Aided UAV Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10264168</link><description>In this correspondence, we consider the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) uplink transmission, where a UAV collects data from ground users via an IRS. The objective is to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory, user scheduling and IRS phase shifts. Unlike existing offline designs, we propose a hybrid offline-online scheme to further improve the performance with both the statistical and instantaneous channel state information (CSI). Specifically, the UAV trajectory and user scheduling are optimized based on the statistical CSI in the offline phase, followed by the online phase in which the phase shifts are readjusted based on the instantaneous CSI. Simulation results show the EE gain of the offline-online design over benchmarks.</description></item><item><title>Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Assisted Passive Covert Wireless Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10265182</link><description>In this work, we consider an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted covert wireless detection system, where a transmitter aims to improve the detection accuracy of its transmission at a legitimate receiver, but avoid this transmission being detected by a warden. Considering Rician fading channels and a bounded noise uncertainty model, the detection performance at the legitimate receiver and warden is thoroughly analyzed. Then, the optimal design of the transmit power and IRS reflection matrix is proposed for maximizing the detection performance at the legitimate transceiver subject to a covertness constraint (i.e., the detection accuracy at the warden is less than a specific tolerable level). Our design is solely based on the line-of-sight (LoS) channel components and thus partially eliminates the need for acquiring the IRS's instantaneous channels, which takes a step towards the practical deployment of IRS. Our examination shows that IRS can still improve the covert detection performance even when only the LoS channel components are known and the improvement increases as the LoS components become more dominant.</description></item><item><title>A D2I and D2D Collaboration Framework for Resource Management in ABS-Assisted Post-Disaster Emergency Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10251631</link><description>This article proposes a device-to-infrastructure (D2I) and device-to-device (D2D) collaboration framework in air base station (ABS)-assisted post-disaster emergency networks, based on which the resource management problem is investigated. Specifically, by optimizing the power control and spectrum allocation, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to characterize the tradeoff among two critical performance metrics: a) total power consumption minimization (primary); b) sum rate maximization (secondary). Due to the intractability of this non-convex problem, we first adopt the primal decomposition method to decompose the formulated problem. Next, we theoretically derive the explicit expression of optimal power control policies. Then, we transform the spectrum allocation problem as a bipartite graph maximum matching problem, which can be tackled by the Hungarian algorithm. Finally, the simulation results show that the designed resource management algorithm achieves a desirable balance among two performance metrics.</description></item><item><title>Coordinated Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Integrated Satellite-Terrestrial Networks With Super-Common Message</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10266774</link><description>Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) is an emerging multiple access technique for multi-antenna networks that splits messages into common and private parts for flexible interference mitigation. Motivated by its robustness and scalability, it is promising to employ RSMA in integrated satellite-terrestrial networks (ISTN), where a satellite serves satellite users (SUs) broadly with a multibeam multicast transmission while terrestrial base station (BS) serves cellular users (CUs) with a unicast transmission, operating in the same frequency band. To avoid the data exchange between satellite/cellular networks via backhaul, we assume a coordinated ISTN relying on imperfect channel state information. We put forth a coordinated RSMA framework tailored to the coordinated ISTN by applying inter-network rate-splitting (RS) with a super-common message on top of intra-network RS with common/private messages. With the unified RS design for inter- and intra-networks, we jointly optimize the precoding and power allocation of the private/common/super-common messages to achieve max-min fairness among all SUs and CUs through successive convex approximation. By doing so, the power of the super-common message can be adjusted according to interference levels of the satellite towards CUs, thereby potentially mitigating inter-network interference. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our approach to cope with various interference and propagation conditions.</description></item><item><title>Getting Ahead of the Curve: Assessment of New Photovoltaic Module Reliability Risks Associated With Projected Technological Changes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10347402</link><description>Maintaining the reliability of photovoltaic (PV) modules in the face of rapidly changing technology is critical to maximizing solar energy's contribution to global decarbonization. Our review describes expected changes in PV technology and their impacts on performance and reliability. We leverage PV market reports, interviews with PV researchers and other industry stakeholders, and peer-reviewed literature to narrow the multitude of possible changes into a manageable set of 11 impactful trends likely to be incorporated in near-term crystalline-silicon module designs. We group the trends into four categories (module architecture, interconnect technologies, bifacial modules, and cell technology) and explore the drivers behind the changes, their interactions, and associated reliability risks and benefits. Our analysis identifies specific areas that would benefit from accelerating the PV reliability learning cycle to assess emerging module products and designs more accurately. We recommend that researchers continue tracking module technologies and their reliability implications, so efforts can be focused on the most impactful trends. As the rapid technological turnover continues, it is also critical to incorporate fundamental knowledge into models that can predict module reliability. Predictive capabilities complete the PV reliability learning cycle&#8212;reducing the time required to assess new designs and mitigating the risks associated with large-scale deployment of new products.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Floating PV Systems With a Techno-Economic Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10284543</link><description>This article reviews floating photovoltaics, mainly on techno-economical, environmental, and O&amp;amp;M issues. Floating PV is a promising technology that is expected to establish a new global market in the near future. Recent years have seen the deployment of an increasing power that exceeded 3 GWp worldwide in 2021, and market analysts expect it will reach 4.8 GWp in 2026. The projected growth rate suggests that this technology is a promising complement to utility-scale land-mounted PV systems, mainly because it reduces or eliminates need for new land, reduces water evaporation from reservoirs, and can increase energy yield when compared with ground-mounted systems with similar fixed tilt. Despite its potential advantages, however, floating PV is more expensive than well-established rooftop and ground-mounted PV installations. Literature results showed that the CAPEX costs are around 20%&#8211;30% and the LCOE around 30% higher than ground-mounted systems. The present article provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art of floating PV, and describes the benefits and main drawbacks. We collected data from various sources available in the literature, ranging from evaluation studies to technical reports. Our review includes a special emphasis on the benefits and limitations of unmanned technologies used for maintenance purposes. Finally, we presented a cost breakdown comparison between the floating PV and ground-mounted PV, and combined information extracted from the literature with a case study in Italy.</description></item><item><title>Investigation of p-Type Silicon Heterojunction Radiation Hardness</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10334305</link><description>The space sector is facing significant upheavals, in particular, in terms of cost reduction challenges, driven by the emergence of low Earth orbit constellations. Concerning solar power generation, it opens up perspectives for alternative solar photovoltaics technologies, instead of the highly performant and expensive III-V multijunction devices. Crystalline silicon solar cells, which have fueled initial space developments, spark a renewed interest, thanks to their industrial maturity, high efficiencies on p-type substrates, and costs of two to three orders of magnitude lower than those of III-V. In this context, we present here the results of electrons radiation hardness studies on p-type (Ga-doped) silicon heterojunction solar cells. Devices with thicknesses down to 60 &#956;m are manufactured and then characterized before and after 1MeV electrons irradiations. The best ultra-thin heterojunction cell shows an end-of-life (1.5 &#215; 1014 e/cm2) externally certified efficiency of 15.9% under AM1.5G at room temperature; this translates into &#8764; 14.3% with AM0 spectrum. The benefits of thickness reduction with respect to radiation hardness are presented, and the cells&#8217; improvement pathways discussed.</description></item><item><title>Toward High-Performance HTL-Free All-Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells: SCAPS Simulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10313087</link><description>Perovskite tandem solar cells have met attractive concentrations with the potential to break through the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit in single-junction photovoltaics. However, the efficiency of all-perovskite tandem solar cells is still challenging due to the deficiency of low-bandgap Pb&#8211;Sn mixed perovskite solar cells. In this work, high-performance hole-transporting layer free (HTL-free) low-bandgap perovskite (1.29 eV) tandem solar cells are simulated with 1-D solar cell capacitance simulator. By optimizing work function, thickness, and doping concentration of the perovskite layer, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of HTL-free perovskite device reached to 19.14%. Furthermore, the all-perovskite tandem solar cell combined this HTL-free solar cell with MAGeI3 (1.9 eV) top solar is studied and the current matching condition between two subcells is obtained by the optimum thicknesses of perovskite layers, which are 700 and 350 nm for the bottom and top absorbers, respectively. The all-perovskite tandem solar cell reaches a PCE of 29.1%, which is among one of the top efficiency in perovskite-based solar cells.</description></item><item><title>A Model-free Approach for Estimating Service Transformer Capacity Using Residential Smart Meter Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10339803</link><description>Before residential photovoltaic (PV) systems are interconnected with the grid, various planning and impact studies are conducted on detailed models of the system to ensure safety and reliability are maintained. However, these model-based analyses can be time-consuming and error-prone, representing a potential bottleneck as the pace of PV installations accelerates. Data-driven tools and analyses provide an alternate pathway to supplement or replace their model-based counterparts. In this article, a data-driven algorithm is presented for assessing the thermal limitations of PV interconnections. Using input data from residential smart meters, and without any grid models or topology information, the algorithm can determine the nameplate capacity of the service transformer supplying those customers. The algorithm was tested on multiple datasets and predicted service transformer capacity with &gt;98% accuracy, regardless of existing PV installations. This algorithm has various applications from model-free thermal impact analysis for hosting capacity studies to error detection and calibration of existing grid models.</description></item><item><title>Optimization of Photovoltaic Environment for Enhanced Performance of GA$_{0.053}$MA$_{0.947}$PbI$_{3}$-Based Perovskite Solar Cell</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10284528</link><description>Hybrid halide perovskites (HHPs) have achieved unprecedented advancement and considered as the potential candidates for the next generation of photovoltaics. However, MAPbI$_{3}$ (MA$^+$ = CH$_{3}$ NH$_{3}^+$)-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are extensively examined both on theoretical and experimental fronts. Compositional engineering, i.e., doping in the absorber layer (MAPbI$_{3}$) of HHP solar cells, seems to be very fruitful for improving overall photovoltaic performance and also the stability of PSC. In the present study, we perform a device optimization of GA-doped MAPbI$_{3}$-based PSC using numerical simulations. For better performance, several materials have been proposed as hole transport layer (HTL) and electron transport layer (ETL). Among them, zinc oxide (ZnO) and copper (I) oxide (Cu$_{2}$O) are found to be the most suitable ETL and HTL, respectively. In addition, the effect of various parameters, such as defect density and thickness of absorber layer have been investigated. Moreover, it has been found that the work function of the back contact electrode plays a vital role and its value should be more than 5 eV for the better performance of the proposed device. After considering all the optimized parameters, the proposed GA-doped MAPbI$_{3}$-based perovskite solar cell exhibits remarkable photovoltaic performance with a fill factor of 75.13% and power conversion efficiency of 24.61%. The present work contains sufficient information for the experimentalists to design solar cells containing GA-doped MAPbI$_{3}$ absorber layer.</description></item><item><title>The Effect of Different Concentrations of Molybdenum Trioxide in Electrolyte for Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs): Performance Enhancement of DSSCs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304269</link><description>Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)&#8217; photovoltaic conversion efficiency is decreased by recombination reactions at the photo anode/electrolyte interface. Herein, a new molybdenum trioxide ($\text{MoO}_{3}$) function is used as a treatment agent for electrolytes. $\text{MoO}_{3}$ added to the electrolyte precludes recombination of electrons with triiodide ($I_{3}^{-}$) ions at photoanodes/electrolyte interface by adsorbing anions (triiodide/iodide) from the electrolyte on its surface. After $\text{MoO}_{3}$ treatment, the electrochemical properties of the electrolytes do not change significantly but the power conversion efficiency of the DSSCs have clearly improved from 6.31% to 7.47%, owing primarily to higher open-circuit voltages. Different weight percentages of $\text{MoO}_{3}$ were added into the electrolyte: 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 wt%. $\text{MoO}_{3}$ are injected directly into electrolytes, good shake, and followed by centrifugation to obtain clear electrolytes. Clear electrolytes were measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, Mott&#8211;Schottky, current density&#8211;voltage, and open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements. This anionic adsorption onto the $\text{MoO}_{3}$ in the electrolyte has been confirmed by the scanning electron microscope, energy-dispersive X-ray, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy of molybdenum dioxide particles before and after injected into the electrolyte. UV-Vis measurements were carried out before and after centrifugation for electrolytes.</description></item><item><title>Simulation of the Effects of Geometry on Performance of Luminescent Solar Concentrator Photovoltaic Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10288559</link><description>This computational study presents the influences of device geometry, including shape, size, and thickness, on the performance of luminescent solar concentrator photovoltaic (LSC-PV) devices. LSC-PV device optical performance was simulated for 8 different device shapes: circular, regular triangular, pentagonal, hexagonal, square, and three rectangular with varying aspect ratios, with 10 different surface areas from 1 cm2 to 1 m2, and 10 different thicknesses from 0.2 to 5 cm; for 11 different concentrations, 10&#8211;110 parts per million (ppm), of 4 different organic dyes. Each of the LSC-PV devices employs monocrystalline silicon PV cells. The irradiance, as well as spectral distribution of irradiance received by the PV cells, has been simulated by means of Monte Carlo ray tracing to calculate the electrical power and power conversion efficiencies. The results show that triangles, pentagons, and hexagons have better optical performance than squares or circles. Furthermore, the optical internal loss of the LSC-PV device is positively correlated with the device size in which edge performance is relatively poor in larger size devices, and increasing lightguide thickness has a limited impact on the edge performance of the planar LSC-PV devices. Higher dye concentrations and greater stokes&#8217; shifts of the dyes led to more significant edge emissions. The best performance of 3.24% was attained for 1-cm-thick, 100 cm2 small triangular units suitable for matrix-dense packing, using 110 ppm of LR305 dye with a high photoluminescence quantum yield (95%) and a relatively large stokes shift (29 nm).</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Modeling of CPV Performance Loss Factors in Humid Continental Climate</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315952</link><description>Local climate and environmental conditions can impact the performance of concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) systems. There is a lack of experimental performance analysis of CPV systems, especially in the region with high snowfall and very low temperature in winters. In this article, we present first a CPV system performance in humid continental climate and identify snow and frost as sources of losses that are not considered in conventional predictive models. We propose then a method to account for the negative effect of snow and frost on the system, by adding monthly soiling factors in the predictive model. The monthly soiling factors are modeled based on average monthly snow fall and ambient temperature. Applying this method, decrease in root-mean-square error (RMSE) between predicted and actual energy production from 24.51 to 5.07% validates our model in humid continental climate for CPV systems.</description></item><item><title>Effect of Thermal Cycling Aging Photovoltaic Ribbon on the Electrical Performance of Photovoltaic Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10313090</link><description>The objective of this study was to reveal the impact of aging photovoltaic ribbon welding layer materials on the performance of photovoltaic modules. We conducted thermal cycling aging on photovoltaic ribbon, solar cells, and solar cells welded with photovoltaic ribbons. Using scanning electron microscopy, we observed the welded interface morphology of photovoltaic ribbon. The results show that the solder exhibited coarsening, the voids increased, and the intermetallic compound layer thickened at the welding layer. These changes can lead to a decrease of the peeling force in the welding layer, as well as a degradation in the performance of photovoltaic modules. After 200 cycles of thermal cycling aging, the peeling forces of the welded photovoltaic ribbons on the front and back of the solar cell decreased by 0.588 and 3.236 N, respectively. To verify the impact of the aging of the welding layer on the performance of photovoltaic modules, we designed experimental plans for the independent aging of photovoltaic ribbons, solar cells, and solar cells welded with photovoltaic ribbons, combined aging materials, and fabricated four types of photovoltaic modules. After 200 cycles of thermal cycling aging, the power degradation rates of the four photovoltaic modules were 5.9% (aged photovoltaic ribbons + unaged solar cells), 7.5% (unaged photovoltaic ribbons + aged solar cells), 12.5% (aged photovoltaic ribbons + aged solar cells), and 14.3% (aged solar cells welded with photovoltaic ribbons). These results reveal the relationship between the aging of photovoltaic ribbons and the power degradation of photovoltaic modules.</description></item><item><title>Understanding and Benchmarking Ground Reflectors for Bifacial Photovoltaic Yield Enhancement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10272316</link><description>Bifacial modules combined with optimally positioned ground reflectors (albedo) can boost photovoltaic (PV) yield. Yet, a rigorous understanding and benchmarking of the reflector performance is missing, which leads to errors in power yield and economic estimates, thus hampering PV market penetration. Here, we address this impediment by establishing an experimentally validated reverse ray tracing (RRT) approach, combined with empirically derived parameters. First, we determine the spectro-angular reflection of a wide class of ground reflectors (diffuse, glossy, and specular). These parameters were fed into our RRT software, that simulated the PV yield, which was then experimentally validated with a model PV system. The validated framework enables determining an upper limit to PV yield enhancement and current mismatch within modules exposed to different kinds of reflectors. Our approach helps assessing already-existing natural and exotic reflectors, and inspire novel reflectors for enhanced PV yield and economic benefits.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid GMPPT Technique for Photovoltaic Series Based on Fractional Characteristic Curve</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10288588</link><description>This article proposes a hybrid global maximum power point (MPP) tracking technique, named improved global fractional characteristic curve (IGFCC), which combines the advantages of both the model-based and heuristic techniques. The IGFCC technique aims to achieve high speed and accuracy in tracking the MPP of photovoltaic (PV) modules. The model-based technique employed in the IGFCC technique utilizes a precise single-diode model that considers the effects of irradiance and temperature to estimate the MPP voltage. This model-based approach ensures accurate tracking of the MPP and is particularly suitable for PV series applications with string inverters. One of the advantages of the IGFCC technique is its computational efficiency. It involves solving simple equations derived from the single-diode model, which reduces the computational effort required for MPP tracking. This makes the technique practical and feasible for real-time implementation.</description></item><item><title>Model-Based Assessment of the Incident Angle Modifier on the Annual Angular Losses and Gain of PV Modules in Tracking Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292989</link><description>In a competitive photovoltaic (PV) solar energy market, precise and accurate modeling of the energy produced by a PV power plant is required to obtain the best technical and economic project. In particular, slight differences in the predicted energy produced are relevant due to the project size. Typically, the energy calculation includes the direct and diffuse components of the solar radiation at normal incidence. The incident angle's influence is considered using the incident angle modifier (IAM). This study model the experimental values of the IAM available in the literature using the physical, ASHRAE, SANDIA, and Martin&#8211;Ruiz models. Also, a new mathematical model based on only one parameter to describe the IAM is presented. The IAM is used to determine the annual angular losses (AAL) and energy gain using different solar tracking strategies compared with the horizontal plane for locations at different latitudes and climate zones. The results showed that the IAM is sensitive to radiation under indoor and outdoor conditions, quantified by the parameters employed to fit the experimental data. Also, results revealed that the gain in PV systems using solar tracker systems is improved if the AAL is considered.</description></item><item><title>Quantification of the Impact of Azimuth and Tilt Angle on the Performance of a PV Output Power Forecasting Model for BIPVs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286995</link><description>Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) have become increasingly popular in urban areas due to their potential to provide zero-emission energy in buildings. BIPVs enable the use of MO of photovoltaic (PV) modules, resulting in multiple generation peaks throughout the day, which can closely match the consumption profile of a building. However, designing a PV output power forecasting model for BIPVs can be complex, as multiple generation peaks may occur. In general, prior works focused on the design of a PV output power forecasting model and the study of the impact of tilt and azimuth angle variations on the annual yield of a PV system independently. The interaction between the two problems has received little or no attention in the literature. Considering the recent rapid development of BIPVs, it is therefore extremely important to understand this. This article, therefore, aims to quantify the impact of mixed orientations on the accuracy of a PV output prediction model for an 181.15 $\text{kW}_{p}$ BIPV system located in Trondheim, Norway. The results indicate that the mixed orientations resulted in a notable rise in forecast error, with a maximum increase of 51% in root mean squared error, when compared with a baseline model that accounted for all orientations. These findings have important implications for developing practical predictive energy management systems for BIPVs.</description></item><item><title>Net Zero Water Withdrawal Strategies and Multicriteria Impacts for PV Manufacturing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10297559</link><description>Net zero water withdrawal is a sustainable development strategy for manufacturing in water-stressed locations. A case study in Tamil Nadu, India shows that sustainable net zero water withdrawal photovoltaics (PV) manufacturing can be achieved by a) utilizing on-site wastewater treatment and zero liquid discharge units to maximize the usage of onsite reclaimed water, b) using offsite reclaimed water to meet the remaining water demand, and c) implementing continuous improvement in water conservation. Net zero water can be combined with net zero electricity to reduce the life cycle water footprint of PV modules by &#8764;60% while also reducing the life cycle carbon footprint by &#8764;40%. While crucial for managing local water and energy resources, net zero strategies have a relatively small (&#8764;20%) impact on reducing the total multicriteria product footprint. Adding a third strategy of high value recycling with semiconductor recovery can achieve up to &#8764;65% reduction in the multicriteria PV module product environmental footprint covering health, ecosystem, and natural resource impact categories.</description></item><item><title>Variable Conversion Approach for Design Optimization of Low-Voltage Low-Pass Filters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10335630</link><description>This article describes a design optimization method based on variable conversion applied to low-voltage (LV) CMOS analog integrated circuits. For supply voltages in the range of 0.3 to 0.6 V, traditional design variables (e.g., transistor channel width  $W$  and  $\text {gm}/I_{D}$ ) are not suitable for exploring the design space, leading to impractical design solutions. We show that it is more efficient to convert the design variables into current  $I_{D}$  and channel length  $L$ , since these parameters are directly related to circuit performance for LV applications. The proposed optimization algorithm explores the design space to obtain solutions that satisfy the design constraints while analyzing the effects of process, voltage, and temperature variations (PVT). We apply the proposed method for design optimization in terms of area and power consumption of a fourth-order LV active filter preceded by a programmable gain amplifier (PGA), in 130 nm CMOS technology. A fully differential 0.6 V operational amplifier (OTA) is designed as a building block and used in the filter in a bottom-up approach. Measurements of a prototype chip validate the proposed method and resulted in a 0.784 mW, 0.066 mm2 active low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 2.5 MHz and attenuation that meet the requirements of the IEEE 802.15.4 technical standard for 2.4 GHz receivers.</description></item><item><title>Enabling Voltage Over-Scaling in Multiplierless DSP Architectures via Algorithm-Hardware Co-Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10334301</link><description>The design of low-power digital signal processing (DSP) architectures have gained a lot of attention due to their use in a variety of smart edge applications and portable devices. Recent efforts have focused on the replacement of power-hungry multipliers with various approximation frameworks such as multiplierless architectures that require only a few bit-shifts, additions and/or multiplexers when the multiplicand coefficients are known a priori. However, most existing multiplierless and approximation-based works have not been combined systematically with voltage over-scaling (VOS), which is considered one of the most effective power saving approaches, while the few that have tried, were applied to specific case studies with custom modifications. In this article, we are proposing a generic optimization framework that not only minimizes the hardware units in any time-multiplexed directed acyclic graph (TM-DAG) multiplier but also allows the reliable completion of most operations and the avoidance of random timing errors under VOS. This is achieved by synthesizing alternative coefficients that approximate well the original ones, while also activating shorter critical paths. As a result when VOS is applied, minor quality degradation occurs due to the coefficient approximations which are deterministic by design, while the gained timing slack of the new multiplicands allow us to reduce the supply voltage and circumvent the random timing errors induced by the increased delay under iso-frequency/throughput. Our experiments have indicated that when our framework is applied on fast Fourier transform (FFT) and discrete cosine transform (DCT) architectures, it results in up to 34.07% power savings, when compared to conventional multiplierless architectures, while it induces minimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) degradation, even when voltage is reduced by up to 20%.</description></item><item><title>A Masked Hardware Accelerator for Feed-Forward Neural Networks With Fixed-Point Arithmetic</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10359503</link><description>Neural network (NN) execution on resource-constrained edge devices is increasing. Commonly, hardware accelerators are introduced in small devices to support the execution of NNs. However, an attacker can often gain physical access to edge devices. Therefore, side-channel attacks are a potential threat to obtain valuable information about the NN. In order to keep the network secret and protect it from extraction, countermeasures are required. In this article, we propose a masked hardware accelerator for feed-forward NNs that utilizes fixed-point arithmetic and is protected against side-channel analysis (SCA). We use an existing arithmetic masking scheme and improve it to prevent incorrect results. Moreover, we transfer the scheme to the hardware layer by utilizing the glitch-extended probing model and demonstrate the security of the individual modules. To exhibit the effectiveness of the masked design, we implement it on an FPGA and measure the power consumption. The results show that with two million measurements, no secret information is leaked by means of a  $t$ -test. In addition, we compare our accelerator with the masked software implementation and other hardware designs. The comparison indicates that our accelerator is up to 38 times faster than software and improves the throughput by a factor of about 4.1 compared to other masked hardware accelerators.</description></item><item><title>IPOCIM: Artificial Intelligent Architecture Design Space Exploration With Scalable Ping-Pong Computing-in-Memory Macro</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10323361</link><description>Computing-in-memory (CIM) architecture has become a possible solution to designing an energy-efficient artificial intelligent processor. Various CIM demonstrators indicated the computing efficiency of CIM macro and CIM-based processors. However, previous studies mainly focus on macro optimization and low CIM capacity without considering the weight update strategy of CIM architecture. The artificial intelligence (AI) processor with a CIM engine practically induces issues, including updating memory data and supporting different operators. For instance, AI-oriented applications usually contain various weight parameters. The weight stored in the CIM architecture should be reloaded for the considerable gap between the capacity of CIM and growing weight parameters. The computation efficiency of the CIM architecture is reduced by the weight updating and waiting. In addition, the natural parallelism of CIM leads to the mismatch of various convolution kernel sizes in different networks and layers, which reduces hardware utilization efficiency. In this work, we develop a CIM engine with a ping-pong computing strategy as an alternative to typical CIM macro and weight buffer, hiding the data update latency and improving the data reuse ratio. Based on the ping-pong engine, we propose a flexible CIM architecture adapting to different sizes of neural networks, namely, intelligent pong computing-in memory (IPOCIM), with a fine-grained data flow mapping strategy. Based on the evaluation, IPOCIM can achieve a 1.27&#8211; $6.27\times $  performance and 2.34&#8211; $5.30\times $  energy efficiency improvement compared to the state-of-the-art works.</description></item><item><title>HARDSEA: Hybrid Analog-ReRAM Clustering and Digital-SRAM In-Memory Computing Accelerator for Dynamic Sparse Self-Attention in Transformer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10367847</link><description>Self-attention-based transformers have outperformed recurrent and convolutional neural networks (RNN/ CNNs) in many applications. Despite the effectiveness, calculating self-attention is prohibitively costly due to quadratic computation and memory requirements. To solve this challenge, this article proposes a hybrid analog-ReRAM and digital-SRAM in-memory computing accelerator (HARDSEA), a computing-in-memory (CIM) accelerator supporting self-attention in transformer applications. To trade off between energy efficiency and algorithm accuracy, HARDSEA features an algorithm-architecture-circuit codesign. A product-quantization-based scheme dynamically facilitates self-attention sparsity by predicting lightweight token relevance. A hybrid in-memory computing architecture employs both high-efficiency analog ReRAM-CIM and high-precision digital SRAM-CIM to implement the proposed new scheme. The ReRAM-CIM, whose precision is sensitive to circuit nonidealities, takes charge of token relevance prediction where only computing monotonicity is demanded. The SRAM-CIM, utilized for exact sparse attention computing, is reorganized as an on-memory-boundary computing scheme, thus adapting to irregular sparsity patterns. In addition, we propose a time-domain winner-take-all (WTA) circuit to replace the expensive ADCs in ReRAM-CIM macros. Experimental results show that HARDSEA prunes BERT and GPT-2 models to 12%&#8211;33% sparsity without accuracy loss, achieving  $13.5\times $ &#8211; $28.5\times $  speedup and  $291.6\times $ &#8211; $1894.3\times $  energy efficiency over GPU. Compared to state-of-the-art transformer accelerators, HARDSEA has  $1.2\times $ &#8211; $14.9\times $  better energy efficiency at the same level of throughput.</description></item><item><title>Write&#8211;Verify-Free MLC RRAM Using Nonbinary Encoding for AI Weight Storage at the Edge</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10275806</link><description>High-density and reliable multilevel-cell (MLC) resistive random access memory (RRAM) is expected to meet the ever-increasing demand for on-chip weight storages in the intelligent edge devices. However, due to the device variations, many write-and-verify (WAV) iterations are usually required to program the RRAM cell, which causes high power consumption, long latency, and degradation on the memory lifetime. To address this issue, we propose a write&#8211;verify-free MLC RRAM macro for weight storage with 1) a cascode-current-mirror multibit write (CCM-MW) driver and 2) a nonbinary programming scheme (NB-PS) with a radix not greater than 2. A 180-nm 400-Kb RRAM test chip is demonstrated in silicon. For 2-bit-per-cell MLC storage, the value error rates can be reduced by 24.13% after introducing two redundant bits (RBDs). In addition, compared to the single-level cell (SLC) storage scheme, a 37.50% reduction in the number of cells can be achieved to store the ResNet-8 model with a 0.79% loss in inference accuracy without the need for WAV iterations.</description></item><item><title>SiPGuard: Run-Time System-in-Package Security Monitoring via Power Noise Variation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286457</link><description>As Moore&#8217;s law comes to a crawl, advanced package and integration techniques become increasingly crucial by allowing for the combination of fabricated silicon dies, so-called chiplet, to constitute system-in-package (SiP) achieving a much better yield and time-to-market. However, due to inherent security concerns within the convoluted semiconductor supply chain and in-field environment, hostile attacks targeting software and hardware applications can present a formidable challenge to ensuring the security of SiP. Even worse, the immanent black-box nature of product chiplets renders most conventional security inspection and testing solutions less useful. Therefore, we present our SiPGuard in this article to enable the security monitoring capability during run time to noninvasively track the application-level behaviors of target chiplets and detect any deviations potentially induced by underlying malicious intrusions. The security monitoring mechanism utilizes information-bearing system-level power noise variation and machine learning (ML) techniques. Specifically, we utilize a trusted field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chiplet as our trust anchor to implement the lightweight power sensor and on-chip ML inference engine for near-sensor analysis. We prototype our solution on a 2.5-D chiplet-based FPGA device and demonstrate the effectiveness against threats at software/hardware levels by identifying the consequent power anomalies of malicious activities.</description></item><item><title>TrustGuard: Standalone FPGA-Based Security Monitoring Through Power Side-Channel</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10345508</link><description>The Internet-of-Thing (IoT) era inspires a surge of networked embedded devices in the real world. However, cyber-attacks such as malware intrusions pose severe concerns about the security of the entire IoT space by hijacking the devices, altering the application&#8217;s execution, and/or causing a denial of services. Traditional operating-system-level and built-in hardware detection solutions either induce drastic performance degradation or incur high overhead to the system, failing to provide protection in a timely and affordable fashion. On the other hand, external side-channel-based security monitoring becomes an attractive scheme for addressing the dilemma because the observable physical properties of a running electronic device, such as power consumption and electromagnetic (EM) emanations, can deliver a good amount of information for the underlying operations. In this article, we present TrustGuard, a standalone security monitoring framework integrating both power side-channel capturing and machine learning (ML)-based malware detection capabilities on the same field-programmable gate array (FPGA) fabric. We eliminate the need for dedicated sampling equipment like an oscilloscope with an ON-chip configurable sensor FPGA analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and enable agile prototyping of ML accelerator for attack detection through the high-level synthesis (HLS) technique. We deploy the outcome hardware sensor and security monitor on the Xilinx ZCU104 platform to target the prevalent BeagleBone Black (BBB) board by profiling the behaviors of uncompromised benchmark applications and discovering the anomalies introduced by the attack vectors, including malware infections, code injection, and code reuse. The experimental results demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of TrustGuard by achieving more than 90% malware detection accuracy.</description></item><item><title>IOLock: An Input/Output Locking Scheme for Protection Against Reverse Engineering Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10354011</link><description>Reverse engineering (RE) of hardware designs poses a significant threat to the modern distributed electronics supply chain. RE can be performed at both chip and printed circuit board (PCB) levels by using structural, functional, or combined analysis techniques. Recent studies on artificial intelligence (AI)-inspired RE techniques have seen a drastic increase in the effectiveness of such attacks. While various countermeasures, e.g., logic locking (LL) at the chip level and camouflaging at the board level, have been studies to combat RE, the advent of Boolean satisfiability (SAT)-based functional query at chip level and 3-D imaging attacks at board level has shown that these protections can be easily bypassed. We observe that a common factor that contributes to the success of these attacks at both chip and board levels is the ability of an attacker to observe the input/output (I/O) patterns of a working system. Based on this observation, we present a novel locking scheme called IOLock that can effectively prevent access to golden I/O behavior of a working system. IOLock restricts access to the actual I/Os of the chips in a PCB by introducing a low-overhead key management unit (KMU) that works in conjunction with internal encryption/decryption modules near the I/O ports. The encryption/decryption modules are designed to work with the existing joint test action group (JTAG) infrastructure. IOLock can be used in standalone mode or in conjunction with another LL scheme to enhance the overall security of the design. We evaluate the security guarantees offered by IOLock theoretically, through simulation, and hardware measurements. We show that IOLock provides robust protection against both chip-level and PCB-level RE attacks while incurring minimal design overhead.</description></item><item><title>GateLock: Input-Dependent Key-Based Locked Gates for SAT Resistant Logic Locking</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375951</link><description>Logic locking has become a robust method for reducing the risk of intellectual property (IP) piracy, overbuilding, and hardware Trojan threats throughout the lifespan of integrated circuits (ICs). Nevertheless, the majority of reported logic locking approaches are susceptible to satisfiability (SAT)-based attacks. The existing SAT-resistant logic locking methods provide a tradeoff between security and effectiveness and require a significant design overhead. In this article, a novel gate replacement-based input-dependent key-based logic locking (IDKLL) technique is proposed. We first introduce the concept of IDKLL, and how the IDKLL can mitigate the SAT attacks completely. Unlike conventional logic locking, the IDKLL approach uses multiple key sequences (KSs) (instead of a single KS) as the correct key to lock/unlock the design functionality for all inputs. Based on this IDKLL concept, we developed several locked gates. Further, we propose a lightweight gate replacement-based IDKLL called GateLock that locks the design by replacing exciting gates with their respective IDKLL-based locked gates. The security analysis of the proposed method shows that it prevents the SAT attack completely and forces the attacker to apply a significantly large number of brute-force attempts to decipher the key. The experimental evaluation on International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS) and International Test Conference (ITC) benchmarks shows that the proposed GateLock method completely prevents the SAT-based attacks and requires an average of 56.7%, 72.7%, and 87.8% reduced area, power, and delay compared to cascaded locking (CAS-Lock) and strong Anti-SAT (SAS) approaches.</description></item><item><title>Improving Radiation Reliability of SRAM-Based Physical Unclonable Function With Self-Healing and Pre-Irradiation Masking Techniques</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375959</link><description>Physical unclonable function (PUF) is an innovative primitive used for key generation and device authentication, which has promising applications for resource-limited scenarios such as satellite communication. However, the reliability of traditional PUF circuits is low and the power consumption is high. Maintaining reliability also requires high costs, which limits its practical application. This article proposes a multimode SRAM PUF based on a 55-nm CMOS process, which has a self-healing feature. By using a voltage tilt preselection mechanism, the unstable PUF cells can be detected and most of them can be healed by mode switching, thereby improving the reliability of the PUF and reducing the costs required for golden key screening tests. However, the total ionizing dose (TID) effect poses a threat to the PUF, which can significantly increase the bit error rate (BER). In this article, the radiation effect of the PUF is characterized and its mechanism is analyzed. Besides, by means of the self-healing and preirradiation temperature and voltage masking techniques, the radiation reliability of the proposed PUF can be improved avoiding traditional destructive testing. The experimental results demonstrate that the BER can be reduced to as low as 0.0183%, which is  $345\times $  lower than the raw BER, after irradiation up to 100 krad(Si). The proposed technique presents great potential for communication security in the aerospace environment.</description></item><item><title>New Associate Editor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10420470</link><description>It is with great pleasure that I welcome Prof. Jie Gu to the Editorial Board of the IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits as a new Associate Editor.

It features a wideband Doherty power amplifier utilizing adaptive bias and a transmit/receive switch (TRX-switch) that has embedded low noise amplifier to antenna matching. The phase shift of 90&#176; to the Doherty auxiliary amplifier is achieved using a separate IQ-mixer with rearranged phases in the auxiliary path, ensuring a wideband 90&#176; phase shift, and avoiding 3-dB loss from radio frequency (RF) input power splitting. Special emphasis is on the analysis of adaptive bias, the Doherty output combiner network, the decoupling capacitors, and the TRX-switch. Including TRX-switch losses of 1.1 dB in transmit mode, the transmitter reaches a saturated output power of 18.3 dBm with a 1-dB output compression point of 15.9 dBm. Stimulated with a 400-MHz 16-QAM orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) IQ-signal at baseband, without digital IQ-compensation and predistortion, the transmitter delivers a 26.5-GHz modulated signal with an output power ( $P_{\mathrm{ out}}$ ) of 12.8 dBm and an error vector magnitude (EVM) of -20.2 dB. The complete transmitter, including quadrature local oscillator drivers, then achieves a power added efficiency (PAE) of 5.8%. For a 1600-MHz wide 64-QAM OFDM signal,  $P_{\mathrm{ out}}$  is 9.0 dBm, with an EVM  $=\,\,-$ 23.3 dB and a complete transmitter PAE of 3.2%. In receive mode including TRX-switch, at 27.25 GHz, the noise figure is below 4 dB with a gain of 23 dB and a third-order input-referred intercept point of -9 dBm. The active part of the die, manufactured in 22-nm fully depleted silicon on insulator (FD-SOI) CMOS, occupies 2.3 mm2.</description></item><item><title>An Interference-Resilient Bit-Level Duty-Cycled ULP Receiver Leveraging a Dual-Chirp Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10178021</link><description>In this article, we present a blocker-tolerant ultralow-power (ULP) receiver (RX) operating at the 430-MHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, which leverages a chirp modulation scheme to achieve high blocker tolerance. The presented RX simultaneously achieves ULP consumption, high RX sensitivity, and enhanced in-band (IB) and out-of-band (OOB) interference tolerance. This is enabled by a unique dual-chirp ON&#8211;OFF-keying (DC-OOK) modulation scheme in conjunction with several architecture and circuit-level techniques, including bit-level duty-cycling and cost-/energy-efficient high- ${Q}$  radiofrequency (RF) amplifiers. As a result, this RX offers high channel selectivity and good immunity to interference without the need for OFF-chip high- ${Q}$  surface acoustic wave (SAW) and BAW filters or high-power active filters. The RX prototype was designed and fabricated in a bulk CMOS 28-nm process and achieves &#8722; 103 dBm sensitivity for bit error rate (BER) &lt; 10 $^{-{3}}$  while rejecting amplitude-modulated blockers as strong as 41 dBc at a 10-MHz frequency offset. The RX operates at 2.5-kb/s data rate and consumes 110- $\mu \text{W}$  average dc power.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Power Radiation-Hardened Ka-Band CMOS Phased-Array Receiver for Small Satellite Constellation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10251164</link><description>This article introduces a low-power radiation-hardened  $Ka$ -band CMOS phased-array receiver for the low Earth orbit (LEO) small satellite communication system. As the available solar panel area limits the power consumption of the receiver, a multi-coupling common-gate (CG) low noise amplifier (LNA) with current-sharing topology and built-in 180&#176; phase shifter is proposed in this work to solve the power issue. The multi-coupling LNA utilizes three coupling inductors to reduce the input matching impedance with a smaller input CMOS transistor size. After implementing the proposed technique, a single beamformer realized a 3.4-mW typical power consumption compared with the conventional works with 17.3&#8211;195-mW power consumption. The receiver with magnetic-tuning phase shifter (MTPS) has 0.06-dB/Mrad gain and 0.4&#176;/Mrad phase degradations and is the lowest reported root-mean-square phase and gain errors due to radiation. The proposed receiver achieves &#8722;22-dBm IIP3 with a 3.8-dB noise figure. The required on-chip area for each element is only 0.2 mm2. In the over-the-air (OTA) measurement, digital video broadcasting-second generation extension (DVB-S2x) standard modulated signals of up to 256 amplitude phase shift keying (APSK) can be supported by the proposed large array modules. This work realizes &#8722;33.2-dB error vector magnitude (EVM) and 12.8-Gb/s link speed with 1.6-GHz channel bandwidth. The measured beam pattern can cover radiated angle from &#8722;50&#176; to +50&#176; with lower than &#8722;10-dBc sidelobe level. Because of the proposed multi-coupling LNA and MTPS, a low-power radiation-hardened phased-array receiver for small LEO satellites can be achieved in this work.</description></item><item><title>A 136-G&#937; Input-Impedance Active Electrode for Non-Contact Biopotential Signals Monitoring</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10158773</link><description>This article describes an ultra-high input-impedance active electrode (AE) circuit and the system to sense biopotential signals through a capacitively coupled interface. Various techniques from both circuit and system aspects are used to eliminate the input parasitic capacitance of the AE. On-chip parasitic capacitance is compensated by an auto-calibrated positive feedback loop (PFL) without applying any reference signal. A capacitor down-scaling technique combined with SAR-assisted PFL calibration enables femtofarad-level resolution of the capacitor array, alleviating the practical constraints of the conventional PFL to implement a small capacitor below 10 fF. Besides, a dummy input structure ensures that the pad and electrostatic discharge (ESD) capacitances are also canceled by the PFL, while off-chip parasitic capacitance on the printed circuit board (PCB) is nulled by active shielding. Fabricated in a standard 0.18- $\mu \text{m}$  1P6M CMOS process, the AE achieves an ultra-high input impedance of 136  $\text{G}\Omega $  at 60 Hz (average of 10 samples). This is equivalent to an input capacitance of 19.5 fF and corresponds to a  $2.7\times $ &#8211; $68\times $  improvement over the state-of-the-art. The AE exhibits an input signal range of 700 mVpp and an input-referred noise of  $0.72 \mu \text{V}_{\mathrm {rms}}$  (0.5&#8211;100 Hz) while consuming  $10.46 \mu \text{W}$  from a 1.2-V supply.

A novel 2-D scalable coupling topology suitable for large array formation is proposed to enable the desired coherent oscillation mode, in which a differential patch antenna can be incorporated, radiating the third harmonic for high output frequency beyond 600 GHz without a lens. High-efficiency harmonic oscillator design and optimization method are proposed for the third harmonic generation and extraction. This design is also capable of beam steering by changing the bias voltage to establish different phase gradients across the array. Finally, the fabricated chip can radiate 9.1-dBm power and 30.8-dBm lensless effective isotropic-radiated power (EIRP) at 675 GHz. The beam is steerable from &#8722;45&#176; to 45&#176; in the  $H$ -plane, making it the highest power silicon-based THz source and highest frequency beam-steerable chip. This chip was fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, occupying a  $2\times1.7$  mm area. The output frequency is tunable from 643 to 689 GHz.

The proposed single-ended Doherty (SED) PA topology with switched-capacitor (SC) arrays can generate four power efficiency peaks that significantly improve the power-added efficiency (PAE) at the power amplifier (PA)&#8217;s power back-offs (PBOs). In addition, this work utilizes a three-segment DTC, built with a delay-locked loop (DLL), to improve the phase resolution and enable real-time process-voltage-temperature (PVT) calibration of the DTC. Fabricated in a 28 nm CMOS technology, the DPTX achieves a peak output power ( $P_{\mathrm {out}}$ ) of 27.7 dBm and a peak PAE of 33.4% at a 2.1 GHz carrier frequency. The PAEs at 2.5, 6, and 12 dB PBOs are 31.1%, 24.5%, and 18%, respectively. With the 2.1 GHz carrier, the DTC achieves 360&#176; full output phase range, &#177;1.3&#176; differential nonlinearity (DNL), &#177;1.7&#176; integral nonlinearity (INL), and &#8722;133.86 dBc/Hz phase noise at a frequency offset of 1 MHz, while the power dissipation is only 14 mW. When testing the 10 MHz (and 20 MHz) long term evolution (LTE) 64 QAM signals with a 6.2 (5.0) dB peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), the DPTX achieves an average  $P_{\mathrm {out}}$  of 21.5 (22.7) dBm, an average PAE of 23.5% (24.6%), an average system efficiency (SE) of 22.5% (23.8%),&#8211;30.6 (&#8211;27.7) dB error vector magnitude (EVM), and&#8211;34.2/&#8211;32.6 (&#8211;30.1/&#8211;29.2) dBc adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR).

Single-pole double-throw (SPDT) switch is commonly adopted in conventional FEM for T/R isolation, but its insertion loss (IL) deteriorates TX efficiency greatly. To alleviate this problem, a post-matching (PM) architecture is proposed to eliminate the switch in the TX branch. Specifically, a PM network (PMN) is employed to transform 50- $\Omega $  impedance at the antenna port into the intrinsic optimal load impedance of the power amplifier (PA), while the output capacitance of the PA is absorbed into a  $\lambda $ /4-transmission-line (TL)-based single-pole single-throw (SPST) switch in the receiver (RX) branch. The drain voltage of the PA can also be supplied via the SPST, avoiding the use of an additional choke inductor. The theoretical performance of the T/R switch, including bandwidth, IL, and isolation, is analyzed in depth. A 4.9&#8211;7.1-GHz FEM for Wi-Fi 7 application is implemented in a commercial 0.15- $\mu \text{m}$  gallium nitride (GaN)-high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) process to validate the proposed architecture, and the chip size is only 2  $\times $  1.6 mm. The TX mode realizes a saturated power of 37.1&#8211;38.6 dBm and a saturated power-added efficiency (PAE) of 45%&#8211;52.4%. With MCS9 EHT160 signals, an average PAE of 18.5%&#8211;23.3% at an average power of 28&#8211;29.9 dBm is measured, while the error vector magnitude (EVM) specification of &#8211; 32 dB is met. When digital predistortion (DPD) is applied, MCS13 EHT320 signals are also supported. The RX mode achieves a gain of 9.1&#8211;12.1 dB, a noise figure (NF) of 1.6&#8211;1.9 dB, and an input-referred third-order intercept point (IIP3) of 20.2&#8211;25.4 dBm.</description></item><item><title>Highly Efficient Differential Frequency Doubler With Output Resistance Boosting Feedback</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10172337</link><description>This article presents a differential  $V$ -band frequency doubler and a  $D$ -band frequency quadrupler that use complementary MOS transistors.

Conventionally, fractional- $N$  SSPLLs remove the quantization error (Q-error) of the delta&#8211;sigma modulator ( $\Delta \Sigma \text{M}$ ) before the sample-and-hold (SH) circuit using a digital-to-time converter (DTC). As a result, the in-band noise of those SSPLLs is saturated by the jitter of the DTC, and the overall rms jitter is increased. However, the proposed SSPLL cancels the Q-error after the SH using a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). This approach significantly suppresses the jitter of the DAC by the gain of the SH,  $K_{\mathrm {SH}}$ , resulting in a much lower rms jitter. To implement the proposed Q-error cancellation, this work introduces two key techniques: 1) dual-clock-phase sampling (DCP sampling) that maintains a consistently high  $K_{\mathrm {SH}}$  and 2) second-order curve-fitting digital predistortion (SCF-DPD) that enables the DAC to cancel the Q-error more precisely. The proposed fractional- $N$  SSPLL was fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS technology, and the total power consumption was 7.3 mW when a 14-GHz  $f_{\mathrm {OUT}}$  was generated using a reference frequency of 100 MHz. The measured rms jitter and the level of fractional spurs were 104 fs and &#8722;58 dBc, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A 0.39-mm2 Stacked Standard-CMOS Humidity Sensor Using a Charge-Redistribution Correlated Level Shifting Floating Inverter Amplifier and a VCO-Based Zoom CDC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10241982</link><description>This article reports an energy/area-efficient zoom capacitance-to-digital converter (CDC)-based CMOS humidity sensor. It achieves the best-in-class error of &#177;0.8%RH and better figure of merit (FoMw; 87 fJ/c.step) than the state-of-the-art humidity sensors due to the use of the two techniques described in the following: 1) a charge-redistribution correlated level-shifting (CR-CLS) floating inverter amplifier (FIA) is proposed to increase the conventional CLS-FIA open-loop gain by at least 13.5 dB across temperature variations (&#8722;40 &#176;C to 85 &#176;C) and the extreme process corners, minimizing the closed-loop FIA gain error and thus the CDC nonlinearity and humidity error and 2) a pair of stacked humidity sensors over the circuits, all of which are included in the standard CMOS process, is proposed to achieve a lower cost and decrease the area by half. The proposed CMOS humidity sensor is implemented in a 55-nm CMOS process. The measurement results show that the capacitance resolution and humidity resolution are 197 aF and 0.094%RH, respectively, at a total input capacitance of 3 pF, and the effective number of bits (ENOB) is 12.1 at a clock frequency of 2.5 MHz and a cycle number per conversion (N) of 16.

Specifically, after the first injection, a calibration module refines the auxiliary oscillator&#8217;s frequency toward the crystal&#8217;s resonant frequency in a binary-search fashion with a sub-500-ppm error for the second injection. This calibration method eliminates the closed-loop phase-locked loop (PLL) and shortens the calibration period into 48 clock cycles. Prototyped in a 65-nm CMOS process, the XO occupies an active area of 0.134 mm2. The 13.56-MHz XO can achieve a startup time ( $t_s)$  of  $45.8 \mu $ s with a  $V_{\mathrm {DD}}$  of 0.7 V, while consuming 5.0 nJ of energy.  $t_s$  varies by &#177;2.2% amid temperature variations (&#8722;40 &#176;C to 85 &#176;C). Its steady-state power consumption is  $28.4 \mu $ W, with an output phase noise of &#8722;143.7 dBc/Hz at 1-kHz offset (FoM: 241.8 dBc/Hz), manifesting its state-of-the-art performance.</description></item><item><title>A Pitch-Matched High-Frame-Rate Ultrasound Imaging ASIC for Catheter-Based 3-D Probes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10214188</link><description>This article presents an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for catheter-based 3-D ultrasound imaging probes. The pitch-matched design implements a comprehensive architecture with high-voltage (HV) transmitters, analog front ends, hybrid beamforming analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), and data transmission to the imaging system. To reduce the number of cables in the catheter while maintaining a small footprint per element, transmission (TX) beamforming is realized on the chip with a combination of a shift register (SR) and a row/column (R/C) approach. To explore an additional cable-count reduction in the receiver part of the design, a channel with a combination of time-division multiplexing (TDM), subarray beamforming, and multi-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) data transmission is also included. This achieves an 18-fold cable-count reduction and minimizes the power consumption in the catheter by a load modulation (LM) cable driver. It is further explored how common-mode interference can limit beamforming gain and a strategy to reduce its impact with local regulators is discussed. The chip was fabricated in TSMC 0.18- $\mu \text{m}$  HV BCD technology and a 2-D PZT transducer matrix of 16  $\times $  18 elements with a pitch of 160  $\mu \text{m}$  and a center frequency of 6 MHz was manufactured on the chip. The system can generate all required TX patterns at up to 30 V, provides quick settling after the TX phase, and has an reception (RX) power consumption of only 1.12 mW/element. The functionality and operation of up to 1000 volumes/s have been demonstrated in electrical and acoustic imaging experiments.</description></item><item><title>A 46.6 &#956;g/&#8730;Hz Single-Chip Accelerometer Exploiting a DTC-Assisted Chopper Amplifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10148056</link><description>This article presents a single-chip accelerometer with the best reported thermal noise and the lowest bias instability among state-of-the-art accelerometers with high- $g$  ( $&gt;$ 1000  $g$ ) sensing capability. Complete single-chip integration of microelectromechanical transducers, readout circuits, and environmental sensors is achieved by leveraging a CMOS-microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) approach. Simple equations are derived to estimate the gain degradation issue due to delay mismatch in chopper amplifiers. A coarse digital-to-time converter (CDTC) assisted chopper amplifier is introduced to suppress the gain degradation nonideality and potentially improve the energy efficiency. Measurements and simulations validate the accuracy of the predictions and efficacy of the CDTC-based signal-boosting technique. A fine digital-to-time converter (FDTC) assisted demodulation clock skew compensation technique is employed to further suppress the residual flicker noise in chopper amplifiers. Measurement results validate the preliminary investigation of the clock skew-induced residual flicker noise and prove the benefit of FDTC-assisted flicker noise reduction. Both low- $g$  and high- $g$  performance are characterized. Fabricated in a standard 180 nm CMOS process followed by post-CMOS processing, the accelerometer achieves 46.6  $\mu g/\surd $ Hz thermal noise, 472  $\mu g$  bias instability, and  $&gt;$ 1000  $g$  full-scale (FS).</description></item><item><title>A 15.4-ENOB, Fourth-Order Truncation-Error-Shaping NS-SAR-Nested &#916;&#931; Modulator With Boosted Input Impedance and Range for Biosignal Acquisition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10221702</link><description>This article presents a discrete-time  $\Delta \Sigma $  modulator (DSM) with a wide linear input range and high input impedance for biomedical signal acquisition. The proposed integrated circuit (IC) is based on a 1st-order DSM with 2nd-order noise-shaping (NS)-successive approximation (SAR) for high resolution with high power efficiency, directly converting the small input signal to digital. The first-stage integrator in the DSM is designed to support not only for wide-input swing at low power consumption but also for high input impedance. The input impedance is further boosted by a proposed presampling-based charge-transfer-reduction technique, which does not require any additional amplifiers. It precharges the sampling capacitor with just the previous sampled signal, thus reducing the charge transfer and boosting the input impedance. Besides, we also propose a new truncation-error shaping method. By feeding the truncation error back to the local NS-SAR loop, the truncation error is effectively noise-shaped without using any additional loop, resulting in 4th-order NS. The prototype IC is fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process. It achieves 94.5-dB signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) for 1&#8211;500-Hz bandwidth with 600-mVPP input applied, resulting in FoMSNDR of 174.3 dB and FoMDR of 175.8 dB. It achieves over 83-dB common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) and input impedance of 208  $\text{M}\Omega $  at dc and 31.5  $\text{M}\Omega $  at the target bandwidth. Moreover, its artifact tolerance is verified by in vitro and in vivo measurements.</description></item><item><title>Sub-&#956;W Auto-Calibration Bandgap Voltage Reference With 1&#963; Inaccuracy of &#177; 0.12% Within &#8722; 40&#176;C to 120&#176;C</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10195934</link><description>This article presents an auto-calibration technique for current-based bandgap voltage references (BGRs), based on a digitally-assisted auto-calibration loop for calibration cost reduction. We first present a theoretical study of the process variation induced  $V_{\mathrm{EB}}$  and  $\Delta V_{\text {EB}}$  variations in the BJT, which contribute to residual errors in the reference voltage ( $V_{\mathrm{REF}}$ ) and its temperature coefficient (TC) after applying conventional one-point trimming. Based on the study, we further propose an automatic one-point trimming methodology using a current digital-to-analog converter (IDAC), which can simultaneously relax the  $A{V}$ EBand  $\Delta V_{\mathrm{EB}}$  variations, resulting in a small drift in both  $V_{\mathrm{REF}}$  and its TC after calibration. Fabricated in 65 nm standard CMOS, the proposed auto-calibrated BGR achieves a measured TC of 22.3 ppm/&#176;C at 1.2 V supply within &#8722;40 &#176;C to 120 &#176;C. The line regulation is 1.26 mV/V or 0.13%/V from 1.2 to 2.5 V. Based on ten-chip measurement results, the achieved  $\sigma /\mu $  variation in  $V_{\mathrm{REF}}$  improves from &#177;0.53% to &#177;0.12% within the entire temperature spectrum after applying the proposed auto-calibration technique at 27 &#176;C.</description></item><item><title>A Dual-Inductor Ladder Buck Converter for Li-Ion Battery-Operated Sub-Volt SoCs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268424</link><description>This article presents a dual-inductor ladder (DIL) hybrid buck converter to support system-on-chip (SoC)-compatible subvolt ( $\le $ 1 V) supply rails directly from a single-cell Li-ion battery (2.5&#8211;5 V). Facilitating an extreme downconversion (16.67 $\times $ ) using scaled CMOS technology, the proposed topology presents a unique solution to address the active versus passive component utilization while still neutralizing the well-known efficiency versus power density (PD) trade-off for a hybrid converter. The balanced inductor currents help reduce the average switch currents, improving active switch utilization, while the natural soft-charging of the flying capacitors reduces the switch rms currents, improving passive component utilization and PD. The DIL, thus, presents an optimal two-inductor solution for similar applications achieving excellent efficiency and PD. Fabricated in a 65 nm bulk CMOS technology, the DIL obtains 90.6% peak efficiency, 0.93 W/mm2 peak active PD (PPD) with a maximum power delivery of 1.35 W occupying just 1.13 mm2 die area.</description></item><item><title>A Quad-Mode Structure-Reconfigurable Regulating Rectifier With Shared-Inductor DC&#8211;DC Energy Recycling in a Wireless Power Receiver</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10210584</link><description>A quad-mode structure-reconfigurable regulating rectifier (SR-RR) is presented for a wireless power transfer system. The proposed SR-RR combines an ac&#8211;dc regulating rectifier and a dc&#8211;dc boost converter in a single stage. The regulating rectifier converts the received wireless power to an output load and stores the excess power in a storage element to improve the power conversion efficiency. By allowing the regulating rectifier and the boost converter to share a receiver (RX) coil with adjustments to the power stage structure, the SR-RR operates as a dc&#8211;dc boost converter to extend the output power without requiring additional inductors. Freewheeling operation skips power to realize single-stage voltage regulation. In addition, the SR-RR operation mode is automatically selected from among four: charging, storing, boost converting, and freewheeling. The chip, fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu \text{m}$  CMOS process, can regulate an output voltage of 5 V and a stored voltage of 3.7 V. The measurement results demonstrate a 1.7 $\times $  output power extension. Peak RX efficiency reaches 91.8%, while system efficiency reaches 64.7%.</description></item><item><title>Design and Implementation of a Hybrid, ADC/DAC-Free, Input-Sparsity-Aware, Precision Reconfigurable RRAM Processing-in-Memory Chip</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10226332</link><description>In this work, we design and implement a 1-Mb resistive random access memory (RRAM) processing-in-memory (PIM) chip based on a 180-nm CMOS technology. In this design, a time-division multiplexing (TDM) circuit along with sparsity-aware sense amplifier (SA) and asynchronous counter module (ACM) are proposed to free the chip from digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and analog-to-digital converter (ADC). A sparsity-aware input module (SAIM) is designed to improve computational efficiency for bit-level input sparsity detection. A technique based on quantization-aware training (QAT), dynamically reconfigurable shifters (RecSTRs), and tree adders (TAs) is used to achieve system reconfigurability for 1&#8211;8-bit input, 1&#8211;8-bit weight, and 6&#8211;22-bit output.

TICA can perceive the dynamic PVT variations of a circuit with in situ cycle borrowing detectors, then infer its runtime timing slack, and adjust the clock frequency accordingly to minimize the redundant timing margin timely. Therefore, with TICA, a circuit can maintain a small amount of positive timing slack, free from the costly timing error correction process required in conventional in situ timing error detection and correction (EDAC)-based circuits. For error-tolerant applications, TICA can also keep the circuit&#8217;s timing slack at a small negative level for further energy efficiency and throughput improvements. Moreover, an inference-accuracy-driven in situ cycle borrowing detector insertion method is presented, which greatly reduces the insertion rate and the associated timing error detection overheads by leveraging the monotonic relationship between the timing slack and the number of cycle borrowing events. We implement TICA in a near-threshold-voltage (NTV) bitcoin mining core featuring a 64-stage deeply pipelined SHA256 engine in a 28-nm process, with only 0.59% in situ detector insertion rate and 1.4% area overhead. Silicon measurements show  $4.2\times $  throughput improvements or 19.3% energy savings without any timing error compared to the baseline margined for a 10%  $V_{\mathrm {DD}}$  drop, as well as additional 35.7% throughput gains or 10.6% energy savings at 0.3 V when maintaining the error rate of SHA256 computing results at 1%.</description></item><item><title>A Metastability Risk Prediction and Mitigation Technique for Clock-Domain Crossing With Single-Stage Synchronizer in Near-Threshold-Voltage Multivoltage/ Frequency-Domain Network-on-Chip</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10159987</link><description>For a network-on-chip (NoC) with multiple voltage/frequency domains, metastability hurts the reliability during the clock-domain crossing, especially in the near-threshold-voltage (NTV) region. Conventional multistage synchronizers reduce the probability of metastability but have a high latency penalty. This article presents a technique titled metastability risk prediction and mitigation (MPAM) that predicts the near-future metastability risks by a triple-phase clock monitoring circuitry and mitigates them by a metastability-free clock scheme. Therefore, the MPAM enables only one flip-flop for data synchronization without degrading the reliability against metastability, thus improving the latency and throughput of NoC. We prototyped a 2-by-2 NoC test chip with four independent voltage/frequency domains in a 40-nm low-power (LP) process, featuring the MPAM technique. The measurement shows that the MPAM significantly reduces the metastability condition rate by  $10^{10}$  times under different clock frequency ratios. Moreover, by enabling only one flip-flop for synchronization, the MPAM-based NoC achieves packet latency reduction, throughput improvement, and energy efficiency gain by 58%, 13.4%, and 8.6%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A 0.05-mm2 2.91-nJ/Decision Keyword-Spotting (KWS) Chip Featuring an Always-Retention 5T-SRAM in 28-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10183650</link><description>This article reports a keyword-spotting (KWS) chip for voice-controlled devices.

The hybrid wide-deep architecture absorbs their strengths with a powerful parallel processing capability while enhancing the memory capacity of reservoirs. However, the fully analog RC circuit combining the two structures has yet to be proposed, mainly due to unmanageable hierarchical signal processing. Here we report a full-analog memristive RC circuit with a hybrid wide-deep architecture comprising an input module, mask module, reservoir module, and readout module. The input module can generate continuous voltages with temporal sequences. The mask module provides parallel mask processes, laying the foundation for implementing a wide RC structure. The reservoir module includes dynamic memristors and postprocessing circuits. Dynamic memristors can produce high-dimensional reservoir states, and postprocessing circuits allow memristive reservoir circuits to be cascaded to achieve a deep RC structure. The readout module mainly consists of a nonvolatile memristor crossbar and an analog integrator, enabling an efficient multiplication-and-accumulation operation. The simulation results in LTspice illustrate that the memory capacity of the proposed circuit is 91.6% higher than that of wide RC. Moreover, it can efficiently perform temporal tasks, obtaining a high accuracy of 98.99% in arrhythmia detection.</description></item><item><title>A Compact Sub-nW/kHz Relaxation Oscillator Using a Negative-Offset Comparator With Chopping and Piecewise Charge-Acceleration in 28-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10303730</link><description>This work presents a compact and power-efficient kHz-range relaxation (RC) oscillator with robust performance against temperature and voltage variations. By deliberately introducing a negative-offset voltage into the comparator, an offset cancellation scheme leveraging chopping and piecewise charge-acceleration facilitates a low temperature coefficient.

The latency and energy consumption in this process have been a bottleneck and are becoming more severe. To mitigate this problem, the idea of combining sensors, memory and processors for collectively handling the data, has been proposed and explored actively in recent efforts. In this work, thin-film transistor (TFT), which has been widely adopted in display devices and flexible sensors, is exploited. It is shown that, while TFT is promising for large-area sensing, it also shows a great potential for computing and storing data for large-area and low-cost edge sensors. More specifically, we have fabricated and measured two large-area TFT-based near-sensor computing-in-memory (CiM) chips adopting embedded DRAM (eDRAM) and ROM structure respectively.

Moreover, the efficient training of CNNs on resource-constrained platforms has become more important because of communication latency and privacy concerns. However, deploying CNN training on edge devices is challenging due to the intensive computation and diverse computational patterns. In this work, we firstly propose a hybrid decomposition Winograd (HDW) method that significantly reduces the number of multiplications and flexibly handles various convolution operations during training.

This paper proposes a software and hardware co-design system to reduce computational latency and memory access based on workload reorganization and feature reduction. In software, the adjacency matrix is preprocessed, and the workload in both feature and node dimensions is concentrated to optimize memory access and hardware utilization.

However, the emerging memory technologies such as RRAMs, PCMs, STT-MRAMs, etc. are still immature and exhibit significant spatial and temporal variations limiting the yield and the size of crossbar arrays available for implementing logic functions. Considering the technological maturity, ultra-high density and ultra-low cost of 3D NAND flash memory, in this work, we have proposed a novel methodology to exploit 3D NAND flash memory for realizing any logic function in sum-of-product form (SOP) with &#8804;177 literals/inputs and  $\le 2^{14}$  minterms parallelly. Moreover, all the logic functions realized using the proposed technique appear same at the layout level rendering the logic-in-memory implementation utilizing the 3D NAND flash memory an innate camouflaging property and an inherent immunity against security vulnerabilities in the semiconductor supply chain. We have also evaluated the resiliency of the proposed technique against reverse engineering attacks such as SAT attacks, ATPG attacks and brute force attacks on ISCAS&#8217;85 and ISCAS&#8217;89 benchmark circuits.

This challenge leads many accelerators to opt for simpler and shallow models like FSRCNN, compromising performance for real-time needs, especially for resource-limited edge devices. This paper proposes an energy-efficient SR accelerator, ACNPU, to tackle this challenge. The ACNPU enhances image quality by 0.34dB with a 27-layer model, but needs 36% less complexity than FSRCNN, while maintaining a similar model size, with the decoupled asymmetric convolution and split-bypass structure. The hardware-friendly 17K-parameter model enables holistic model fusion instead of localized layer fusion to remove external DRAM access of intermediate feature maps. The on-chip memory bandwidth is further reduced with the input stationary flow and parallel-layer execution to reduce power consumption. Hardware is regular and easy to control to support different layers by processing elements (PEs) clusters with reconfigurable input and uniform data flow. The implementation in the 40 nm CMOS process consumes 2333 K gate counts and 198&#194; KB SRAMs. The ACNPU achieves 31.7 FPS and 124.4 FPS for  $\times 2$  and  $\times 4$  scales Full-HD generation, respectively, which attains 4.75 TOPS/W energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Hardware Accelerator of Fractional-Order Operator Based on Phase Optimized Filters With Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375250</link><description>Hardware accelerators outperform CPUs in terms of performance by parallelizing the algorithm architecture and using the device&#8217;s programmable resources.

The introduction of the residual block (RB) raises the depth of the algorithm to perform better reconstruction. The processing of the RB leads to a decrease in hardware utilization and frequent off-chip communications. It is hard to apply such algorithms on edge devices with limited performance. Computing-in-memory (CiM) is one promising method to reduce high power caused by massive data movement in multiply-accumulation computation. The algebraic sparsity (AS) is the structured sparsity (SS) optimization for imaging computing. However, it is an unsolved problem to simultaneously realize the texture sparsity (TS) of the image and the SS of the algorithm in the CiM scheme while maintaining high hardware utilization. Thus, we propose a CiM-based SR task accelerator. There are three key contributions: first, a texture-aware workflow and a dynamic grouping CiM engine can concurrently support TS coupling with AS. Second, a macro-level pipeline scheme together with two custom-sized CiM macros and a high reuse-rate Hadamard transformation circuit reaches 91% hardware utilization. Third, a novel weight update strategy is devised to reduce the performance loss induced by the weight updating. The accelerator prototype is fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS. It scores a 22.8-44.3-TOPS/W peak energy efficiency at the voltage supply of 0.54-1.1 V and the operating frequency of 50-200 MHz, indicating 1.8-6.8x higher compared to the state-of-the-art CiM processors.</description></item><item><title>Probabilistic Compute-in-Memory Design for Efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo Sampling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10347275</link><description>Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a widely used sampling method in modern artificial intelligence and probabilistic computing systems. It involves repetitive random number generations and thus often dominates the latency of probabilistic model computing. Hence, we propose a compute-in-memory (CIM) based MCMC design as a hardware acceleration solution. This work investigates SRAM bitcell stochasticity and proposes a novel &#8220;pseudo-read&#8221; operation, based on which we offer a block-wise random number generation circuit scheme for fast random number generation. Moreover, this work proposes a novel multi-stage exclusive-OR gate (MSXOR) design method to generate strictly uniformly distributed random numbers. The probability error deviating from a uniform distribution is suppressed under  $10^{-6}$ . Also, this work presents a novel in-memory copy circuit scheme to realize data copy inside a CIM sub-array, significantly reducing the use of R/W circuits for power saving. Evaluated in a commercial 28-nm process development kit, this CIM-based MCMC design generates 4-bit $\sim $ 32-bit samples with an energy efficiency of 0.53 pJ/sample and high throughput of up to 1066.7M samples/s.

The proposed architecture is constructed with a bitonic sorter and several cascaded bidirectional insertion sorting units. The bidirectional insertion sorting unit uses the segmented sorted subsequence generated by the bitonic sorter as input, and records the maximum and minimum values of the subsequence. After all segmented subsequences are processed through the cascaded bidirectional insertion sorting units, a sorted sequence is obtained. The proposed architecture is implemented using the Verilog hardware description language (HDL) and synthesized using the Synopsys Design Compiler with a TSMC 90-nm cell library. The experimental results indicate that the proposed architecture can not only shorten sorting cycles but also reduce hardware area costs. Moreover, sorting cycles can be further shortened by increasing the parallelism of the proposed architecture. Under the configuration that 2048 32-bit data to be sorted and 16 data have to be processed simultaneously, the proposed architecture can improve the throughput-to-gate-count ratio by 16%, and throughput-to-power-consumption-ratio by 25% compared to the existing sorting design.

In ITS, vehicles, infrastructures, and data networks communicate using vehicle-to-everything (V2X) protocols. In V2X message broadcasting, the ECDSA guarantees data security and privacy. During traffic congestion, the signature generation/verification latency becomes crucial. Hence, this paper proposes a high-throughput and efficient ECDSA architecture for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) applications. We investigate the double point multiplication (DPM) method for reducing computational overhead and propose a new finite field multiplier architecture for latency improvement. Our implementation results over  $p_{256}$  on Virtex-7 field programmable gate array (FPGA) show that our design&#8217;s throughput and efficiency are improved compared to previous works by at least  $4.9\times $  and  $7.2\times $ , respectively.

Predicting time sequences is a pervasive and challenging problem that may require identifying the dependencies between sequences that RNN is capable of performing. Despite all its features, conventional RNN still faces challenges such as limited accuracy and a large number of parameters. Therefore, we propose new macromodeling methods for nonlinear circuits called the Clockwork-RNN (CWRNN) and its hybrid version which is a more powerful but simpler implementation of a conventional RNN architecture with relatively little model complexity. In addition, CWRNN inherently models complex dependencies without the need for a large number of parameters. As a result, the computational cost is less than conventional RNN. Moreover, understanding and implementing the CWRNN is relatively simple and provides great flexibility in architectural configuration by introducing modules with several clock rates of exponents of 2. In addition to the above new modeling technique, we proposed the Hybrid-Module CWRNN as another new modeling method that utilizes modules of various exponents of different numbers resulting in further accuracy improvement of the CWRNN. Furthermore, the models obtained from the proposed techniques required much smaller simulation times compared to the current models used in simulation tools. Three nonlinear high-frequency examples have been utilized to verify the benefits of the proposed modeling methods.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Composite Nonlinear Output Feedback Control of ICPT System: When Markov Jumping Systems Meet Event-Triggering Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10295432</link><description>This paper investigates the  ${H_{\infty }}$  dynamic composite nonlinear output feedback control of the inductive coupled power transfer (ICPT) system with load resistance variation, coil structural perturbation, and energy-bounded external disturbance under event-triggering mechanism.

Based on the interesting observation that the power gain is not sensitive to the loss in the 90&#176; transmission line which is used to provide dc path for the source terminal of a transistor to ground, a thorough theoretical gain-plane analysis is carried out. It is found that utilization of a lossy series embedding network with linear, lossless and reciprocal embedding networks can effectively boost the Mason&#8217;s  $U$  and maximum available gain ( $G_{ma}$ ) in single-ended amplifiers and a novel  $U$ -boosting factor is introduced to determine the condition whether  $U$  of an active device can be boosted.

ESS operators can reap benefits from energy arbitrage by optimizing operations of storage equipment. To further enhance ESS flexibility within the energy market and improve renewable energy utilization, a heterogeneous photovoltaic-ESS (PV-ESS) is proposed, which leverages the unique characteristics of battery energy storage (BES) and hydrogen energy storage (HES). For scheduling tasks of the heterogeneous PV-ESS, a practical cost function plays a crucial role in guiding operator&#8217;s strategies to maximize benefits. We develop a comprehensive cost function that takes into account degradation, capital, and operation/maintenance costs to reflect real-world scenarios. Moreover, while numerous methods excel in optimizing ESS energy arbitrage, they often rely on black-box models with opaque decision-making processes, limiting practical applicability. To overcome this limitation and enable explainable scheduling strategies, a prototype-based policy network with inherent interpretability is introduced. This network employs human-designed prototypes to guide decision-making by comparing similarities between prototypical situations and encountered situations, which allows for naturally explained scheduling strategies. Comparative results across four distinct cases demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our proposed pre-hoc interpretable optimization method when contrasted with black-box models.</description></item><item><title>Physics-Guided Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robust Active Voltage Control in Electrical Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10360326</link><description>Although several multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithms have been employed in power distribution networks configured with high penetration level of Photovoltaic (PV) generators for active voltage control (AVC), the impact of the voltage fluctuation of a single PV node on voltage violations of other PV nodes in the network is ignored. Consequently, it leads to the conservativeness of the existing MADRL based AVC algorithms. In this paper, a robust MADRL control algorithm is designed to minimize the nodal voltage violation and line loss with the exploration of coupling voltage fluctuations across all the controlled nodes by coordinating PV inverters, and a physics factor is utilized to guide (physics-guided) the training policy with the expectation of a better performance compared to existing purely data-driven methods. In the proposed physics-guided multi-agent adversarial twin delayed deep deterministic (PG-MA2TD3) policy gradient algorithm, a physics factor, global sensitivity of voltage (GSV), is properly embedded in the algorithm to measure the influence of the nodal voltage fluctuation on voltage violations on the other controlled nodes with PV inverters and this GSV is shared in the learning center to guide the centralized learning and decentralized execution process. The multi-agent adversarial learning (MAAL) embedded with the GSV to seek an adaptive descend gradient for reducing the Q-value function appropriately rather than always assuming the worst case. Therefore, this physics-guided method can reduce the conservation and provide significantly better reward. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared with several other methods on IEEE 33-bus, 141-bus and 322-bus with three-year data in Portuguese and the results indicate the proposed method can obtain the minimal voltage fluctuation and the best reward in the comparisons.</description></item><item><title>Self-Contained Dual-Input Interferometric Receiver for Paralleled-Multichannel Wireless Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10347286</link><description>In this paper, a self-contained dual-input receiver architecture based on the interferometric technique is proposed and demonstrated for the first time for paralleled-multichannel wireless systems.

Recent studies using phase-variable (PV) synchronized switch technologies have also shown potential in broadband PEH, thereby improving off-resonance energy harvesting. However, the electrically induced dynamics by existing interface circuits lack a comprehensive definition and demonstration, hampering the performance comparisons across different circuits. Regarding these gaps, this paper presents an impedance-based analysis and comparison of electromechanical joint dynamics in PEH systems employing various interface circuits. The focus is on their contributions to enhancing harvesting bandwidth. By introducing resonance tunability into the conventional ideal PEH model, this paper proposes a more generic impedance model. It reveals that the achievable dynamic ranges of practical interface circuits are subsets of the ideal arbitrarily tunable scenario. A detailed quantitative study on the attainable ranges of the PV synchronized switch circuit solutions is provided after the introduction of the ideal target. Simulation and experimental data from different interface circuits align well with theoretical findings. The paper concludes that resonance tunability hinges on the extent of the achievable reactive (imaginary) part of the equivalent impedance. Electromechanical coupling conditions and dielectric loss may further impact resonance tunability. The general ideal model and quantitative impedance analysis provided in this paper help guide the future design effort toward high-capability and broadband PEH systems.</description></item><item><title>A 6.78-MHz Coupling Coefficient Sensorless Wireless Power Transfer System Charging Multiple Receivers With Efficiency Maximization by Adaptive Magnetic Field Distributor IC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375821</link><description>Targeting the simultaneous wireless charging of multiple receiver (RX) coils, we developed a coupling coefficient ( ${k}$ ) sensorless wireless power transfer (WPT) system enabled by the proposed adaptive magnetic field distributor (AMFD) IC.

The D-LDO regulator adopts a coarse-fine control scheme to accelerate the load transient response. In steady state, the regulator operates at fine-tuning mode with a small switch strength and a low clock frequency.

Angle insensitivity is achieved by two pairs of Dual-Photodiodes (PDs) for X-axis and Y-axis respectively. 4-CHs temperature-independent flicker detection is realized by a time-interleaved architecture sharing two Trans-Impedance-Amplifiers (TIAs) and one 16-bit third-order incremental  $\Delta \Sigma $ ADC, whose clock provided by a newly proposed relaxation oscillator with real-time comparator offset and current-mirror mismatch temperature variation calibration. 7-Levels Auto-Gain-Control (AGC) is implemented to extend dynamic range.

The AATC method utilizes an exponential curve for high-order fitting the optimal bias voltage, which is generated by the piecewise exponential current of two differential MOS pairs operating in the subthreshold region, only requiring low power consumption and small chip area. To verify the effectiveness of the AATC method, a W-band front-end is fabricated in 65-nm CMOS technology. Benefiting from the AATC method, the measurement results show that the gain variation of the W-band front-end in both receive and transmit modes is less than &#177;0.5 dB over an ultra-wide temperature range from &#8722;30 &#176;C to 120 &#176;C and the corresponding gain temperature coefficient is &#177;0.0033 dB/&#176;C, significantly better than the &#8722;7 dB gain variation without temperature compensation.

Due to the nonlinear characteristics of HEMT, the impedance mismatch at different input power levels is a major challenge in rectifier design. Herein, a variable voltage gate self-bias network is proposed. It can dynamically generate a DC voltage according to the input power level, and continuously provide the optimal bias for the HEMT, thereby improving the RF to DC conversion efficiency in a wide input power range. This design does not require any external sensing or dynamic control circuit. The power needed by the self-bias network is provided using a weak coupling structure placed at the input port, which couples a small amount of the received RF power to operate the self-bias network. It is demonstrated that the proposed rectifier can achieve a dynamic operating power range of 24 dB (from 1 to 25 dBm) for over 60% conversion efficiency, or 16 dB for over 70% conversion efficiency in the measurement.</description></item><item><title>A Two-Step Time-to-Digital Converter With 5.6-ps Resolution and 1&#8211;4255-&#956;s Measurement Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10250876</link><description>This brief presents a two-step coarse-fine time-to-digital converter (TDC) for ultrasonic flowmeter applications.

The proposed architecture consists of two back-to-back multiport networks driven by only one local oscillator (LO) through a multilayer power divider. The low-power LO source can effectively suppress the growth of intermodulations in/between the transmit and DPD feedback loop, thereby optimizing transmission performance. Furthermore, the architecture makes full use of the mainstream DPD architectures, like the frequency-selective (FS) method, to migrate the in-band/cross-band distortions and the adjacent channel interference (ACI) caused by the nonlinearity of the power amplifiers. In experiments, we evaluate the performance of the proposed MTFE architecture over the QAM and OFDM signals. The results consistently demonstrate excellent DPD performance under concurrent dual-band transmission.</description></item><item><title>Dual-Band Dual-Polarized Antenna Based on TDLS Metasurface for 4G/5G Base Station Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10231135</link><description>This brief presents a dual-band dual polarization (DP) antenna based on a cross-shaped metasurface with a terminal double-loop structure (TDLS) applied to 4G/5G base stations.

Compared to conventional low-noise amplifiers (LNAs), LNTAs offer superior linearity as they process signals in the current mode. A novel derivative superposition (DS) method is introduced to enhance the third-order input intercept point (IIP3), and the noise canceling (NC) technique is employed to overcome the inherent trade-off between noise figure (NF) and wideband input impedance matching. The circuit design process is accelerated using Bayesian optimization. Furthermore, the NF and IIP3 of the LNTA can be tuned by adjusting the input bias voltage. The chip is fabricated using 40-nm low-power (LP) CMOS technology. Experimental results demonstrate that the S11 is lower than -10 dB in the frequency range of 0.1-1.95 GHz, with a maximum transconductance gain of 126 mS and a minimum NF of 1.5 dB. The average IIP3 and output 1 dB compression point (OP1dB) over the frequency band is 4 dBm and 1.6 dBm, respectively. The blocker NF is 4.25 dB under a -15 dBm blocker and the blocker P1dB is -19.9 dBm. The power dissipation is 22 mW at a 1.25 V supply.

Several SRAM-based CIM architectures adopt a digital implementation, using the digital adder trees (ATs) to perform in-memory multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations. Compared with the analog-domain CIM, the digital CIM eliminates errors caused by analog circuits to achieve high accuracy. However, the digital AT still incurs much power/area overhead. This brief proposes a novel low-power AT solution by sparsity and approximate circuits co-design. Several sparsity modes are explored to perform approximate logic substitution of the full adder. Besides, fine-grain pruning algorithm and offline data rearrangement compensate for the accuracy loss incurred by approximation. The proposed approximation scheme achieves at least a 19.3% reduction in area and a 30.0% reduction in power consumption. The maximum inference accuracy of the LeNet model on MNIST dataset is slightly 0.06% lower than the baseline accuracy. On the retrained Vgg8 and Vgg16 models on Cifar-10 dataset, the proposed three approximation strategies incur at most 0.99% accuracy decreases.</description></item><item><title>Discrete Switching Sequence Control for Converter Reference Tracking With Zero Steady-State Errors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10124231</link><description>This brief proposes a discrete switching sequence control (dSSC) to achieve zero steady-state error tracking for L-type converters.

A novel magnetic coupling and circuit tuning structure is proposed to achieve parameter estimation and closed-loop control using a sensing coil on the primary side. The design process is according to the industrial need of the application, i.e., substation inspection robots. One key procedure is the magnetic coupling design, utilizing the DD and Q coils to eliminate the undesired cross-coupling between them. Two practical series (S) and inductor-capacitor-capacitor (LCC) compensating topologies are adopted to tune with coils for improving energy transferability.

A single auxiliary switch and few passive devices form simple auxiliary circuits on the DC-link of the inverter. When the auxiliary circuits are involved in the commutation process of the inverter, the DC-link voltage will get into the extremely short zero state in which main switches on the bridge arms can implement the function of zero-voltage switching, eliminating significant switching loss and achieving higher efficiency. In the meantime, the single auxiliary switch can also implement the function of zero-voltage switching. Besides, the voltage across all the switches is no more than the DC supply voltage, reducing the risk of over-voltage. The prominent characteristic of the inverter is the lowest number of auxiliary switches, which makes for the low cost and the simple control concerning auxiliary circuits. This brief elaborates each working state within a switching cycle. The experiment validation declares that switches implement the function of zero-voltage switching. The efficiency of the devised inverter is 99.1% under the rated state. Hence, the devised inverter is superior to other similar resonant DC-link inverters in terms of the efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Open Circuit Fault Localization in NPC Inverter Fed Induction Motor Drives Using Cost Function and Estimated Voltages</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10239292</link><description>Multi-level inverters (MLIs) are widely employed in numerous power conversion applications due to reduced (dv/dt) voltage stresses on the switching devices. The operational performance of MLI decreases due to frequent switch faults that may lead to system degradation and failure.

They are an emerging threat being investigated by academia, the military, and industry. Therefore, run-time hardware Trojan detection is critically needed as the final layer of defense during chip deployment, and in this work, we focus on hardware Trojans that target the processor&#8217;s performance. Current state-of-the-art detectors watch hardware counters for anomalies using complex machine-learning models, which require a dedicated off-chip processor and must be trained extensively for each target processor. In this work, we propose a lightweight solution that uses data from a single reference run to accurately determine whether a Trojan is slowing processor performance, across CPU configurations, without the need for new profiles. To accomplish this, we use an analytical model based on the application&#8217;s inherent microarchitecturally independent characteristics. Such models determine the expected microarchitectural events across different processor configurations without requiring reference values for each application-hardware configuration pair. By comparing predicted values to actual hardware events, one can quickly check for unexpected application slowdowns that are the key signatures of many hardware Trojans. The proposed methodology achieves a higher true positive rate (TPR) compared to prior works while having no false positives. The proposed detector incurs no run-time performance penalty and only adds a negligible power overhead of 0.005%.</description></item><item><title>FASE: Energy Isolation Framework for Latency-Sensitive Applications in Intermittent Systems With Multiple Peripherals</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10258389</link><description>The rapid and widespread deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors is limited by issues related to maintenance costs and safe battery disposal. While battery-less systems supported by harvesting ambient energy offer a potential solution, the weakness and instability of ambient energy result in intermittent execution. To provide data consistency, I/O operations are usually performed in the atomic sections, resulting in low-energy efficiency and low-system progress in intermittent systems. To improve application responsiveness and prevent low-energy efficiency due to atomic I/O operations, we propose a framework named FASE, which provides energy isolation assistance to support multiple asynchronous atomic I/O operations in intermittent systems. Our proposal was evaluated on a real platform, and the results show that, compared to state-of-the-art works, our proposed algorithm can increase the rate of completion for latency-sensitive applications by more than 50%.</description></item><item><title>EDF-Based Energy-Efficient Semi-Clairvoyant Scheduling With Graceful Degradation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10271253</link><description>Recent works introduce a semi-clairvoyant model, in which the system mode transition is revealed on the arrival of high-criticality jobs.

In particular, N:M fine-grained structured sparsity, where only  ${N}$  out of consecutive  ${M}$  elements can be nonzero, has attracted attention due to its hardware-friendly pattern and capability of achieving a high sparse ratio. However, the potential to accelerate N:M sparse DNN training has not been fully exploited, and there is a lack of efficient hardware supporting N:M sparse training. To tackle these challenges, this article presents a computation-efficient training scheme for N:M sparse DNNs using algorithm, architecture, and dataflow co-design. At the algorithm level, a bidirectional weight pruning method, dubbed BDWP, is proposed to leverage the N:M sparsity of weights during both forward and backward passes of DNN training, which can significantly reduce the computational cost while maintaining model accuracy. At the architecture level, a sparse accelerator for DNN training, namely, SAT, is developed to neatly support both the regular dense operations and the computation-efficient N:M sparse operations. At the dataflow level, multiple optimization methods ranging from interleave mapping, pregeneration of N:M sparse weights, and offline scheduling, are proposed to boost the computational efficiency of SAT. Finally, the effectiveness of our training scheme is evaluated on a Xilinx VCU1525 FPGA card using various DNN models (ResNet9, ViT, VGG19, ResNet18, and ResNet50) and datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, and ImageNet). Experimental results show the SAT accelerator with the BDWP sparse training method under 2:8 sparse ratio achieves an average speedup of  $1.75\times $  over that with the dense training, accompanied by a negligible accuracy loss of 0.56% on average. Furthermore, our proposed training scheme significantly improves the training throughput by  $2.97\times $ &#8211; $25.22\times $  and the energy efficiency by  $1.36\times $ &#8211; $3.58\times $  over prior FPGA-based accelerators.</description></item><item><title>Ace-Sniper: Cloud&#8211;Edge Collaborative Scheduling Framework With DNN Inference Latency Modeling on Heterogeneous Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10247268</link><description>The cloud&#8211;edge collaborative inference requires efficient scheduling of artificial intelligence (AI) tasks to the appropriate edge intelligence devices. Gls DNN inference latency has become a vital basis for improving scheduling efficiency. However, edge devices exhibit highly heterogeneous due to the differences in hardware architectures, computing power, etc. Meanwhile, the diverse deep neural networks (DNNs) are continuing to iterate over time. The diversity of devices and DNNs introduces high computational costs for measurement methods, while invasive prediction methods face significant development efforts and application limitations. In this article, we propose and develop Ace-Sniper, a scheduling framework with DNN inference latency modeling on heterogeneous devices. First, to address the device heterogeneity, a unified hardware resource modeling (HRM) is designed by considering the platforms as black-box functions that output feature vectors. Second, neural network similarity (NNS) is introduced for feature extraction of diverse and frequently iterated DNNs. Finally, with the results of HRM and NNS as input, the performance characterization network is designed to predict the latencies of the given unseen DNNs on heterogeneous devices, which can be combined into most time-based scheduling algorithms. Experimental results show that the average relative error of DNN inference latency prediction is 11.11%, and the prediction accuracy reaches 93.2%. Compared with the nontime-aware scheduling methods, the average waiting time for tasks is reduced by 82.95%, and the platform throughput is improved by 63% on average.</description></item><item><title>Boosting the Convergence of Reinforcement Learning-Based Auto-Pruning Using Historical Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10265172</link><description>Recently, neural network compression schemes like channel pruning have been widely used to reduce the model size and computational complexity of deep neural networks (DNNs) for applications in power-constrained scenarios, such as embedded systems. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based auto-pruning has been further proposed to automate the DNN pruning process to avoid expensive hand-crafted work. However, the RL-based pruner involves a time-consuming training process, and pruning and evaluating each network comes at high-computational expense. These problems have greatly restricted the real-world application of RL-based auto-pruning. Thus, we propose an efficient auto-pruning framework that solves this problem by taking advantage of the historical data from the previous auto-pruning process. In our framework, we first boost the convergence of the RL-pruner by transfer learning. Then, an augmented transfer learning scheme is proposed to further speed up the training process by improving the transferability. Finally, an assistant learning process is proposed to improve the sample efficiency of the RL agent. The experiments show that our framework can accelerate the auto-pruning process by  $1.5\times $ &#8211; $2.5\times $  for ResNet20, and  $1.81\times $ &#8211; $2.375\times $  for other neural networks, such as ResNet56, ResNet18, and MobileNet v1.</description></item><item><title>Statistical Hardware Design With Multimodel Active Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268051</link><description>With the rising complexity of numerous novel applications that serve our modern society comes the strong need to design efficient computing platforms. Designing efficient hardware is, however, a complex multiobjective problem that deals with multiple parameters and their interactions. Given that there is a large number of parameters and objectives involved in hardware design, synthesizing all possible combinations is not a feasible method to find the optimal solution. One promising approach to tackle this problem is statistical modeling of a desired hardware performance. Here, we propose a model-based active learning approach to solve this problem. Our proposed method uses Bayesian models to characterize various aspects of hardware performance. We also use acrlong TL and Gaussian regression bootstrapping techniques in conjunction with active learning to create more accurate models. Our proposed statistical modeling method provides hardware models that are sufficiently accurate to perform design space exploration (DSE) as well as performance prediction simultaneously. We use our proposed method to perform DSE and performance prediction for various hardware setups, such as micro-architecture design and OpenCL kernels for FPGA targets. Our experiments show that the number of samples required to create performance models significantly reduces while maintaining the predictive power of our proposed statistical models. For instance, in our performance prediction setting, the proposed method needs 65% fewer samples to create the model, and in the DSE setting, our proposed method can find the best parameter settings by exploring fewer than 50 samples.</description></item><item><title>CorrectNet+: Dealing With HW Non-Idealities in In-Memory-Computing Platforms by Error Suppression and Compensation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10242326</link><description>The last decade has witnessed the breakthrough of deep neural networks (DNNs) in many fields. With the increasing depth of DNNs, hundreds of millions of multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations need to be executed. To accelerate such operations efficiently, analog in-memory computing platforms based on emerging devices, e.g., resistive RAM (RRAM), have been introduced. These acceleration platforms rely on analog properties of the devices and thus suffer from process variations. Consequently, weights in neural networks configured into these platforms can deviate from the nominal trained values, which may lead to feature errors and a significant degradation of the inference accuracy. Besides, additional HW aspects represent key controlling factors for such computing platforms, namely, the limited RRAM cell programmable conductance levels, which limits the number of bits stored in one RRAM cell, the ADC noise converting analog values to digital domain and the ADC power scaling with the number of bits of its output. To address these points, in this article, we propose a framework to enhance the robustness of neural networks under variations. First, an enhanced Lipschitz constant regularization is adopted during neural network training to suppress the amplification of errors propagated through network layers. Additionally, the quantization setting of a NN model is optimized considering robustness against weight variations and total ADC power consumption. Afterward, error compensation is introduced at necessary locations determined by reinforcement learning (RL) to rescue the feature maps with remaining errors. Experimental results demonstrate that inference accuracy of neural networks can be recovered from as low as 1.69% under variations back to more than 95% of their original accuracy at the highest level of variations and reducing total ADC power consumption by 55% while the training and hardware cost are negligible.</description></item><item><title>Performance- and Energy-Aware Gait-Based User Authentication With Intermittent Computation for IoT Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10242378</link><description>Internet of Things (IoT) makes it possible to utilize a multitude of small- and medium-scale devices allowing for increased functionality in flexible networks. However, user authentication on IoT devices is as important as it can be challenging. Due to limitations on the available energy, interface, and processing power, IoT devices can be the weakest link in their networks. Multiple authentication techniques have been developed to address these challenges. However, the existing techniques are limited in terms of performance, overheads, and efficiency. In contrast, our proposed authentication method uses a user&#8217;s walking gait as an input, because gait is unique to every user and can be collected using low-power inertial sensors found on all handheld devices. Our authentication method uses a lightweight neural network (NN) which is further complimented with early exits to further optimize computational cost(s). We also propose reinforcement learning that considers the energy consumption to dynamically determine which of the exits should be chosen to strike a balance between performance and computational and energy cost. Though effective, one of the challenges with IoT devices is their power supply such as dependence on batteries. Discharge of the battery or any other interruptions can lead to recomputations, which are expensive on already limited battery-operated IoT devices. To address such challenges, especially for user authorization, we introduce intermittent computation to our proposed authentication framework. Intermittent computation can store the state of the NNs at checkpoints. In the case of power disruption, the execution will be resumed from the saved checkpoints instead of performing the whole execution. Most implementations of intermittent computation take place at the compiler level, which makes for a very efficient design, however, that also makes them hardware specific. Our method is implemented on software and is hardware-agnostic, allowing us to create checkpoints to save and retrieve the authentication framework state, in case of power interruption. The proposed authentication framework can authenticate users with up to more than 85% accuracy and can save up to 34% of computations due to the proposed intermittent computing.</description></item><item><title>Pplace-MS: Methodologically Faster Poisson&#8217;s Equation-Based Mixed-Size Global Placement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10266769</link><description>With the advancement of semiconductor technologies, the acceleration of advanced EDA algorithms is receiving much attention. However, developing a faster mixed-size placer without hardware acceleration and loss of solution quality is of great challenge. In this article, we propose a novel definition of potential energy for each block for global placement based on an analytical solution of Poisson&#8217;s equation. A fast approximate computation scheme for partial derivatives of the potential energy is given with considerably less computational loads than existing electrostatics-based placers. Moreover, we propose an effective and efficient occupy-aware macro legalization algorithm. Then, a mixed-size placer named Pplace-MS is developed. Compared to the existing leading mixed-size placer, Pplace-MS on average achieves  $2.054\times $  speedup in single-threaded mode on the same machine and 2.3% reduction of scaled half-perimeter wirelength on the modern mixed-size placement benchmarks. The proposed approach can also be considered accelerated on GPU, as previous works.</description></item><item><title>Power Aware Placement of On-Chip Voltage Regulators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10273654</link><description>In traditional power delivery networks, the on-chip supply voltage is provided by board-level converters. Due to the significant distance between the converter and the load, variations in the load current are not effectively managed, producing a significant voltage drop at the point-of-load. To mitigate this issue, modern high-performance systems utilize on-chip voltage regulators. Due to the close proximity to the load, these regulators can quickly respond to fluctuations in the input voltage or load current, providing superior power quality. Integrated voltage regulators however require significant area, limiting the number of on-chip regulators. An algorithm for distributing on-chip voltage regulators is presented in this article. The algorithm is accelerated using the acrlong IMT, enabling the analysis of arbitrarily sized power grids. The power quality is maximized with a limited number of regulators. Practical scenarios are supported, such as limited current capacity and restricted placement. Several orders of magnitude speedup in the placement process is demonstrated while achieving up to 88% reduction in the maximum voltage drop.</description></item><item><title>Generation of Two-Cycle Tests for Structurally Similar Circuits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10271261</link><description>VLSI design flows improve design parameters (performance, power, area, and testability) iteratively. Whereas the &#8220;shift left&#8221; trend implies that changes at the RTL are preferred for improving the design, it is sometimes necessary to make gate-level changes, e.g., because of layout changes or ECO. In an iterative design flow, repeated ATPG to evaluate the testability of a design after design changes have been made creates a bottleneck. The goal of this article is to address this bottleneck considering two-cycle tests for transition faults. The test generation procedure described in third article transforms an LOC test set generated for an earlier version of the design into an LOC test set for a new version without repeating the entire test generation process. To enable the transformation, it is necessary to find a mapping between the inputs and outputs of the earlier and new versions of the design, taking into consideration that RTL resynthesis may produce a new gate-level netlist, with new signal names and different input and output orders. To address two-cycle tests, the mapping is performed over two time frames of the design. Experimental results for industrial circuits with changes made at the RTL as well as gate-level demonstrate significant runtime gains with the test generation procedure described in this article.</description></item></channel></rss>
