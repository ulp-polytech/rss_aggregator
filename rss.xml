The proposed architecture transfers charges to any lower voltage cell(s) within the battery module naturally without sensing the individual cell voltage. Each half-bridge converter converts the voltage of its corresponding battery module to an ac signal, which is then transmitted to the ac link via a transformer and two decoupling capacitors. Since all modules are interconnected via the shared ac link, any low-voltage battery cell(s) receives energy from the link, thereby enabling effective energy transfer among modules. The proposed equalizer enables an adaptive current distribution among cells without relying on any selection switches. A 16-cell prototype (two modules of eight 3.6 V 18 650 cells each) was built to validate the effectiveness of the proposed topology. The equalization performances of the equalizer under single-module operation and dual-module operation have been evaluated. The proposed equalizer offers advantages in scalability, control complexity, and efficiency over conventional approaches, which makes it well suited for large-scale energy storage applications.</description></item><item><title>Nonresonant Soft-Switching DC&#8211;DC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11271112</link><description>Since the traditional resonant soft-switching converter operates with variable switching frequency, it is difficult to design the filter. In addition, the auxiliary switch should be added into the resonant soft-switching converters to realize constant switching frequency, resulting in the complex control method. In order to address the problems, a new nonresonant soft-switching structure is proposed. An auxiliary inductor and the output filter inductor facilitate nonresonant zero-current switching turn-on for the switch under all duty cycle and load. All the diodes can realize nonresonant soft-switching by the clamping capacitor with constant voltage and the auxiliary inductor. There is only one switch in the proposed structure and pulsewidth modulation control can be used, so the control method is simple. A nonresonant soft-switching buck converter is taken as an example to illustrate the operating principle of the proposed structure. Voltage stress of all semiconductors is equal to the output voltage, which does not vary with the input voltage. Average output filter inductor current is equal to the input current. Parameters design and example are given. Loss analysis of the proposed converter is given. Stability of the proposed converter is analyzed. Experimental results validate the theoretical analysis. Comparison among different soft-switching buck-type converters is given.</description></item><item><title>Robust Fixed-Time Sliding Mode Control for DC/DC Converters With Varying Exponential Coefficient</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11271729</link><description>In this article, a novel disturbance observer-based sliding mode control scheme with fixed-time convergence mechanism is proposed to regulate the output voltage of dc&#8211;dc buck converters. First, to assure that the convergence time of the voltage tracking process is independent of the initial state, a new varying exponential coefficient fixed-time sliding mode controller (VECFxTSMC) is proposed in the outer loop of dc&#8211;dc buck converters. The designed varying exponential coefficient $\sigma$ increases when the system trajectory is distant from the origin to improve the convergence speed and decreases when the system trajectory is near the origin to assure the robustness. Compared with conventional fixed-time sliding mode controllers, the proposed one not only assures a fixed-time convergence of system trajectory but also further enhances the robustness and dynamic performance of the system without increasing chattering, thus the performance of buck converters can be further enhanced. Then, a fixed-time disturbance observer is designed in combination with the proposed VECFxTSMC to estimate the unknown lumped disturbances and enhance the disturbance rejection ability of buck converters. Finally, a set of comparative experiments between conventional methods and the proposed method are implemented based on dc&#8211;dc buck converters, and the experimental results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>A Current Sharing Strategy With Model Predictive Control for Multiphase Parallel LLC-Buck Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11275835</link><description>Input-series-output-parallel (ISOP) LLC-Buck converters are widely used in energy storage systems for their high efficiency and wide voltage gain range. However, parameter mismatches among parallel modules often cause power imbalance and degraded current sharing. This article proposes a model predictive control (MPC) based current sharing strategy for multiphase LLC-Buck converters. A current-sharing error model is established to analyze the impact of mismatched parameters, including resonant components, magnetizing inductance, switch characteristics, and Buck inductor resistance. Based on this, a fixed-frequency, single-step MPC algorithm is developed, incorporating real-time reference updates and an observer to correct model deviations. Compared with the widely used average current control, the proposed method enhances dynamic response, robustness, and current balance. A 500 W two-phase LLC-Buck prototype (48 V to 3.2 V) is built, and both simulation and experimental results validate the approach, achieving current sharing errors of 0.84% at half-load and 0.27% at full-load.</description></item><item><title>A Switched-Capacitor Asymmetrical-Input Eleven-Level Inverter With Zero Leakage Current for PV Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11277380</link><description>In photovoltaic applications, multisource transformerless inverters pose a leakage current issue due to the absence of galvanic isolation, presenting a structural design challenge. This article proposes a switched-capacitor eleven-level inverter featuring an asymmetric input configuration and common-ground structure. The asymmetric design allows the inverter to accommodate PV panels of varying specifications, while the common-ground connection effectively eliminates the leakage current. With the series and parallel operation, the voltage of all capacitors is naturally self-balanced without any voltage sensors. Furthermore, the generalized structure of the proposed inverter accommodates a variable number of input sources while maintaining its common-ground configuration, thereby enhancing flexibility and safety. Meanwhile, the reliability of the system has also been verified and enhanced when any input voltage source failed. Compared to existing structures, the proposed inverter requires fewer power devices, demonstrates higher boosting capability, appropriate costs, improve reliability, and effectively addresses the leakage current issue. Besides, the nearest level modulation strategy, system parameter designs, and power loss analysis are given. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed structure and control strategy are verified through simulation and experimental results, confirming its dynamic stability under off-grid conditions and reactive power support capability under on-grid conditions.</description></item><item><title>Enhanced Power Sharing of Dual-Frequency-Band Grid Emulator Utilizing Inductive Terminal Characteristic</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11278105</link><description>The grid-interaction stability of the converter may vary with grid impedance conditions, and needs to be validated before field deployment. To facilitate stability tests toward grid-connected converters, a dual-frequency-band grid emulator has been proposed, which consists of an impedance-forming converter (IFC) switching at high frequency, and a power-supporting converter (PSC) switching at low frequency. Normally, the IFC is used to mimic the terminal characteristics of a predefined grid condition, while the PSC is expected to absorb/supply the power flowing through the converter under test. However, due to the limited control bandwidth of PSC, a large proportion of harmonic and transient power may flow through IFC under grid resonance conditions, which deviates from the design expectation. This may lead to overcurrent of IFC and limit the full use of PSC's power capacity. In this article, the power sharing of a dual-frequency-band grid emulator is studied, and an enhancement method utilizing the inductive terminal characteristic of IFC is proposed. With the proposed method, the current tracking performance of PSC is elevated, which naturally improves power sharing and extends the applicable power range of the grid emulator.</description></item><item><title>An Online Safe-Fast Start-Up Strategy for LC-DAB Converter Based on Resonant-Voltage-Limitation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11282480</link><description>Unlike L-DAB converters, where startup safety primarily focuses on limiting peak inductor current, LC-DAB converters require additional attention due to the overvoltage issue of resonant capacitors, causing immediate dielectric breakdown and permanent damage. Therefore, limiting the peak resonant voltage should be prioritized as a critical condition for ensuring safe startup in LC-DAB converters, which has not yet been effectively solved. To address this issue, a closed-loop safe-fast startup strategy for LC-DAB converters is proposed in this article. By keeping the peak voltage of the resonant capacitor (vrmax) to its allowable maximum during the startup process, the proposed strategy ensures converter safety while maximizing output power, thereby accelerating the startup process. First, a time-domain model of the LC-DAB converter is established through state plane trajectory analysis. Based on this model, the optimal phase shift combination that limits vrmax while maximizing output power is derived. Furthermore, smooth variation of the phase-shift angles and online optimization over a wide voltage and load range can be realized based on real-time sampling of the input and output voltages for the proposed strategy, demonstrating strong engineering applicability. Experimental results show that, compared to conventional startup strategies for LC-DAB converters, the proposed method reduces startup time by up to 73.85% under safe resonant voltage limitation.</description></item><item><title>A Crossingly Merged Four-Port PV System Topology With Controllable Symmetry for Resonant Conversion</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11288091</link><description>This article proposes a simple four-port resonant converter for standalone photovoltaic (PV) systems. Specifically, the new topology combines an isolated resonant LLC converter and two bi-directional buck-boost converters by using only four mosfets on the primary side, and thus, fulfills PV voltage regulation and battery management in a low-cost manner. Then, by properly designing the control sequence for the power switches, the system can not only divide the PVs into two groups for distributed management, but also stack the PVs and the battery as the dc supply for LLC. This reduces the influence of PV voltage variation and eliminates the need of pre-regulation stage. In addition, the LLC part can either maintain a symmetrical mode to improve efficiency, or add asymmetry control when a wider regulation range is needed. Based on the theoretical analysis, experimental results verify the performance of the proposed concept.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Grid-Following Control Strategy With DC Inertia Synchronization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11288068</link><description>Regarding the subsynchronous oscillation issues of grid-following (GFL) converters in weak grids, existing improved control and parameter optimization strategies are already well-developed. Recent references have proposed hybrid control methods that combine features of GFL and grid-forming (GFM) controls. GFL converters applying a phase-locked loop (PLL) are liable to instability in weak grids, whereas GFM converters exhibit good stability. These hybrid structures focus on the integration of a virtual synchronous generator (VSG) or droop control with GFL control. Apart from VSG and droop control, dc inertia synchronization (IsynC) control is another common GFM strategy. However, there are currently no published references on hybrid control strategies combining GFL control with dc IsynC. Therefore, this article proposes an equivalent hybrid strategy for GFL converters by incorporating dc IsynC. The equivalent hybrid method introduces the dc power deviation to the dc voltage loop output, which will influence the d-axis current directly and q-axis voltage indirectly. Then, the PLL output &#952; will be consequently affected, and finally, &#952; will include the same component with IsynC, thereby incorporating the concept of equivalent hybrid dc IsynC. Finally, theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed equivalent hybrid control strategy.</description></item><item><title>A Bidirectional LLC-Based Integrated Equalizer for Large-Scale Energy Storage Systems: A Parallel Transformer Approach for Efficient and Compact</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11291124</link><description>The existing transformer-based equalization systems have the advantages of simple circuitry and ease of control. However, their application in large-scale energy storage systems is often hampered by scalability issues, as the number of magnetic components typically scales linearly with the cell count. A bidirectional LLC-based integrated equalizer employing a parallel modular transformer architecture to overcome this scalability challenge in large-scale energy storage systems is proposed. By leveraging the symmetrical voltage and current waveforms inherent to the LLC converter, the proposed equalizer enables a single secondary winding to balance two adjacent cells, thereby halving the required number of transformers. Furthermore, the proposed circuit can achieve balancing during charging, discharging, and idle states in the energy storage system. The proposed design was validated on an eight-cell supercapacitor prototype, demonstrating rapid voltage convergence under all operating conditions. The system achieved peak efficiencies of 95.5%(charging) and 95.7%(discharging) within a 10 to 30 W power range.</description></item><item><title>An Improved Inductor Current Compensation Scheme for TCM Controlled Grid-Tied Inverters Considering Circuit Nonidealities Effects</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11296990</link><description>Triangular current mode (TCM) control is popularly applied in low-to-medium power grid-tied inverters (GTIs) due to its excellent ability of realizing full-range zero-voltage-switching. However, practical circuit nonidealities, including time delay and the resonance occurring between the power inductor and parasitic output capacitances of the power switches, make actual inductor current boundary diverge from the required one, which degrades the control accuracy and thereby deteriorates the grid current total harmonic distortion. To tackle this issue, an improved inductor current compensation scheme for TCM-controlled GTIs is proposed. Taking the single-phase full-bridge GTI as an example, the adverse effects of time delay and resonance process on TCM control are separately modeled and analyzed. Then, an accurate operation model of TCM-controlled GTIs considering these two circuit nonidealities is developed. In this model, a charge-based resonance behaviors estimator is proposed for estimating the pivotal current and time parameters of the resonance process with simple forms. Further, elaborations of the proposed scheme, parameters design and control implementation are conducted. Finally, the efficacy and advantages of the proposed scheme are verified through the simulations and experiments on a 300-W GTI prototype.</description></item><item><title>Mathematical Modeling and Multiobjective Optimization of Negative-Coupled Inductor in Multiphase Interleaved DC&#8211;DC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11297018</link><description>To optimize the converter efficiency, footprint and volume of magnetic devices simultaneously, this article proposes a mathematical modeling and multiobjective optimization method based on multiphase negative-coupled inductor (NCI) in interleaved dc&#8211;dc converter, and elaborates on the specific details by taking interleaved buck converter (IBC) and four-phase NCI as an example. First, flux cancellation is employed to design a four-phase NCI without core center column. Next, comprehensive mathematical models of NCI are established considering essential parameters. Subsequently, the Pareto Front of the objective function and converter efficiency constraint is identified through the multiobjective optimization based on the modeling results, enabling tradeoff for optimal parameters selection of NCI. Finally, an experimental prototype of 300 W demonstrates that compared to separate inductors, NCI reduces footprint and volume by 41.31% and 60.90%, respectively, while achieving the magnetic device power density of 7376 W/in3, the 1.45% improvement of rated efficiency and better transient performance of IBC.</description></item><item><title>Second-Harmonic Current Suppression Scheme for Cascaded H-Bridge Converter-Based BESS With Reduced Capacitance Requirement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11296996</link><description>The cascaded H-bridge (CHB) converter-based battery energy storage system (BESS) is a promising solution for large-capacity energy storage due to its modular architecture. However, the instantaneous power exchanged between the ac and dc sides generates a second-harmonic current (SHC), which can degrade the lifespan of the BESS. To address this issue, this article proposes a differential buck-based active power decoupling scheme that suppresses SHC without additional power semiconductors. The proposed scheme comprises two key components: a differential buck circuit designed on the ac-side of each H-bridge to provide a conduction path for SHC and a closed-loop control strategy for multibattery clusters to ensure effective SHC suppression. Compared with conventional passive filtering schemes, the proposed scheme reduces the capacitance requirement while achieving superior SHC suppression performance, thus reducing the overall cost of CHB-based BESS. Moreover, adaptive SHC control strategies are developed to maintain effective SHC suppression under state-of-charge imbalance among battery clusters. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated through simulations and experiments.</description></item><item><title>Bidirectional Isolated DC&#8211;DC Converter With Power Active Allocation Strategy for Single-Cell BESS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11297002</link><description>This article proposes a low-voltage-side parallel high-voltage-side series isolated bidirectional dc&#8211;dc converter for single-cell battery energy storage systems, addressing the critical challenges of high voltage gain requirements and low-voltage/high-current operation. Two parallel staggered shunt boost units are used on the low-voltage side to reduce the current ripple and the current stress. The voltage gain is further increased by applying an isolation capacitor on the high-voltage side, which enables the converter to accomplish high-gain boosting without a high transformer turns ratio. Since switches with different performance are used in the two parallel branches to achieve cost efficiency, this article further proposes a power active allocation strategy (PAAS) for the proposed converter. Despite the mixed use of switches with different conduction and switching characteristics, the proposed strategy dynamically optimizes the branch current allocation through duty cycle control while regulating the output voltage, thus improving the overall system efficiency, particularly enhancing efficiency under light-load conditions. Finally, a 250 W prototype with 3.2 V/48 V is built to verify the working principle of the proposed converter, and the overall efficiency is improved by an average of 1.22% after adopting the PAAS.</description></item><item><title>Current Profile Optimization for Accurate Early-Stage Internal Short Circuit Resistance Identification of High-Rate Lithium-ion Batteries</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11297836</link><description>High-rate lithium-ion batteries, with high-power density, are widely used in electric vehicles and frequency regulation battery energy storage stations. However, they are more prone to lithium dendrites and internal short circuit (ISC) faults, a major cause of thermal runaway. Early ISC diagnosis is crucial for battery safety, especially identifying ISC resistance as an indicator of fault severity. However, its identification is limited by two factors. One is the time-varying nature of battery model parameters. The other is the weak features of early-stage ISC faults, which make accurate identification difficult. To this end, a model-parameter-independent method is proposed for ISC resistance identification with optimized current excitation. First, a simplified equivalent circuit model is derived by comparing the voltage responses of circuit parameters with the sampling error. Based on this simplified model, an identification method is developed without requiring parameter knowledge. Then, the Cramer&#8211;Rao lower bound theory is used to guide current profile optimization for improved accuracy. Finally, experimental results show that the optimized current reduces the relative error of early-stage ISC resistance identification at 25 &#176;C to 1.93% &#8211;5.02%, significantly better than the preoptimization range of 7.11% &#8211;70.12%. Nail penetration experiment further demonstrates the method&#8217;s effectiveness under real ISC conditions.</description></item><item><title>Variable Voltage Level Based EPS Control for Three-Port DAB Converter to Achieve Current Stress Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11296863</link><description>This article proposes a variable voltage level base extended phase shift (V2L-EPS) control for three-port dual active bridge (DAB) converter to achieve current stress optimization. By modifying the flying capacitor voltage balance control, the inner phase shift angle of DAB converter is released and can be used to realize extended phase shift (EPS) control. Furthermore, a variable voltage level can be constructed on the midpoint voltage of the primary side bridge arm by actively creating the unbalance of the flying capacitor voltage, so that the voltage excitation on the series inductor in the DAB converter varies within the inner phase shift interval thereby realizing a reconfiguration of the series inductor current, which reduces the high circulating power of the EPS control under light load conditions. In addition, by calculating the optimized trajectory of the V2L-EPS control, the current stress of the three port DAB converter is substantially reduced while ensuring all switches of the three port DAB converter operate under soft switching conditions over the full load range. Finally, a 500 W rated prototype is built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed V2L-EPS control.</description></item><item><title>A Tight Grid-Forming Control Framework for Grid-Connected Inverters Under Large Grid Frequency Drops With Wide Range of SCR and X/R</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11298511</link><description>The high penetration of renewable energy sources in future power grids presents stability challenges for grid-connected inverters, particularly during large frequency drops under a wide range of short-circuit ratio and reactance-to-resistance (X/R) conditions. To address these challenges, especially for applications requiring firm power delivery, such as utility-scale renewable plants under power purchase agreements, this article proposes a tight grid-forming (TGFM) control framework. The primary objective of TGFM is to ensure precise and robust tracking of active power references, shifting the focus from passive frequency support to active and reliable power injection during grid disturbances. The proposed framework employs a grid voltage state observer to achieve real-time, high-fidelity estimation of the grid voltage&#8217;s phase and frequency across diverse line impedance conditions. By integrating this real-time grid information into the controller, the inverter dynamically compensates for grid phase variations. This ensures a stable power angle, enabling the inverter to tightly track its power command and thereby preventing the overcurrent and oscillatory instabilities common during large frequency drops. The effectiveness of the proposed TGFM strategy is validated through comprehensive simulations and physical experiments under various grid conditions, demonstrating superior power tracking performance and stability.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Long-Horizon Model Predictive Control for Capacitor Voltage Regulation in Cascaded H-Bridge Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11298535</link><description>This article presents a multiagent, collaborative control framework for cascaded H-bridge (CHB) converters, designed to distribute the computational burden and reduce control hardware requirements. The proposal adopts a hierarchical structure consisting of two long-horizon model predictive control (MPC) strategies. At the upper level, an MPC-based intercluster balancing controller computes an optimal common-mode voltage reference, enforcing explicit constraints to ensure feasible and effective energy balancing among clusters. At the lower level, local cluster balancing is achieved through a distributed MPC strategy based on consensus theory. In this architecture, each local controller solves its own constrained optimization problem using only neighbor-to-neighbor communication, enabling modularity, robustness to communication delays, and real-time implementation. The effectiveness of this solution was experimentally validated using a CHB converter composed of 12 submodules, and its performance was assessed against state-of-the-art strategies under various conditions, including communication delays, channel failures, and sudden changes in control references.</description></item><item><title>VVI-GFM: A Voltage Vector-Informed Grid-Forming Control for Postdisturbance Fast Synchronization Recovery</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11298529</link><description>Maintaining synchronization stability after large grid disturbances is a vital requirement for grid-forming (GFM) converters. Existing enhanced GFM control strategies are often designed for a specific disturbance scenario, requiring extended recovery times or exhibiting frequency fluctuations. This article reveals that synchronization instability triggered by two typical grid disturbance events, phase jumps and voltage sags, can be unified according to underlying similarities during the postdisturbance recovery. Based on these insights, this article proposes a novel voltage vector-informed grid-forming (VVI-GFM) control strategy by fully leveraging the $d$/$q$ components of the point of common coupling (PCC) voltage vector, which can offer fast synchronization recovery and minimize frequency deviations under both phase jumps and voltage sags. The postdisturbance dynamics of the $d$/$q$ components of the PCC voltage vector are quantitatively characterized, thus mechanistically demonstrating the effectiveness and applicability of the VVI-GFM control. Moreover, detailed guidelines about the feedforward path design and critical control parameter calculation are provided to ensure normal operation across varying grid strengths. Simulations and experimental results under diverse grid disturbance scenarios further validate the advantages and robustness of the proposed control strategy.</description></item><item><title>A High-Efficiency TPCM/DCM Mixed Conduction Mode for Five-Level Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11300964</link><description>Discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) leverages its ZCS characteristics to significantly improve inverter efficiency. However, its inherent drawback of higher peak-to-average ratio (PAR) in inverter-side inductor current leads to increased current stress and device losses, thereby limiting practical applications. To address this issue, this article takes the T-type hybrid bridge five-level topology as an example and proposes a fixed-frequency mixed conduction mode modulation strategy for five-level inverters. By introducing a half-level implementation to achieve trapezoidal conduction mode, the inductor current is divided into three stages within one switching period, effectively reducing PAR and minimizing losses. When the instantaneous power is insufficient to maintain trapezoidal conduction mode, the inverter operates in five-level DCM, where the introduced half-level not only reduces PAR, but also improves duty cycle utilization in DCM. This article systematically analyzes the operational characteristics of the inverter under the proposed hybrid conduction mode modulation strategy. Mathematical derivations are provided for switch duty cycle calculations in each operating mode, along with a unified decision logic for mode selection based on real-time circuit conditions, enabling seamless mode transitions. Furthermore, an inductance selection methodology is developed to minimize both losses and current stress in the inverter-side inductor. A 500 W experimental prototype was constructed to validate the theoretical analysis, and the efficiency was significantly improve.</description></item><item><title>ANN-Assisted Switching Loss Prediction for SiC MOSFET Power Module</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11291161</link><description>Accurate and rapid determination of switching loss is crucial for energy consumption assessment and system cooling design of silicon carbide (SiC) metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (mosfet) power modules. However, traditional switching loss prediction methods struggle to balance low modeling complexity with high prediction accuracy. This article proposes an effective switching loss prediction method for SiC mosfet power modules based on multilayer backpropagation artificial neural network (ANN). The proposed method accurately models the regression relationship between the static parameters and switching loss of SiC mosfets, allowing for the direct prediction of switching loss using static parameters obtained from tests or datasheets. By leveraging static parameters that inherently encode structural and parasitic effects, the model adapts to both intra-batch and inter-batch manufacturing fluctuations without explicit physical parameter tuning. Experimental results conducted on real test-acquired datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve a minimum mean absolute percentage error and root mean squared error of 1.13% and 7.26&#215;10-4, a maximum coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.881, with a maximum error of no more than 7.43% and average prediction time of 4.95 ms per module.</description></item><item><title>Low-Commutation-Loop Inductance Design for 3.3 kV/500 kVA SiC-Based Four-Level Hybrid Clamp Converter With Extra-High Power Density</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11275947</link><description>This article presents the design and demonstration of a medium-voltage, half-megawatt, four-level hybrid clamped converter (4L-HCC), which is suitable for high-power motor drives and grid connection. Compared to two-level and three-level converters, the current commutation loop (CCL) of the 4L-HCC is more complex, resulting in very high voltage overshoot among switches and limiting its high-power-density design. This article first clarifies the CCL performance for HCCs and identifies the most challenging loop. A two-stage decoupling CCL design is proposed, using decoupling capacitors to reduce the large stray inductance. Then, the low-stray inductance hardware design of the full-scale prototype is elaborated, including power module layout, capacitor selection and design, busbar design, and system integration. Finally, a 3.3 kV/500 kVA SiC-based 4L-HCC prototype is developed and tested to validate its effectiveness. Results demonstrate that the longest CCL stray inductance with the proposed design is 110 nH, and the added decoupling capacitor can further reduce the stray inductance of the CCL to 70 nH. The maximum voltage overshoot is reduced by over 30%. Furthermore, the prototype operates stably at a power rating of 3.3 kV/200 A. It achieves an extra-high power density over 1.6 MVA/m3 and a wide output frequency range of 0&#8211;1000 Hz.</description></item><item><title>Characterization and Minimization of Commutation Loop Inductance in Reconfigurable Battery Systems Using Magnetically Coupled Auxiliary Loops</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11278615</link><description>This study presents a novel analysis of the commutation loop inductance in reconfigurable battery systems based on a half-bridge topology.

Furthermore, to ensure monitoring reliability and effectiveness, practical implementation solutions are provided to address challenges arising from varying operating conditions and unbalanced capacitor degradation within the bank. Compared with existing methods, the proposed scheme offers superior practical deployability and operational robustness. Experimental validation through component-level accelerated aging tests and converter-level discharge tests demonstrates capacitance percentage evaluation error within 0.6%, and reliable detection of critical degradation in individual capacitors within the dc-link capacitor bank under varying operating conditions, enabling proactive maintenance before failure occurs.</description></item><item><title>Partial Power-Hardware-in-the-Loop Test for In-Situ Dynamic and Steady-State Validation of a Single Submodule in a Megawatt-Scale MMC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11297165</link><description>Modular multilevel converter (MMC) has been highlighted as a scalable power converter for high-power applications. As a unit power block, submodule (SM) is a key component to achieve the scalability and reliability of the MMC. Therefore, it is important to test an SM under various operating conditions during the development stage before the final full assembly. To reduce the development cost and time, various methods have been presented to test a single SM without a full MMC assembly. Recently, owing to the advancement of processing power, real-time simulators are beginning to be incorporated to test an MMC controller as a controller-hardware-in-the-loop-simulation. This article proposes the realization of a versatile powering test scheme for a single SM combining a real-time simulator, referred to as partial power-hardware-in-the-loop (partial PHIL) test. For demonstration, an industrial SM for a 5 MW MMC-based motor drive system is tested using the partial PHIL test with full-scale voltage and current levels. Various operating conditions are considered, including initial boosting operation, magnetization of the induction motor at standstill, full-load operation, and a step change in speed reference.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient LCL-T-Based Compact Resonant Converter for On-Board Charger</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11297840</link><description>Numerous efforts are underway to minimize the dimensions of electric vehicle on-board chargers. This can be attained by enhancing the power density without sacrificing the converter efficiency. Magnetic integration is one of the widely used techniques to achieve a higher power density. For on-board chargers, LLC-based resonant converters are a common option where optimization of switching frequency, power density, and efficiency has been accomplished in a number of studies. Efficiency and power density are still required to satisfy the demands of electric car charging, notwithstanding the trade-off between soft-switching over the load range. LCL-T-based resonant converters offers a promising solution to this problem, which are yet to be explored with magnetic integration. This article proposes a LCL-T-based resonant converter with magnetic integration to achieve higher power density. Above all, this magnetic integration has been achieved using simple switching scheme with fixed frequency operation. The converter maintains zero voltage switching in all the switches and zero current switching in both the diodes over the entire load range. The proposed magnetic integration has been validated by finite element analysis (FEA) in Ansys maxwell simulation software. A 2 KW prototype with 400 V input and 200&#8211;400 V output has been tested in the lab. The converter achieves highest efficiency of 98.15% and integrated transformer maintains a power density of 25.57 W/cm$^{3}$.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Inertia Droop Control for Multiconverter DC Microgrids: Impedance Modeling, Parameter Design, and Synchronization Methodology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11272081</link><description>In dc microgrids (DCMGs), the insufficient inertia due to the fast-response nature of power electronic converters poses significant challenges to the dc bus voltage stability. Inertia droop control (IDC) offers a solution by emulating virtual inertia through droop-coefficient modification. However, it suffers from steady-state voltage drop and lacks a comprehensive investigation into the multiconverter scenarios. To this end, this article proposes an enhanced IDC strategy that systematically addresses the key challenges in applications to multiconverter DCMGs, including the steady-state and transient current sharing, dynamic stability improvement, and plug-and-play capability. First, a decentralized secondary voltage controller is introduced to eliminate steady-state voltage deviations. Then, a small-signal impedance model is developed to reveal the inertia enhancement mechanism and current-sharing behavior. Based on a reduced-order equivalent single-converter model, an intuitive parameter design method is proposed to determine appropriate IDC control gains within a parameter feasible region that ensures the improved dynamic performance. Moreover, a short-term small-ac-signal injection method is proposed to realize the synchronization of decentralized secondary controllers during converter plug-in, eliminating the circulating currents with no communication line required. The experiment results validate the proposed control framework and the impedance-based analysis.</description></item><item><title>Constraint-Aware Grid-Forming Control for Current Limiting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11271807</link><description>This work develops a constraint-aware grid-forming (GFM) control that explicitly accounts for current limits and modulation limits within the GFM oscillator dynamics generating the GFM voltage reference (i.e., phase angle and magnitude). Broadly speaking, the voltage reference generated by the constraint-aware GFM control minimizes the deviation from conventional unconstrained GFM droop control, while respecting current and modulation limits. The resulting GFM control achieves fast current limiting while preserving transient stability, e.g., exhibiting infinite critical clearing time. To develop the control, we first characterize and analyze the set of converter voltages that do not result in constraint violations. Next, an efficient algorithm for projecting voltages onto the feasible set is developed. Subsequently, these results are used to restrict the dynamics of GFM droop control to the set of feasible voltages. Finally, detailed simulation studies and hardware experiments are used to illustrate and validate the response to short-circuit faults and phase jumps.</description></item><item><title>A Split Phase Transformerless Hybrid Converter STATCOM and its Capacitor Voltage Balancing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11275843</link><description>The parallel hybrid converter-based static compensator (PHC-STATCOM) requires transformers and director switches (DSs) capable of enduring high voltage stress. Every DS is assembled with a series connection of IGBTs, which reduces reliability and increases the issue of unequal voltage distribution. This article proposes a new STATCOM, the &#8220;split phase transformer-less hybrid converter&#8221; (STL-HC), which reduces the voltage stress and number of IGBTs connected in series in each DS by 50% compared to PHC. The capacitor voltages of STL-HC tend to divert from the reference value during unbalanced network conditions. Hence, a zero-sequence voltage (ZSV) injection technique is also proposed to regulate the capacitor voltages of STL-HC. The comparative analysis of the proposed topology demonstrates that it requires lesser switch and capacitor count than popular multilevel topologies. Experimental results demonstrate the working principle of the STL-HC and the developed capacitor voltage control technique under various grid/load conditions.</description></item><item><title>Topology and Control Method for Reconstructable Hybrid Distribution Transformer to Enhance the Compensation Capability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11278106</link><description>The traditional hybrid distribution transformer (HDT), comprising a three-phase main transformer and power electronic converters, is widely used to address voltage sag and reactive loads in distribution networks. However, its compensation performance is constrained by the limited capacity of the converters. In scenarios involving severe voltage sags or excessive reactive loads, the HDT may fail to provide complete compensation. To address this limitation, this article introduces a reconstructable hybrid distribution transformer (REC-HDT) with multiple operating modes, designed to enhance current and voltage compensation capabilities without significantly increasing costs. The topology and three operating modes of the REC-HDT are meticulously designed and analyzed. The compensation mechanisms for voltage and current are elucidated through a detailed examination of power flow between the converter and the transformer. Furthermore, an enhanced control strategy is proposed to support smooth mode transitions across various operating conditions. Simulation studies and experimental validation demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the REC-HDT topology and control strategy.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Switching Sequence Model Predictive Control for Modular Multilevel Converter With Low Computational Complexity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11278768</link><description>Model predictive control (MPC) has been widely adopted in modular multilevel converters (MMCs) due to its multiobjective capabilities and rapid dynamic response. However, it faces challenges such as significant computational burden, difficulty in adjusting weighting factors, and variable switching frequency. Additionally, the presence of numerous redundant switching states further complicates the application of space vector modulation in MMC. To address these issues, this article proposes an optimal switching sequence MPC (OSS-MPC) for MMC. First, a method for determining the candidate switching sequence is developed to identify specific switching states while minimizing computational complexity. Next, a predictive model based on the gradient of output current is introduced to reduce current ripple and improve tracking accuracy. Finally, circulating current suppression is achieved by integrating the predictive model of arm unbalanced voltage with the OSS. The proposed OSS-MPC exhibits excellent steady-state performance and a reduced computational burden while preserving the rapid response characteristic of MPC. Simulation and experimental results from a prototype with 24 submodules demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Simplified Cost-Effective DuC-UPQC With Multiobjective Optimization Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11298397</link><description>A simplified cost-effective dual-capacitor unified power quality conditioner (DuC-UPQC) is proposed. It could maintain sinusoidal standard load voltage and in-phase grid current, obtain reduced dc-link voltage, improve modulation indexes, achieve active power balance between inside dynamic voltage restorers and active power filters. Compared to existing methods, DuC-UPQC is cost-effective as less bipolar capacitors are required and external bidirectional dc power source could be removed.

However, under such scenarios, existing methods for grid current injection do not guarantee the absence of power pulsations on the dc-bus. To address this issue, this work proposes a power decoupling strategy for an ac-side, LCL-filtered, grid-tied dc&#8211;ac three-phase converter under unbalanced grid conditions. The strategy suppresses second harmonic power ripple on the dc-bus during grid fault conditions, regardless of the grid power injection method employed, thereby expanding the operating capabilities of the converter. The nonlinear zero-sequence model of the system is linearized using the exact feedback-linearization technique. Experimental and simulation corroborates the validity and effectiveness of the proposal.</description></item><item><title>GSSA Modeling and Excitation Optimization for Adjacent Coils in Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11271485</link><description>Dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) technology can achieve charging for devices on the move, like automated guided vehicles, which can dramatically improve their working efficiency. In this article, the generalized state-space averaging (GSSA) model of the DWPT system is established, where the state equations are derived in accordance with the equivalent circuit, and then all state variables are separated into sine and cosine items using the Fourier series. The established model reveals that the maximum efficiency points of the DWPT system are correlated with the phase differences between currents of two adjacent transmitting coils at different mutual inductance conditions. As a result, the system's efficiency can be optimized by adjusting the phase differences of transmitting currents. Finally, numerous simulations and experiments are conducted to verify the GSSA model. The results prove the high accuracy of the model, and the efficiency calculation errors are less than 0.21% and 2.38% when the phase differences are 0 and -89 degrees, respectively. The model exhibits only a one-degree error in tracking the maximum efficiency point when the receiver is located 5 cm away from the reference position. Additionally, the closed-loop experiments demonstrate that the efficiency optimization is achieved by tuning the Tx current's phase.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Temperature Prediction of the Magnetic Coupler in Wireless Charging Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11278751</link><description>As the core component of wireless charging systems, the magnetic coupler usually accounts for a significant proportion of total system power losses, resulting in substantial cumulative temperature rise. This article proposes a multipoint dynamic temperature prediction method for magnetic couplers, integrating multiphysics finite-element simulation with a deep learning algorithm to achieve real-time, accurate prediction of temperature variations under ambient temperature fluctuations, coil misalignment, and continuous charging conditions. First, an electromagnetic-thermal coupled model is constructed using the finite-element method to generate temperature datasets under various operating conditions.

Finally, a 3.3 kW experimental prototype was built to simulate continuous charging scenarios under varying coil misalignment conditions, with real-time temperature acquisition at key locations of the magnetic coupler. Experimental results show average prediction errors of 5.7%, validating the correctness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Variable-Gain Load-Independent Class-E Rectifier for High-Frequency Wireless Power Transfer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11288099</link><description>This article proposes a variable-gain load-independent (LI) class-E rectifier for high-frequency wireless power transfer (WPT) systems. Featuring a reconfigurable resonant network, the proposed rectifier dynamically adjusts its voltage gain across multiple levels, enabling the system to maintain a nearly constant output voltage under varying load and coil misalignment conditions. Comprehensive circuit analysis is conducted to derive explicit expressions for both the voltage gain and input reactance of the LI class-E rectifier. Based on this analysis, a systematic design methodology is presented to realize dynamic gain adjustment while preserving zero-voltage switching (ZVS) and constant input reactance. A 6.78-MHz WPT prototype was constructed and evaluated. The rectifier effectively adapted its gain in response to coupling variations, eliminating the need for external regulators. Moreover, the rectifier not only achieved ZVS operation itself but also maintained ZVS in the transmitter by providing constant input reactance. As a result, switching losses were significantly reduced, and the system achieved a high overall efficiency of 88.0%.</description></item><item><title>Analysis Model for Hybrid Magnetic Energy Harvesters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11296992</link><description>Current transformer magnetic energy harvesters (CTMEHs) harvest energy from the magnetic fields surrounding electrical conductors to power sensors in a battery-free manner. Detailed, nonlinear analytical power harvest models for traditional CTMEHs have been presented and validated, such that designers can quickly predict and evaluate CTMEH performance without the need for intensive finite-element simulations.

Each channel can maintain constant-voltage output characteristics, leading the output voltage independency to the load variations at its designed frequency. Due to the cross-coupling between channels, an interference suppression approach is implemented by integrating notch networks to the compensation networks. A mathematical model is developed and the impact of cross-coupling between channels is systematically analyzed and incorporated as a key factor for the tuning of the multichannel WPT system. The notch network and its corresponding supplementary impedances are introduced in each receiving channel to establish low-impedance transmission paths at the designed frequencies, effectively mitigating cross-interference. The conditions for constant-voltage output are rigorously deduced. Experimental results demonstrate that under the condition of an input voltage of 80 V and a load variation range of 10&#8211;40 $\Omega$, the output voltages of Channels 1 and 2 remain stable at 19.2 V with a fluctuation less than 6.2%. The multichannel rotary steering system's efficiency can reach 83.92%. Compact design making it particularly suitable for power transfer in multichannel rotary steering systems and space-constrained scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Modeling, Analysis, and Optimization of Omega-Shaped Magnetic Field Energy Harvester for Self-Powered Three-Core Cable Sensors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11298403</link><description>In nonuniform magnetic field environments around three-core power cables, conventional magnetic field energy harvesters (MFEHs) typically suffer from low power density due to the mutual cancellation of three-phase magnetic fluxes. To address this limitation, this article proposes an OS-MFEH based on the amplitude and phase characteristics of the surrounding magnetic flux density. The proposed structure enhances the induced voltage and mitigates output degradation caused by flux cancellation, while also reducing demagnetization effects. A mathematical model of the harvester&#8217;s output power is developed, incorporating the influence of the magnetic field generated by the harvester coil. Guided by this model, the core dimensions and material properties are systematically optimized to achieve improved performance. The resulting design not only achieves improved power density but also prevents magnetic core saturation&#8212;an issue commonly overlooked when coil-induced magnetic fields are neglected. The experiment verified the effectiveness of proposed omega-shaped MFEH structure and the optimization method. The experimental prototype volume is 45.8 cm3 and can achieve an output power of 12.86 mW to 84.2 mW within 100 ARMS to 250 ARMS. Within a three-phase current imbalance of 10%, OS-MFEH can still supply power to the load.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Frequency Tracking Strategy for Underwater Wireless Power Transfer Systems With Constant-Voltage Output Under Load Variations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11298406</link><description>This article presents an optimal frequency tracking strategy with constant-voltage (CV) output capability for series&#8211;series (SS) compensated underwater wireless power transfer (UWPT) systems under varying load conditions. Initially, a simplified equivalent circuit of the SS-topology UWPT system is derived through circuit analysis, establishing the compensation capacitance criteria necessary to achieve CV output, and characterizing the phase and amplitude properties of the system&#8217;s currents. The loss mechanisms within the system are then analyzed, and on this basis, a control strategy is proposed to improve the efficiency by dynamically adjusting the operating frequency to accommodate load variations. To maintain CV output during variable frequency control, fixed compensation capacitors on both the transmitter and Rx sides are replaced with switched-controlled capacitors, whose capacitance values are dynamically adjusted to satisfy the CV output requirements. Experimental validation on a 1.9-kW prototype demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, achieving both optimal frequency tracking and stable CV output across a load range of 10&#8211;50 $\Omega$.

First, the operating principles of APQC-ESS for regenerative braking energy (RBE) utilization, reactive power compensation, and negative sequence current (NSC) suppression are analyzed. Then, a multiobjective decoupled control strategy based on sequence component decomposition is developed to achieve independent control of above multiobjectives. On this basis, a collaborative energy management strategy is investigated to enable real-time multiobjective cooperative control for APQC-ESS under fluctuating traction loads. Specifically, the collaborative energy management categorizes RPS operating conditions into two types based on the NSC severity. Subsequently, a three-stage optimization strategy is employed to allocate APQC-ESS capacity to meet various compensation targets, while comprehensively considering capacity limitations and unbalanced power flow within the CHB branches. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed APQC-ESS and its control strategy is validated through experimental results and a filed data case study.

To adapt to sudden changes in pulse frequency, higher requirements are imposed on the dynamic performance of the converter. The conventional proportional-integral (PI) control cannot simultaneously ensure both excellent dynamic and steady-state performance. The capacitor energy balance control method can achieve high dynamic performance. However, it requires additional output compensation for the converter&#8217;s active current, and its implementation complexity hinders widespread adoption. This article develops an optimized dynamic PI control strategy for three-port rectifiers to address low-frequency pulse load challenges, leveraging capacitor charge balance control (CBC) for enhanced performance. By analyzing the optimal transient trajectories of voltage and current during pulse frequency step changes, the corresponding dynamic controller parameters are prestored based on actual operating conditions. When the pulse frequency changes, rapid active current adjustment within a single pulse cycle is achieved by modifying the outer-loop parameters. This approach maintains the decoupling voltage recovery curve near its optimal trajectory without requiring additional compensation. A three-port rectifier prototype was developed, and experimental results validate both the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed control method.</description></item><item><title>Magnetic Gear-Based Ferrite PM Vernier Generator for a Direct-Drive Wind Turbine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11220162</link><description>Nowadays, direct-drive wind generators are becoming popular due to the absence of mechanical gearboxes, noiseless operation, high reliability and less maintenance. Usually, permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSGs) are used for direct-drive wind energy conversion systems due to their high efficiency and voltage regulation. However, the speed of wind turbine blades is generally low, and hence a gear-box is required for grid-connected operation of the generator. Therefore, magnetic geared machines such as flux reversal generators (FRGs) and permanent magnet vernier generators (PMVGs), which have an inherent magnetic gearing effect, low-speed high-torque capability and high torque-to-weight ratio are becoming popular for direct-drive wind generators. In this article, an outer rotor surface-mounted PMVG with ferrite magnets is proposed. A 2-D finite element (FE) analysis is carried-out and the results are presented. In addition, a prototype is fabricated to measure the effectiveness of the proposed generator. Further, experimental validation is carried-out and performance parameters are measured and compared with 2-D FE analysis.</description></item><item><title>Design of Variable Pole Phase Induction Motor Drive With Hybrid Four Quadrant Switch Configuration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11218267</link><description>In electric traction applications, researchers are employing pole phase modulation (PPM) based multiphase induction machines (MIM) to achieve a broader range of speed and torque, allowing for dynamic switching between the various pole phase configurations. The existing literature studies have concentrated more on various inverter topologies for variable pole phase-based induction machines (VPIM). Here, the torque ripple and dc bus voltage utilization (DBVU) issues are tackled with multiple four-quadrant switches along with 3-&#981; SVPWM technology. However, the design of the VPIM drive system w.r.t the converter and machine is crucial, which is not explored in previous studies. This article aims to bridge this gap by describing design considerations of the inverter configuration as well as the motor for VPIM drives. A simple 2-level 9-&#981; inverter with a hybrid four-quadrant switch (HFQS) is proposed for VPIM with phase grouping and isolated neutral techniques. This HFQS is realized with one controllable switch and six power diodes with snubber protection to limit the voltage surges during the transitions from one pole to another pole combination. The design considerations of the dc bus, switch selection for the 9-&#981; inverter, and design of a proposed HFQS are presented in detail. It further presents complete switching loss analysis, conduction loss analysis, and overall inverter as well as motor efficiency. The 3-&#981; carrier-based SVPWM ensures better DBVU, and phase-shifted carriers give the enhanced torque ripple in the high pole mode of a 9-&#981; VPIM drive. The proposed inverter design for a 9-&#981; VPIM has been implemented and validated with Maxwell 2-D, along with Simplorer, and the laboratory prototype of a 5 hp motor.</description></item><item><title>Air-Cooled Coils for Induction Sealing of Large Cylindrical Containers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11217347</link><description>In induction cap sealing, power is transferred to thin Al foil(s) traveling beneath an energized coil-head to create a hermetically sealed bond between the foil and the rim of a plastic/glass container. The distribution of transferred power on foil plays crucial roles for quality of sealing, sealing range, productivity, and energy efficiency. It is particularly difficult to seal moving containers using foils with a large diameter. Achieving desired heat distribution by thermal conduction on a thin foil is difficult. The problem gets aggravated when several large containers reside beneath the coil-head. The effective load resistance could go beyond its limiting value, resulting reduction in coil current. Corresponding reduction in power density in foil could result undersealing. To resolve the problems of sealing continuously fed large-mouth containers (foil diameter &#8805; body diameter), this article proposes a novel coil-head to take care of energy distribution electromagnetically. It achieves sealing of large containers without any feeding constraints and inherently avoids overload condition. The coil enhances the efficiency of energy utilization and productivity. The coil-head is experimentally validated by sealing containers using foils with a diameter range 35&#8211;140 mm. Its superior field distribution is also verified. Even after transferring less power, the foil area sealed/second is drastically increased.</description></item><item><title>Multimicrogrid P2P Energy Trading Benefiting Both Microgrids and the Main Grid Based on a Bi-Level Game</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11215689</link><description>This article proposes a multimicrogrid peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading framework that benefits both microgrids and the main grid.

The existing dc fault models of CSC either focus on 3-level CSC topology or neglect the transient process and commutation of the converter after fault, not suitable for accurate dc fault analysis of CSC-HVDC. Moreover, the elimination of ac-filters at the point of common coupling (PCC) will lead to severe PCC voltage distortion of weak-grid connected CSC-HVDC after fault. The interaction between the valve-groups caused by the voltage distortion and its influence on the fault characteristics is yet to be studied. In this article, two dc fault analysis models for CSC-HVDC connected to ac grid with different strengths are proposed. Based on quasi-steady state assumptions and substitution theorem, a simplified model by decoupling the valve-groups at the PCC and its adaptability under different grid strengths are proposed for analytical studies of dc fault. For weak-grid connected CSC-HVDC, a fault analysis model is further derived based on the quantitative analysis of the interaction between valve-groups. The proposed models are validated through PSCAD simulations and HIL experiments.</description></item><item><title>Study on an Improved Current Ripple Suppression Algorithm for IPOS SAB DC&#8211;DC Converter System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11220830</link><description>The input-parallel output-series (IPOS) single active bridge (SAB) dc&#8211;dc converter system often suffers from current ripple issues caused by enormous branch power differences due to the location of windward surface and wind turbines in the cascaded dc wind farm. Therefore, this article focuses on a dc current ripple suppression algorithm for the IPOS SAB system, and three improvements are as follows. First, the effect of branch power difference on dc current ripple is analyzed, current ripple model is derived by the Fourier decomposition of inductor current within a switching period, and its 2nd ripple component at switching frequency is the main current ripple analytically. Second, system operational regions are divided into Zone I and Zone II according to branch power ratios, and a current ripple suppression algorithm that consists of triangular synthesis phasor method and inverted phasor method is proposed by regulating branch carrier phase-shift angles in the two zones. Third, the proposed current ripple suppression algorithm is verified by simulations and experiments.</description></item><item><title>Fault-Tolerant Model Predictive Control for Three-Level T-Type Converters Based on Fault-Induced State Equation Modeling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11214711</link><description>Three-level T-type converters (3LT${}^{\mathbf{2}}$Cs) provide inherent redundancies that can be used to improve system-level reliability, where fault-tolerant control (FTC) techniques are the enabling algorithms. Existing FTC methods primarily focus on compensating redundant vectors and adjusting dwell times, while neglecting the impact on modeling and control of grid-side currents and neutral-point (NP) voltage under fault conditions. This work formulates a unified fault-induced state space model that facilitates the construction of cost functions in finite-control-set model predictive control (FCS-MPC). The modeling is based on the investigation of the possible cases of single-switch and double-switch open-circuit faults, and the analysis of additional terms introduced by the faults. The proposed FTC method adopts a dual-loop control structure, i.e., the outer loop uses a proportional integral (PI) controller to automatically increase the reference value of the dc bus voltage during vertical faults and converts it into the grid current reference, while the inner loop combines fault-induced grid-side current and NP voltage cost functions in FCS-MPC, adjusting weighting factors based on fault conditions to prioritize grid-side current quality. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed FTC under various open-circuit fault scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Discontinuous Modulation-Based Active Thermal Control for Enhancing the KVA Limit of Grid-Connected Inverter-Based Resources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11217174</link><description>The kVA limit of a power electronic converter (PEC) is often limited to keep the junction temperature ($T_{j}$) within a safe operating area (SOA). Hence, controlling $T_{j}$ with advanced algorithms such as active thermal control (ATC) methods seems to be a promising way to increase the kVA limit of PEC. In this regard, this article presents a novel closed-loop control approach, combining the discontinuous pulse width modulation (DPWM) strategy with a system-level current controller. The proposed method enables grid-connected inverter-based resources (IBR) to increase their kVA limit without violating the $T_{j}$ limit. This method further allows the converters to operate at a higher ambient temperature ($T_{\rm amb}$) without sacrificing their power handling capacity. An analytical relationship between the bus clamp angle ($\alpha$) with respect to the switching loss ($P_{\rm sw}$) for DPWM has been explained, which is then used as a control variable for the ATC. For the thermal model, a simple Foster thermal model-based temperature estimation method is described, and its accuracy has been depicted.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Control for Multibus Voltage Regulation and Adaptive Reactive Power Sharing in Islanded Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11217313</link><description>In multibus islanded microgrids (IMGs), maintaining all bus voltages within limits while ensuring proper reactive power sharing (RPS) among distributed generators (DGs) presents a significant challenge. To address this challenge, this article presents a distributed control strategy for achieving multibus voltage regulation and adaptive RPS in IMGs. First, we propose a dynamic max/min-consensus algorithm to monitor the real-time voltage range across all buses in a distributed manner. Next, we design a distributed observer to calculate the ideal reactive power reference for each DG. Finally, based on the monitoring of the voltage range, the designed controller ensures that all bus voltages remain within acceptable limits while adjusting each DG&#8217;s output reactive power as close as possible to the reference values. To validate the proposed strategy, we set up IMG systems of different scales using both the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimental platform and the MATLAB/Simulink simulation environment for comprehensive testing. The results show that the proposed strategy effectively regulates all bus voltages within the target range while achieving adaptive RPS, whereas existing methods cause some bus voltages to violate limits.</description></item><item><title>Reinforcement Learning Based Active Model Variation Deadbeat Control for Energy Storage System in DC Microgrids With Constant Power Loads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11216350</link><description>The issues of constant power load (CPL) and model mismatch lead to significant current ripples and voltage fluctuations in dc microgrids, presenting a substantial challenge for the control methods of energy storage systems. To address these issues, this article proposes a reinforcement learning based active model variation deadbeat control (RL-AMVDB), which adjusts a few control model parameters in the current control loop. The model variation factors and the states of closed-loop system are formulated as a Markov decision process, allowing the model variation factors to be optimized through RL. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through both simulation and hardware experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces current ripple by 16.6% under model mismatch conditions. Additionally, under sudden CPL changes, the settling time, voltage fluctuations, and current ripple are reduced by 38.4%, 10.2%, and 12.5%&#8211;20%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Simple and Efficient Direct Predictive Control Framework for Multiparallel Power Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11218625</link><description>Parallel connection of power converters is a widely adopted approach to increase power capacity and enhance fault tolerance. This article presents a simple and efficient direct predictive control framework for multiparallel two-level and three-level neutral-point-clamped converters. By using the number of available switching states as control variables, rather than the switching states themselves, the candidate set is reduced to no more than four, significantly lowering the computational burden and enhancing scalability. Additionally, a novel current sorting method is introduced to suppress circulating currents independently, allowing more flexibility for output current and voltage balancing optimization.

Conventionally, these microinverters incorporate a stable dc bus that relies on bulky and unreliable electrolytic capacitors. To improve, we propose an adaptive virtual bus strategy for DAB microinverter, which removes the electrolytic capacitors. The microinverter features a quasi-single-stage design interconnected by a virtual bus, which exhibits a notable double-line-frequency voltage ripple. The front-end employs a boost converter to elevate the low PV voltage and regulate the voltage of the virtual bus. The back-end utilizes a dual-active-bridge (DAB) inverter to transform the oscillating virtual bus voltage into the desired ac output. This architecture facilitates active power decoupling (APD) for enhanced power density by buffering mismatched power on the minimized bus capacitors and dynamically adjusting the operational state of the DAB inverter. Furthermore, by decoupling the control algorithms of the two parts, we reduce the number of required voltage and current sensors, thereby simplifying the overall control system. To validate the concept, a GaN-based prototype rated at 200 W and 600 kHz maximum is designed and tested. This prototype achieved a peak efficiency of 92.67%.</description></item><item><title>Energy-Aware Adaptive Force-Admittance Control for Robotic Manipulators: Application in High-Precision Aircraft Assembly</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11217341</link><description>An energy-aware adaptive force-admittance control strategy is proposed, which integrates accurate force regulation through a direct force controller with compliant motion enabled by adaptive admittance control. This combined mechanism addresses environmental uncertainties while simultaneously regulating wrench and position. However, the admittance adaptation and direct force controller introduce nonpassive behaviors, undermining the system&#8217;s passivity. To resolve this issue, a virtual energy tank is introduced to monitor the energy associated with nonpassive actions, ensuring energy boundedness and restoring system passivity for stable interaction with passive environments. To further enhance safety and performance, the proposed scheme incorporates online energy injection and freezing mechanisms. When the tank&#8217;s energy level falls below a preset threshold, additional energy is injected to improve control performance. Conversely, when the exerted wrench exceeds specified limits, the control system reverts to a constant admittance model to maintain compliance, effectively freezing any additional energy extraction. Two activation functions are also developed to ensure precise positioning in the direction of position control. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through real industrial robot applications in aircraft assembly tasks. Experimental results demonstrate its superiority in improving both task performance and operational safety.</description></item><item><title>Minimum-Spacing Optimized Winding Switching Control for Winding-Segmented PMLSM With Multiple Movers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11220838</link><description>The winding-segmented permanent magnet linear synchronous motor (WS-PMLSM) system adopts a modular mover-stator topology, offering advantages such as high load capacity and high-precision positioning. Traditional strategy typically employs a synchronous current drive method for dual-stator units, which mandates the minimum spacing of multiple movers exceeding the length of two stator units. To minimize the spacing constraints between the movers, this article proposes an optimized stator winding switching control strategy based on single/dual-stator winding drive modes. First, an analytical electromagnetic thrust model of WS-PMLSM is established based on the magnetic energy principle. Second, for the single-stator winding drive mode, a current feedforward control strategy is proposed to compensate for the electromagnetic force disturbance between adjacent segments. Furthermore, based on the coupling length between the mover and stator windings, an optimized winding switching strategy with linear transition switching method is proposed to reduce the thrust ripple. Finally, a WS-PMLSM experimental platform is built to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.</description></item><item><title>Model-Free Energy Flow Regulation Passivity-Based Control for Robotic Rotary Joints With Data-Driven Surrogate Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11215801</link><description>Passivity-based control (PBC) is a powerful control strategy, excelling in stability through its energy-based framework. It is regarded as an effective method for enhancing the dependability of robotic rotary joints (RRJs). However, as a fundamentally model-based control method, PBC&#8217;s effectiveness heavily relies on accurate system modeling and parameter estimation. Consequently, its control performance is significantly degraded in RRJs, which exhibit complex nonlinear dynamics complicate parameter identification and frequently lead to parameter mismatches between theoretical models and physical systems. To address this limitation, this article presents a novel energy flow regulation-PBC (EFR-PBC) methodology. Leveraging the system&#8217;s polynomial characteristics, EFR-PBC incorporates a data-driven recursive polynomial response surface (RPRS) surrogate model to predict energy flow tensor (EFT) variations from input-output measurements, facilitating adaptive control law synthesis. By reducing dependence on precise mathematical models and system parameters, EFR-PBC maintains robust performance under uncertain conditions. Extensive comparative studies through both numerical simulations and experimental validations against conventional interconnection and damping assignment (IDA)-PBC and PID-PBC implementations demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Variable Symmetry Constraints-Based Stability Analysis of Large Delayed Cyber-Physical Power System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11216358</link><description>Linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based delay-dependent stability analysis methods have been effectively utilized in the delayed cyber-physical power system (DCPPS). However, the significant computational burden associated with solving large-scale LMIs presents a substantial challenge when these methods are applied to real-world power systems. This article investigates an efficient evaluation method for the delay-dependent stability of the large DCPPS by presenting a variable symmetry constraints-based approach. First, by exploring the highly symmetric characteristics of control loops and renewable energy sources (RES), this article gives new structure restrictions for the weighting matrices required in the LMI-based stability criterion to reduce the number of decision variables (NDVs). In contrast, the existing methods focus only on the symmetric characteristics of traditional generators and are not applicable to large DCPPS integrated with the RES. Then, by introducing an adjustable parameter into the proposed structure restrictions, the approach based on variable symmetry constraints is established to bridge the gap where the existing constant methods fail to address the variable stability conditions. Moreover, the proposed variable symmetry constraints-based approach is more relaxed than the existing method since it keeps the NDVs in the LMIs unchanged despite massive generators equipped in the same control area of the DCPPS. Case studies are based on the large DCPPS with illustration of the load frequency control (LFC) schemes and the 39-Bus New England System to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. The proposed method is verified to be available to analyze the delay-dependent stability of the large-scale DCPPS efficiently while guaranteeing the computation accuracy.</description></item><item><title>High-Precision Nonlinear Spatial Gradient Disturbance Suppression Method for Magnetic Shielding Cylinder</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11220881</link><description>High-power devices used in hospitals generate harmonic magnetic field disturbances inside magnetic shielding cylinders (MSCs). These disturbances exhibit axial-gradient spatial distributions, which substantially degrade the imaging quality of magnetocardiography (MCG). To address this issue, a high-precision nonlinear spatial gradient disturbance suppression method is proposed for single-open MSCs. First, a nonlinear gradient coil design is developed to generate variable magnetic field gradients, precisely matching the nonlinear gradient distribution induced by external magnetic disturbances in the MSC. Subsequently, the entire system is modeled, and a composite controller based on proportional-integral repetitive control-linear extended state observer (PIRC-LESO) is designed to enhance the suppression of magnetic field disturbances with harmonic characteristics. Finally, an active magnetic field disturbance suppression system was implemented to evaluate the effectiveness of the nonlinear spatial gradient disturbance suppression method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the peak-to-peak magnetic field disturbance from 42.0 to 6.9 pT and significantly enhances the signal-to-noise ratio of the MCG signals.</description></item><item><title>Revisit Windup Phenomenon in Grid-Forming Inverters With Priority Current Limiter: A Physical Perspective</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11220825</link><description>This article investigates the windup phenomenon of grid-forming (GFM) inverters with priority current limiters (PCL). It is found that a crucial transitional stage exists in both the PCL triggering and exit processes, which significantly impacts the windup issue. By analyzing the phasor diagrams and power-angle curves of the GFM inverter, it is revealed that the fault clearance angle and switching angle between the transitional stage and stable stage in current-limiting mode jointly determine the existence of windup after fault clearance. A criterion is developed based on these findings. Further, four distinct scenarios are examined in light of this criterion and transitional stage. A practical antiwindup control method based on the criterion is proposed. Finally, the theoretical findings are demonstrated through experiments.</description></item><item><title>DC Link Capacitance Minimizing Set of Type-II Voltage Controller Coefficients for PFC Rectifiers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11217337</link><description>The brief presents a method for deriving a type-II voltage controller coefficients set allowing to minimize the dc link capacitance in single-phase active power factor correction rectifiers (PFCR) operating without hold-up time requirements.

However, due to the fact that the load transient response of HHB circuit depends on the IGBT branch with lower switching frequency, the system load transient response is poor. To overcome this issue, an active ripple suppression technique based on digital dead-beat average current (DBAC) control and load current feed-forward for both IGBT branch and GaN branch in the HHB circuit is proposed in this letter. The operating principle and control law of proposed control for the HHB circuit in FPP mode are analyzed in detail. The load transient performance of the HHB circuit is further investigated. Finally, experimental results of the active ripple suppression technique for the IGBT and GaN HHB circuit are provided to verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis.</description></item><item><title>Interpretable Wind Power Forecasting With Feature and Loss Function Construction Guided by Domain Knowledge</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11122909</link><description>Current wind power forecasting (WPF) methods predominantly rely on data-driven deep learning models, inherently lacking integration of domain knowledge, which limits forecasting accuracy and model interpretability. To address this issue, an interpretable data-knowledge fusion ultra-short-term WPF model is proposed, in which domain knowledge guides the feature construction process and is directly embedded into the design of the loss function. In the feature construction module, a wind speed-power curve is established to generate theoretical power outputs by using historical wind speed as inputs. These theoretical outputs, combined with historical measured data, serve as inputs for the model. In the loss function construction module, a boundary constraint loss is designed by extracting the upper and lower boundaries of wind power output using the alpha shape algorithm and Local Weighted Linear Regression based on wind speed and power data. Notably, the parameters of boundaries are dynamically updated to capture the volatility of wind power. Additionally, an error distribution shape loss is introduced to penalize the deviation of the training error distribution from the normal distribution, using Jensen-Shannon divergence as an indicator. Case studies across 30 wind farms demonstrate that the proposed method guided by interpretable knowledge achieves the best average performance across all time horizons compared to baseline models. The method also shows strong robustness in noise and missing data experiments.</description></item><item><title>Novel Unified Control Framework for Networked RES-BES Microgrids With Enhanced Performance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11120450</link><description>The increasing deployment of renewable energy sources (RESs) facilitates the interconnection of distributed energy networks, thereby maximizing the utilization of the unevenly distributed RESs. Networked hybrid ac/dc microgrids enable regional multi-terminal networks at end-user sites, offering plug-and-play integration for RESs and battery energy storage systems (BESs) through synergistic ac/dc complementarity. However, this interconnected configuration introduces increased complexity in control strategies and poses significant power management challenges for RES-BES microgrids, as sudden RES fluctuations demand system-wide BES compensation to prevent local overloads. This paper proposes a unified droop control-based framework for networked hybrid microgrids comprising RESs, BESs and loads. The proposed approach enables seamless transitions between operational modes, proportional power sharing, and enhanced operation without circulating currents or overstressing components. Furthermore, it inherently addresses abrupt source failures and asymmetric line faults without requiring adjustments in the primary control methods, ensuring uninterrupted maximum power harvest of RESs. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through case studies using real-time simulation platform Typhoon-HIL.</description></item><item><title>Time-Varying Inertia Characterization of DFIG-Based Wind Turbines for Power System Frequency Dynamic Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11113495</link><description>Accurately assessing the inertial response of renewable energy generation (REG) is critical for frequency stability. However, REG represented by doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbine (WT) exhibits inherent time-varying inertia behavior, fundamentally distinct from synchronous generators (SGs). Prevailing inertia assessment methods predominantly rely on SG-derived time-domain inertia constants, which cannot capture this intrinsic variability. Consequently, the rationality of directly applying these conventional methods to DFIG-based WT lacks theoretical justification. To address this gap, this paper derives an expression for calculating time-varying inertia using the angular momentum theorem. Results demonstrate that inertia in the time domain dynamically varies with disturbances, highlighting the significant limitations of conventional inertia descriptions. Alternatively, a frequency-domain inertia characterization method is investigated to provide a disturbance-independent description of inertia, effectively capturing its intrinsic time-varying nature. Due to the duality between time and frequency domains, this paper mathematically describes the relationship between frequency-domain inertia and time-domain inertia, explicitly clarifying the physical meaning of inertia in the frequency domain. Simulations on an IEEE 39-bus system verify that the frequency-domain inertia method accurately captures inertia dynamics and is suitable for frequency stability analysis. These findings emphasize frequency-domain inertia characterization as an essential method for representing inertia in renewable-rich power systems.</description></item><item><title>Wind Turbulence-Induced Power Fluctuations Mitigation in PMSG-Based Wind Turbines by a Coordinated Control Scheme</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11106269</link><description>Power fluctuations in large-scale wind turbines (WTs), induced by persistent wind turbulences, can degrade the reliability of power modules and increase mechanical stress on light-strength structural components. These issues entail intricate challenges for system operators in terms of operation and maintenance. This paper investigates specifications of power fluctuations in PMSG-based WTs and presents a control scheme advantageous both below and above the rated wind speed, without requiring additional energy storage devices. This work strives to bridge the gap between the complicated art of WT modeling and wind turbulence-induced power fluctuations aiming to reveal the origin of power fluctuations in terms of operating regions and control strategies. In the proposed control scheme, the power fluctuations are mitigated without any auxiliary control terms below the nominal wind speed. Above the nominal wind speed, the power smoothing action is performed via three items, in which the machine side converter (MSC) virtually regulates the rotor inertia, the grid side converter (GSC) exerts the damping component, and the pitch control system helps enhance the damping mechanism. The feedback gains of the auxiliary terms are optimized while considering their interactions. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed control scheme effectively mitigates both the electrical and mechanical oscillations.</description></item><item><title>Incorporating Frequency Security Constraints in Two-Stage Robust Unit Commitment of Integrated Transmission and Distribution System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11098731</link><description>With the integration of high-proportion renewable energies, the independent operation of the transmission and distribution systems (T&amp;amp;DSs) makes it difficult to achieve optimal scheduling and ensure frequency security. Therefore, this paper proposes a two-stage robust frequency-constrained unit commitment (TRO-FCUC) model of T&amp;amp;DS. Firstly, the impacts of distributed energy resources (DERs) frequency regulation capabilities on inertial response and primary frequency response (PFR) are considered, and dynamic frequency constraints considering the cooperation of thermal units, wind farms, and DERs with their inertia-based frequency reserve are constructed. Then, the TRO-FCUC model is formulated to address uncertainties of wind farms (WFs) and distributed photovoltaics (DPVs) based on uncertainty sets. Further, the column and constraint generation (C&amp;amp;CG) algorithm and strong duality theory are utilized to transform the TRO-FCUC model into a mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) model and then solve it iteratively. Finally, case analyses proposed demonstrate that the coordinated operation of T&amp;amp;DS can fully mobilize the frequency regulation potential of DERs and improve the operation&#8217;s economy while ensuring the frequency security of the system.</description></item><item><title>Novel Series-Isolated-Parallel Wind Farm DC Collection System With New Control Strategies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11105057</link><description>Offshore wind farm (WF) DC collection systems offer significant reductions in weight and size compared to conventional AC systems. Among DC architectures, the series-parallel wind farm (SP-WF) configuration achieves higher efficiency by reducing the number of power conversion stages. However, because SP-WF places the DC-DC converter upstream of the series connection of wind turbines (WTs), it suffers from reduced reliability due to its vulnerability to DC short-circuit faults within the series string. This paper proposes a novel series-isolated-parallel wind farm (SIP-WF) architecture that enhances reliability by integrating a DC-DC converter to isolate each group of series-connected WTs. This isolation provides intrinsic DC fault blocking capability without the need for external DC circuit breakers. Furthermore, as only passive rectifiers are used at each individual WT, the proposed SIP-WF architecture maintains high efficiency. To manage maximum power point tracking (MPPT) across turbines experiencing different wind conditions, two new centralized control strategies are proposed to coordinate multiple WTs using a single DC-DC converter per group. The proposed SIP-WF architecture and control strategies are validated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink. A comprehensive performance comparison is conducted against existing DC collection topologies. The results demonstrate that SIP-WF achieves a higher net energy yield while reducing cost, system weight, and volume, and offering superior fault tolerance compared to conventional architectures.</description></item><item><title>Fault Ride-Through Strategy for Grid-Forming Converters Satisfying Multi-Objective Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11091548</link><description>Transient synchronization stability (TSS), current limitation and reactive power support (RPS) are the key objectives for fault ride-through (FRT) that grid-forming converters (GFMCs) must satisfy. However, the complex coupling restraints among these objectives, along with the fact that GFMC cannot directly control current due to its voltage-source nature, present significant challenges for FRT. To address these issues, this paper first analyzes the coupling relationships among the three objectives, and reveals the formations and control mechanisms of phase current, reactive current, and fault inrush current in GFMC. Inspired these insights, an adaptive FRT strategy is designed by cooperatively adjusting the active power and voltage references, as well as the adaptive virtual resistance, which satisfies FRT multi-objective constraints even if the voltage sags to 0. And it is straightforward to implement. Furthermore, the proposed FRT strategy is shown to exhibit superior TSS and RPS performance, as demonstrated through region of attraction and voltage phase portraits. Finally, simulation and experiment results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed FRT strategy.</description></item><item><title>Transient Stability Analysis of MMC-HVDC Connected DFIG-Based Wind Farms in the Electromechanical Timescale</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11106276</link><description>This paper investigates the transient stability of doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind farms connected via a modular multilevel converter (MMC)-based high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission system in the electromechanical timescale. During faults, the MMC tends to be switched to the current-limiting mode, which further interacts with the control systems of DFIG-based wind farms, thereby complicating the transient stability problem. In this paper, a large-signal model is constructed for transient stability analysis under this condition. The transient stability mechanism is revealed, and a transient stability index that considers the impact of a phase-locked loop in the electromechanical timescale is derived. The proposed index quantitatively assesses the instability risk arising from the coupled interaction between the DFIG-based wind farms and the MMC. In addition, the impacts of the current- limiting mode and other parameters (i.e., speed control loop gains, rotor shaft damping, inertia coefficient and fault location and severity) are analyzed. Based on the results of the parametric analysis, a suite of targeted countermeasures is proposed to enhance the transient stability of the power system. Finally, a theoretical analysis is demonstrated and verified through hardware-in-the-loop simulations using the Modeling Tech microgrid real-time simulation platform.</description></item><item><title>A Quantitative Accommodation Guaranteed Robust Scheduling Method for Renewable Power System With Dynamic Uncertainty Set</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11090046</link><description>Wind power generation (WPG) has been increasingly integrated into power systems to reduce carbon emissions. However, its inherent volatility and stochasticity have significantly challenged the reliable system operation and effective accommodation. In this paper, a robust scheduling method with a quantitative accommodation guarantee for power systems with WPG integration is proposed. First, a dynamic uncertainty set (DUS) of WPG is introduced, and a stochastic accommodation rate (SAR) indicator is accordingly proposed and derived to quantify the attainable accommodation level. Based on the DUS, a robust scheduling method is proposed, in which the implicit affine strategy (IAS) is adapted to guarantee the nonanticipativity of scheduling strategies. Moreover, a SAR constraint is carefully built according to the assessment result of the power system&#8217;s maximal and minimal SAR and embedded into the scheduling model to provide a quantitative accommodation guarantee. An illustrative case is presented to validate the effectiveness of the SAR indicator. Numerical simulations in the modified 6-bus, 14-bus, and 118-bus power systems validate the superiority of the proposed scheduling method.</description></item><item><title>Current Control and DC Capacitor Dynamic Interaction in a Cross-Timescale Manner in DFIG-WT Dominated Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11088231</link><description>The Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) based wind turbine (WT) contains control loops and energy storage components operating across multiple timescales, leading to potential cross-timescale influence dynamics in DFIG-WT-dominated power systems. Previous analyses have primarily focused on single timescale dynamics or the interactions between control loops at different timescales, with limited attention given to the cross-timescale influences between control loops and energy storage components. This paper aims to reveal the cross-timescale influence mechanism of current control at the AC-current-control timescale on the dynamics of the DC capacitor at the DC-voltage-control timescale. Modal analysis is a mature method used to uncover the cross-timescale influence phenomena and laws of current control on the dynamics of the DC capacitor. Subsequently, an equivalent circuit model is established to analyze the mechanism by which current control affects the dynamics of the DC capacitor. Finally, the conclusions are validated through simulations based on a four-machine two-area power system and the power grid of Northwest China.</description></item><item><title>Rapid Active Power Regulation of Distributed Photovoltaics Based on Optimal Dynamic Droop Coefficients</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11095309</link><description>To realize the active response for rapid active power regulation of massive distributed photovoltaics (DPVs), a bi-level architecture integrating clustering and optimization is proposed for the coordinated design of dynamic droop coefficients of DPVs in this paper.

At the upper level, a frequency deviation-optimal droop coefficient model incorporating the regulation performance and network losses is developed in a perspective that considers power flow impacts. The droop coefficient regulation strategy under various frequency fluctuations is pre-calculated by a graph attention network (GAT).

Model predictive control (MPC) is the mainstream EMS for HESSs, as it typically yields a control solution close to the global optimum while satisfying constraints. However, MPC faces a high computational burden when the optimal control problem is nonlinear. More importantly, considering multiple competing objectives, tuning weighting factors (WFs) in the MPC cost function is also challenging. To tackle these challenges, this article proposes a learning-augmented MPC strategy to optimize energy management for the HESS in WECs. The strategy first utilizes a fuzzy logic-based asymmetric action trimming technique to reduce MPC computational time. Further, a warm-start Q-learning (QL) framework with high learning efficiency is applied to obtain the WF online tuning method. To bridge the simulation-to-reality gap in the QL framework, the article designs a neural network-based current predictor, aiming to sense the nonlinear power loss during power conversion. Finally, simulations and experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed strategy in reducing energy loss, battery degradation, and MPC computational burden.</description></item><item><title>Spatio-Temporal Probabilistic Forecasting of Wind Speed Using Transformer-Based Diffusion Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11091547</link><description>Spatio-temporal wind speed forecasting plays a crucial role in enhancing energy conversion efficiency and optimizing resource allocation, forming a cornerstone of sustainable development. However, existing methods for spatio-temporal wind speed forecasting face challenges in capturing intricate spatio-temporal dependencies and adapting to dynamic variations in wind speed data. To address these limitations, we propose the Probabilistic Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Transformer (PSTDT), a novel model that combines the generative power of denoising diffusion probabilistic models with the robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities of Transformers. This approach introduces a dual-spatial attention module to model static positional relationships and dynamic dependencies from historical data, thereby capturing evolving spatial correlations. Additionally, PSTDT integrates a dual-phase temporal module for modeling cross-period temporal dependencies alongside auto-regressive temporal features, enhancing its capacity to address the complexities of time-series forecasting. Furthermore, a temporal-adaptive layer normalization is incorporated to dynamically adjust normalization parameters, improving the model&#8217;s forecast accuracy and stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PSTDT outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, reducing continuous ranked probability score by 8% &#8211;20% and mean absolute error by 7% &#8211;19% .</description></item><item><title>End-to-End Collaborative Optimization for Active Distribution Network Power Dispatch Based on Sparse Model-Ensemble Learning Policy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119768</link><description>With the higher penetration of distributed renewable power sources, novel active distribution networks are increasingly implementing flexible adjustment strategies. Currently, the dual uncertainties from both sources and demand significantly affect power dispatch in distribution networks. Typically, power dispatch is performed using a predict-then-optimize approach, making it challenging to quantify the gap between the real-time and theoretically optimal dispatch performances due to inaccuracies in power predictions. Hence, this study introduces a novel end-to-end policy to solve a collaborative optimization between prediction and dispatch. The policy directly utilizes all available information, such as gridded numerical weather forecasts, for dispatch decision-making, which eliminates the need for power predictions as intermediate variables for dispatch. To address the challenges of high-dimensional and open-scenario model training in end-to-end policies, sparse model-ensemble learning is proposed to formulate the dispatch policy model. The model is solved using constrained policy optimization. Comparative studies show that the proposed end-to-end policy outperforms the predict-then-optimize policy in real-time dispatch cases involving photovoltaic reactive power ancillary service and demand response within distribution networks.</description></item><item><title>LPV Model Predictive Control for Offshore Wind Farms Considering Wake Delay Characteristics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11082107</link><description>The pronounced wake effect in large-scale offshore wind farm necessitates careful consideration of its delay characteristics, which are crucial yet often overlooked in control. Addressing the coupling between the dynamic evolution of wake effects and the parameter changes of the WT control model, this paper introduces a Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) model predictive control method that considers wake delay characteristics. Through the development of a quasi-steady state wake model, the wake delay characteristic is incorporated within an LPV model for the wind farm. A two-stage dimensionality reduction method is proposed to simplify the calculation, and a model predictive control (MPC) method is combined to optimize the fatigue damage balance and power generation enhancement in the wind farm coordinately. Simulation results from a wind farm consisting of 16 wind turbines validate the efficacy of the quasi-steady state wake model in depicting the spatial distribution of wake delays. Furthermore, in dynamically varying wind speed and directions scenarios, the proposed control method can effectively capture the wind speed delay and fluctuation characteristics between different wind turbines, leading to heightening power output and diminishing fatigue stresses. Notably, in comparison to the static model control, the adaptive parameter tuning mechanism inherent in the proposed method effectively curtails control overshoot, enhancing overall system performance.</description></item><item><title>Fast Frequency Response in Low Inertia Grids via Integrated Supercapacitor Energy Storage Systems and Wind Turbine Generators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11082652</link><description>The increasing penetration of inverter-based resources in modern power systems has led to a significant reduction in system inertia, creating challenges for maintaining grid frequency stability. To address these issues, a new ancillary service market, termed &#8220;Fast Frequency Response (FFR)&#8221;, has emerged. FFR mandates rapid power delivery from renewable energy sources,including wind power systems, immediately following contingency events to alleviate frequency drops in a few seconds. This paper presents a control method combining supercapacitor energy storage systems and wind turbine generators to enhance the FFR capabilities of wind power systems and mitigate the frequency drop. This approach ensures the readiness of supercapacitor energy storage systems to provide FFR services under diverse wind conditions. Additionally, a control scheme for the wind turbine generator is developed to optimize its participation in FFR across a range of wind speeds while maintaining a stable operation of the wind power system. The results demonstrate that, while preserving an equivalent investment cost to that of supercapacitor banks, wind power systems can significantly increase their FFR contributions. This improvement effectively addresses critical frequency stability challenges in low-inertia grids. Eventually, the proposed method is validated through real-time experiments on a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) setup.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Evolution and Stability Analysis of GFM-Based Renewable Energy Resources Considering Repeated &amp; Continuous Current Saturation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11079878</link><description>The current saturation (CS) strategy of grid-forming renewable energy sources (GFM-RESs) is designed to protect the device from overcurrent damages. However, the potential switching processes of control strategies trigger new stability issues. It is revealed that two emerging stability issues, i.e., repeated current saturation (R-CS) and continuous current saturation (C-CS) governed by the inherent inconsistency of switching conditions, will occur when the system operates into the corresponding virtual power angle (VPA) region. This paper adopts the hybrid system theory to analyze such stability issues by deriving the necessary and sufficient switching conditions of current saturation and desaturation. During R-CS, the GFM-RES externally behaves as an abnormal current source, triggering adverse high-frequency oscillations. When subject to C-CS, the system will suffer from persistent overvoltage issues and cannot return to its initial operating point. To identify the stability risks of these two issues and offer guidance for GFM-RES&#8217;s controller design, a novel R&amp;amp;C-CS criterion, along with a generic desaturation region-based (DRB) principle, is proposed. Meanwhile, a switching condition and dynamic characteristic decoupling control (S&amp;amp;D-DC) is developed based on the DRB principle to prevent the R&amp;amp;C-CS issues. High-fidelity electromagnetic transient simulations conducted on both single-machine and multi-machine systems validate the theoretical derivations and proposed control strategy.</description></item><item><title>Interpretable Augmented Ambiguity Set for Quantifying Regional Wind Power Uncertainty in Distributionally Robust Optimal Dispatch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11082100</link><description>A large-scale grid penetration of wind power has posed severe uncertainty challenges for power system operation. This paper comes up with an interpretable augmented ambiguity set assisted by deep learning for two-stage economic dispatch formulated in a distributionally robust optimization, aiming at precisely representing regional wind power uncertainty. The specifically designed augmented ambiguity set is driven by both the fine-grained uncertainty model of each wind farm and interactive dependencies among different sites. In particular, a multi-teacher knowledge distillation-time generative adversarial network (MKD-time GAN) is presented for the first time to form a spherical ambiguity set gathering all possible distributions for power prediction error of single wind farm. This model leverages a cascaded learning framework by typical teacher-time GANs to jointly educate one general student-time GAN so as to induce a family of comprehensive reference distributions as an ambiguity set. Further, multiple ambiguity sets are mapped into augmented ambiguity set, an interdependent joint probability distribution space for regional prediction error by Nataf transformation. Based on that, a tractable solution algorithm of two-stage optimal dispatch is explicitly derived and saves computation scale. The benefits of both novel MKD-time GAN and decision-making dispatch schemes are demonstrated in IEEE 118-bus systems.</description></item><item><title>Tri-layer Distributed Scheduling for Coastal Integrated Transmission-Distribution-Gas System With Uncertain Typhoons-Affected Offshore Wind Power</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11075623</link><description>This paper addresses the scheduling challenges associated with offshore wind power within coastal power systems during uncertain typhoons. The proposed tri-layer chance-constrained coordinated scheduling model differs from existing formulations through two major innovations. First, unlike the deterministic scheduling under forecasted typhoons, it implements a scenario-based stochastic programming to address the wind power deviations resulting from the typhoon uncertainties, while additionally factoring in the potential damage to wind turbines. Second, moving beyond the isolated scheduling of thermal units in the transmission network, the proposed model enables a distributed coordination of diverse flexible resources across the distribution and gas networks to mitigate typhoon damage, resulting in a more complex tri-layer scheduling framework. These advancements introduce marked challenges for model solution. To handle this, a mix-sample average approximation method is introduced to reformulate the original random variables involved model into a tractable linear form. Moreover, a novel efficient distributed solution methodology is proposed to tackle the specific nested interactions within the tri-layer scheduling framework. Case studies verify the economic and reliability advantages of the proposed model, with 20.2% average cost saving and over 90% decrease in imbalanced power, as well as the computational superiority of the proposed distributed solution for significantly reduced solution time.</description></item><item><title>A Two-Stage Ultra-Short-Term Wind Power Forecasting Method Based on Transitional Weather Identification and Meteorological Prediction Error Propagation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11078806</link><description>Accurate and reliable wind power forecasting is crucial for the safe and economical operation of power systems. However, under transitional weather conditions, the forecasting errors of meteorological variables such as wind speed tend to increase, introducing significant input noise into wind power prediction models and reducing their reliability. To address this, this paper focuses on analyzing the error propagation mechanism of meteorological input variables and proposes a strategy to improve short-term wind power forecasting accuracy under transitional weather conditions. First, transitional weather periods are identified by analyzing the fluctuation characteristics of multi-dimensional meteorological variables. Then, a two-stage model combining Sparse Variational Gaussian Process (SVGP) and Noisy Input Gaussian Process (NIGP) is proposed. In this model, noisy input data (wind speed predictions) are decomposed into true data (actual wind speed) and noise data (forecast errors), which are modeled independently. By considering the propagation process of input noise in wind power forecasting and making necessary corrections, the SVGP-NIGP model provides more accurate deterministic forecasts and higher-quality interval predictions. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly enhances wind power forecasting accuracy under transitional weather conditions, offering an effective solution to address the uncertainties arising from meteorological forecasting.</description></item><item><title>Self-Optimizing Local Voltage Control of SOP in Active Distribution Networks Based on Lift-Dimension Mapping Linearization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11072306</link><description>The high penetration of distributed generators (DGs) deteriorates the voltage violations in active distribution networks (ADNs). Owing to the flexible adjustment capacity, the local power regulation provided by soft open point (SOP) presents a promising solution for eliminating voltage violations in ADNs. A data-driven local control method can fully excavate the potential logic from operational data without requiring precious network parameters. However, the training data may be insufficient in practical applications. In this paper, a self-optimizing local voltage control method for SOP is proposed to achieve adaptive control in label-poor conditions. First, a SOP local control model is constructed based on lift-dimension mapping linearization (LDML), which portrays the complex relationship between ADN states and SOP control strategies. Subsequently, a self-optimizing guidance mechanism is established to obtain the label data of SOP control strategy, which provides a large number of training samples for the local control model. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using a practical distribution network with a four-terminal SOP. Results demonstrate that efficient control strategies can be determined based on local state measurements. A rapid response to DG fluctuations can be achieved while enhancing the adaptability to variations in practical operations.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Optimized Parameter Tuning Algorithm for Wind Turbine Grid-Forming Control to Mitigate Power Oscillations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11068198</link><description>As the transition from synchronous generators (SGs) to renewable energy sources (RESs) accelerates, grid forming wind turbines (GFM-WTs) are increasingly expected to play a critical role in maintaining power system stability. However, the integration of GFM without thoroughly considering the interaction between the outer and inner control loops can induce power oscillations. Therefore, this paper offers a systematic sensitivity analysis to explicitly reveal how the control parameters contribute to power oscillations in the GFM-WT system. This analysis is based on a linearized state-space model for the GFM-WT system, incorporating comprehensive system dynamics and control strategies. Furthermore, an optimized control algorithm is developed based on a comprehensive small-signal model, incorporating essential constraints such as the eigenvalue damping ratio and the control loop bandwidth. The algorithm autonomously tunes the control parameters of both the inner and outer loop systems, resulting in optimal parameter values. A comprehensive stability analysis was conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in ensuring system stability. The proposed method is verified through various scenario in modified WSCC 9-bus and New England 39-bus systems. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm effectively mitigates power oscillations in the WT output, subsequently reducing power oscillations in the SG.</description></item><item><title>Deterministic and Probabilistic Forecasting of Wind Power Generation and Ramp Rate With Expectation-Implemented Deep Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11068153</link><description>Accurate day-ahead forecasting of wind power generation, both deterministically and probabilistically, is crucial for reliable and efficient power system operations, and its significance will increase in renewable energy-dominant power systems. Furthermore, inherent variability of wind farms necessitates day-ahead ramp rate forecasting to ensure stable energy balancing. To address these needs, we propose an hourly day-ahead forecasting framework that concurrently predicts the wind power generation and ramp rate. This framework leverages expectation-implemented deep learning models trained by the custom loss functions tailored to the different signal attributes and our distinct expectations. Additional strategies, such as feature generation and a feedforward error learning model, are implemented to enhance forecasting performance while maintaining a balance between tasks. Finally, our framework integrates heterogeneous generation and ramp rate forecasting results, incorporating probabilistic ramp rate forecasting derived from the synthesized output. We validate our approach using real wind power data and assess the impact of each proposed method individually. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly contribute to identifying the intrinsic volatility of wind power, thereby fully exploiting its potential benefits.</description></item><item><title>Optimal BESS Management for Peak Load Shaving and Battery Health Under Prediction Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11071638</link><description>In modern power grids, integrating renewable energy sources (RESs), deploying battery energy storage systems (BESSs) is increasingly vital for mitigating power fluctuations. However, optimizing BESS operation remains challenging amidst uncertainties in both RES and load forecasting. This paper proposes a novel stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) framework for BESS operation, focusing on peak load shaving and battery health while addressing prediction uncertainties. The proposed framework employs a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network for forecasting and integrates a constraint-tightening technique into a stochastic optimization (SO) problem with a receding horizon. Based on the load profile of a company in Germany, the proposed framework achieves an additional reduction of 99 kW (5.8%) in peak grid take-out power compared with the traditional model predictive control (MPC) approach, demonstrating its advantage in addressing uncertainties.</description></item><item><title>PMU-Based Power Oscillation Damping Control for Renewable Energy System With Communication Disruption and Multi-Time Delays</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11071336</link><description>This paper presents a novel model-free power oscillation damping strategy for renewable energy (RE) system considering communication disruption and multiple time delays in control loops. First, a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process-enabled online estimation method is developed for state-space modeling estimation only using measurement data. This estimation method is applicable to systems with different delays in each wide-area control loop. Subsequently, a novel wide-area power oscillation damper (POD) is designed for the renewable energy sources (RESs) and that is further reconstructed in a decomposition manner to achieve independently sub-control, which allows to retain better damping performance under communication disruption. After that, the POD parameter settings are carefully tuned, where the time delay and estimation error are considered, formulated as stability constraints using Razumikhin theorem, and solved via linear matrix inequality (LMI), yielding multi-dimensional robustness of the system, including operating conditions, time delay and communication disruption. Case studies in the improved 4-machine 2-area system and IEEE 39-bus system show that the proposed method can accurately estimate the state-space modeling of closed-loop system and effectively dampen power oscillations in time delay and communication disruption scenarios.</description></item><item><title>A Unified Method for Assessing Frequency Support Capability of Diverse Renewable Power Generation Units</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11061796</link><description>The proliferation of renewable power generation units (RGUs) deteriorates the physical inertia of the system, making the evaluation of unit-level frequency support capability (FSC) and system-level frequency stability increasingly important. However, the prior-art approaches lack a standardized framework for FSC assessment, and the non-disclosure of RGU information by manufacturers exacerbates this challenge. To address these issues, this paper proposes a unified transfer function structure (UTFS) model and its parameter solving method based on impedance measurement, enabling a unified assessment of both the unit-level FSC and system-level frequency stability. The unit-level UTFS can be obtained through frequency-domain approaches, e.g., xy-impedance measurements. Moreover, the system-level UTFS can be acquired through the simple aggregation of unit-level UTFS. Without detailed models or post-event data, the proposed framework uniformly represents the FSC of various RGUs through three key indicators: effective inertia, damping, and primary frequency regulation (PFR). Furthermore, the proposed method analytically derives system frequency indicators: frequency nadir, rate of change of frequency (RoCoF), and steady-state frequency deviation. Numerical simulations and analysis of the operational data of a provincial power grid are provided to validate the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Timescale Operational Optimization for Mobile Charging Solutions Considering Voltage Regulation Support for ADN: A Two-Stage Coordination Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11051060</link><description>To alleviate the pressure of traditional fixed charging methods, mobile charging solutions have emerged in recent years. This article presents a two-stage coordination approach for mobile charging robots (MCRs) and active distribution networks (ADN). In the first stage, we maximize the total revenue for the MCRs from providing charging services for electric vehicles (EVs) and interacting with the ADN within a frame-based time scale, where the duration of each frame is determined by the charging decisions of MCRs. Furthermore, we consider the long-term objectives of meeting the battery energy deficit constraint for each MCR, thereby improving their battery life. Lyapunov optimization is utilized to transform frame-based scheduling into an optimization problem within a specified time slot, simplifying the process of solving the optimization problem. To avoid affecting charging efficiency when MCRs interact with the power grid, we use the reactive power of free MCRs to provide voltage regulation support for the ADN, improving power quality and minimizing total network loss simultaneously. Decoupling active and reactive power in two stages ensures both the profitability of the MCRs cluster and the voltage security of the ADN, resulting in a win-win situation. The simulation results, based on the 18-bus and 51-bus distribution networks, confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Assessing Grid Penalized Reinforcement Learning for Renewable Energy Management of Power-to-X Integrated With Intermediate Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11051013</link><description>This research explores the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based planning strategies of power-to-X (PtX) systems under uncertainties of renewable and price through a detailed case study and comparative analysis of system planning. A DRL-based hourly planning model is proposed to minimize operational costs for a PtX system, incorporating a hybrid energy storage system. The model employs a grid-penalized reward function to manage grid power usage while accounting for temporal uncertainties in renewable and grid prices. To analyze the DRL model&#8217;s planning strategies, it is compared to a general rule-based model across varying spatial and temporal uncertainties using real-world data from national (France) areas. The results show that the DRL-based planning approach consistently outperforms the rule-based model, achieving 1,360.12% higher monthly profits in the national area, though with a relatively lower renewable energy penetration (REP). However, sensitivity analysis reveals that increasing the grid penalty level effectively reduces the gap in REP while sustaining higher profitability. This comparative analysis is the first to quantitatively reveal the planning strategies of a DRL-based PtX system, highlighting its effectiveness in reducing grid power overuse while maintaining higher profitability in system planning.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Proximal Policy Optimization With Embedded Dual Rules for Power Systems Considering Wind and Photovoltaic Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11059762</link><description>Most renewable energy power systems are created to provide more resilient, reliable, economical, sustainable and secure power support services for loads. However, owing to the inherent forecasting errors of wind and photovoltaic (PV) power, existing optimal dispatch decisions based on forecasting errors have biases. To address this issue, this paper proposes the distributed proximal policy optimization (DPPO) model with embedded dual rules for optimal power dispatch that considers wind and PV power forecasting error correction. The proposed model embeds forecasting and error correction information into the DPPO state space. Moreover, considering the physical characteristics and operational security constraints of the power grid, power balance and flow constraints are embedded in the DPPO network in a regular form. Finally, by integrating the established rules, wind and PV forecasting, and error correction information, the proposed model achieves optimal dispatch decisions through the calculation of state and execution of prescribed actions. The proposed method is applied and tested on a modified IEEE-30 bus system using actual data from a provincial power grid. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively addresses optimal dispatch decisions caused by wind and PV forecasting errors. Compared with three other advanced methods, the proposed approach has significant advantages in promoting wind power accommodation, reducing operating costs, and enhancing the adaptability of optimal dispatch to uncertainty.</description></item><item><title>An End-to-End Ensemble Learning Approach for Enhancing Wind Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11048619</link><description>Accurate wind power forecasts are crucial for grid stability, thereby ensuring a reliable and efficient power supply. To characterize the complicated fluctuation of wind power, numerous ensemble models with multiple base forecasters have been developed. However, most existing ensemble forecasting models contain several modeling stages, which increases the risk of error accumulation and inefficiency in model training. Moreover, the limited number of base forecasters results in forecasts with reduced diversity, thereby diminishing the performance of ensemble models. To address these challenges, MG-DS, a simple but efficient end-to-end ensemble learning model based on the Dempster-Shafer (DS) evidence theory, is proposed to unify base model learning and ensemble learning into a single process. It comprises an all-MLP-based nonlinear feature extraction module, a GRU and cross attention-based base forecast generation module, and a DS-based self-ensemble forecasting module with a DS-based magnifying glass to enhance the diversity of base forecasts. Further, a DS-based self-ensemble (DSSE) plugin is proposed to integrate the trained RNN-type and non-RNN-type base forecasters. Experiments on five wind power datasets show that MG-DS outperforms popular wind power forecasting models and ensemble techniques, and the effectiveness of the DSSE plugin is also validated in enhancing the performance of ensemble wind power forecasting.</description></item><item><title>A Fully Distributed Incentive Mechanism for Integrated Electricity and Heat Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045415</link><description>Coordination between electric power systems (EPS) and district heating systems (DHS) integrates more renewable energy and improves economic benefits. However, the dispatch of integrated electricity and heat systems (IEHS) raises privacy and incentive concerns. To address these issues, we propose a fully distributed incentive mechanism for IEHS. Specifically, the combined heat and power dispatch (CHPD) model is transformed into a monotone variational inequality (MVI) and solved by a fully distributed predictor-corrector algorithm (FDPCA). With FDPCA, the EPS and DHS operators can dispatch independently. Additionally, we use a novel two-stage benefit allocation approach based on Nash bargaining to distribute profits while simplifying computational complexity. Case studies demonstrate that the fully distributed incentive mechanism effectively protects privacy, enhances efficiency, and promotes cooperation.</description></item><item><title>Adaptable Parameters Estimation for Microgrid Distributed Energy Resources Using Modified Physics-Informed Neural Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045087</link><description>Parameters estimation in microgrids remains challenging due to ambiguous system dynamics brought by distributed energy resources (DERs) and scarcity of data. This study presents a modified physics-informed neural network (PINN) paradigmdesigned for parameters estimation under such constraints. This paper introduces two main innovations: First, by combining small-signal analysis with the PINN framework for ordinary differential equations, we introduce an adaptable parameter estimation paradigm applicable to different types of DERs in microgrid. Second, we introduce a modified data transformation that reduces training time by up to 82.87% compared to traditional PINN approaches at best. To validate our approach, we conducted simulation on two typical system setups based on open-source real-world microgrid using real-time digital simulation to generate data. We evaluate the proposed method by using an error margin below 5% as a key metric to confirm its robustness and accuracy for different types of DERs. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed method across varying ordinary differential equations to diverse mathematical models. Additionally, suboptimal and failed cases are analyzed and discussed to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the method&#8217;s limitations.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Fractional Programming-Based Planning Model for 100% Renewable Poly-Generation of Electricity and Methanol</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045219</link><description>Engaging in long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with renewable energy producers (REPs) is a promising strategy for decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors, such as internet data centers. However, due to the inherent volatility and intermittency of renewable energy sources (RES), REPs typically require substantial over-installation of capacity to meet fixed PPA delivery commitments, resulting in significant energy curtailment and increased supply costs. Power-to-methanol (P2M) offers a viable pathway for large-scale integration of RES by providing flexible chemical storage and demand. This study proposes a unified planning framework for the 100% renewable poly-generation of electricity and methanol, considering both flexible and inflexible loads. The objective is to maximize the internal rate of return (IRR), a key metric for investment decision-making. To this end, a mixed-integer linear fractional programming (MILFP) model is developed and solved in a computationally tractable manner. The model is validated using real-world data. Results show that the proposed approach significantly improves IRR, reduces RES curtailment, and lowers the levelized costs of both electricity and methanol. Furthermore, the model effectively coordinates electricity delivery under PPA constraints with methanol synthesis, offering an economically robust solution for renewable energy utilization and sector coupling.</description></item><item><title>Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning Method for Volt/Var Control in Active Distribution Network With Safe Operation Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045109</link><description>In recent years, distributed energy resources (DERs) in power systems have been increasingly integrated into the distribution network. DERs will improve the flexibility and economy of active distribution networks (ADNs) while introducing increased complexity and challenges in maintaining stable and efficient system operations. The traditional voltage regulation methods struggle to cope with these complexities, highlighting the need for more advanced and adaptive control strategies for fast-response PVs and battery energy storage systems (BESS). This paper proposes a novel Human-in-the-loop deep reinforcement learning (HITL-DRL) framework for Volt/Var control in ADNs, addressing the limitations of the existing approaches by integrating human experience and knowledge into the learning process. Additionally, a Security-Clipped Proximal Policy Optimization (SC-PPO) algorithm is introduced to ensure safe operation during reinforcement learning. The paper explores three human-intervention strategies: human demonstration, human feedback, and setting adversary, which enhance the learning process by leveraging expert knowledge and experience. The proposed HITL-DRL framework demonstrates improved convergence speed, robustness, reduced exploration risk, and increased interpretability and trust, paving the way for more effective voltage regulation in complex power systems. The proposed HITL-DRL method is verified in the IEEE 33-bus system, demonstrating superior performance over standard DRL algorithms in terms of training speed and robustness, achieving the highest average reward and the second-fastest computational time. Compared to traditional PPO, our method significantly excels in managing unforeseen contingencies, resulting in a lower voltage violation rate of 73.4%. Compared with the model-based method, the strategy of HITL-DRL is very close to that of optimization results in terms of energy loss and voltage violation rates. However, HITL-DRL shows advantages in decision-making time, responding within 1 millisecond, which is capable of rapidly adapting to time-vary changes in ADNs.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Flexibility Aggregation of Heterogeneous Demand-Side Energy Storages for Secondary Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11044873</link><description>Demand-side energy storages (DESs), such as household batteries and electric vehicles (EVs), have shown great potential in providing fast frequency regulation services. This paper proposes a three-layer hierarchical flexibility aggregation framework to fully evaluate and reliably realize the aggregate flexibility of heterogeneous DESs for secondary frequency regulation (SFR). At the device layer, the regulation capacity of an individual DES is modeled as a two-dimensional feasible region, with the real-time state-of-charge (SoC) constraint and the statistical features of regulation signals well considered. On this basis, heterogeneous DESs are divided into several clusters according to the geometry of their feasible region. At the cluster layer, regulation capacity, dynamic response model as well as regulation costs are efficiently aggregated within each DES cluster by prototype-based maximum inner approximation (MIA). At the aggregator layer, an analytical expression of the multi-cluster coordinated SFR flexibility can be formulated by convex optimizations at each feasible operating point, which provides a comprehensive model for DES aggregators to economically participate in SFR. Comparative simulations validate that the proposed method can accurately capture the aggregate SFR flexibility of heterogeneous DESs with lower flexibility loss and affordable computational burden, while the disaggregation feasibility of aggregate flexibility is further demonstrated using real-world regulation signals.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Autonomous Control for Global Economic Operation of AC/DC Microgrid Clusters Interconnected by Flexible DC Distribution Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045308</link><description>This paper presents a distributed autonomous control strategy for AC/DC microgrid clusters interconnected by the flexible DC distribution network to simultaneously achieve the global economic operation and frequency/voltage control of the system while complying with the power limits of DGs and interlinking converters.

Mobile wind turbines (MWTs) are uniquely positioned to navigate transportation systems, being towed by trucks, and supply energy to power distribution systems (PDSs). This flexibility enables MWTs to serve as emergency power sources, thereby contributing to enhancing the system resilience by facilitating service restoration following extreme events. This paper presents a novel framework based on Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) to dispatch MWTs for service restoration. Deep Q-learning (DQL) and Double Deep Q-learning (DDQL) approaches are implemented within the agent for training and comparison purposes. Additionally, an action limitation is incorporated into the proposed framework in order to mitigate the influence of wind power fluctuations. Case studies conducted on an integrated power-transport system, comprising a Sioux Falls transportation system and four IEEE 33-bus test systems, illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed restoration scheduling policy in enhancing PDSs&#8217; resilience against disasters.</description></item><item><title>Robust Unit Commitment With Multi-State Uncertainty: A Novel Formulation and Scalable Solution Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045107</link><description>To mitigate the conservatism of scheduling schemes derived from the two-stage robust unit commitment model (TS-RUCM), this paper proposes a novel multi-state uncertainty set (MSUS) considering the uncertain wind power output (WPO). The MSUS formulates WPO uncertainties with higher resolution by introducing multiple discrete state values within the uncertain interval. Additionally, the MSUS limits extreme fluctuations of WPO uncertainties among state values through transition indicators embedded in multiple transition constraints. The state values and transition indicators are calculated using the conditional quantile regression technique and Markov chain analysis. This systematic and scientific approach allows the MSUS to effectively exclude low-probability WPO scenarios, thereby significantly mitigating the conservatism of the scheduling schemes. Moreover, to accelerate the computation of the TS-RUCM based on the MSUS, this paper proposes an improved inexact column and constraint generation (II-C&amp;amp;CG) method. The II-C&amp;amp;CG method employs an adaptive tolerance strategy and refined backtracking to solve master and subproblems inexactly while ensuring finite convergence, significantly reducing computational time. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of both the MSUS and the II-C&amp;amp;CG method.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Artificial Intelligence and Physics-Based Modeling for Long-Term Cascaded Hydropower Scheduling Under Extreme Heat Events</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11059276</link><description>The operation of hydropower plants are significantly challenged by extreme heatwave events. This paper integrates artificial intelligence and a physics-based model to introduce an efficient long-term scheduling framework aimed at maximizing hydropower generation during extreme heat events. The water values derived from the proposed long-term scheduling model can be used in developing effective strategies for short-term hydropower scheduling. A physics-based evaporation model (PEM), which captures key land-atmosphere interactions, is developed to account for significant variations in reservoir evaporation rates during extreme heat events. A multivariate long short-term memory (M-LSTM) forecasting model is also utilized to predict the key input parameters required for both the PEM and the long-term scheduling problem. A regression-based machine learning algorithm is also utilized to estimate the hydropower production function, which enables linear integration of the nonlinear and nonconvex behavior of hydropower plant in the mixed-integer linear formulation of the scheduling problem. The proposed model is applied to a case study of eleven cascaded hydropower units located on the Columbia river. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed long-term scheduling model effectively manages reservoir operations, mitigating the adverse impacts of extreme heat events on hydropower generation and operator profitability.</description></item><item><title>Chance-Constrained Optimization for VPPs With Base Stations Considering Diverse Communication Rate Requirements</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11082584</link><description>5G Base Stations (BSs) consume a large amount of electricity, requiring predominantly green power, which brings huge pressure on their electricity costs. To reduce energy costs and carbon emissions, aggregating 5G BSs (Macro BS and Micro BS), and distributed renewable energy into virtual power plants (VPPs) to participate in market transactions has become a trend. However, the operation of VPPs faces challenges: the uncertainty of renewable energy output and the unclear regulation mechanism of BSs. Consequently, this paper focuses on developing an optimal scheduling strategy for VPPs, considering the schedulability of BSs and the uncertainty of internal renewable energy. Firstly, the flexibility of BSs with 4G and 5G modules is investigated, particularly in terms of transceivers and backup energy storage. The communication rates of BSs are modeled to evaluate the impact of active transceiver numbers on user experience. A dynamic time-domain model of backup energy storage capacity considering communication load is proposed. The impact of user mobility and overlapping coverage areas of BSs on communication rates is considered to be more in line with real-world scenarios. Subsequently, an optimization model is developed for VPPs to maximize the profit of engaging BSs in the day-ahead market transaction, considering diverse communication rate requirements. The optimization model determines the schedule of transceivers, backup energy storage, and other resources. Then, to control the operational risks associated with the uncertainty of internal distributed renewable energy outputs, the chance constraint is introduced. Furthermore, the Taylor expansion-based algorithm is applied to coordinately solve the VPP dispatching problem. Numerical simulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed models, which achieve a 5.4% increase in the proportion of internal renewable energy consumption and a 18.72% increase in economic benefits.</description></item><item><title>Synthetic Inertia Control for a Wind Turbine Generator Based on Event Size and Rotor Speed</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045832</link><description>To enhance the frequency nadir without causing the excessive deceleration of the rotor speed (${{{{\omega }}}_{{r}}}$), synthetic inertia control (SIC) schemes of a wind turbine generator (WTG) need to provide incremental power in response to event magnitude and ${{{{\omega }}}_{{r}}}$. Conventional stepwise SIC approaches face limitations during large events due to the increase of predefined incremental power, which does not match the actual event size. This paper presents an SIC strategy for WTGs that adjusts incremental power in relation to event size and ${{{{\omega }}}_{{r}}}$. During the frequency-support phase, the incremental power is modulated based on the frequency deviation, along with a control gain proportional to ${{{{\omega }}}_{{r}}}$, rather than the rate of change of frequency. While this approach accounts for the power imbalance, it remains vulnerable to noise and delays in practical applications. After the frequency-support phase, the proposed method decreases the active power reference in accordance with ${{{{\omega }}}_{{r}}}$, ensuring it stabilizes within a secure operating range. Following stabilization, the WTG transitions smoothly back to maximum power point tracking operation.

To address these issues, a novel spatial-temporal transformer-based prototype federated reinforcement learning (STT-PFRL) model is proposed to mitigate voltage deviations while ensuring data privacy. Specifically, STT-PFRL operating within a decentralized framework trains the model by transmitting local prototype information between a central data server and local agents, avoiding raw data privacy leakage. Besides, a novel physics-aware spatial-temporal transformer network is proposed to improve the voltage regulation policy learning stability against uncertainties by embedding the spatial-temporal graphical physics information into the data aggregation process. Furthermore, the prototype learning-based federated soft actor-critic (ProtoFedSAC) algorithm incorporates a prototype layer to utilize diverse feature representations, thereby enhancing the model&#8217;s ability to handle heterogeneity in environmental data. Simulation results on 33- and 118-node distribution systems demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of STT-PFRL in voltage regulation.</description></item><item><title>County-Level Distributed PV Day-Ahead Power Prediction Based on Grey Correlation Analysis and Transformer-GCAN Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11061797</link><description>The distributed photovoltaic (PV) power stations within the entire county exist spatiotemporal correlation. Merely considering temporal correlation makes it challenging to meet the day-ahead scheduling demands. This paper proposes a distributed PV county-level day-ahead power prediction method based on grey relational analysis and the Transformer-Graph Convolutional Attention Network (Transformer-GCAN) model. Firstly, the grey relational degree is used to measure the relevance between each distributed PV stations, and the connection relationship of the station graph is determined based on the analysis results. Secondly, the Transformer network is utilized to extract the temporal features of each PV sequence in the graph. Based on the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model, a Graph Attention Mechanism (GAT) is introduced to dynamically extract spatial features between each photovoltaic station in the graph. Finally, the integration of spatiotemporal features is achieved through a fully connected neural network, enabling day-ahead power prediction at the county level. Case analysis results demonstrate that compared with the Transformer-GCN model, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the power prediction model proposed in this paper is reduced by 11.90%, 15.72% and 19.61% respectively in sunny days, cloudy days and rainy days.</description></item><item><title>Power Capacity Allocation Among Multiple Renewable Power Plants: A Perspective From System Strength</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11122291</link><description>Large-scale renewable energy projects consisting of renewable power plants (RPPs) managed by different stakeholders may suffer weak system strength. Consequently, only a limited amount of renewable power capacity can be delivered, or the insufficient system strength could incur stability issues. The allocation of system strength constrained power capacity among different RPPs deserves investigation, which is critical to their respective benefits. To this end, the system strength demand of each RPP is quantified based on its allowable power capacity. A power capacity allocation approach is proposed, ensuring that the RPPs efficiently and fairly utilize system strength. Case studies show that RPPs with longer electrical distances deliver less renewable capacity due to their greater impact on system strength.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Event-Triggered Sliding Mode Control for Reactive and Unbalanced Power Sharing in Islanded AC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11230861</link><description>To address the reactive and unbalanced power sharing in islanded AC microgrids with communication constraints and disturbances, novel distributed secondary control methods are proposed by combining event-triggered schemes and sliding mode control, which can save communication resources and cope with external bounded disturbances, respectively.

Moreover, an event-triggered scheme with a dynamically regulated threshold depending on sliding mode is designed in the distributed secondary control to reduce communication burden without Zeno behavior. The integration of sliding mode control and event-triggered scheme induces the difficulty in the stability analysis of the proposed control methods, which is handled by selecting applicable Lyapunov function.

This method addresses voltage instability that occurs during mode switching from one mode to another scheduled by the upper-level energy management of the microgrid network. First, a switched system model is established for networked DCMGs with multiple operational modes, from which the switching stability criterion and the voltage fluctuation index are derived through a family of Lyapunov functions. Then, a directed graph is constructed to facilitate the search and planning of stable mode switching paths, where the vertices represent the modes, the edges are governed by switching stability criteria, and the edge weights correspond to voltage fluctuation indices. The graph model converts the mode-switching stability problem into a reachability path planning problem in graph theory, bridging the current mode to the target mode determined by the upper-level energy management. To identify the optimal mode-switching path, a depth-first search algorithm is employed, which provides a stable path with the minimal voltage fluctuation. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated through simulation in MATLAB/Simulink and Modeling Tech StarSim platform.</description></item><item><title>Edge Computing-Based Cyber-Physical Interdependent Power Restoration of Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11230619</link><description>The digitalization of distribution networks intensifies the coupling between cyber and physical networks.

This makes the coordinated multi-period joint active and reactive power dispatch (C-MP-ARPD) problem a bilevel mixed-integer nonlinear programming (bilevel-MINLP) one. Nevertheless, research on the bilevel coordinated optimization problems with binary variables at each level is extremely limited. To fill this research gap, this work proposes a spherical manifold-based optimization method for the C-MP-ARPD problem. Specifically, the  $l_{2}$ -box method is employed to transform the bilevel-MINLP problem into a bilevel Riemannian nonlinear programming problem within the continuous domain. Then, a manifold-based model decomposition strategy is proposed, obtaining relaxed subproblems, box-subproblems and sphere-subproblems of both ADN and MGs, which can be efficiently coordinated by the enhanced manifold-based ADMM algorithm. Besides, a Riemannian trust-region method is employed to solve sphere-subproblems efficiently. Moreover, the bilevel relaxed subproblem of ADN and MGs is further equivalently decomposed into several small-scale subproblems by exploiting the spatio-temporal structure. Correspondingly, a hierarchical spatio-temporal decomposition method is developed to efficiently coordinate those obtained subproblems in a fully distributed and parallel manner. Finally, by integrating the aforementioned methods, a spherical manifold-based optimization approach is proposed for solving the C-MP-ARPD problem. The accuracy, computational efficiency, and convergence performance of the proposed method are verified through comparison with the commercial MIP solver Gurobi, as well as other representative distributed methods.</description></item><item><title>Optimizing Parameters of the LinDistFlow Power Flow Approximation for Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11230858</link><description>The DistFlow model accurately represents power flows in distribution systems, but the model&#8217;s nonlinearities result in computational challenges for many applications. Accordingly, a linear approximation known as LinDistFlow (and its three-phase extension LinDist3Flow) is commonly employed. This paper introduces a parameter optimization algorithm for enhancing the accuracy of this approximation for both balanced single-phase equivalent and unbalanced three-phase distribution network models, with the goal of aligning the outputs more closely with those from the nonlinear DistFlow model. Using sensitivity information, our algorithm optimizes the LinDistFlow approximation&#8217;s coefficient and bias parameters to minimize discrepancies in predictions of voltage magnitudes relative to the nonlinear DistFlow model. The parameter optimization algorithm employs the Truncated Newton Conjugate-Gradient (TNC) method to fine-tune coefficients and bias parameters during an offline training phase to improve the LinDistFlow approximation&#8217;s accuracy. Numerical results underscore the algorithm&#8217;s efficacy, showcasing accuracy improvements in  $L_{1}$ -norm and  $L_{\infty }$ -norm losses of up to 92% and 88%, respectively, relative to the traditional LinDistFlow model. We also assess how the optimized parameters perform under changes in the network topology and demonstrate the optimized LinDistFlow approximation&#8217;s efficacy in a hosting capacity optimization problem.</description></item><item><title>Secondary Frequency Control Through Serverless Cloud Computing for Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11231387</link><description>With the growing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs), many regulating entities, such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in the USA, have initiated a notice of inquiry for the utilization of cloud services for power system operation, including ancillary grid services from DERs. Motivated by these initiatives, this paper develops a serverless cloud computing architecture for real-time secondary frequency control in active distribution networks (ADNs). A secondary frequency control architecture is developed along with an optimization-based controller for optimally dispatching the regulating units in response to automatic generation control (AGC) signals. The developed optimization is fully integrated with the proposed serverless cloud computing architecture, utilizing several Amazon Web Services (AWS) such as Lambda, IoT Core, and S3. The AWS cloud architecture communicates with a real-time digital simulator, which mimics an ADN, utilizing IoT devices like Raspberry Pi and several utility standard communication protocols such as MQTT and TCP/IP. To demonstrate the dispatch of regulating units using the proposed serverless cloud computing architecture&#8212;and to validate the performance of the developed optimization-based controller&#8212;a real-time model of an actual feeder from NV Energy (the largest utility in Nevada) is utilized. Furthermore, a grid response time analysis is conducted to enable proper sequencing of frequency regulation commands by predicting the actual response time of the grid. The results of accurately dispatching the regulating units in response to AGC signals validate the accuracy of the optimization, demonstrate the successful implementation of the proposed serverless cloud-based AGC, and set the stage for practically implementing the proposed solutions.</description></item><item><title>Research on Protection Method for DC Distribution Networks Based on Fault Current Energy Peak-to-Average Ratio</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11250597</link><description>Existing protection methods for DC distribution networks suffer from limitations such as low transition resistance tolerance, noise susceptibility, and inadequate speed. To overcome these challenges, this paper first establishes a bipolar short-circuit fault model that considers multi-converter interactions. Based on this model, we reveal the intrinsic relationship between fault current energy distribution and fault conditions, and propose a novel protection criterion utilizing the Energy Peak-to-Average Ratio (EPAR) of the fault current. By converting the time-domain waveform characteristics of the fault current into energy distribution features, the method effectively characterizes the influence of transition resistance on fault characteristics, enabling rapid and reliable identification of high-impedance bipolar short-circuit faults. An adaptive collaborative protection method leveraging the complementary characteristics of EPAR and current variation is developed. By constructing a dual-criterion coordination mechanism integrating current variation and EPAR, this method enables dynamic setting and complementary identification, ensuring full-line rapid protection for internal bipolar faults. Furthermore, the impact of setting value selection on protection reliability and sensitivity was quantitatively analyzed, constraints in the protection setting process were elucidated, and a theoretical basis for applying the proposed method to DC distribution networks with different structures was provided. A 10 kV multi-terminal flexible DC distribution network model incorporating diverse converters is built in PSCAD/EMTDC to validate the proposed method under various fault conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that the method accurately discriminates faults within 1.5 ms after occurrence, achieves transition resistance tolerance up to  $100~\Omega $ , and exhibits strong noise immunity.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Load Restoration of Coupled Power-Transportation Systems Considering Healthcare System Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11224497</link><description>The interdependence of power and transportation systems tightens over time, which brings significant chances and challenges to the coordinated restoration of coupled power-transportation systems under extreme weather events.

Most of the existing studies on carbon pricing overlook the impact of energy consumption behavior of consumers and fail to leverage the potential of demand-sides to achieve greater carbon emission reductions. This paper proposes a low-carbon demand response (LCDR) framework for decarbonization of power-hydrogen integrated energy systems (PH-IESs) and an equitable allocation of carbon responsibility to various types of consumers. A consumer-based carbon pricing strategy with improved marginal carbon intensity is first developed to quantify the impact of the amount and behavior of energy consumption on carbon responsibility and costs. Then, a consumer-based LCDR model is proposed for demand-side energy aggregators (DSEAs) who adjust flexible loads to reduce operation costs and carbon emissions based on the determined carbon price. Finally, a low-carbon operation model is formulated to schedule the PH-IESs considering the responses of DSEAs. To capture renewable uncertainties and reduce decision conservatism, distributionally robust joint chance constraints are established capitalizing on heterogeneous information (i.e., moment, unimodality, and mode skewness). Case studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed LCDR framework.</description></item><item><title>Emission and Economy Balanced Dispatching of Integrated Power and Hydrogen Systems via a Tri-Level Robust Optimizer Incorporating Multi-Time Resolution and Carbon Tax</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11232499</link><description>The escalating demand for hydrogen forces hydrogen generation station (HGS) to seek a stable power supply, that is inherently contradicts the intermittency of distributed renewable energy (DRE). Whilst the affordable active distribution network (ADN) electricity mostly sourced from fossil fuels goes against decarbonization vision. To balance economy and emission, an efficient integrated power and hydrogen system (IPHS), featuring a full-cycle carbon tax and hybrid energy storage, is proposed. Particularly, the full-cycle carbon tax fosters optimized utilization of clean energies and development of high-efficiency solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). The ADN involves li-ion batteries to derisk DRE curtailment. Whilst a two-layer optimizer is proposed to lower emission of the HGS, where the inner layer leverages a vehicle routing problem (VRP) to decarbonize hydrogen selling, and the outer layer serves to improve efficiency of hydrogen production and conversion. On privacy barrier, the ADN and HGS are unified by alternated directed multiplier method (ADMM), yielding a tri-level robust model. Given the integer-rich NP-hard nature of this model, due to 5-minute battery scheduling and inner VRP, a multi-time resolution solver is tailored. It segregates IPHS operations into a 1-hour ADN-HGS interaction stage following HGS&#8217;s slow responses, and an enhanced fast 5-minute battery schedule phase to compensate DRE stochasticity. Numerical studies indicate that, the proposed model reduces carbon emissions by at least 20.5% and operating costs by 7.6% across various seasonal scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Control of a Boiling Water Small Modular Reactor Cogeneration System for District Heating Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11245633</link><description>This paper proposes a novel approach for modeling and controlling a Small Modular Reactor (SMR) cogeneration power plant for District Heating Network (DHN) applications, aimed at decarbonizing energy systems and enhancing power grid flexibility. Existing studies do not adequately address key aspects of the dynamic modeling and control of SMR-based DHN cogeneration plants, including insufficient representation of piping heat losses, thermal delays, fluctuations in DHN thermal demand, and the lack of multi-timescale dynamic analyses. Thus, this work proposes dynamic models and control strategies for SMR-based DHN cogeneration systems, incorporating detailed thermoelectric modeling that addresses the current modeling shortcomings to allow for the assessment of system stability over both short- and long-term horizons to properly evaluate transient and steady-state performance. Furthermore, the paper assesses the SMR-based DHN cogeneration system by examining its dynamic interactions with the Electric Power Network (EPN) and DHN under realistic scenarios to support industry-driven control design and operational decisions. In this context, the proposed model and controls are validated using the boiling water reactor BWRX-300 being integrated into the power grid of Ontario, Canada, considering a potential DHN deployment in the Darlington region. The results highlight the strong potential of SMRs for cogeneration, demonstrating their operational flexibility in a practical application and illustrating a significant reduction in energy consumption compared to heating systems based on solely Heat Pumps (HPs), considering that existing government policies in Ontario, like in other jurisdictions, are incentivizing the replacement of fossil fuel-based space heating systems with HPs.</description></item><item><title>Carbon-Centric Hybrid-Game Robust Planning of Multiple Integrated Energy Systems Considering Higher-Order Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11263952</link><description>With the growing focus on carbon neutrality, integrated energy systems (IESs) have become vital for low-carbon transitions. However, conventional multi-IES planning remains energy-centric, overlooking inter- and intra-system interactions of carbon trading and carbon-based pricing. Therefore, this paper proposes a carbon-centric hybrid-game robust planning model for multi-IESs under higher-order uncertainties (HOUs). The proposed model integrates an inter-IES Nash bargaining game to enhance system-wide coordination with dynamic carbon trading, and an intra-IES Stackelberg game to improve supplier-user interaction via carbon-based energy pricing. A novel low-carbon flexible retrofitted CHP structure, alongside its extended carbon emission flow (ECEF) model, is developed to provide physical support for dynamic carbon attribution. Additionally, to address HOUs in renewable outputs, a confidence band-based ambiguity set is constructed, considering both parameter and distributional variations for system robust planning. A decomposition algorithm combining adaptive ADMM and parallel C&amp;amp;CG is implemented to ensure computational tractability. Finally, case studies on a real-world system in Southern China validate the effectiveness of the proposed model in improving emission reduction, operational flexibility, and planning robustness.</description></item><item><title>Constrained Semi-MDP Formulation and Perception-Enhanced Safe Policy Learning for Efficient Dynamic Task Scheduling of Data Centers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11236459</link><description>With the exponential growth of global data generation and the energy consumption of data centers (DCs), efficient dynamic task scheduling has become critical to optimize energy costs while ensuring the quality of the service. Model predictive control (MPC) method is burdened with significant computational complexity and exhibits limited uncertainty adaptability, heuristic methods overlook the energy cost optimization objective and may lead to sub-optimal schedules, while conventional reinforcement learning (RL) methods based on Markov decision processes (MDPs) face significant dimensionality challenge in discrete action spaces and struggle to satisfy the temporal-coupling task deadline constraints. This paper proposes a Constrained Semi-MDP (CSMDP) formulation for dynamic task scheduling considering heterogeneous tasks and servers. It introduces temporally-extended sub-actions executable across multiple sub-processes, omitting exhaustive search for appropriate task-server pair combinations. A dual-agent architecture involving a task selection agent and a server assignment agent are designed to work collaboratively to optimize energy costs while satisfying task deadlines and resource constraints. A safe RL method is proposed that employs a constraint-value network and a shielding mechanism for task selection and server assignment agents to enforce resource capacity and time-coupling deadline constraints, while jointly optimizing the latter with an action-value network to improve energy cost efficiency. Case studies based on Alibaba real production dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of scheduling policy optimality and safety, uncertainty generalization and computational efficiency, against state-of-the-art methods.</description></item><item><title>Electricity-Carbon Collaborative Optimization of Electrolytic Aluminum Load Considering Green Certificate-Carbon Trading and Demand Response</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11249460</link><description>Due to its large capacity and rapid adjustment capability, the electrolytic aluminum load (EAL) possesses significant potential for flexibility and can participate in demand response (DR) to alleviate peak regulation pressures on the power system. Within the frameworks of carbon emissions trading (CET), green-certificate trading (GCT), and renewable portfolio standards (RPS), the electricity-carbon benefits of the EAL acting as a multi-market participant are tightly coupled. Therefore, it is imperative to develop an electricity&#8211;carbon collaborative optimization strategy for EALs participating in DR. First, based on the dynamic carbon emission characteristics of EAL, a GCT-CET coupling model is constructed, and the ladder CET cost structure is enhanced to better characterize carbon trading expenses. Then, the production regulation model, regulation benefit model, and DR model are formulated for the EAL. Finally, considering the uncertainty of on-site photovoltaic (PV) generation, a stochastic electricity-carbon optimization model is proposed, incorporating GCT, CET, and DR, with the objective of maximizing the comprehensive net benefits. A real-plant case study demonstrates that the proposed model increases the EAL&#8217;s comprehensive net benefit while substantially reducing average energy consumption and total CEs. Sensitivity analyses with respect to the compensation price coefficient, carbon-quota auction ratio, and carbon-quota reduction ratio further verify robustness. Overall, the results indicate that electricity-carbon co-optimization enables EAL participation in DR to deliver both economic and environmental benefits.</description></item><item><title>An Easy-to-Hard Curriculum Learning Framework for Fast Production Cost Minimization Simulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11245207</link><description>The production cost minimization (PCM) problem in power systems involves numerous binary variables, resulting in prolonged solving times and a trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency, affecting the economic viability of operations. Our previous research has explored algorithmic enhancements using machine learning techniques to achieve optimal solutions while reducing solving times. However, as power systems evolve, new PCM models incorporating diverse factors emerge, each presenting varying levels of solving difficulty. Traditional supervised learning, commonly used in algorithmic enhancements, assumes that all training data from PCM problems with varying solving difficulties are provided to training model simultaneously. This limits further improvements in solving efficiency. To address this issue, this paper introduces an easy-to-hard curriculum learning (CL)-based imitation learning (IL) framework that progressively guides IL from simple PCM problems to more complex problems. The one-pass rule is employed to expedite the training process during the transition to more difficult PCM problems. Additionally, a difficulty-oriented component network selection mechanism is introduced to choose appropriate weight parameters for solving PCM problems, thereby enhancing performance on target tasks. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework can accelerate the training process and shows good performance on target tasks.</description></item><item><title>A Robust Singular Perturbation Method for Decoupling of Power and Voltage Control of Grid-Forming Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11245583</link><description>Grid-forming converters (GFMCs), which provide superior grid formulation and supportive services, have been identified as the enabler of more-electronics power systems. Control of GFMCs mainly comprises outer-power and inner-voltage loops. Although existing literature assumes that the two loops can be independently analyzed and designed, we reveal that the converter may be unstable even with two individually stabilized control loops, thereby implying their strong coupling effect. To realize the decoupling design of power and voltage control loops, we propose a robust singular perturbation method, which comprises a marriage of robust control and singular perturbation theory. Specifically, we construct the converter model as an interconnection of slow and fast subsystems, and derive two quantitative criteria regarding system stability and performance, respectively. Through the proposed method, we successfully quantify the coupling effects between the two loops at each frequency point, enabling the identification of the maximum coupling and the critical coupling frequency. Accordingly, we provide insightful guidelines for simplified controller design. The correctness of the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed decoupling method are validated by simulation and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Learning Active Constraints for Bilevel Optimization: Evaluating Classification Metrics on Real-World Distribution System Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11245557</link><description>Bilevel optimization provides a useful power system modeling framework, but it is computationally demanding due to its NP-hard nature and the need for frequent solutions under uncertainty. To mitigate this, machine learning can be used to predict active constraints, enabling the deduction of a reduced problem formulation. However, prediction errors are inevitable, and synthetic training data may not fully reflect real-world conditions. This paper presents a structured approach to managing uncertainty by classifying constraints into three sets &#8211; active, inactive, and unpredictable &#8211; where each constraint is modeled using a separate binary classifier. The method is applied to a real-world bilevel distribution system optimization problem: the upper level solves an AC Optimal Power Flow, while the lower level minimizes residential photovoltaic power curtailment. Training data are generated from daily exact bilevel solutions, incorporating variability in electricity prices, consumption, and photovoltaic power generation. Results show that the reduced formulation effectively solves the problem, up to 10 times faster with a marginal objective value deviation (&#8722;3% to + 4%).</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive Virtual Impedance-Based Closed-Loop Voltage Control Strategy for Smart Transformer-Interfacing Distribution Grid With High PV Penetration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11251011</link><description>The substantial increase of distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems in low-voltage distribution grids has resulted in an escalating problem of exceeding voltage upper limits due to reverse power flow. Numerous strategies have been suggested to address the issue of voltage violating the voltage upper limits. Nevertheless, the conventional approaches are essentially open-loop control methods and exhibit steady-state errors. In addition, unbalanced loads or single-phase PV can cause traditional methods to be ineffective. This article proposes an adaptive virtual impedance-based closed-loop voltage control strategy for smart transformer (ST)- interfacing distribution grid. Utilizing adaptive virtual impedance-based closed-loop control, ST can regulate the maximum bus voltage of the distribution grid at the voltage threshold without static error, hence enabling the control of other buses within the voltage threshold when reverse power flow occurs. Besides, as the proposed control strategy is implemented in the abc control coordinate system, it can still effectively regulate the maximum bus voltage at the voltage threshold in the presence of unbalanced loads or the sudden connection of single-phase PV systems. Furthermore, to ensure the stability of the system, impedance-based stability is analyzed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through simulation based upon real data of a radial distribution feeder and a simplified ST-interfacing distribution grid experiment.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Robust Chance-Constrained Optimization for Distribution Substation Restoration With Quickly Detachable Transformers and Mobile Emergency Storage Dispatch Under HEMP Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11270969</link><description>High Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) attacks can cause significant damage to substations in power distribution systems (DSs). In this paper, we propose a distributed robust model for the distribution substation restoration (DSR) with mobile emergency storage (MES) devices along with quickly detachable transformers (QDTs) to expedite DS load pickups under HEMP attacks. For substation restoration, we dissect the DSR problem into transportation and installation subproblems to replace faulty QDTs. Since DSR considers short-period transportation agents, a dynamic interval dispatching strategy in the continuous time domain is formulated for the coupled power-transportation system (PTS). Then, distributed robust chance-constraints are constructed under each dynamic dispatching time interval to address the travel time uncertainty during substation restoration. To support practical solutions, safe tractable approximation and binary extension methods are employed to transform the proposed PTS model into a mixed-integer second-order conic programming. Case studies on the modified IEEE 33-bus system and modified 141-bus system verify the effectiveness of the proposed model.</description></item><item><title>Leveraging DER Frequency Response for Enhanced Power System Resilience</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11275959</link><description>The growing presence of distributed energy resources (DERs) requires better orchestration between Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and Distribution System Operators (DSOs) for secure power system operation. While typically studied for reliability, the potential of TSO-DSO energy exchange to improve resilience during extreme events needs more research. Moreover, existing studies focus on leveraging DER flexibility to enhance distribution system resilience. This paper introduces a novel framework that evaluates the impact of DER flexibility on overall system resilience, considering the spatial progression of hazard events across both transmission and distribution networks. The framework encompasses spatiotemporal modeling of hazard scenarios and dynamic analyses to assess contributions of TSO-DSO energy exchange to resilience enhancement, using metrics such as frequency settling time and unserved load. Application of this framework to a 39-node system, representing both transmission and distribution (T&amp;amp;D) network, reveals that DER flexibility can significantly reduce frequency settling time &#8211; by up to 47% in high-inertia systems and over 65% in low-inertia systems &#8211; highlighting the impact of DERs on the rapid restoration of power balance and the prevention of widespread blackouts. Simultaneously, the unserved load is reduced by approximately 52.49% in high-inertia systems and 39.67% in low-inertia systems.</description></item><item><title>Spatial Flexibility Provision From Geographically Dispersed Data Centers Enabling Coordinated Operation of Multi-Local Flexibility Markets</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11316215</link><description>In local flexibility markets (LFMs), distribution system operators (DSOs) can obtain flexibility from distributed energy resource aggregators (DERAs) to address operation problems of distribution systems (DSs). However, in a single LFM, the supply and demand of flexibility may not be balanced, leading DSOs to face significant economic challenges. In this paper, leveraging the geographically coupled flexibility (GCF) provided by geographically dispersed data centers (DCs), a coordinated operation framework for multi-LFMs is proposed. This framework enables wireless connections between multi- LFMs without geographical limitations, only requiring interactions between DSOs and their local DC. To clear the multi-LFMs, an optimization model is established with the objective of minimizing total operation costs of multi-LFMs. The optimization model is solved by ADMM to protect the data privacy. A settlement method for GCF is proposed to allocate the total cost fairly. Furthermore, the uncertain parameters are addressed using distributionally robust chance constraints based on Wasserstein metric. Three DCs, which are connected to three DSs adapted from IEEE 15-bus, 33-bus, and 69-bus DSs, respectively, are used in case studies. The results demonstrate that the GCF enables effective integration and utilization of DERAs&#8217; flexibility across the three LFMs, facilitating the balance between flexibility supply and demand.</description></item><item><title>An Incipient Fault Location Scheme Utilizing Synchronous Waveform Measurements in Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11264013</link><description>Incipient faults frequently occur in underground cables due to the widespread aging of power distribution infrastructure. These faults are self-clearing with short duration, posing significant challenges for accurately pinpointing their locations. This paper proposes a novel incipient fault location scheme for medium-voltage underground distribution systems in North America, leveraging synchronized waveform measurement units (WMUs). Initially, zero-sequence fault voltage models at the fault point are derived from upstream and downstream WMU measurements, incorporating system topology and parameters. Utilizing these zero-sequence fault voltage models, a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) framework is developed to estimate the fault distance for each line segment, with a whitening process applied to mitigate the effects of correlated noise. Subsequently, a candidate fault line segment is identified for each path from the substation to the end of each branch. Finally, the fault location is pinpointed within one of the candidate fault line segments, using the corresponding fault distance estimation result and the depth between the substation and candidate fault line segments, along with a truncated mean square error (MSE). The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated in PSCAD/EMTDC based on the IEEE 33-Bus and 123-Bus Test Feeders with various fault types, parameters and locations.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a distribution locational marginal price (DLMP) based congestion management method, utilizing differentiated congestion prices to incentivize EV aggregators (EVAs) to actively adjust charging patterns, thereby mitigating network congestion. In this model, an improved power flow method based on continuous implicit linearization is employed, which integrates network loss modeling and dynamically updates the linearization point, thus guaranteeing the accuracy of power flow approximation and price signal calculation. Moreover, both the uncertainty of EVA parameters and its impact on the safety constraints of the grid are characterized by robust ambiguity sets within the congestion management model, ensuring the reliability of the proposed pricing mechanism in guiding EV charging behavior in uncertain environments. Furthermore, a two-layer iterative algorithm is designed to facilitate bidirectional coordination between the distribution system operator (DSO) and EVAs. The outer layer updates network-related coefficient matrices to improve accuracy in grid state estimation, while the inner layer uses the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to iteratively adjust DLMPs while preserving the privacy of EVAs. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method can incentivize EV charging pattern adaptation and effectively relieve network congestion.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-View Multi-Timescale Hypergraph-Empowered Spatiotemporal Framework for EV Charging Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11251047</link><description>Accurate electric vehicle (EV) charging demand forecasting is essential for stable grid operation and proactive EV participation in electricity market. Existing forecasting methods, particularly those based on graph neural networks, are often limited to modeling pairwise relationships between stations, failing to capture the complex, group-wise dynamics inherent in urban charging networks. To address this gap, we develop a novel forecasting framework namely HyperCast, leveraging the expressive power of hypergraphs to model the higher-order spatiotemporal dependencies hidden in EV charging patterns. HyperCast integrates multi-view hypergraphs, which capture both static geographical proximity and dynamic demand-based functional similarities, along with multi-timescale inputs to differentiate between recent trends and weekly periodicities. The framework employs specialized hyper-spatiotemporal blocks and tailored cross-attention mechanisms to effectively fuse information from these diverse sources: views and timescales. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that HyperCast significantly outperforms a wide array of state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of explicitly modeling collective charging behaviors for more accurate forecasting.</description></item><item><title>A Differentially Private Energy Trading Mechanism Approaching Social Optimum</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11224496</link><description>This paper proposes a differentially private energy trading mechanism for prosumers in peer-to-peer (P2P) markets, offering provable privacy guarantees while approaching the Nash equilibrium with nearly socially optimal efficiency. We first model the P2P energy trading as a (generalized) Nash game and prove the vulnerability of traditional distributed algorithms to privacy attacks through an adversarial inference model. To address this challenge, we develop a privacy-preserving Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm incorporating carefully calibrated Laplacian noise. We prove that the proposed algorithm achieves  $\epsilon $ -differential privacy while converging in expectation to the Nash equilibrium with a suitable step size. Numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the algorithm&#8217;s robustness against privacy attacks, convergence behavior, and optimality compared to the non-private solution. Results demonstrate that our mechanism effectively protects prosumers&#8217; sensitive information while maintaining near-optimal market outcomes, offering a practical approach for privacy-preserving coordination in P2P markets.</description></item><item><title>Targeted Adversarial Poisoning Attack Against Robust Aggregation in Federated Learning for Smart Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11227121</link><description>Federated learning has been widely adopted as an intelligent computing method to leverage the power of distributed data without compromising data privacy and security, especially in smart grids. Poisoning attack is one of the common attacks against federated learning to degrade the performance of the global model or cause it to make specific, incorrect predictions. To counter these threats, secure aggregation rules have been implemented to reduce the impact of adversarial or malicious updates during training process. In this paper, we first propose a norm-based aggregation rule specifically designed to mitigate the effects of poisoning attacks within federated learning systems used for power quality classification. Subsequently, we introduce the Targeted Adversarial Poisoning Attack (TAPA), a method that aims to break the secure aggregation rule by causing the global model to misclassify a specific targeted class as another chosen class with increased success. This attack method employs a generative approach to produce extra fake data and trains a malicious model whose parameter norms closely resemble those of standard local models, thereby increasing the likelihood of these updates surviving the filtering processes of secure aggregation rules. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed TAPA method can achieve a higher poisoning attack success rate while preserving the classification accuracies of non-targeted classes, even in the presence of unbalanced data distributions. This approach underscores the potential vulnerabilities in existing secure aggregation mechanisms and highlights the need for robust defenses against sophisticated poisoning strategies in federated learning environments.</description></item><item><title>Distribution System Reconfiguration to Mitigate Load Altering Attacks via Stackelberg Games</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11227003</link><description>The widespread integration of IoT-controllable devices (e.g., smart EV charging stations and heat pumps) into modern power systems enhances capabilities but introduces critical cybersecurity risks. Specifically, these devices are susceptible to load-altering attacks (LAAs) that can compromise power system safety. This paper quantifies the impact of LAAs on nodal voltage constraint violations in distribution networks (DNs). We first present closed-form expressions to analytically characterize LAA effects and quantify the minimum number of compromised devices for a successful LAA. Based on these insights, we propose a reactive defense mechanism that mitigates LAAs through DN reconfiguration. To address strategic adversaries, we then formulate defense strategies using a non-cooperative sequential game, which models the knowledgeable and strategic attacker, accounting for the worst-case scenario and enabling the reactive defender to devise an efficient and robust defense. Further, our formulation also accounts for uncertainties in attack localization. A novel Bayesian optimization approach is introduced to compute the Stackelberg equilibrium, significantly reducing computational burden efficiently. The game-theoretic strategy effectively mitigates the attack&#8217;s impact while ensuring minimal system reconfiguration.</description></item><item><title>Generative AI-Enhanced Real-Time Anomaly Detection in Integrated Energy Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11232457</link><description>The integration of Integrated Energy Systems (IES) with main power grids is vital for enhancing the efficiency, security, and resilience of modern energy systems. However, this increased interconnectivity among energy sources, smart grids, and digital monitoring systems also exposes IES to significant cyber threats. To mitigate these risks, we have developed a framework for real-time, AI-assisted monitoring and anomaly detection, leveraging generative AI models to monitor interconnected IES within the main grid. This paper presents a Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)-based prediction and anomaly detection system, specifically leveraging the Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), for secure monitoring of grid-connected IES. Our approach combines the generator&#8217;s predictive capabilities with the discriminator&#8217;s scoring mechanism to enhance anomaly detection and overall model accuracy. This allows the system to forecast the control system&#8217;s future response and detect anomalies before they manifest in real-time data. The effectiveness of this framework is assessed using an interconnected IES to the IEEE 118-bus test network. The pre-trained model is subjected to diverse attack scenarios, and experimental results consistently demonstrate its capability to identify the probability of anomalies within the IES efficiently.</description></item><item><title>Reputation Attack Detection-Based Resilient Distributed Energy Management of Cyber-Physical Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11245598</link><description>Due to potential cyber attack, it brings a great challenge for energy management of micro-grid. To address these problems, a reputation-detection-based resilient distributed energy management approach is proposed. To well detect false data injection (FDI) and denial of service (DoS) attacks, this paper presents a reputation mechanism to detect the potential cyber attack combined with acknowledgment (ACK) signal by evaluation index from its neighbor nodes. Those identified adversarial nodes can be compensated with coordinated information from high-reputation nodes. To fight against those cyber attacks, a resilient distributed optimization approach is proposed with event-triggered mechanism, which corrects those adversarial nodes with a compensation mechanism, which can ensure the convergence even under both FDI and DoS attack. According to those simulation results, it reveals that the proposed approach can converge well under both FDI and DoS attack, which can provide a promising viable approach for security-based energy management of cyber-physical micro-grid.</description></item><item><title>Generating Synthetic Net Load Data for Residential Customers With Physics-Informed Diffusion Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11245631</link><description>This paper presents a novel physics-informed diffusion model for generating synthetic net load data for residential customers, addressing the challenges of data scarcity and privacy concerns. The proposed framework embeds physical models within denoising networks, offering a versatile approach that can be readily generalized to unforeseen scenarios. A conditional denoising neural network is designed to jointly train the parameters of the transition kernel of the diffusion model and the parameters of the physics-informed function. Utilizing the real-world smart meter data from Pecan Street, we validate the proposed method and conduct a thorough numerical study comparing its performance with state-of-the-art generative models, including generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, normalizing flows, and a well-calibrated baseline diffusion model. A comprehensive set of evaluation metrics is used to assess the accuracy and diversity of the generated synthetic net load data. The numerical study results demonstrate that the proposed physics-informed diffusion model outperforms state-of-the-art models across all quantitative metrics, yielding at least 20% improvement. To justify the practical value of synthetic data, we show that the synthetic net load data generated by our proposed model yields superior results than the benchmark models using power flow and dynamic hosting capacity analysis.</description></item><item><title>Redesigning the Decoder and Loss Function of Diffusion Transformer for PV Temporal Simulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11224017</link><description>Photovoltaic (PV) temporal simulation is a core technology for PV planning analysis.

Existing methods are limited by coarse-resolution weather data and insufficient modeling of spatiotemporal dependencies. We propose a novel framework that combines bias-corrected high-resolution weather data with an Adaptive Fourier Graph Neural Network (PV-AFGNN) to capture complex spatial and temporal patterns. A Gated recurrent unit (GRU)-based encoder-decoder module refines Numerical Weather Prediction forecasts using local meteorological data, generating site-specific inputs for PV-AFGNN, which operates in the Fourier domain to model correlations efficiently. By jointly optimizing weather data correction and spatiotemporal learning, the framework achieves high accuracy even under challenging forecasting scenarios. Experiments on real-world multi-site PV datasets show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, offering a scalable and robust solution for reliable energy scheduling, and enhanced integration of PV power into modern electricity systems.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Preserving Residential Short-Term Load Forecasting With Missing Data Tolerance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11262200</link><description>Traditional data-driven residential short-term load forecasting methods are faced with two major challenges, i.e., preserving data privacy and addressing missing data. Regarding privacy-preserving, a new two-stage pre-training personalized federated learning framework is proposed to train customized forecasting models with high forecasting accuracy for all households without violating their data privacy. As for the missing data problem, an advanced semi-supervised graph diffusion network model is proposed to address missing &#8220;features&#8221; and &#8220;labels&#8221; problems, where &#8220;features&#8221; and &#8220;labels&#8221; refer to the required input data of the forecasting model and actual load data of the forecasting day, respectively. Mathematically, a graph feature diffusion mechanism-based feature input and imputation module is developed to mitigate the deficiency imposed by missing &#8220;features&#8221;. Next, a graph convolutional network-based semi-supervised feature augmented and update module is established to mitigate the negative effects of missing &#8220;labels&#8221;.

However, existing models struggle with scenarios where only aggregate power sequences are available in the target domain without any individual appliance labels for fine-tuning (i.e., zero-shot), which causes significant performance degradation and limits their practical applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model named contrastive learning-based multiscale dual-path temporal fusion network (CL-MDTFN). CL-MDTFN integrates an energy-aware subsampling embedding block for multiscale feature extraction and a residual power decoupling block for capturing both fine-grained transient activities and overarching load trends. By leveraging the autocorrelation contrastive loss, CL-MDTFN effectively learns the long-term variations of the signals, enabling accurate load disaggregation in unlabeled households. Experiments on U.K.-DALE and REDD demonstrate that CL-MDTFN outperforms existing NILM models in fully labeled and unlabeled scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Preserving Tensor Decomposition Personalized Federated Learning for Ultra-Short-Term Load Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11251317</link><description>Accurate ultra-short-term load forecasting is crucial for the optimal scheduling and efficient operation of power systems. Traditional centralized collaborative modeling methods rely on cross-domain data aggregation, which poses significant data security risks. Meanwhile, existing federated learning approaches suffer from slow global model convergence and high communication costs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving tensor decomposition-based personalized federated learning method (PP-TDPFed) for ultra-short-term load forecasting. First, a novel tensorized local model is designed using tensor decomposition techniques to reduce communication costs. Second, a dual-layer loss function is introduced to decouple the personalized model from the tensorized local model by controlling the distance between them, enabling personalized optimization. Finally, leveraging the tensorized characteristics of model parameters, an efficient distributed learning algorithm and an aggregating composed tensor strategy are developed to enable global model aggregation and updating. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, the proposed method demonstrates superior robustness and generalization capability while achieving rapid convergence. It effectively reduces communication costs during training and enhances the stability of ultra-short-term load forecasting.</description></item><item><title>High-Risk Lines Identification Under Manipulation of Demand Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11298508</link><description>Manipulation of Demand (MAD) attacks leverage compromised high-wattage IoT devices on the public Internet to generate abnormal loads, thereby inducing severe transmission line overloads, effectively bypassing deployed cyber defense mechanisms for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems in the private network.

However, current methods face three limitations like reliance on manual similarity measures, high computational costs, and inflexibility to new load profiles. To address these challenges, this letter proposes a large-scale anchor graph-based subspace clustering method for residential load profiling. Specifically, the distance matrix is directly learned from the load profile through subspace clustering to handle high-dimensional data and uncover hidden load patterns. Then, an anchor graph is constructed to capture the intrinsic structure of the learned subspace, which can effectively reduce the computational complexity. Finally, k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is adopted to assign labels to new load profiles based on selected anchor points, eliminating the need for re-clustering the entire dataset.

Multiple UAV owners participate and collaboratively offer UaaS to the end-users. In the process, a UAV with limited resources offloads the task to other UAVs with adequate resources. However, not all the UAVs are trustworthy to offload the task. In such a case, we need to evaluate the trust of those UAVs to whom another UAV wishes to offload the task. The proposed trust evaluation scheme, TOFU, consists of three components &#8211; (i) residual energy, (ii) data transmission rate, and (iii) reputation of a UAV. The residual energy and data transmission are the pre-determined components retrieved directly. On the other hand, we need to compute the reputation of a UAV specific to the UaaS environment. We consider the resources available with a UAV to determine its initial reputation. Further, we apply the debit-credit system to compute the reputation value. When a UAV offloads a task, its reputation is debited from its total reputation. On the other hand, the reputation is credited to that UAV to which the task is offloaded. We apply a reputation transfer-based bargaining game while prioritizing the UAVs with higher capability. In particular, we adopt Rubinstein bargaining model to evaluate the trust of the UAVs and design an incentivized offloading mechanism. We use the concept of Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE) to decide an optimal amount of reputation to be transferred between two UAVs. The game is modeled in a way that encourages UAVs with lower reputations to participate in the game by making them more patient so that they can negotiate for higher fractions of reputation. Simulation results show that TOFU reduces delay and energy consumption per task by up to 1.74% and 2%, respectively. Additionally, TOFU reduces task failure rate by approximately 9% as compared to the traditional approaches such as DeTTO, DPTO, and SOA, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Path Tracking Control Method With Trailer Additional Yaw-Moment Control for Semi-Trailer Trucks on High-Curvature Paths</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11150472</link><description>This paper proposes an innovative path tracking control method with trailer additional yaw-moment control for semi-trailer trucks on high-curvature paths.

The validity of the proposed method is evaluated by a hardware-in-the-loop platform, where the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is more effective and robust than the existing baseline control methods.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing User Experience and Energy Efficiency in Metaverse Play to Earn Games via Mobile Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11146578</link><description>The burgeoning interest in the Metaverse has captured the attention of both academic and commercial sectors, largely due to the decentralization of the security and authenticity of digital assets. This has notably accelerated the popularity of play-to-earn (P2E) games, where participants can earn and own digital assets that are exchangeable for real-world currencies. These games, however, are computationally demanding and often not feasible on devices with limited resources, necessitating computational offloading to edge servers. Through mobile edge computing (MEC), data can be processed on Metaverse Service Provider (MSP) edge servers. A key challenge arises in balancing the latency perceived by users, which can affect gameplay, the visual experience that impacts potential earnings, and the energy consumption of user devices. Lowering the resolution of downlink transmissions can reduce latency but also diminishes visual quality, consequently affecting user earnings. To address these challenges, our research introduces a comprehensive multi-objective optimization framework that incorporates latency, visual quality, and energy consumption for Metaverse-based mobile augmented reality (MAR) games. Given the NP-hardness of this optimization challenge, we offer simple yet effective optimization algorithms to mitigate the trade-offs between delay and financial returns. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed methodology effectively balances perceived latency, visual quality, and energy consumption, thereby enhancing both the user experience and the sustainability of Metaverse-based MAR systems.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Caching-Assisted Inter-Satellite Cooperative Computation Offloading in LEO Satellite Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11144472</link><description>Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite edge computing network (LSECN) can complement the advantages of terrestrial networks and provide users with ubiquitous services. Currently, the majority of research on task software caching primarily concentrates on statically caching data at the network edge. However, in reality, user requests are time-varying, which makes it difficult to maintain high reusability. Therefore, this paper considers dynamic caching of task software in the mobile edge computing (MEC) servers to assist users in processing tasks. Tasks can be processed locally or offloaded to the LSECN to achieve on-board load balancing through inter-satellite cooperation. Specifically, considering the limited caching size and computing capabilities of MEC servers and the time-varying task requirements of users, a joint task software caching update and computation offloading problem is constructed to minimize the system cost, defined as the weighted sum of system delay and energy consumption, while ensuring resource constraints. To solve the above problem, we propose a computation offloading strategy and caching scheme based on twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm, which significantly reduces the system cost and has excellent convergence performance.</description></item><item><title>Performance Enhancement for CNN-Based Classification of Low Probability of Intercept Radar Signals With Pulse Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11145921</link><description>In electronic warfare, technologies that accurately detect the adversary's location and signal characteristics to execute precise strikes or effectively jam signals are crucial assets. To meet these capabilities, low probability of intercept (LPI) radars are employed, which transmit low-power signals and utilize various modulation techniques to minimize the probability of signal detection. Previous studies presented an approach for classifying LPI radar waveforms using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with time-frequency images (TFIs). Even though they have shown higher identification performance than that of the conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques, they did not consider the inherent characteristics of radar systems, such as repetitive pulse transmissions and the interceptor's limited knowledge of the start of pulses. Motivated by the limitations, this paper proposes a framework that converts multiple intercepted signals into images and extracts multiple features through a CNN to improve the classification performance with a more realistic LPI dataset constructed under timing errors. To validate the performance of the proposed framework, we consider various CNNs with different combinations of feature extraction methods and backbone networks. We provide a quantitative analysis of the advantage of pulse integration. Furthermore, the experimental results clearly demonstrated that the proposed framework achieved a 18.2% accuracy improvement at $-10$ dB and a 26% improvement at $-12$ dB, compared to the conventional scheme without pulse integration.</description></item><item><title>On the Terminal Location Uncertainty in Elliptical Footprints: Application in Air-to-Ground Links</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11150748</link><description>Wireless transmitters (Txs) that radiate downward in a direction often generate circular footprints on the ground. The configurational flexibility of these footprints is inherently limited as coverage adjustments are restricted to variations in radius, the only parameter available for tuning. This simplification is inadequate for scenarios that require asymmetric coverage, extended service areas, or dynamic footprint adaptation due to antenna tilt or changes in altitude of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In specific scenarios, the use of elliptical cells can offer increased flexibility for providing user coverage due to unique network characteristics. For example, an elliptical footprint can be produced when a practical directional antenna with unequal azimuth and elevation half-power beamwidths is used in high-speed railway networks. Another common scenario involves the production of an elliptical footprint when an airborne Tx radiates at an angle by tilting its directional antenna by a few degrees. This paper aims to investigate for the first time the association between the random location of the user within an elliptical coverage area and the performance of a wireless communication link considering these scenarios. We assume a UAV as a Tx, although a tall cellular base station tower could also be employed without losing generality. To gain a deeper understanding of the impact of random location, we derive the relevant distance and signal-to-noise ratio metrics and examine the outage probability for a single-user link, as well as the throughput in a multiuser scenario. This analysis accounts for both random terminal locations and fading impairments in both cases. The findings provide valuable insights into the performance of comparable wireless systems.</description></item><item><title>Channel-Adaptive Privacy Enhancement for NOMA-Based Antagonistic Overlay Cognitive Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11153544</link><description>Overlay cognitive networks based on non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can introduce substantial privacy concerns, especially in antagonistic systems where primary and secondary networks lack mutual trust. This paper highlights two critical privacy challenges and investigates a NOMA-assisted purely antagonistic overlay cognitive network. As part of our privacy design, we propose a Channel-Adaptive Dual-Phase Cooperative Jamming (CADP-CJ) strategy, leveraging reverse successive interference cancellation and a dynamic top-down power allocation approach based on the available channel-state information. The ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) for both single-user and multi-user scenarios is derived in closed form by means of Taylor-McLaurin expansions and Gaussian-Chebyshev quadrature, while considering Nakagami-$m$ fading across all channels. Furthermore, the closed-form expressions for the asymptotic ESR are presented to provide deeper insights. The accuracy of our analytical results is corroborated through Monte-Carlo simulations, which also confirm that our scheme ensures a positive ESR in both single and multi-user cases. We comprehensively analyze the impact of the fading properties of the channels involved and comment on optimal jamming power using the CADP-CJ strategy. Notably, our proposed system outperforms benchmark systems, particularly those based on orthogonal multiple access, with an 86% enhancement for primary users and 64% for secondary users.</description></item><item><title>Covert Communication in Multi-User ISAC Systems: Joint Beamforming and Jamming Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11153710</link><description>This paper investigates covert communication in multi-user integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where a base station (BS) detects target and secretly transmits confidential signals to multiple users under the surveillance of an adversarial warden (Willie), and a mobile friendly jammer is deployed to transmit jamming signals to enhance covertness. The closed-form expression of Willie's detection error probability (DEP) is derived as a metric of covertness performance, and the joint beamforming and jamming power optimization problem is formulated to balance sensing performance and average covert transmission rate. Considering both perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) scenarios, a two-step algorithm composed of Rayleigh quotient derivation and successive convex approximation (SCA) is proposed to solve the non-convex multi-variable problem. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical analysis, and demonstrate the benefits of a jammer to the covertness of the ISAC system compared with max ratio transmission (MRT) and zero-forcing (ZF) methods.</description></item><item><title>Model Lightweight Strategy Under Federated Edge Learning Framework</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11146606</link><description>Mobile communication devices such as mobile phones and autonomous driving in car systems are ubiquitous.The energy and computing power of existing mobile devices are limited. The energy consumption of local training in federated learning is significant. To reduce computational energy consumption, we propose a lightweight federated edge learning framework for client models. We attempted to extract a small model suitable for execution on mobile devices from a large federated global model trained on edge servers. Directly training the small model would involve multiple transmissions of local models, leading to a shift of energy consumption from computation to communication. We aim to transfer more computation to edge servers. To this end, we design a pseudo vector compression method to reduce data transmission energy consumption. The framework enables most model training to be moved to edge servers while also ensuring the accuracy and reducing the energy consumption of client models. In addition, we prune and adjust the model parameters of the lightweight model to make it more personalized. We also provided a convergence analysis of our algorithm and proved that our algorithm is convergent. The experimental results indicate that our proposed framework and algorithm not only reduce computational costs of mobile devices but also ensure the availability of local lightweight models.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Computing and Multicasting Optimization for Live 360-Degree Video Streaming</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11146920</link><description>Virtual reality (VR) technology is widely employed across various domains, with its applications expanding as Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies advance, bringing new scenarios and functionalities to 360-degree video streaming. However, these applications impose substantial demands on computational power and communication capacity, along with increased sensitivity to computation and transmission delay. In this paper, we propose a joint optimization scheme of computing and multicasting for 360-degree video in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) networks to maximize the long-term Quality of Experience (QoE) of multiple users. We solve the computing and multicasting optimization problem separately by dividing it into adaptive grouping and resource optimization subproblems. By implementing adaptive grouping, we reduce redundant computation and transmission, thereby improving the efficiency of limited resource utilization. We propose a Cooperative Bargaining Game (CBG)-based resource allocation algorithm for efficient resource management and a Lyapunov optimization-based bitrate adaptation algorithm for long-term performance optimization, enhancing users' QoE while minimizing playback freezing. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in multi-user long-term QoE, average bitrate, and reduced rebuffering time, underscoring the effectiveness of our scheme in demanding scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Mobile Edge Computing Based Intelligent Charging Strategy for Electric Vehicles in Cyber Physical Energy System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11146906</link><description>The development of intelligent transportation systems has promoted the application of wireless technology in vehicular communication networks and mobile services. At the same time, electric vehicles are popular due to their environmental-friendliness and cost-saving characteristics. However, charging of electric vehicles without proper and real-time rules may cause serious traffic congestion and high expense, which results in unnecessary charging stations and wasted power generation with high carbon emission. Therefore, it is crucial to design an efficient charging strategy for electric vehicles without causing road congestion, together with an economic dispatch strategy to offer proper power generation and decarbonization. In this paper, we introduce mobile edge computing architecture to enhance real-time response capabilities through edge device positioning data. This approach allows charging strategies to swiftly adapt to varying road conditions and user demands, effectively mitigating traffic congestion. Regarding the forecasting of load demand for charging stations, this paper employs a deep learning model based on informer and deploys it on edge servers, quickly providing accurate demand predictions for economic dispatching and enhancing the precision of scheduling strategies. With the application of deep reinforcement learning models, the system can formulate efficient charging plans based on real-time user data, improving user satisfaction and quality of services. Numerical results show the efficiency of the obtained strategies for electric vehicles charging and power economic dispatching, and the two-stage modeling approach significantly improves the convergence of the model and the quality of the solution.</description></item><item><title>Computation Offloading for Distributed Learning in Vehicular Networks: A Service Scheduling and Resource Allocation Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11150601</link><description>Distributed machine learning has attracted significant attention for the future vehicular networks. However, the inadequate computation capacity of multi-vehicles and the dynamic wireless communication environment degrade the training effectiveness of distributed models. Against these backdrops, a novel end-edge-cloud collaborative computation offloading for distributed learning paradigm is proposed in this paper. In order to minimize the weighted sum cost of latency and learning loss, we jointly optimize the offloading decisions for access selection and the proportion of data offloading, as well as the resource allocation strategy for bandwidth and transmit power. Wherein, the straggler effect is addressed by formulating a dynamic short timescale problem based on service fairness and a combinatorial iterative approach is suggested to resolve this min-max problem. Then, over the long timescale, the modified multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm based on multiple base stations and users is developed to overcome the dilemma of the missing explicit relationship between optimization variables and learning loss function. Moreover, a fractional programming (FP) based MARL algorithm is designed to solve this NP-hard issue. Simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed FP-MARL algorithm in comparison to the benchmark schemes.</description></item><item><title>QoE-Aware User Allocation in NOMA-Enabled MEC Systems: A Distributed Game-Theoretical Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11154945</link><description>In vehicular networks, mobile edge computing (MEC) allows service providers to allocate vehicle terminals (VTs) to edge servers, providing an effective paradigm for low latency computing services. In resources-limited edge computing scenarios, user allocation needs to achieve the goals of minimizing deployment costs and maximizing coverage density while ensuring service quality. However, the differentiated configuration of user power in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology can cause intra-cell and inter-cell interference within the same frequency band, resulting in a significant decrease in transmission rate and a reduction in Quality of Experience (QoE). In this paper, we study the QoE-aware user and power allocation (QUPA) problem with multiple users in a NOMA-enabled MEC system aimed at maximizing users' QoE. We formulate this problem as a QUPA game and theoretically analyze its properties. To achieve the Nash equilibrium for each user, we propose a distributed game-theoretical user and power allocation (GUPA) algorithm that jointly optimizes server selection, channel selection, and transmission power allocation. Meanwhile, we theoretically analyze the convergence and performance by price of anarchy (PoA) of our GUPA algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed GUPA algorithm can effectively reduce costs and improve user experience in this system.</description></item><item><title>Secrecy Rate Maximization for Coupled Phase-Shift STAR-RIS-Assisted ISAC Networks Under Dual Eavesdropping Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11144762</link><description>This article investigates a secure coupled phase-shift simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) network, where a base station (BS) utilizes the STAR-RIS to enable simultaneous communication with a user and target detection on opposite sides, while the transmitted signals are exposed to interception by communication and sensing eavesdroppers. We aim to maximize the secrecy rate of the communication user by jointly optimizing the BS beamforming and the STAR-RIS transmission and reflection coefficients, while ensuring the constraints on BS power, coupled STAR-RIS transmission and reflection coefficients, sensing performance, and sensing security. To tackle the non-convex problem, we propose an optimization algorithm that combines successive convex approximation (SCA) and penalty dual decomposition (PDD). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves superior performance compared to the benchmarks.</description></item><item><title>DRL-Based Energy Harvesting for RIS-Assisted Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems With Electromagnetic Interference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11146925</link><description>Electromagnetic interference (EMI) poses a significant negative impact on reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted communications. In contrast, in this correspondence, we harness EMI for energy harvesting (EH) in RIS-assisted cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems. The proposed scheme achieves energy-efficient RISs by employing a dynamic time-division strategy to split the time into transmission and EH phases. It promotes environmentally sustainable communication by efficiently harnessing the power of EMI and access points (APs). Specifically, we jointly optimize the precoding of APs, the phase shifts of RISs, and transmission time scheduling to maximize EH while satisfying the required quality of service (QoS) for users. Due to the non-convex and non-linear nature of the problem, arising from the intricate coupling of optimization variables, a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm based on the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) is proposed for robust system performance. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed scheme effectively reduces the negative effects of EMI and optimally utilizes the power of EMI, especially in scenarios with severe EMI.</description></item><item><title>Artificial Noise With Network Coding for Securing NOMA-Assisted Cooperative Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11150600</link><description>We investigate security-reliability tradeoff (SRT) for a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-aided cooperative network, where an internal untrusted far user (UFU) intercepts transmission from source to trusted near user (TNU), and an external eavesdropper (Eve) overhears transmission from source to UFU and TNU. To prevent eavesdropping, an artificial noise (AN)-aided network coding (ANANC) scheme is presented and exact expressions of outage probabilities (OPs), intercept probabilities (IPs), and transmission secrecy outage probabilities (TSOPs) are derived for NOMA users. For comparison, the simulation results of AN without network coding (ANWNC) scheme and non-AN (NAN) scheme are presented. Numerical results show that: 1) the IPs of TNU by the ANANC scheme is lower than that by the ANWNC and NAN schemes slightly deteriorating OP; 2) UFU by the ANANC, ANWNC, and NAN schemes achieves almost the same OP and NAN scheme performs the worst IP performance; 3) SRT of TNU by the ANANC scheme is superior to ANWNC and NAN schemes without damaging SRT for UFU compared to the ANWNC scheme but being better than that of the NAN scheme; 4) secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) of TNU by the ANANC scheme performs better than that of the ANWNC and NAN schemes but has a negligible impact on UFU in a high transmit power region, while both NOMA users have comparable SEE to ANWNC and NAN schemes in a low transmit power region.</description></item><item><title>Performance Analysis of Sub-Nyquist Wideband Spectrum Sensing Over Fading Channels</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11150720</link><description>This paper studies the performance of wideband spectrum sensing (WBSS) with sub-Nyquist sampling in cognitive networks. Considering the limitations posed by expensive and power-hungry analog-to-digital converters for Nyquist sampling approaches and high-computational complexity for compressed sensing approaches, this paper focuses on performing WBSS directly from aliased subbands with limited samples in a cost-effective and computationally efficient manner, and understanding the relationship between downsampling rates and sensing performance. To address the aliasing effect caused by sub-Nyquist sampling, bin detection is used to evaluate the channel occupancy. Moreover, the sensing performance is analyzed over fading channels in terms of probabilities of miss detection, false alarm, insufficient spectrum opportunity, and excessive interference opportunity. The results show that sub-Nyquist sampling can achieve WBSS without full spectrum recovery, thus reducing the sensing overhead and computational complexity.</description></item><item><title>Exploiting Polarization Domain of the IOS for Enhanced Full-Dimensional Transmission</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11164485</link><description>Intelligent omni-surface (IOS), capable of providing service coverage to mobile users (MUs) in a reflective and refractive manner, has recently attracted widespread attention. However, the performance of power-domain IOS-assisted systems is limited by the intimate coupling between the refraction and reflection behavior of IOS elements. In this paper, we introduce the concept of dual-polarized IOS-assisted communication to overcome this challenge. By employing the polarization domain in the design of IOS, full independent refraction and reflection modes can be delivered. We consider a downlink dual-polarized IOS-aided system while also accounting for the leakage between different polarizations. To maximize the sum rate, we formulated a joint base station (BS) digital and IOS analog beamforming problem and proposed an iterative algorithm to solve the non-convex program. Simulation results validate that dual-polarized IOS significantly enhances the performance than that of the power-domain one.</description></item><item><title>STAR-RIS Assisted Hybrid Far- and Near-Field SWIPT</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11143906</link><description>A simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) assisted hybrid far- and near-field (HFNF) simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) framework is proposed, where the energy users are located in the near-field region while the information users are located in the far-field region. The weighted harvested power of near-field energy users is maximized by jointly optimizing the active beamforming of base station (BS) and the passive beamforming of STAR-RIS, subject to the communication quality of far-field communication users. To solve this non-convex problem, a two-layer penalty-based algorithm is proposed. For the inner layer, the concave-convex procedure (CCCP) technique is invoked to address non-convex difference-of-convex (DC) expressions. For the outer layer, the penalized approach is used to guarantee the rank-1 solution. Numerical results show that: 1) the proposed algorithm achieves significant energy harvesting enhancement; 2) the STAR-RIS outperforms both reflecting-only and transmitting-only RIS; and 3) in contrast to far-field beamformers, near-field beamformers enable energy to be concentrated directly around energy users, thereby improving energy harvesting performance.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Dense Base Station Deployment for Resilient Communication Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11145914</link><description>Communication networks are of critical importance to modern societies. However, they are often susceptible to disruption due to natural disasters, which can have significant economic and social impacts. In order, to mitigate the aforementioned impacts, a novel spatio-temporal risk-based optimization framework for designing disaster-resilient communication networks is introduced. This framework addresses both cost-effectiveness and risk minimization in a unified manner. The effects of physical damage, power disruption, and recovery dynamics on the outage probability over time are incorporated into a dual-objective optimization model. A key innovation is the incorporation of spatial heterogeneity, which enables region-specific base station density allocation that reflect spatial variations in seismic intensity. The proposed framework, which utilizes a convex optimization strategy and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, achieves optimal resource allocation while satisfying cost and risk constraints. This methodology has been demonstrated to enhance network resilience in high-risk regions while incurring no additional costs, thus providing a scalable and adaptable solution applicable to a variety types of natural hazards and geographic contexts.</description></item><item><title>Effect of Laser Cutting Procedures on Overall Performance of N-Type TOPCon Silicon Solar Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11364251</link><description>Today, as the most well-developed photovoltaic (PV) technology, silicon-based solar cells still dominate the PV market. In order to further maximize the power output of the PV modules, it is vital to cut the full solar cells into half-size cells. An increase of 3% in overall power output can often be seen for the half-cell PV modules. However, the solar cell splitting process, which is usually conducted by laser cutting, inevitably causes structural damage and power conversion efficiency loss to the cut cells. The overall performance of the cut solar cell is greatly dependent on the laser cutting scenario. How the laser cutting parameters, such as cutting technique and cutting direction influence the performance of the solar cell is still under debate. In this work, commercial efficient N-type TOPCon solar cells were subjected to laser scribe and mechanical cleaving and thermal laser separation from different cutting side, respectively, to comprehensively investigate the effect of laser cutting procedures on the overall performance of the cells.</description></item><item><title>Impact of NaF Precursor Layer Thickness on Submicrometer Rear-passivated Coevaporated CIGS Solar Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11381898</link><description>Rear interface passivation on submicrometer Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells through nanopatterned dielectric layers has enabled performance gains. The combined optimization of the rear contact interface and the absorber properties enables high-efficiency ultrathin CIGS solar cells. However, the absorber quality of a standard thin 2000 nm CIGS has not been suitably maintained in absorbers with thickness values around 500 nm. Establishing an optimized Na doping, absorber crystallinity, and bandgap profile on such submicrometer CIGS solar cells has been challenging. Moreover, the Na doping may also be influenced by the rear contact architectures implemented in passivated solar cells, e.g., affecting the diffusion of Na from the soda-lime glass. Nonetheless, a proper Na supply into CIGS is critical for an optimized absorber quality. Therefore, this study evaluates the impact of the amount of Na supply controlled through a NaF precursor layer on a rear passivated ultrathin CIGS solar cell. The NaF layer thickness leading to the best performance solar cells in this study, attributed to high absorber crystallinity and low ordered vacancy compound content, is lower than that used in standard thin 2000 nm cells. It suggests that the transition to ultrathin solar cells is not straightforward, and the cell architecture influences the conditions to reach the optimum absorber properties.</description></item><item><title>Nonuniform Luminescence Changes Under Illumination and Applied Voltage in Perovskite Photovoltaic Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11372191</link><description>The nonuniform luminescence changes were investigated under illumination and applied voltage in perovskite photovoltaic (PV) modules. The intensity of photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) intensities gradually decreased under illumination and applied voltage, respectively, which could be due to ion migration. This is implied by the metastable behavior of the device: the power decreased under illumination and recovered after dark storage. The rate of decrease in PL and EL intensities was different for each subsolar cell, indicating the nonuniform performance of perovskite solar cells in the module. In addition, the EL image after dark storage shows a speckle pattern and a decrease in the bright EL spots under the applied voltage. These changes indicate that the interface between the perovskite and charge-transport layer may not recover uniformly during dark storage. These results indicate that transient luminescence imaging to evaluate the presence of inhomogeneous layers, such as the absorbers, can contribute to the understanding of the degradation of perovskite PVs.</description></item><item><title>An Approach for Modeling, Simulation, and Parameter Estimation of Half-Cell Bifacial PV Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11364221</link><description>Bifacial modules have gained prominence due to their ability to capture additional energy from rear-side irradiance. However, models and parameter estimation methods for bifacial modules remain limited largely due to varying interpretations of rear irradiance effects. An approach to address that issue is the standardization of models in line with the IEC TS 60904-1-2 standard. This study proposes a bifacial module model based on that standard featuring two current sources, each representing front and rear irradiances, and introduces bifaciality coefficient as a new parameter to be estimated. A conventional half-cell bifacial photovoltaic module with 655 W was tested in a solar simulator, and the resulting data were used for simulations and parameter estimation of the proposed model by a mean&#8211;variance mapping optimization algorithm. According to the results, the model can effectively estimate the parameters and represent the bifacial photovoltaic module comprehensively due to its low error rates and a strong fit to $I$&#8211;$V$ and $P$&#8211;$V$ curves. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis revealed the incorporation of the new parameter does not affect the identifiability of the model.</description></item><item><title>Lifetime Prediction of TOPCon Modules Based on Accelerated Damp Heat Life Tests</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11361318</link><description>Tunnel oxide passivation contacts (TOPCon) solar cells have revealed a high-performance efficiency and become mainstream product in global photovoltaic (PV) market. Nevertheless, there are still concerns about the reliability and durability of TOPCon modules, particularly in damp and heat conditions. Current lifetime prediction models for TOPCon modules lack adaptability to complex environmental stressors and rapid degradation feedback, limiting their utility in guiding material selection and process optimization. To address this gap, we developed a robust accelerated aging model by combining an improved Peck model with a sigmoidal degradation function, which explicitly incorporates critical factors such as internal humidity and temperature within the module. The model incorporates a particle swarm optimization algorithm to calibrate activation energy and humidity sensitivity parameters, enabling precise simulation of degradation trajectories. Validated through a &#8220;fitting + testing&#8221; framework, the model demonstrates high accuracy (RMSE = 0.7%) in predicting power degradation under damp heat, highly accelerated stress test, and modified pressure cooker test conditions. The results of our designed accelerated aging tests reveal that DH-induced degradation primarily reduces fill factor due to finger corrosion, with minimal impact on Voc and Isc. Modules encapsulated with polyolefin elastomer exhibit superior corrosion resistance, achieving a projected service lifetime 23 years longer than EVA/EVA encapsulated in high-humidity regions like Hainan, China. This article bridges the critical gap in TOPCon module lifetime prediction under extreme environments and provides actionable insights for optimizing encapsulation materials and enhancing long-term reliability. The proposed model offers a scalable framework for industry stakeholders to evaluate module performance under site-specific climatic conditions, accelerating the development of durable PV technologies.</description></item><item><title>Partial Shading Losses in Half-Cut PV Modules: Experiments, Circuit Simulation, and an Analytical Loss Function</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11313241</link><description>This study establishes an integrated approach to quantify partial shading losses in commercial half-cut photovoltaic modules. Systematic indoor experiments were conducted on a 440 W c-Si half-cut module, providing current-voltage data under controlled shading. The data were used to calibrate a detailed LTspice circuit model. Further, an analytical loss function was developed to predict power losses as a function of shaded substring fraction and configuration. This analytical loss function was then refined through empirical fitting to the experimentally validated LTspice model, and it closely matches both the designed simulation conditions used for data fitting and independent representative shading scenarios. This framework offers a reliable and efficient tool for predicting shading losses in series-connected half-cut PV modules, facilitating more accurate system design and performance assessment.</description></item><item><title>Thermal-Aware Tracking for Photovoltaics: Reducing Module Degradation Without Sacrificing Yield</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11381435</link><description>Elevated operating temperatures for photovoltaic modules remain a critical challenge for PV systems, particularly in regions with high irradiance. High temperatures lower efficiency and accelerate module degradation. Single-axis trackers generally rely on algorithms that maximize irradiance capture. To tackle the dual challenge of maximizing production while preventing overheating, we propose a thermal-aware tracking algorithm. The method substantially reduces module temperatures during inverter clipping, a common occurrence in PV systems with high dc/ac ratios. By moderating plane-of-array irradiance (POAI) only when excess power cannot be exported, the algorithm reduces the module temperature without compromising energy yield. Validation using an advanced thermal model that accounts for wind-driven convection and radiative exchange with the sky shows that, under the climatic and operational conditions in Chile, the algorithm performs best when panels are oriented closer to horizontal. Implemented on a solar tracker in northern Chile, the algorithm achieved module temperature reductions of up to 7.7&#8201;&#176;C along with decreased UV exposure, enhancing thermal performance without compromising system output and thereby improving efficiency while minimizing degradation.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Analysis of PyroCb Lightning Leader Impacts on PV Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11303118</link><description>Pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) thunderstorms from intense bushfires are major lightning sources, igniting secondary fires and damaging electrical infrastructure. Unlike conventional lightning surge studies based on generic thunderstorm conditions, this study develops a novel modeling framework rooted in atmospheric pyroCb thundercloud dynamics. A numerical model is employed to simulate downward leader propagation in pyroCb lightning via the dielectric breakdown model, explicitly coupling charge structure, wind-shear-driven displacement, and leader dynamics with surge analysis. Results show wind shear extensions of 0&#8211;12 km significantly influence charge distribution and lightning type, shifting from intracloud to negative cloud-to-ground (&#8211;CG) discharges as initiation potential changes from 49.34 MV (4 km extension) to &#8211;450.69 MV (12 km extension). Findings indicate that CG flashes predominantly strike within 26&#8211;27 km, emphasizing charge density variations in leader development. The extracted return stroke current, peaking at 350 kA, is modeled as a MATLAB time-series function and applied to a grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) system to analyze surge effects. Results show pyroCb lightning surges propagate through electrical networks, causing extreme overvoltages, equipment failure, and operational disruptions. By directly linking pyroCb atmospheric processes with renewable energy infrastructure response, this study makes the first integrated assessment of bushfire-driven lightning surges on PV systems. These findings emphasize the need to assess renewable energy infrastructure vulnerabilities to extreme weather-driven lightning events. By clarifying leader dynamics and surge impacts, this study advances lightning protection research and highlights the importance of robust mitigation strategies to safeguard electrical systems against pyroCb lightning hazards.</description></item><item><title>Defining Solar Farm Lifetime From Techno-economic Indicators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11348952</link><description>Photovoltaic (PV) system design and project viability are conventionally decided based on the assumptions: &#8220;end of life at 80% capacity&#8221; and &#8220;20&#8211;25 year system life.&#8221; These heuristic assumptions decouple the local financial context from long-term technical performance dynamics, obscuring the technoeconomic optimal in the decision aiding analyses. In this article, we present a technoeconomics driven framework to explain the project lifetime of PV farms. The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) varies with the chosen project lifetime, and we show that there is an optimum operational life of the PV system where LCOE is minimum. We compare the fixed-rate degradation (FRD) model to a realistic degradation (RD) profile to quantify LCOE and optimal project lifetimes. FRD significantly overestimates the optimum lifetime. For a baseline system reaching 80% capacity in 25 years (&#8220;technical lifetime&#8221;), the FRD model predicts an unrealistic optimum life of 58 years, whereas the RD model yields 32 years at 2.5% interest rate and 2% inflation rate. We study the variation in optimum lifetimes for different interest/discount rates, inflation, and technical lifetime. While optimum lifetime increases as each of these parameters increase, LCOE only goes up with the economic rates. Our results indicate, in certain local conditions, it may be possible that the optimum is lower than the technical lifetime&#8212;i.e., it would then be better to set the system decommissioning date even before the warranty. By bridging realistic system performance with LCOE analysis to identify the year of minimum LCOE, our approach provides investors and policymakers with a robust metric to maximize financial returns and decide when to decommission.</description></item><item><title>A Linear Programming Approach to Backtracking for Single-Axis Trackers on Rolling Terrain</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11327451</link><description>In this article, we present a computationally efficient method for determining optimal backtracking rotations for single-axis solar trackers on nonuniform terrain. The method allows for ganged tracking, mechanical rotation constraints, uneven row spacing, and arbitrary maximum allowable shaded fractions (to enable &#8220;fractional backtracking&#8221;). As with previous 2-D approaches, the method is suitable for terrain that varies in the transverse direction with respect to the rotation axis of the trackers. The novelty of the method lies in formulating the problem of shade avoidance as a linear problem, which is achieved by using the row interception width as the optimization variable instead of rotation angles. Formulating backtracking as a linear problem enables the use of extremely efficient linear programming algorithms, making the method highly scalable, requiring less than 1 min to compute optimal rotation schedules for hundreds of trackers. It also produces more effective backtracking rotations, reducing the frequency of shading by 4&#215; and improving system energy output by 1%&#8211;2%.</description></item><item><title>Using Open-Source Forecasts for Solar Plant Maintenance Outage Scheduling Can Reduce Lost Energy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11345810</link><description>Solar plant operators have to schedule outages for periodic maintenance, where plants or subsets of plants are shut down. Outages can last many hours to several days and result in lost energy generation. Scheduling outages one or more days in advance may be required for staffing purposes and to provide adequate notification to grid operators. Because solar generation can vary from one day to the next, it is ideal for outage scheduling to be informed by the weather, with resulting generation that will or could occur on each day being considered for an outage. In this work, we demonstrate how forecasts made with open-source data and tools can improve maintenance outage scheduling relative to not using forecasts, reducing losses relative to perfect scheduling by more than half. Reference code to replicate this work, which is freely available, is also introduced.</description></item><item><title>Multiparameter Dynamic Mode Decomposition for Electrothermal Analysis of Chiplet Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11329520</link><description>Chiplet employs advanced packaging techniques to heterogeneously integrate chips with different processes and functions, featuring multidie integration and high density. However, the increased power density and thermal coupling within these systems introduce significant electrothermal issues, leading to heat accumulation and power management complexities. Meanwhile, due to the complex multilayer heterogeneous integration and multiscale geometric features of chiplet systems, the number of degrees of freedom increases sharply, resulting in significant computational challenges and high demands for computational resources. Traditional numerical methods, such as finite element analysis (FEA), although capable of providing high-accuracy results, are computationally expensive. This work proposes a parametric dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)-based reduced-order modeling method for the electrothermal analysis, extending DMD to handle variations in parameters such as convection coefficients and thermal conductivity, thereby enabling robust analysis for diverse design requirements. As a matrix decomposition technique based on singular value decomposition (SVD), DMD extracts low-rank structures that capture both temporal dynamics and spatial correlations. The numerical results show that the proposed method provides an efficient and reliable solution for electrothermal analysis of chiplets, achieving a 4&#8211;9 times speedup over commercial software like COMSOL Multiphysics, making it an alternative for optimization design and reliability analysis of advanced systems.</description></item><item><title>High-Speed Floating Voltage Level Shifter With Self-Locked Noise Immunity for High-Side Gate Driver</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11360777</link><description>Level shifters (LSs) are essential circuit elements within high-side gate drivers, responsible for translating logic signals from a low-voltage (LV) domain to a high-voltage (HV) domain. However, high-frequency gate drivers impose stringent requirements on the propagation delay and reliability of LSs. This article presents a novel high-speed floating voltage LS that achieves subnanosecond propagation delays and enhanced noise immunity. The proposed structure, termed the common-mode self-locking (CMSL) LS, mitigates both common-mode (CM) and differential-mode (DM) noise. The proposed architecture incorporates two complementary techniques: a cross-coupled current mirror topology to suppress CM transient noise, and a combination of resistive signal sensing and a self-locking (SL) mechanism to provide DM transient noise immunity. The proposed technique achieves subnanosecond propagation delay while ensuring high noise immunity and maintaining excellent tolerance to negative voltage swings on the floating supply rail. The design is implemented in a 0.18- $\mu $ m bipolar CMOS&#8211;DMOS on the silicon-on-insulator (BCD-on-SOI) process. Simulation results demonstrate that the final LS achieves an average propagation delay as low as 410 ps. The figure of merit (FOM) is 0.057 ns/( $\mu $ m $\cdot $ V), indicating superior performance compared to existing solutions. The experimental results validate the LS&#8217;s performance, demonstrating an overall propagation delay of less than 19 ns and a dV/dt noise immunity of up to 42.8 V/ns. The design supports a negative VS swing of &#8722;4.12 V at a 5-V supply voltage. Furthermore, verification in a 600-V BCD process confirms the architecture&#8217;s intrinsic robustness and superior immunity performance suitable for HV applications.</description></item><item><title>An Independently Programmable Multioutput SAR SC DC-DC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11347524</link><description>This article presents an integrated independently programmable multioutput (MO) successive approximation (SAR) switched-capacitor (SC) DC-DC converter with two independently programmable output channels ranging outputs between 0.4&#8198;V and  $V_{\text {BAT}}$  with resolution of  $V_{\text {BAT}}/{3^{N}}$  where  $V_{\text {BAT}}$  is the input voltage and N is the number of SC units cascaded in SAR structure.

Conventional MDNN methods suffer from distribution shifts caused by dynamic oversampling ratio (OSR) variations, necessitating repeated retraining. Our innovation lies in a data reconstruction mechanism: for lower OSR scenarios, a third-order cascaded integrator-comb (CIC) filter inserts pseudo-data points between quantization code to match the NN&#8217;s input dimension. For higher OSR scenarios, cyclic downsampling decomposes the original sequence into parallel subsequences processed independently by the same network. For multitone signals, a reconstruction&#8211;calibration&#8211;summation flow hierarchically handles spectral components. Implemented on an FPGA and covalidated with a commercial 14-bit/1 GSPS pipeline ADC, the framework demonstrates robust performance without retraining.

The design employs a ring-oscillator-based digitally controlled oscillator (RO-DCO) that provides 1 MHz frequency granularity and exhibits a &#8722;124 dBc/Hz phase-noise level at a 1 MHz offset, yielding an integrated rms jitter of 154 fs (1 kHz&#8211;100 MHz). Reference spurious tones caused by static phase offset (SPO) and nonideal clock realignment are mitigated through an in situ stochastic-sampling calibration technique that performs on-chip detection. The proposed correction technique suppresses spurs without compromising jitter or power efficiency, enabling a compact, low-overhead all-digital implementation. The MDLL demonstrates that ring-oscillator-based architectures can simultaneously achieve broad frequency programmability, sub-200-fs jitter, and spur suppression at low power and area cost. These results demonstrate suitability for high-performance clock generation in advanced SoCs and multi-Gb/s applications where analog PLLs face scaling limitations.</description></item><item><title>HSA: An Efficient Sparse CNN Accelerator Based on Kernel-Aware Hybrid Pruning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11314110</link><description>The deployment of large-scale convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on hardware often results in reduced execution efficiency and increased hardware overhead. Prior works have addressed this challenge by employing pruning techniques to reduce parameters and computational loads. Among these techniques, fine-grained N:M pruning methods achieve high sparsity rates but at the cost of generating substantial indexing overhead and potential workload imbalance. In contrast, pattern-based pruning methods reduce indexing complexity and achieve workload balancing but suffer from low sparsity. To overcome these limitations, this article proposes a kernel-aware hybrid pruning (KAHP) method that simultaneously attains high sparsity, workload balancing, and reduced indexing overhead. Moreover, to accelerate the inference of the models pruned by the KAHP method, we design an efficient accelerator based on the systolic array architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the N:M pruning method, the KAHP method achieves workload balancing and reduces the number of indices by up to 88.7% on ResNet-20. Compared to pattern-based pruning methods, the KAHP method achieves up to  $31.8\times $  sparsity. The proposed accelerator achieves up to 93.18 GOPS/W power efficiency and 0.721 GOPS/DSP computation efficiency.</description></item><item><title>RRAM-Based Spectral-Domain Convolution Accelerator for Reliable and Energy-Efficient CNN Inference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11313316</link><description>The growing computational demands of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have motivated the use of spectral-domain inference as an alternative to costly spatial-domain convolutions. In this work, we propose a resistive RAM (RRAM)-based spectral-domain convolutional layer that exploits in-memory computing (IMC) for low energy consumption and high parallelism. Both the 2-D Fourier transform and the elementwise multiplications are directly executed on RRAM crossbar arrays, while Hermitian symmetry is leveraged to further enhance the energy efficiency of the transform and subsequent spectral processing. To ensure robustness, the measured RRAM device data are incorporated into system-level simulations to evaluate inference accuracy under the impact of device variability. Furthermore, we introduce a layer-wise mapping framework that adaptively selects between spatial- and spectral-domain execution based on the tradeoff between energy efficiency and accuracy. Simulation results show that the proposed design achieves up to a  $2.18\times $  improvement in energy efficiency across various convolutional layer configurations compared with the spatial-domain design. For VGG-8 on CIFAR-100, the proposed architecture with the layer-wise mapping scheme reduces the energy-delay product (EDP) by 45% while incurring negligible accuracy loss. This work presents the first complete RRAM-based spectral-domain convolutional layer that accounts for device variability, providing a promising solution for edge CNN inference.</description></item><item><title>Fast Modular Reduction Algorithm and Reconfigurable Domain-Specific Architecture Design Based on Generalized Mersenne Primes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11353472</link><description>Modular arithmetic enjoys a broad spectrum of applications. In recent years, the advancement of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) has imposed growing demands on the flexibility and scalability of domain-specific accelerators. This article presents a fast modular reduction algorithm based on generalized Mersenne (GM) primes, which employs approximate scaling and iterative compression approaches to rapidly converge the quotient value while reducing the precomputation complexity to rely solely on the modulus itself. Building upon this algorithm, we have designed a reconfigurable modular reduction array using multiplier units with smaller word length. Operating at 1 GHz, the proposed array achieves an area reduction of 45.14% compared to Barrett-based structures, and 13.93% compared to Montgomery-based structures. The array has been integrated into a complete number-theoretic transform (NTT) acceleration architecture. The resulting reconfigurable GM/general modular reduction domain-specific architecture elevates the chip frequency to  $0.42\sim 1$  GHz under the same process technology. Under identical test conditions, it improves area efficiency by 10.6% and reduces energy consumption by 17.0% compared to the state-of-the-art ASIC design. When compared to the latest field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementations, it achieves a reduction in area-time product (ATP) by 7.2%~18.4% for Kyber and by 13.4% for Dilithium. These results strongly demonstrate the notable advantages of the hardware-friendly GM algorithm.</description></item><item><title>A T8T-SRAM Computing-in-Memory Macro for Ternary Deep Neural Networks and Boolean Logic Computations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11343922</link><description>Deep neural networks (DNNs) play important roles in artificial intelligence applications and show hungry computility and power demands. Compared with binary neural networks (BNNs), ternary neural networks (TNNs) have higher representation and adaptive abilities and balance the inference accuracy and computing efficiency between DNNs and BNNs. This article proposed a T8T-SRAM computing-in-memory (CIM) macro to achieve Boolean logic operations and MAC operation of ternary activation and ternary weight. The proposed T8T-SRAM bitcell has a separate read and write path, and can avoid the read disturb issue. In Boolean logic operation mode, the T8T-SRAM macro can achieve nand, nor, xnor, and xor operations with redundant rows, reducing the additional reference voltage generation circuit. In the MAC mode, the result is quantized by an embedded column analog-to-digital converter (ADC), which uses activation refresh to reduce weight changing. In 28-nm CMOS technology, under 0.5-V array supply voltage and 0.9-V peripheral supply voltage, simulation results manifest that the MAC results have good linearity, and feasibility of Boolean logic operation. The proposed T8T-SRAM macro realizes MAC operation of 16 ternary activations and 16 ternary weights with 333.99&#8211;816.1-TOPS/W energy efficiency and 61.9-TOPS/mm2 area efficiency.

FP computing in-memory (FP-CIM) has a broader range of applications compared to integer CIM. However, FP-CIM can incur greater power, delay, and area overheads than integer CIM due to the inherent complexity of FP computational flow. In this article, we introduce a new method for asynchronous exponent normalization and parallel mantissa alignment. This approach allows us to add exponents and find the maximum sum simultaneously. We also replace the traditional subtraction and shifting for mantissa alignment with a cross-structure maximum-finding method, enabling FP-CIM to be achieved with lower delay, area, and power overheads. The macro is designed in TSMC 28 nm process, with a memory size of 6 Kb, a layout area of 0.067 mm2, and an area efficiency of 1.3 TFLOPS/mm2. Simulation results show that the macro computational frequency and energy efficiency can reach 150 MHz and 12.8 TFLOPS/W, respectively, at 900 mV, while performing FP- MAC operations.</description></item><item><title>A 40 nm Buffer-Free 7T-SRAM Analog Charge-Domain CIM Macro With Merging Timing Based On Time-Row Division Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11370282</link><description>Computing-in-memory (CIM) macros based on static random access memory (SRAM) are meant to increase capacity while improving energy efficiency and reducing computing latency. However, traditional analog designs still face several key challenges, including long computing latency from separated computing phases, negative voltage fluctuations from massive parallel computing, and low bitcell density from additional transistors and capacitors for multiplication. On the other hand, only time-aligned inputs are supported in the works. To overcome the above challenges, this work proposes a buffer-free 7T-SRAM charge-domain CIM macro. It has four key features: 1) a compact 7T SRAM bitcell structure for high-energy efficiency; 2) a configurable input unit to support different sizes of input activations; 3) a time-row division (RD) strategy to support real-time processing and alleviate negative voltage fluctuations; and 4) a merging timing to conceal the input phase for high throughput.

However, signed multibit multiplication and accumulation (MAC) pose significant challenges, primarily due to the complexities involved in handling sign bits. Relying solely on auxiliary modules for sign bit operations in computing-in-memory (CIM) arrays increases time and area overhead. To address this, we propose a CIM signed MAC architecture utilizing a hybrid cell array. Our proposed strategy relies on the partial structure within an 11 T cell to complete sign operations, rather than relying on additional modules; it achieves a balance between area consumption and computational efficiency. Our strategy decomposes the discharge that represents the operation value according to weights and distributes it across different bit lines. Therefore, under the limited bitline voltage margin, the discharge value of the least significant bit does not sharply decrease as the number of operation bits increases, which ensures the accuracy of the MAC operation. Since all the cells in the array can simultaneously perform the corresponding sign or numerical operations, and numerical accumulation is reflected in the analog voltage physical quantities, each group of MAC operations can be performed with high parallelism. Simulations using a 28-nm CMOS process demonstrate that the proposed circuit achieves high linearity, such that the absolute value of the integral nonlinearity (INL) does not exceed 1.12. The MAC operation achieves an energy efficiency of 26.9 TOPS/W at a frequency of 417 MHz, with 4-bit input, 4-bit weight, and 4-bit output. Our proposed strategy demonstrates an advantage in figure-of-merit (FOM) and network data accuracy.</description></item><item><title>An Area-Efficient and Reconfigurable Accelerator for Massive MIMO Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11318341</link><description>To overcome the trilemma between application flexibility, high efficiency, and minimal area/power overhead in baseband processors, this article proposes an area-efficient and reconfigurable accelerator for massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems, integrating a reconfigurable and heterogeneous processing element (PE) array featuring customized mixed-precision floating-point units (FPUs) to enable high-accuracy execution of diverse baseband operations (i.e., general matrix computation, inversion, mixed-radix fast fourier transform (FFT), decomposition, etc.) on matrices ranging from  $4\times 4$ &#8211; $32\times 32$ .

This article presents an ultralow-power application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for real-time multiclass arrhythmia classification in wearable electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring. Unlike present works that require high computational resources or use limited resources for binary or small-category classification, this work proposes a hardware-friendly ASIC to support seven categories of cardiac arrhythmia classification based on the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard, outperforming most existing chips. Through a shared discrete wavelet transform (DWT) module and an optimized support vector machine (SVM) core, the hardware resources are reduced by over 30% for the optimized SVM and by over 75% when both optimizations are applied together. Through optimized circuit design and low-power design, this ASIC can maintain a high accuracy of 97.2% and an ultralow power consumption of 35.5 nJ/inference, which is lower than most of the existing tasks.

While general-purpose processors employ comprehensive cryptographic authenticated encryption for memory security, domain-specific DNN accelerators lack adequate protection, particularly against integrity violations. To address this research gap, we present Sorbet, a DNN accelerator equipped with authenticated encryption to defend against both confidentiality and integrity attacks on off-chip memory. Integrity verification introduces complex memory access patterns in DNN accelerators, as the granularity of authentication operations often clashes with the tiling strategies used for efficient off-chip memory access. Our approach tackles this challenge with a secure memory interface (SMI) module that efficiently: 1) translates the accelerator&#8217;s tile request to the required data for cryptographic authentication and 2) aligns fetched data with the memory map of the accelerator&#8217;s on-chip buffers. Moreover, our design mitigates the area and performance overhead of cryptographic operations by adopting a lightweight cipher while maintaining security requirements against splicing and replay attacks. Our fabricated chip achieves 22% latency overhead across diverse workloads, including convolutions and multihead attentions (MHAs), which can be further reduced with larger on-chip buffer size and double-buffering. It incurs only 7.9% area and 18.3% energy overhead, which is competitive with recent DNN accelerator defenses with weaker off-chip memory protection.</description></item><item><title>A 48-Gb/s PAM-4 Transceiver With Transition Boosting and RLM Calibration for Next-Generation Memory Interface Testing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11346068</link><description>As the demand for high-speed memory interfaces continues to grow, the need for effective testing methodologies becomes increasingly critical. Traditional automatic test equipment (ATE) systems are limited in their capability to test advanced signaling methods such as pulse amplitude modulation-4 (PAM-4) due to their reliance on non-return-to-zero (NRZ) signaling. This article presents a PAM-4 transceiver designed to bridge the gap between the tester and the memory, boosting the PAM-4 testing data rate up to 48 Gb/s using existing NRZ-based ATE.

The detector is inherently prone to soft errors, as its chip area is predominantly occupied by memories, which are easily exposed to high-energy particles and hostile interferences in harsh environments. One of the most widespread ways to protect memories is to encode their entries with error-correcting codes (ECCs). However, na&#239;vely encoding all bits in an entry is likely to be costly and unnecessary. Accordingly, to sort out performance-critical bits and determine the priority of protection, we extensively scrutinize how vulnerable respective bits in the memories of the detector are too soft errors. Based on the analysis, in addition, an efficient FTA that selectively encodes only a subset of the bits in order of the identified vulnerability is developed. Furthermore, the proposed FTA implements the state-of-the-art multiuser detection (MUD) scheme called on-the-fly despreading (OD) and showcases a new feature named purification, which repeatedly replaces erroneous entries with corrected ones to keep them error-free. Complicated memory accesses to concurrently perform the OD as well as the purification are enabled by remodeling both the datapath and the control path of the baseline OD architecture (ODA). Implementation results demonstrate that, unlike the prior arts that fail to sustain near-optimal performances and become impractical even for a very low probability of soft error, the proposed FTA may operate robustly in a wide range of harsh conditions without incurring much overhead.</description></item><item><title>Analysis of a Delay-Element-Based Technique for Enhancing Soft Error Tolerance at Input Nodes Around Clock Edges</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11311171</link><description>Technology scaling and supply voltage reduction make sequential circuits around clock edges increasingly vulnerable to single-event transients (SETs).

A lightweight fault-tolerant scheme is proposed that integrates delay elements (DEs) with the self-recovery capability of DICE to temporally desynchronize SET pulse arrivals and facilitate self-correction through temporal misalignment. Furthermore, a visualization method based on critical charge distribution is presented to delineate SET tolerance boundaries. HSPICE simulations demonstrate that the proposed method is robust against PVT variations, improving the average critical charge by up to  $1.7\times $  over the baseline and reducing the risk window by 47%, while maintaining comparable delay and power efficiency.</description></item><item><title>FPGA-Based Low-Power Signed Approximate Multipliers for Diverse Error-Resilient Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11363033</link><description>The Booth algorithm is widely used for efficient signed multiplication due to its ability to reduce partial products. A higher radix Booth multiplier generates fewer partial products, while it also increases hardware complexity in the generator, diminishing the advantage of fewer accumulators. Previous optimizations of generators and accumulators were designed for application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), but their performance gains cannot be comparably translated to field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) due to differences in architecture. This article proposes FPGA-friendly approximate Booth multipliers that combine approximate hybrid-radix partial product generation with resource-efficient accumulation techniques. Initially, to improve generation efficiency, an look-up table (LUT)-reused exact radix-8 generator is introduced through logical partitioning to integrate two types of partial products into a single LUT. In addition, approximate adjacent-compensation radix-8 and radix-16 generators are developed based on the Booth encoding bit-repetition principle. Later, to speed up partial product accumulation, an overlap-parallel accumulation scheme and various accumulators are proposed, reducing compression steps and enhancing resource utilization. Last, performance-configurable hybrid radix-8/-16 approximate Booth multipliers are designed to meet the needs of different error-resilient applications. The most hardware-efficient configuration of the proposed 16-bit multiplier reduces power&#8211;delay product (PDP) and LUT consumption by 38.31% and 35.66%, respectively, compared with the exact multiplier. Furthermore, the proposed designs offer a better balance between accuracy and hardware complexity than existing approximate multipliers. The practicality of these multipliers is demonstrated in both joint photographic experts group (JPEG) image compression and finite impulse response (FIR) filtering applications. An open-source library of the proposed multipliers is available at https://github.com/YnuGuoLab/FPGA_Signed_Approx_Mul to support further research.</description></item><item><title>A Capacitor Discharge-Based SRAM CIM Macro Based on Hybrid-Domain for Convolutional Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11316805</link><description>Compute-in-memory (CIM) is increasingly recognized as an effective hardware accelerator for convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

PDS samples the residual voltages from multiple ADC conversion cycles to increase the NS effect, without the need for large integration capacitors of the typical cascaded passive integrators. A preamplifier is placed between the sampling capacitors and the integrator to avoid signal attenuation, while further reducing the area of the integrator. PDS and preamplifier introduce two left-half-plane poles to the noise transfer function (NTF) to boost the NS effect, while reducing the impact of the parasitic capacitance to essentially enhance the robustness.

We show that self-injection can be leveraged in GHz LC oscillators as well. Our oscillator employs a current-domain self-injection technique by leveraging second-harmonic extraction, capacitive phase shifting, and self-mixing through the oscillator&#8217;s bias path. The approach enables 90&#176; phase-shifted injection completely on-chip, avoiding any bulky passive delay elements, and with only minor changes to the conventional class-B LC oscillators. Thus, the  $1/f^{3}$  corner can be reduced by at least an order of magnitude without any significant degradation in the tuning range or power consumption. Our proof-of-concept 4.6&#8211;6&#8198;GHz VCO in a 65&#8198;nm CMOS process achieves a  $1/f^{3}$  PN corner of 5&#8211;35&#8198;kHz, and a peak figure-of-merit (FoM) of 193&#8198;dBc/Hz, as well as a FoM normalized by the tuning range of 201&#8198;dBc/Hz.

The proposed structure employs a three-coil gm-boosting technique for the low-noise amplifier (LNA). This approach reduces the LNA&#8217;s noise figure (NF) and expands the input matching bandwidth (BW). Furthermore, it allows for the co-design of a three-coil transformer Dicke switch with low insertion loss, ultimately lowering the system&#8217;s total NF. Recognizing the critical role of Dicke switches and chopper modulation in radiometric systems, this work investigates and compares two distinct chopper configurations and evaluates their effectiveness in flicker noise suppression. A combination of theoretical analysis, circuit-level simulations, and measurement results (for one of the configurations) is used to assess the noise performance of the architecture. The analysis quantifies the critical impact of the chopper clock&#8217;s duty cycle on the noise suppression. Additionally, the effect of mismatch between the signal and reference paths is also analyzed in detail.

A reference multiphase generator is employed to enable  $M_{\text {BA}}$  sampling paths, each sampling the output of the slope generator that is driven by the RO for linear and high sampling gains, enabling stabilized operation at an augmented bandwidth that is &gt;30% of the reference frequency. Meanwhile, each sampling path behaves in a sub-sampling manner without requiring dividers in the feedback loop that consumes additional power overhead and degrades the overall in-band noise performance. Fabricated in standard 40-nm CMOS, the proposed BASS-PLL consumes 6.26 mW with a bandwidth augmentation factor of 8 and occupies an active area of  $0.11~{\mu }$ m2. Measurement results show a worst case rms jitter of 325 and 282 fs integrated from 1 kHz to 100 MHz and 1 kHz to 30 MHz, respectively, when operating at an output frequency of 3 GHz across different samples. The measured spur is better than &#8722;62.1 dBc across a wide frequency span of &#177;1.2 GHz. Measurements across supply variation, temperature variation, and multiple samples are performed to verify the structural robustness, demonstrating that by enabling simultaneous bandwidth enhancement and in-band noise suppression, the proposed BASS-PLL achieves a worst case FoMREF of &#8722;247.9 dB and represents state of the art for compact low-jitter RO-based PLLs.</description></item><item><title>A Machine Learning-Inspired PAM-4 Transceiver for Medium-Reach Wireline Links</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11202240</link><description>This article presents an energy-efficient machine learning-inspired PAM-4 wireline transceiver that leverages data encoding at the transmitter (Tx) and feature extraction with classification at the receiver (Rx) to compensate for channel loss ranging from 13 to 26 dB, while maintaining the bit error rate (BER)&lt;10-11. A new consecutive symbol-to-center (CSC) encoding scheme is proposed that assigns identifiable attributes to the data by moving all consecutive identical symbols (CISs) to the common-mode voltage (0 V) before transmission. Additionally, an on-chip decision-tree classifier is designed and implemented at the Rx back-end to learn both the channel and the CSC data encoding characteristics, enabling accurate detection of the original transmitted data in the presence of inter-symbol interference (ISI), with a latency of only 10 unit intervals (UIs). The decision-tree classifier operates with a low-power, feed-forward architecture without any feedback timing constraints, allowing the transceiver to communicate at 42 Gb/s with an energy efficiency of 1.43 pJ/b for compensating 26 dB loss. The proposed transceiver, fabricated in 16-nm FinFET, achieves a low energy/bit per channel loss of 0.055 pJ/b/dB, which is approximately  $2{\times }$  lower than prior conventional architectures.</description></item><item><title>A 14-Cell Battery Monitoring AFE With 1-mV Total Measurement Error and Integrated Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11242016</link><description>A 14-cell monitoring analog front-end (AFE) is presented for comprehensive battery pack diagnostics and control, aiming to enhance performance and extend lifespan. The AFE measures each cell&#8217;s DC voltage and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), supporting accurate estimation of the state of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH) of lithium battery packs. By integrating dynamic circuit techniques with a hardware-reuse strategy at both the system and circuit levels, the design achieves high measurement resolution, compact area, and improved energy efficiency. The capacitively coupled instrumentation amplifier (CCIA) measures DC voltage under high-voltage (HV) common-mode conditions and is subsequently repurposed for intermittent EIS acquisition. An interchannel auto-zeroing stabilization (AZS) scheme time-interleaves ripple suppression across multiple chopper-stabilized CCIAs, enhancing voltage resolution without additional area. Furthermore, synchronizing the incremental delta-sigma modulator (IDSM) decimation filter with the chopping clock and adjusting filter weights provides additional ripple suppression without extra circuitry. The built-in EIS function leverages the passive balancing circuit to perform fast, broadband impedance measurement using a 1-bit delta-sigma-modulated excitation current. Fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu $ m BCD process, the 14-cell AFE core operates from a 5-V supply, consumes 11.5 mW, and achieves a post-calibration maximum DC total measurement error (TME) of 1 mV from  ${-} 40~{^{\circ }}$ C to  $85~{^{\circ }}$ C.

By employing a level-shifted sub-ranging architecture with an input-tracking (IT) feature, the design obviates direct input sampling, thereby significantly relaxing the demands on the input driver. A gain-error-and-noise suppression (GENS) technique further enhances robustness to interstage gain variation through compact and hardware-efficient switched-capacitor (SC) operations.

A triggered sampling technique is proposed to eliminate the misalignment between the output timestamp and the output voltage amplitude in conventional continuous-time (CT) LC ADCs, which is achieved by sampling the input signal according to the triggering signal from a 4-bit LC detector. Moreover, the signal-dependent error caused by the inevitable CT comparator delay is thus accurately extracted by feeding back the LC output codes. A  $16{\times }$  redundancy-free residue amplifier (RA), followed by an 8-bit second-stage successive approximation register (SAR) ADC, is adopted to perform finer quantization and improve the resolution. Fabricated in a 55-nm CMOS process, the prototype ADC achieves a measured peak SNDR of 72.5 dB with a 6.6-kHz input under a 1-V supply, achieving the highest reported SNDR and providing an 8-dB improvement over state-of-the-art. Also, thanks to the LC scheme, the proposed ADC demonstrates a dynamic power consumption from  $1.2~{\mu }$ W (static) to  $11.8~{\mu }$ W (20-kHz input), yielding Walden FoM (FoMw) of 9&#8211;86 fJ/conv.step.</description></item><item><title>A 95.9-dB SNDR 10-kHz BW Third-Order VCO-Based CT &#916;&#931; Modulator Using a Phase-Time Two-Step Quantizer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11216111</link><description>This article presents a third-order voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)-based continuous-time (CT) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that addresses key limitations in prior VCO-based architectures.

To realize minimally invasive implants with miniaturized volume and weight, wireless power transfer (WPT) has been extensively studied to replace bulky batteries that dominate the volume of traditional implants and require surgical replacements. Ultrasonic (US) and magnetoelectric (ME) WPT modalities, which leverage low-frequency acoustic&#8211;electrical coupling for energy transduction, become viable solutions for millimeter-scale receivers (RXs). This work presents a fully integrated power management unit (PMU) for ME WPT in millimetric implants. The PMU achieves load-independent maximum power extraction and usage by continuously matching the transducer&#8217;s impedance, dynamically optimizing the power stage across varying input/load conditions, and reusing the storage energy to sustain the system when input power drops. Its parallel-input regulation and storing stages architecture prevents the cascading power loss. With the skewed-duty-cycle maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technique and regulation efficiency optimizer, the PMU achieves a peak MPPT efficiency of 98.5% and a peak system overall efficiency of 73.33%. Additionally, the PMU includes an adaptive high-voltage (HV) charging stage that charges the stimulation capacitor up to 12 V with an improved efficiency of 37.88%.</description></item><item><title>A Dual-Path Topology for Single-Inductor Dual-Output DC&#8211;DC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11203941</link><description>This article presents a high-efficiency, high-power-density single-inductor dual-output (SIDO) converter based on a dual-path (DP) topology. The proposed DP-SIDO converter supports a theoretical  $0\sim 1$  voltage conversion ratio (VCR) and arbitrary load differences and introduces three key advantages. First, both the dc and ripple currents through the inductor are significantly reduced, enabling the use of a smaller inductor and enhancing efficiency. Second, the reduced inductor current decreases the discontinuous current through energy allocation switches, thereby reducing the voltage spikes and enhancing reliability. Third, because the inductor and the flying capacitors alternately deliver current to the outputs, the output voltage ripple can be reduced. A dedicated DP-SIDO control strategy is also proposed to provide the fast transient response and minimal cross regulation. Fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu $ m BCD process with all power transistors integrated on-chip, the proposed converter demonstrates the highest efficiency of 94.5% among previous single-inductor multiple-output (SIMO) converters under similar VCR conditions and delivers 4-A total load current with a compact inductor measuring  $3.2\times 2.5\times 1.2$  mm3. For a 1.6-A load step on  $I_{\mathrm {o2}}$  with a 200-ns rise time, the measured  $V_{\mathrm {O2}}$  undershoot is only 136 mV, and the cross regulation is as low as 7 mV/A.</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid SCVR With 4 &#215; CF Continuously Scalable-Conversion Ratio SC Stage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11230332</link><description>This work presents a hybrid switched-capacitor (SC) voltage regulator (VR) with a continuously scalable-conversion (CSC)-ratio stage implemented with off-chip flying capacitors ( $\boldsymbol {C}_{ F}$ s). By eliminating the need for high-density on-chip capacitors, this approach offers broader accessibility to designers. The use of off-chip  $\boldsymbol {C}_{ F}$ s mandates minimizing the  $\boldsymbol {C}_{ F}$ s count to reduce I/O complexity, layout congestion, and routing overhead. However, this conflicts with the conventional CSC design philosophy for high efficiency, which implies many  $\boldsymbol {C}_{ F}$ s. To resolve this tradeoff, we first propose clamping the  $\boldsymbol {C}_{ F}$  voltage ( $\boldsymbol {V}_{ \text {CF}}$ ) swing to 1/4 of its original range, achieving comparable efficiency and output power in the designs with full swing. The clamp is achieved via preceding SC stages, forming an SC-first configuration that improves the efficiency of the SC stages. Next, we propose a half-outphasing control that reduces the  $\boldsymbol {C}_{ F}$ s count to 4, while reconfiguring  $\boldsymbol {V}_{ \text {CF}}$  steps to maintain high efficiency across a wide voltage conversion ratio (VCR) range. Moreover, we employ an SC2-CSC stage outphasing for more  $\boldsymbol {V}_{ \text {CF}}$  steps, further improving efficiency. Fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, the prototype SCVR achieves a measured peak efficiency of 92.5% and a maximum output power of 1.52 W. With further advancements in process and packaging, this approach holds potential for higher output power and density.</description></item><item><title>A 40.68-MHz Dual-Output Wireless Power Transfer System for Millimeter-Scale Biomedical Implants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11203940</link><description>This article presents a single-link, dual-output wireless power transfer (WPT) system operating at 40.68&#8198;MHz for miniature, high-power biomedical implants. The elevated carrier frequency enables a millimeter-scale receiver (RX) coil while maintaining link efficiency and output power comparable to low-frequency WPT designs. End-to-end (E2E) efficiency is optimized through global power modulation using a dynamic off-time (DOT) algorithm in conjunction with a fully integrated load-shift-keying (LSK) uplink. At the RX, a single-stage dual-output resonant-current-mode (DORCM) rectifier with single-mode zero-crossing-based control achieves zero-voltage switching (ZVS) and robust adaptability over varying coupling conditions. At the transmitter (TX), an adaptive-ZVS (AZVS) class-D power amplifier (PA) minimizes switching losses and electromagnetic interference (EMI). Both the TX and RX chips are fabricated in a 180-nm BCD process. Measurement results demonstrate dual-output voltage regulation at 1.2 and 2&#8198;V under DOT control (DOT Ctrl), with smooth switching behaviors observed at both the TX and RX. The DORCM RX supports seamless cold-start-up operation and achieves a peak power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 90.3% at 90.4-mW output power. The peak E2E efficiency is 51.2% at a coupling factor of  $k$ &#8198;=&#8198;0.2. Enabling DOT modulation improves E2E efficiency by up to 18.2%, corresponding to a  $2.2{\times }$  reduction in TX input power.

While prior SF and CP-based amplifiers suffer from poor linearity because the SF must drive large amplified signals, we propose a buffer-then-amplify (BTA) CP architecture that relocates the CP to the SF output. As a result, the SF only buffers unamplified small-swing residues, fully exploiting its intrinsic linearity and eliminating the need for high-order gain calibrations even in advanced process nodes. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we introduce an adaptively biased class-AB SF. An integrated active-hold technique is also proposed to eliminate the timing and bandwidth mismatch between the first-pipeline-stage sampling capacitor and the sub-ADC by repurposing the SF as a hold buffer for the sub-ADC. The prototype 12-bit 800-MS/s pipelined time-interleaved successive approximation register (TI-SAR) ADC is fabricated in 12-nm FinFET technology. It achieves SNDR higher than 55.0&#8198;dB across the 4.2&#8211;373&#8198;K temperature range with 40-MHz input, and peak Walden figure-of-merit (FoMW) of 9.2&#8198;fJ/c.-step at 4.2&#8198;K.

By mapping a COP to the annealing processor, the optimal or near-optimal solution can be achieved efficiently. However, the Ising model is limited to two spin states, which restricts its application in solving multi-state COPs. To address this limitation, we propose a Potts machine implemented in 65-nm CMOS technology, which is based on a  $16\times 16$  King&#8217;s graph topology. The proposed Potts machine supports two to four spin states and is compatible with both the Ising model and the Potts model. Additionally, we introduce an intra- and inter-coefficient reuse strategy, which effectively decreases the coefficient memory area overhead by 68.75%. Furthermore, we propose a successive boundary approximation (SBA) annealing method to address the challenges associated with long convergence time. The measurement results demonstrate that the proposed SBA annealing method achieves a  $10\times $  acceleration in comparison to the conventional simulated annealing approach. The proposed Potts machine has a spin area of  $4400~\mu $ m2 and exhibits an energy consumption of 1.06 nJ when powered by a 1-V supply.</description></item><item><title>A 40-nm 209-TOPS/W Reinforcement Learning Processor With Full Speculation Exploitation and Inference-Training Parallel Processing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11231336</link><description>Reinforcement learning (RL) has found widespread applications across diverse domains, making energy-efficient implementations imperative.

A six-order hybrid modulation scheme, combining differential 16-pulse-position modulation (D16PPM) and four-pulsewidth modulation (4PWM), is proposed, enabling a maximum data rate of 2.016 Gb/s. An intra-pulse frequency hopping (FH) technique is proposed to precisely adjust the frequency variations within a single pulse, achieving a maximum transmitter (TX) radiation power of &#8722;7.6 dBm under the spectral mask.

The transceiver also incorporates a wireless clock calibration strategy, enabling a crystal-referenced external base station to wirelessly calibrate the clock frequency of the crystal-less implant. The calibration process completes within several microseconds, after which the implant can turn off the RX and the all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) to reduce the power consumption. Ex vivo test demonstrates that the transceiver supports a transcutaneous transmission distance of 40 cm at 2.016 Gb/s and 120 cm at 1.344 Gb/s, enabling the experimental subject to move freely within a meter-scale range while maintaining a Gb/s-level data rate.</description></item><item><title>A 16-bit 10-GS/s DAC Achieving &gt;65-dBc SFDR and &lt;&#8211;75-dBc IM3 up to the Nyquist in 28-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11084876</link><description>This article presents an approach to mitigating both current source unit deviations and inter-symbol interference (ISI) non-linearities in Nyquist current-steering digital-to-analog converters (DACs). This approach enables switching-activity-controlled data-weighted-averaging (SAC-DWA) with 50% redundant cells by exploiting the input frequency range and the time-domain randomized element transition rate (ETR), leading to an input-independent switching activity. Utilizing SAC-DWA, a 16-bit 10-GS/s DAC is designed in 28-nm CMOS and mounted in a BGA package. In this DAC, the proposed SAC-DWA decoder is implemented in an overflow-detection-based low-complexity state machine to achieve ultra-high speed at 10 GS/s. In addition, a 1-D merged array placement is adopted to reduce the IR-drop mismatches between the segments of the most and least significant bits. Measurement results show that this DAC achieves spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) &gt;70 dBc up to 2.86 GHz and SFDR &gt;65 dBc with third-order intermodulation distortion (IM3)  $\lt -75$  dBc over the entire Nyquist band.</description></item><item><title>Human Limb ExG Monitoring System Using Four-Node Body Channel Communication With Adaptive Gain Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11084891</link><description>This article presents a multi-node body-channel-communication (BCC) system with the capability of measuring electromyography (EMG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals from the limbs using a custom-designed ExG readout integrated circuit (IC). For further expansion of various extended reality (XR)/virtual reality (VR) applications, accurate motion detection and user data collection are essential, leading to the demand for real-time acquisition of EMG and ECG signals from the body. The proposed multi-node BCC system features wireless operation between its HUB node and multiple sensor nodes, offering the user the convenience of free movement while being energy-efficient enough to enable wearable implementation. Additionally, an adaptive gain control (AGC) technique is incorporated into the BCC receiver of each node to ensure resilience to changes in BCC caused by variations in the user&#8217;s posture. To concurrently read ExG signals while transmitting and receiving data through capacitive BCC, a wide-band common-mode interference (CMI) rejection technique is employed at the ExG readout IC, filtering out the common-mode BCC signals and isolating the ExG signals. Finally, a pre-charging-based input-impedance-boosting technique is applied, making the system robust to variations in measurement environments, such as electrode-body interfaces. The measurement results show that the BCC transmitter and the receiver achieve energy efficiencies of 1.071 and 0.495 nJ/b, respectively, with the overall system operating at a data rate of 1 Mbps. A bit-error rate (BER) below  ${8}{\times }{10^{-5}}$  was achieved under realistic body channel conditions. The ExG readout IC consumes  $8.82~{\mu }$ W per channel and achieves a dc input impedance of 76.18 M $\Omega $  and a common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of over 101.2 dB up to 100 Hz. Most significantly, a successful operation of the entire system is demonstrated along with the simultaneous acquisition of limb EMG signals from all four channels.</description></item><item><title>An R-RC Oscillator Achieving Second-Order Temperature Compensation and Oscillating Independently From the Comparator and Reset Delays</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11080347</link><description>This article presents a second-order temperature-compensated R-RC oscillator with a detailed analysis and design methodology. The proposed R-RC oscillator leverages a novel R-RC configuration that cancels both first- and second-order temperature dependencies at the same time, achieving a low-temperature coefficient in a wide temperature range. The R-RC oscillator proposes a delay-locked loop (DLL) to exclude undesirable delays of the comparator and reset switch, enabling the final reference frequency to be determined by only the time constant of the R-RC configuration. For verification, the oscillator was fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu $ m standard CMOS technology. It generates a frequency reference of 2.3 MHz while occupying an active area of 0.07 mm2 and consuming  $7.6~\mu $ W at room temperature. A total of 11 chips are measured and the proposed R-RC oscillator achieves an average temperature coefficient (TC) of 7.93 ppm/&#176;C across a temperature range from  $- 40~^{\circ }$ C to  $125~^{\circ }$ C and an energy efficiency of 3.3 pJ/Hz.</description></item><item><title>A 174/756-nW 6-Class Keyword Spotting ASIC With Delta/Successive-Approximation Dual-Mode Quantizer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11095636</link><description>An ultra-low-power (ULP) six-class keyword spotting (KWS) ASIC is presented in this article, which can be used in always-on speech-based human&#8211;machine interface applications. The ASIC is composed of a sampling frequency and resolution adaptive (SFRA) dual-mode analog-to-digital quantizer and a power-gated KWS engine with a multiplier-less processing element (PE) array. The dual-mode quantizer mainly operates as a 1.5-bit delta quantizer (DQ), providing inherent robustness against dc drift. It adaptively switches to high-resolution successive-approximation register (SAR) quantization mode upon detecting a sound event based on the DQ output. In the KWS engine, the multiplier-less PE array is reused for both feature extraction and gated recurrent unit (GRU)-based keyword classification. To unveil the tradeoffs between power consumption and flexibility, two versions of the classifier have been implemented, with ROM-based on-chip weight memory (WM) and SRAM-based WM. Fabricated in 180-nm CMOS technology, the proposed KWS ASIC with ROM and SRAM-based WM achieves six-class classification accuracies of 87.3% and 90.1%, respectively, on the Google Speech Command dataset (GSCD) while consuming 174 and 756 nW long-term average (LTA) power with a decision latency of 14 ms at a clock frequency of 256 kHz.</description></item><item><title>A 3&#215; Offset, 2.9&#215; Power, 1.3&#215; Sensing Time, and 4&#215; Area Reduction Direct Input Transfer Offset Cancel DRAM IO Sense Amplifier With Static Current-Free Pre-Sensing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11072694</link><description>With the increase in memory density and scaling down of the DRAM process, the length of the global IO pairs (GIO and GIOB) and the offset voltage ( $V_{\text {OS}}$ ) have increased. This degrades the power consumption and sensing time ( $t_{\text {SEN}}$ ) of IO sense amplifiers (IOSAs) that sense the differential input voltage via long GIO pairs ( $\Delta V_{\text {GIO}}$ ). Conventional IOSAs use the self-time logic, hybrid IOSA, and GIO switches to reduce the power consumption of IOSA. However, they do not consider  $V_{\text {OS}}$  of the IOSA, which requires a larger  $\Delta V_{\text {GIO}}$  for robust IOSA sensing operations, increasing  $t_{\text {SEN}}$  to develop a large  $\Delta V_{\text {GIO}}$  and increasing the power consumption to pre-charge these discharged GIO pairs. To mitigate these issues, offset cancellation (OC)-IOSA has been proposed. However, since two large coupling-capacitor-based OC-IOSAs transfer  $\Delta V_{\text {GIO}}$  via capacitive coupling, it suffers from input voltage attenuation, severe area overhead, and static current. This work proposes a single capacitor-based direct input transfer static current-free pre-sensing IOSA (SCFP-IOSA) to reduce  $V_{\text {OS}}$  and power consumption with a small area and high speed. The direct input transfer scheme is adopted in SCFP-IOSA, which removes input voltage attenuation and does not require large capacitors, thereby enhancing the sensing margin and relieving area overhead. In addition, a novel static current-free pre-sensing, which uses RC delay exponential nature, is proposed that not only pre-amplifies  $\Delta V_{\text {GIO}}$  to enhance  $V_{\text {OS}}$  tolerance but also reduces power consumption by removing static current during the pre-sense (PS) operation. The simultaneous coupling down and  $\Delta V_{\text {GIO}}$  developing operation also contribute to the fast sensing operation of SCFP-IOSA. According to the measurement on the experimental chip fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS technology, SCFP-IOSA achieves three times lower  $\sigma V_{\text {OS}}$  of 4.42 mV, 2.9 times lower power consumption of  $2.15~{\mu }$ W, and 1.3 times faster  $t_{\text {SEN}}$  of 3.75 ns with 4.46 times smaller area of  $10.28~{\mu }$ m2 compared with the state-of-the-art OC-IOSA.</description></item><item><title>A High-Density Low-Leakage and Low-Power Fully Voltage-Stacked SRAM for IoT Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11060649</link><description>The general approach to suppress leakage in static random access memory (SRAM) is to use a low voltage ( $V_{\text {L}}$ ), generated by a low-dropout regulator (LDO), as the cell supply voltage (CVDD) of SRAM array in the standby mode. However, the effectiveness of lowering CVDD is constrained by the area and power overhead introduced by the LDO, as well as the additional latency and power consumption incurred during mode switching. This work presents a fully voltage-stacked (FVS) SRAM that reduces leakage power with internally generated intermediate voltage ( $V_{\text {MID}}$ ) by stacking SRAM arrays. The FVS SRAM consists of a foundry high-density (HD) cell and a pMOS pass-gate (PG) cell having the same metal pattern and size as the HD cell, ensuring compatibility across various process nodes. In addition, the FVS SRAM reduces minimum operating voltage and access energy by the intermediate cell voltage (ICV) assist technique and charge-sharing-based precharge, respectively. The silicon measurement results from a 14-nm FinFET test chip demonstrate that the FVS SRAM achieves a leakage power of 5.34 pW/bit and an access energy of 24.6 fJ/bit at  ${V_{\text {MIN}}} {=} 0.5$  V. Compared to conventional non-stacked SRAM, the FVS SRAM exhibits 29%&#8211;59% and 10%&#8211;21% reduction in leakage power and access energy across VDD  ${=} 0.6$ &#8211;0.8 V.</description></item><item><title>A 1131-kb/mm2 14.0-to-53.3-TOPS/W 8-bit Analog-Assisted Digital Compute-in-Memory With Hybrid Local-Refresh eDRAM for Attention Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11066230</link><description>This article presents an eDRAM-based analog-assisted digital computing-in-memory (CIM) core that offers superior power and area efficiency for dynamic sparse attention computing. For different queries, it uses efficient low-precision analog pre-computing to filter out irrelevant in-memory key groups. As a result, each query only needs to attend to a small subset of the most relevant in-memory key groups in the digital domain, significantly boosting overall energy efficiency. At the cell level, a hybrid local-refresh eDRAM cell is proposed, which integrates analog, digital, and local refresh functions into a 4T1C cell, enabling the analog-assisted digital CIM to achieve high storage density. In addition, to reduce the cost of filtering out irrelevant in-memory key, a time-domain comparator that performs comparisons directly in the analog domain is adopted. For the digital operations, a near-memory time-shared multiply-accumulate (MAC) block design is employed, further enhancing the macro&#8217;s density. Fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process, the prototype demonstrates a high storage density of 1131 kb/mm2 and improved 8-bit digital-mode energy efficiencies from 14.0 to 53.3 TOPS/W.</description></item><item><title>DmNE: A Dual-Mode Neural Engine for Multiplicative and Multiplication-Free Kernels With Fine-Grained Precision Scaling and Processing Elementwise Power Gating</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11072493</link><description>Artificial intelligence (AI) hardware implementations require efficient model processing and the flexibility to adapt to varying accuracy and latency requirements, as well as energy budgets, given the target use cases. Existing AI hardware typically relies on bit precision or data sparsity to balance efficiency and accuracy. Alternatively, the multiplication-free L1 kernel, which measures the L1 distance between inputs and weights, has recently been proposed as a replacement for the traditional, energy-intensive multiplicative dot-product (DP) kernel. This L1 kernel achieves significant energy and delay advantages while maintaining comparable classification performance across various applications. Therefore, selectively applying the L1 kernel serves as an additional parameter to optimize trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and energy. To exploit such an opportunity, we present, for the first time, a silicon-proven dual-mode sparsity/precision-scalable processor, dubbed DmNE, that features the following: 1) a dual-mode reconfigurable architecture (DmRA) optimized for processing both conventional neural networks (NNs) with DP kernels and emerging NNs with L1 kernels; 2) processing elementwise power gating (PEPG) that fully utilizes the unstructured data sparsity, which comes from unique data statistics in L1 kernel processing, while maintaining a structured computing array; and 3) dual-mode bit-serial (DmBS) processing that enables 2&#8211;8-b flexible precision scaling and high resource utilization across both modes. Measurement results show that the proposed DmNE, fabricated in 65 nm CMOS technology, achieves up to  $2.2{\times }$  energy efficiency improvement with PEPG as data sparsity increases from 0% to 90%, up to  $8.8{\times }$  energy efficiency gain with DmBS when bit precision scales from 8-b to 2-b, and up to  $9.1{\times }$  energy-delay product (EDP) boost on real-world NN benchmarks with DmRA by switching from DP to L1 mode. The test chip achieves 0.36/1.0 TOPS peak performance and 7.2/13.0 TOPS/W peak energy efficiency at 4-b data precision in DP/L1 mode, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Noise Modulation of a Bandgap Reference by Using a Single Resistor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11217282</link><description>This manuscript presents a low noise and area efficient voltage bandgap reference (BGR) where its noise is modulated by using a single resistor between the base terminals of the bipolar core. Depending on the value of the resistor, the flicker noise is modulated above the noise corner frequency (thermal noise). This resistor also provides an extra degree of freedom while selecting the BGR output voltage and the temperature coefficient (TC). After optimizing the design via simulations, the BGR was taped out in standard  $\mathbf {1 8 0} \mathbf {n m}$  CMOS TSMC technology. Experimental results are in accordance with simulations, where the BGR provides 0.9 V and occupies an area of only  $0.009 \mathrm {mm}^{2}$ . The BGR has a total noise of  $14.23 \mu \mathrm {Vrms}$  over the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz and only  $2.82~\mu $  Vrms between 0.1 Hz and 10 Hz. The average TC is  $49.05~\mathrm {ppm} ^{\circ } \mathrm {C}$  between  $-20 ^{\circ } \mathrm {C}$  and  $90 ^{\circ } \mathrm {C}$ .

In the past decade, the increasing demand for high-performance and energy-efficient computing systems has generated significant interest in non-volatile CAMs (NV-CAMs) based on emerging non-volatile memory devices. In this work, we propose a novel non-volatile, precharge-free CAM (NV-PCAM) scheme based on double-barrier magnetic tunnel junctions (DMTJs). When compared to its counterparts, NV-PCAM presents competitive figures of merit in terms of area, speed, and energy efficiency, while also ensuring low search error rates. We also provide a complete class of voltage-divider-based NV-CAM cells for benchmark comparison. All schemes are designed and laid out using a 65 nm process and evaluated under Monte Carlo and process-voltage-temperature (PVT) simulations. Through Monte Carlo simulations, the proposed NV-PCAM demonstrates up to 81% and 85% lower search energy than NV-NOR and NV-NAND, respectively, as well as a 61% and 16% improvement in terms of search delay with a compact cell area footprint.</description></item><item><title>Reconfigurable FPU With Precision Auto-Tuning for Next-Generation Transprecision Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11345233</link><description>Recent advances in process technology have shifted the research focus from strict raw scaling to the conception of energy-efficient computing units, capable of adapting to the target application precision requirements. A key opportunity lies in floating-point arithmetic, where traditional fixed-precision formats (32/64-bit) often impose unnecessary resources and costs in both performance and power. To address this problem, this manuscript introduces an Automatic Precision Floating-point Unit (APFU) that extends prior reconfigurable designs by incorporating a hardware controller capable of autonomously tuning the operand precision and vectorization levels at runtime. The APFU supports IEEE-754 (double, single, half-precision), bfloat16, and DLFloat formats, and exploits unused datapath capacity to increase the throughput via vector operations. Unlike previous approaches, the proposed APFU introduces a runtime controller that autonomously determines the operand precision and vectorization levels based on operand characteristics and execution mode. The presented experimental evaluation considers an implementation using a 28-nm UMC technology, achieving up to 152 GOPS/W, and demonstrates a detailed analysis across operating frequencies, vectorization modes, and runtime precision adjustment.</description></item><item><title>Graph-Oriented Layout Design for Field-Coupled Nanocomputing via Parallel Multi-Objective Search Space Exploration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11197132</link><description>Field-coupled Nanocomputing (FCN) is a post-CMOS paradigm in which information propagates through near-field interactions rather than charge flow, enabling ultra-low-power, high-density logic. Translating netlists into manufacturable, cell-level layouts therefore becomes a pivotal challenge. Existing FCN physical design tools optimize only a single cost metric, typically footprint or runtime. As a result, designers must choose between exponentially slow exact solvers and fast yet area-intensive heuristics. We present the first FCN physical design engine that closes this gap by introducing configurable effort modes. These modes let users trade runtime for solution quality while simultaneously optimizing any discretionary objective, e.&#8198;g. area, wire segments, crossings, or delay, thereby integrating data from physical simulation and manufacturing constraints. Our open-source implementation, released as part of the Munich Nanotech Toolkit, generates layouts for circuits that defeat state-of-the-art exact solvers. On such benchmarks, it shrinks footprint by an average of 73.07 %, reduces crossings by 19.10 %, and cuts wire segments by 54.47 % relative to a leading heuristic baseline. Even after post-layout optimization of the baseline, our approach still achieves mean gains of 25.99 % in area, 37.82 % in crossings, and 25.96 % in wire segments. These results establish the proposed engine as a compelling solution for highly optimized, large-scale standard-cell FCN design.</description></item><item><title>CMOS Platform for Neurochemical Detection Using 32 Graphene FETs Array at 16 kS/s per Channel</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11296925</link><description>Graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) are emerging sensors for monitoring chemical molecules in the brain due to their nanoscale dimensions and high sensitivity to ionic concentrations. In such systems, compact electronic readouts that allow high spatiotemporal resolution of dense sensor arrays are desired for improved brain spatial mapping at relevant physiological temporal scales. This work presents a CMOS-based platform capable of reading GFET arrays at a sampling rate of 512 kS/s, time-multiplexed across 32 channels, with an ENOB of 8.38 bits and a power consumption of  $173~\mu $ W per channel.

To address this gap, this paper will investigate planar polynomial systems with four, six, and nine equilibrium points from the perspective of geometric structures, revealing intrinsic characteristics such as equilibrium point distributions and homoclinic/heteroclinic orbits. Then, the system is investigated via Hamiltonian energy to explain the fundamental causes behind the geometric structure formation. Most importantly, a method for hardware circuit implementation of geometric structures is successfully developed for the first time. Oscilloscope observations show consistency between experimental results and theoretical predictions, and the hardware implementation lays a foundation for engineering applications. Overall, this study contributes to the interdisciplinary integration of geometric topology, nonlinear dynamics, analog circuit design, and engineering applications, which provides a new methodological framework for exploring complex dynamical systems.</description></item><item><title>A NS-SAR Assisted CT Incremental ADC With Input Signal Track-and-Reset for Extending Maximum Stable Amplitude</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11125492</link><description>Incremental analog-to-digital converters (IADCs) are well-suited for multiplexing across sensor nodes. Continuous-time (CT) implementations often offer better energy efficiency than switched-capacitor circuits. This paper presents a medium-bandwidth and high-resolution IADC incorporating a second-order CT loop filter and an entirely passive noise-shaping successive approximation-register (SAR) internal quantizer with a direct input feedforward path. The noise-shaping SAR quantizer enhances noise shaping by one additional order. Meanwhile, the direct input feedforward path mitigates the voltage ringing issues that arise when resetting the loop filter during incremental operation, thereby successfully extending the maximum stable amplitude. The proposed hardware prototype is fabricated in  $0.18~\mu $ m CMOS technology, occupying an active area of 0.38 mm2.

The effective transconductance of the inter-stage amplifiers and comparators is optimized for the minimum power consumption while meeting CDAC matching requirements. The architecture consists of two 3.5-bit/stage blocks in cascade with a sub-range 6-bits flash ADC. A two-stage class AB residue amplifier with cascode output stage and complementary differential pairs is employed, effectively double its DC gain and capable of achieving twice the slew rate (SR) and gain-bandwidth product (GBW) compared to the conventional design with equivalent power consumption. The residue amplifier does not require specific frequency compensation since the cascode output stage and large load capacitor determine the dominant pole that is naturally separated from the pole generated at the output of the first stage. To further enhance ADC&#8217;s power efficiency, the multiplying digital-to-analog converter (MDAC) of the second stage is designed to enable the functionality of the subsequent sub-range 6-bit flash ADC. The two-step 6-bit backend stage resolves the last 3 MSBs and 3 LSBs sequentially, significantly reducing power consumption. A digital calibration scheme employing key DC test signals effectively correct gain and non-linearity errors. Experimental results for a 40nm CMOS prototype show that the proposed pipeline ADC achieves a Signal-to-Noise and Distortion Ratio (SNDR) of 69.2 dB and a Spurious-Free Dynamic Range (SFDR) of 81.5 dB at low input frequencies. 68.5 dB SNDR and 80.7 dB SFDR near the Nyquist frequency at 700 MS/s are achieved.

A few upconversion mechanisms are not fully understood yet. In particular, in class-B CMOS oscillators, the reason why a large tail capacitance combined with transistors entering the triode region for a portion of the oscillation cycle dramatically amplifies the 1/f noise upconversion has not been clearly pinpointed. This work introduces a simple yet powerful model to fully capture the 1/f noise upconversion mechanism. It shows that when the transistors enter the triode region, charge sharing between the tail capacitance and the tank capacitance injects a noise charge into the tank, generating phase noise perturbations quantified by the impulse sensitivity function. The analytical description results in closed-form equations that predict the  $1/f^{3}$  phase noise sideband accurately, without relying on complex harmonic analysis or specific device nonlinearities. The excellent agreement with simulations performed both using idealized and real 55nm CMOS transistor models confirms the validity and robustness of the proposed framework, offering new insights and practical design guidelines for low phase noise CMOS oscillators.</description></item><item><title>A Sub-&#956;W Reconfigurable Multiband Transmitter With 2.57-pJ/bit Energy Efficiency and Dynamic Duty-Cycling Adjustment for Sub-GHz Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11197649</link><description>This paper presents the analysis and design of an ultra-low-power injection-locked transmitter supporting ON-OFF keying (OOK) and frequency-shift keying (FSK) modulation for short-range sensor node applications. To achieve sub- $\upmu $ W operation, this design incorporates an enhanced start-up crystal oscillator, allowing for aggressive duty cycling of the entire transmitter. The duty-cycling signal is generated by a nanowatt on-chip clock oscillator, effectively minimizing sleep-mode power consumption.

Traditional prediction methods mainly rely on manual adjustment of model parameters and are constrained by hardware implementation conditions. The crossbar array structure of memristors can perform matrix operations directly in memory, offering significant energy efficiency advantages over traditional computing architectures.

Asynchronous low-power SNN chips employing analog computing-in-memory (CIM) techniques have been demonstrated to enable real-time, energy-efficient inference. However, their tolerance to nonidealities remains to be improved, and their peripherals for multiphase or multilevel signal control are complex. This paper proposes a general-purpose, spike-driven SNN chip designed with efficient analog-computing circuits, featuring two key contributions: 1) A compact direct current-add CIM synapse design that significantly simplifies control peripherals, thereby reducing latency and enhancing energy efficiency. 2) A PVT-aware multi-network learning method underpinned by detailed analyses and modeling, coupled with a label-normalization-based synapse-strengthening method, to mitigate the impact of nonidealities. Fabricated in 65nm CMOS process, the proposed design achieves a state-of-the-art latency of  $10\mu $ s and an energy efficiency of 0.40pJ/spike. The generalization ability of the design is verified through its successful application to two distinct tasks: voice activity detection (VAD) and ECG anomaly detection. The tolerance to nonidealities is validated by the VAD task. The ten chips maintain over 90% detection accuracy across signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of  $4\sim 16$ dB, &#177;10% supply voltage variation, and a temperature range of  $- 25\sim 55^{\circ }$ C.</description></item><item><title>Time Interleaved Self-Synchronized Impulse-Radio Transceiver for Seamless Duplex Communication in Neural Implants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11185225</link><description>This paper introduces a time interleaving technique for impulse radio (IR) transceivers to enable seamless duplex communication in the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) of neural implant interfaces. An integrated time interleaved (TI) transceiver prototype in CMOS process is presented, utilizing the idle time between received DL return-to-zero (RZ) bit sequences to insert the UL transmitter (TX) data without interfering the receiver (RX) operation. The crystal-free transceiver is synchronized with an external unit by a clock and data recovery (CDR) circuit that retrieves the implant system clock from the received radio frequency (RF) signal. The TI data link supports seamless duplex communication with the data transmission rates of 297 Mbps in the UL and 11 Mbps in the DL at 85 cm range with BER  $\lt 10^{\mathbf {-4}}$ . The RX sensitivity and the TX output power are -54 dBm and -16.3 dBm, respectively. By effectively eliminating self-interference (SI) without the need for an external duplexer, this work improves the communication range by more than 5 times compared to frequency division duplexing (FDD) radios commonly used in medical implants.</description></item><item><title>An E-Band Bidirectional Front-End With 20.9 dBm Peak Output Power in GaAs Process</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11217280</link><description>In this paper, a bidirectional RF front-end based on the WIN Semiconductor&#8217;s 100 nm GaAs pHEMT process that can support the extension of E-band vector network analyzers (VNA) is proposed. For E-band VNA extensions, an amplifier multiplier chain (AMC) with high output power and high harmonic rejection characteristics is required to effectively drive the following bidirectional passive mixer. In this design, the AMC includes a 20&#8211;30 GHz frequency doubler, an E-band frequency tripler, and an E-band balanced power amplifier. The frequency doubler features a push-push architecture to effectively improve the rejection characteristics of odd harmonics. Following this stage is a frequency tripler based on an antiparallel diode pair (APDP) topology, which includes a pair of power enhancement T-lines to improve the output power of the AMC. The output of the AMC is a balanced power amplifier with source degeneration inductors to enhance the amplifier&#8217;s bandwidth and stability. To further expand the bandwidth of the AMC, driver amplifiers with an integrated RC negative feedback network are included. Additionally, a compact matching network with bandpass characteristics is integrated between the doubler and tripler to enhance harmonic rejection performance. Measurement results indicate that the peak output power of the E-band AMC is 20.9 dBm, and the harmonics rejection is better than 25 dBc. The intermediate frequency bandwidth of the bidirectional RF front-end covers 100 MHz&#8211;8 GHz, and the corresponding up-conversion gain and down-conversion gain are better than -8.2 dB and -8 dB, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A 50 Gb/s PAM-4 Receiver Featuring Current-Reuse AFE and Single-Loop Half-Rate Reference-Less Bang-Bang CDR in 40-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11214700</link><description>This paper proposes a four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) half-rate receiver, incorporating a current-reuse analog front-end (AFE) and a single-loop half-rate reference-less bang-bang clock and data recovery (BBCDR) in a 40-nm CMOS process. The inverter-based AFE is introduced to compensate for the channel insertion loss efficiently, utilizing a continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE) that works in conjunction with feed-forward mid-frequency equalization and a variable gain amplifier (VGA) that employs a complementary-Gilbert gm-cell for enhanced current efficiency. The gm-transimpedance-amplifier (Gm-TIA) topology is employed in the AFE to extend the gain-bandwidth (GBW) product. To overcome the design challenges of high-speed clock generation and distribution, the BBCDR adopts a half-rate architecture. Two asymmetric locking points (LPs) are adopted for the bang-bang phase detector (BBPD) by the clock-phase-selection (CPS) scheme and the hybrid control circuit (HCC) is adopted to automate the frequency acquisition. To eliminate the impact of the middle transition of the PAM-4 signal and enhance the jitter performance of the proposed PAM-4 receiver, the pattern-selection technique is adopted in the proposed pattern-based BBPD (PB-BBPD). The measurement results demonstrate that the receiver can compensate for &#8722;8.5 dB channel loss at 12.5 GHz and automatically eliminate the frequency errors with the single-loop architecture. Moreover, by incorporating the proposed PB-BBPD, the PAM-4 receiver achieves an improved jitter performance with a power efficiency of 2.47 pJ/bit.</description></item><item><title>A Simultaneous Bidirectional Link With 6&#8211;12.8-Gb/s Forward and 12&#8211;25.6-Gb/s Backward Channels for System Chips Interconnects</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11240195</link><description>This article presents the design of simultaneous bidirectional (SBD) transceivers (TRX) for system chips interconnects. Implemented on differential channels, the forward link employs common-mode non-return to zero (NRZ) signaling, while the backward link utilizes differential-mode 4-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) signaling. The SBD transceiver architecture integrates an NRZ transmitter and two PAM-4 receivers in the Host Chip, paired with an NRZ receiver and two PAM-4 transmitters in the Client Chip. This configuration enables source-synchronous, multi-rate operation without the need for explicit clock channels. The SBD link supports forward data rates ranging from 6 to 12.8 Gbps and backward data rates from 12 to 25.6 Gbps. To the authors&#8217; best knowledge, the proposed SBD link achieves the broadest tunable data rate as is reported to date. An experimental prototype is implemented using a TSMC 28nm CMOS process. The die areas for the Host Chip and the Client Chip are approximately 0.46 mm2 and 0.28 mm2 respectively. The SBD transceiver demonstrates an energy efficiency of approximately 2.5 pJ/b.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Approximate Radix-8 Booth Multiplier for Edge Detection in Bioimages by Field Programmable Gate Array</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11222759</link><description>The Booth multiplier provides high-performance signed multiplication by encoding and decreasing partial products (PPs) generated using the radix-4 Booth algorithm. Although the radix-8 produces fewer PPs than the radix-4 and needs fewer adders to accumulate PPs, it is not fast because the odd multiples of the multiplicand are generated in a complex unit, and attaining a high performance is challenging. This work alleviates this issue using approximate designs. An approximate 4:2 compressor is proposed in which the inputs are encoded by the generation and propagation method for the reduction of faulty rows in the truth table. The compressor, radix-8 Booth encoder, and PP generation (PPG) are used to attain a signed  $16\times 16$ -bit, approximate multiplier, and synthesized targeting a 90 nm complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. The multiplier is efficiently implemented on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to perform the Sobel operator for edge detection. The occupied area, dynamic power dissipation, and power-delay-product (PDP) $\times $  mean relative error distance (MRED) of the presented multiplier are superior to the lookup table (LUT)-based multipliers of an FPGA. The Sobel edge detection algorithm implemented on the FPGA detects 99.15% of edges with 33.33% energy savings, while the structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) are 0.88 and 32.92 dB, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A 3.51 TOPS/mm2 Transformer Accelerator Exploiting Bipolar Sparsity and Approximate Gating</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11150487</link><description>Transformer models excel at natural language processing tasks but are challenging to deploy on edge devices due to high memory and computation demands. To address this, we proposed an energy- and area-efficient transformer accelerator. We identify &#8216;0&#8217; bits in positive and &#8216;1&#8217; bits in negative 2&#8217;s complement activation values as bipolar sparsity. This form of sparsity shares a larger proportion than the traditional bit-level sparsity in transformer models. We propose a bipolar sparsity compressor (BSC) together with a bipolar processing element (BPE) to detect and skip the bipolar sparsity in a bit-group (BG) level during the inference. It reduces a large proportion of ineffective computations and improves throughput. The significant sparsity scheduling (SSS) dynamically adjusts broadcast settings based on BG-level sparsity ratios, balancing the sparsity skipping and memory access. Furthermore, an importance approximate gating (IAG) filters out unimportant tokens/heads during the attention computation by reusing sparsity information from the BSC, further reducing processing latency and energy consumption. Implemented in a 28nm process, the proposed accelerator achieves  $7.62\times $  and  $12.43\times $  throughput improvements on RoBERTa-B and GPT2-xl, respectively. The area efficiency reaches up to 3.51 TOPS/mm2 due to skipping a large proportion of bipolar sparsity, reaching  $4.83\times$  and  $5.85\times $  higher compared with the state-of-the-art approximate computing accelerator and the computing in memory accelerator on the benchmark model.</description></item><item><title>LogSumExp: Efficient Approximate Logarithm Acceleration for Embedded Tractable Probabilistic Reasoning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11185227</link><description>Probabilistic models (PMs) have become an alternative to complement or replace deep learning in applications where transparency and trustworthiness are crucial. As PMs compute explicit high-resolution probabilities, ensuring numerical stability legitimates the need for logarithmic (log) computing. As exact log computation on hardware is typically costly, existing hardware accelerators stick to high-resolution linear computation with, e.g., floating point (FP). From the perspective of efficient execution on edge devices, using such generic linear hardware for log operations is prone to underflow and ill-suited for operations such as log addition. Hence, the log-domain computing of PMs requires new hardware solutions, combining numerical stability and energy-efficient execution. Inspired by the Log-Sum-Exp (LSE) function used in existing PM software tools transferring data between log and linear domains to compute log additions, this work proposes an LSE Processing Element (LSE-PE). LSE-PE allows for efficient log computation, through an innovative double approximation for log addition, while ensuring numerical stability with an error compensation method using a compact error correction Look-Up Table (CLUT). Hardware synthesis results using a 16nm technology show that the proposed 24-bit LSE-PE hardware consumes 46% area and 32% power of 32-bit floating point, using only 16 LUT entries with 10 bits in each entry. Moreover, our experiments on various PM benchmarks show that LSE-PE prevents underflow even for large models, which exist in all other 32-bit number systems, with less than 0.2% accuracy loss. We also demonstrate an outlier detection task for uncertainty estimation of image classification models using the LSE-PE, for a fraction of the main model&#8217;s computing cost (0.06 to 20% of representative DNN architectures for MNIST).</description></item><item><title>An NVM Non-Idealities Mitigation Solution Using Cell-Clustered Calibration for Analog High-Density Edge Multi-Level Cell Compute-in-Memory</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11176125</link><description>Multi-level cell (MLC) non-volatile memory (NVM) has become a promising candidate for compute-in-memory (CiM) designs because of its non-volatility, high density, and improving CMOS compatibility. However, most MLC NVMs suffer from device non-idealities, including large variation, low on/off ratio, and read disturb, which compromise the computational accuracy, reliability, and throughput of MLC NVM-based CiMs. To alleviate the impact of these non-idealities, this work proposes a comprehensive mitigation solution, providing a new paradigm for achieving high-density MLC NVM-based CiM. Without loss of generality, MLC RRAM and STT-MRAM are taken as examples for design and evaluation in this paper. The highlight of the solution is the proposed cell-clustered computing paradigm with local recovery units (LRUs), which enables highly reliable local calibration and efficient in-memory computing. Besides, a dynamic boundary adaption technique is explored to restore the accuracy loss due to the RRAM state drift, and a segmented adaptive LRU configuration approach is proposed to improve the variation and temperature resilience of the MRAM-based design. Results show that the RRAM-based design achieves 152.3TOPS/W energy efficiency and improves the compute and storage density by  $37.0\times $  and  $131.3\times $  with 91.4% inference accuracy under 20% variation compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) MLC RRAM-CiM using on-chip write-and-verify. The MRAM counterpart achieves 182.0TOPS/W energy efficiency,  $2.7\times $  compute density,  $253.6\times $  storage density and 91.5% inference accuracy under 4% variation compared with the SOTA differential offset cancellation MLC MRAM-CiM. The performance reveals the significantly improved balance of the proposed MLC CiM between efficiency, density, and accuracy.</description></item><item><title>STAR-PIM: Self-Test and Repair Structure for Processing-in-Memory With Adder Tree-Based MAC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11195850</link><description>Processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures alleviate memory bottlenecks and improve latency and energy efficiency for AI and ML workloads by accelerating general matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) operations in DNNs. However, permanent faults in arithmetic units (AUs) within processing units (PUs) critically impact yield and inference accuracy. Although the hybrid built-in self-test (HBIST) method has been proposed, it has limited capabilities in diagnosing and repairing faulty AUs within PUs. In this study, a novel Self-Test And Repair structure for PIM (STAR-PIM) is proposed to enable both fault diagnosis and repair by incorporating a bypass mechanism. A scan-path-like approach enables the testing and precise localization of faulty AUs, while faulty adders are bypassed using a redundant adder structure integrated within the memory die. Furthermore, faulty multipliers are masked using the weight-swapping logic. Experimental results demonstrate that STAR-PIM achieves high AU-level test coverage, ranging from 98.89% to 100% with reasonable area overhead. Recovery experiments show that STAR-PIM maintains low relative errors under fault rates up to 1% for GPT-2 and preserves inference accuracy under fault rates up to 3% for MNIST-MLP. Power measurements on GDDR6-AiM indicate an average overhead of 7.39% with only a 0.08% latency increase. Consequently, STAR-PIM significantly enhances the yield and reliability of PIM while reducing test costs, making it a highly practical solution.</description></item><item><title>The Block-Oriented Digital Predistortion Based on the 2-D Complex-Valued Spline Interpolation Lookup Table Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11130437</link><description>In this paper, a novel two-dimensional (2-D) complex-valued spline interpolation lookup table (LUT) method is proposed to construct the cascaded digital predistortion (DPD) system. Three schemes, namely the 2-D complex-valued spline interpolation Wiener DPD (2D-CSPW), the 2-D complex-valued spline interpolation Hammerstein DPD (2D-CSPH), and the 2-D complex-valued spline interpolation Wiener-Hammerstein DPD (2D-CSPWH), are given for the DPD model construction, where the different serial orders of linear and nonlinear blocks are considered. The local mapping property achieved by the proposed approach can closely approximate the conventional polynomial model under strong power amplifier (PA) nonlinear conditions, involving only a few free parameters, which is promising for achieving real-time continuous nonlinear learning. The proposed DPD schemes have been extensively validated through different RF measurements, including those for highly nonlinear Doherty PA (DPA) and the load modulation balanced amplifier (LMBA), as well as the commercial PA. The results show that the proposed 2D-CSPWH achieves linear performance that closely approximates the conventional polynomial models, while reducing complexity by 90%, and the other two models also demonstrate optimal trade-offs between complexity and performance.</description></item><item><title>Resilient Output Feedback Tube-Based MPC for Cyber-Physical Systems Under Hybrid Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11133698</link><description>This paper proposes a resilient output feedback tube-based model predictive control (MPC) approach for constrained cyber-physical systems (CPSs) to handle the impact of stochastic hybrid attacks, where the hybrid attacks include false data injection (FDI) attacks and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that occur in the sensor-controller (S-C) and controller-actuator (C-A) channels, respectively. The anomalous behavior of the attacker is revealed by the designed attack detector and comparator, which provide alert signals that guide the primary and auxiliary controllers to collaboratively generate control inputs as well as a nominal trajectory. The tolerable attack duration is determined by using the concept of  $\mu $ -step robust positive invariant ( $\mu $ -RPI) set, which limits the size of the deviation between the observer and the nominal trajectory under the hybrid attacks. Robust constraint satisfaction and robust asymptotic stability are ensured by restricting the state of the system to a tube centered on a nominal trajectory that converges gradually to the origin, and theoretical guarantees are provided. Finally, the effectiveness of the designed algorithm is validated through a supply chain model, which includes comparisons with an inelastic scheme.</description></item><item><title>Design and Analysis of Small-TX Large-RX Coupler in Wireless Charging System for Mobile Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11185076</link><description>Due to the convenience and electrostatic discharge (ESD)-free features, wireless power transfer (WPT) technology has become essential for mobile devices. Conventional WPT solutions use symmetrical inductive couplers with complex structures to enhance misalignment tolerance, while using a large transmitter (TX) coil with a small receiver (RX) coil can increase distance but results in lower power density. On the contrary, we employ in this paper small TX coil and large RX coil for a better tradeoff between power transfer efficiency (PTE), output power and robustness. With detailed analyses, we prove that the small TX large RX configuration outperforms the conventional large TX coil and small RX coil solution and derives the necessary conditions with design procedures for achieving optimal PTE and desired output power. An experimental setup is built to validate the analyses, revealing that the small TX large RX configuration achieves better PTE under the higher output power conditions. Specifically, the system with small TX large RX configuration attains a PTE of 98.7% at an output of 31.29W with an airgap of 10mm.</description></item><item><title>Frequency Response Model for Power Systems Including HVDC-Connected Offshore Wind Power With Communication-Free Frequency Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11251482</link><description>This paper develops a system frequency response (SFR) model and proposes a control parameter design strategy, accounting for the communication-free frequency support of offshore wind farm (OWF) connected through high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission system.

Conventional RNN-based DPD suffers from three hardware bottlenecks: high-sampling-rate demands, sequential hidden-state dependencies that limit pipelining, and the latency&#8211;accuracy trade-off from large hidden sizes. LW-ResGRU addresses these issues by injecting residual connections at every recurrent layer, enabling stable depth scaling even with reduced hidden sizes. All models were evaluated on the OpenDPD DPA 200 MHz dataset (13.4 dBm output, PAPR = 9.6&#8211;11 dB) under an equal parameter budget (&lt;600). With  $H=5$ , LW-ResGRU achieved Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE)  $= -43.5$  dB, Error Vector Magnitude (EVM)  $= -46.7$  dB, and Adjacent Channel Power Ratio (ACPR) (Left/Right)  $= -50.4$ /&#8722;47.8 dBc, outperforming baseline RNN-based DPD models. Hardware feasibility was further confirmed by FPGA HLS synthesis, demonstrating the potential for real-time deployment.</description></item><item><title>Canonical Variate Autoencoder-Based Interpretable Fault Detection for Lithium-Ion Battery Packs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11278887</link><description>With the large-scale application of electric vehicle and grid-scale energy storage systems, accurate and reliable fault detection (FD) of lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery packs is critical to the safe operation of such devices. As the key feature of battery faults, voltage correlation reflects the abnormal state of the battery by measuring the correlation change between data. Inspired by this, this brief proposes a canonical variate autoencoder for online FD in battery packs. First, the original voltages are reconstructed to obey the Gaussian distribution. Then, the canonical variable model is constructed to assess the synchronization between past and future voltages. Finally, a voltage correlation-based robust optimization objective is formulated to improve FD performance. Studies on a real lithium-ion battery experimental rig verify that the proposed method has reliable detection performance and clear physical interpretability.</description></item><item><title>Finite-Time Data-Driven Load Frequency Control for Multi-Area Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11299053</link><description>In this brief, a novel finite-time data-driven control algorithm to address the load frequency control (LFC) problem in multi-area power systems (MAPSs) with unknown system parameters.

The stability of the algorithm is rigorously validated through comprehensive theoretical analysis, and its effectiveness is confirmed through simulations of a three-area power system.</description></item><item><title>A 21-Transistor Single-Phase-Clocked Flip-Flop With Low Leakage Current for Near-Threshold Voltage Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11260504</link><description>A 21-transistor single-phase-clocked flip-flop with low leakage power is presented in this brief. The architecture of the proposed flip-flop is based on topological modification and device merging within a conventional 24-transistor transmission-gate flip-flop (TGFF). It achieves an asymmetric leader&#8211;follower design that can operate under a single-phase clock, eliminating the requirement for complementary clock signals and enhancing area efficiency. Post-layout evaluation on a 28nm CMOS technology confirms a 6% area reduction compared with the TGFF. With reduced transistor count, the proposed flip-flop lowers leakage power across a wide supply range: 17% at 0.4 V and 7% at 0.9 V. Without any device sizing optimization, it still reduces the total power consumption by more than 10% at both 0.4V 20MHz and 0.9V 1GHz.

However, the requirement of longer bitstreams to ensure computing accuracy leads to higher latency, partially offsetting the low-complexity advantage of SC. To address this, this work utilizes a dynamic truncation method for stochastic bitstreams, and designs an energy-efficient counter-based addition circuit (CBAC) through effective bit recognition and correlation. Further, a tree-structured cascading architecture is then used to perform multi-input addition computing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CBAC outperforms the state-of-the-art designs. For instance, a 16-input configuration achieves at least 75.9% reduction in mean square error (MSE) and a more than 43.1% reduction in area.

For the front-end circuitry, selecting a diode that minimizes both conduction and leakage losses under specified operating conditions is challenging, as the forward voltage drop and reverse leakage current cannot be simultaneously reduced due to the device&#8217;s inherent physics. This brief presents a machine learning framework that predicts the DC output of diode-based AC-DC interfaces directly from specific voltage-current (V-I) characteristic points of the diodes and descriptive features of the excitation waveform. A physics-informed surrogate model is trained on SPICE-simulated data of rectifiers driven by experimentally captured cardiac harvester waveforms. Hardware validation with printed-circuit rectifiers powered by the same harvester source exhibits an average error of 0.03 V between prediction and measurement, matching the performance observed on the synthetic set and demonstrating robust generalization to real-world applications. This data-driven approach offers an instant, datasheet-only diode screening without circuit-level evaluation and can be integrated into automated multi-objective optimization flows for the design of low-power energy harvester AC&#8211;DC interfaces.</description></item><item><title>A 24-W 91.5% Peak Efficiency All-in-One Dual-Loop Controlled Quasi-Resonant Isolated DC&#8211;DC Converter With Adaptive Peak Current and Valley-Hysteresis-Locking Techniques</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11310826</link><description>This brief presents an all-in-one isolated DC-DC converter combines a primary flyback controller, secondary synchronous rectifier and digital isolator on a single chip.

Notably, ReSCIM (Wang et al., 2024) pairs an SRAM cell with a dedicated ReRAM crossbar, allowing ReRAM to serve as the local storage, significantly enhancing the storage capacity of the SRAM-CIM. The SRAM is custom-designed not only to serve as a storage element for CIM but also to function as a sense amplifier to retrieve the data from the ReRAM, which enables super high bandwidth of weight data loading into the CIM engine. However, existing mapping tools for CIM are inadequate for ReSCIM since they do not fully exploit the unique hardware characteristics and advantages of this novel architecture. In this work, we propose an analytical energy and latency model, which incorporates four key factors: hardware, workload, dataflow, and mapping (HWDM), for executing inference of NN on the ReSCIM accelerator. Specifically, we first characterize the ReSCIM accelerator hardware specifications and the NN layers. Next, we introduce three dataflows for ReSCIM, leveraging the high weight-loading bandwidth to reduce memory access for various workloads and layer types. Finally, we develop an algorithm to generate optimal mapping and dataflow strategies aimed at minimizing latency or energy consumption. Using our HWDM model, we design a tile-based ReSCIM accelerator and conduct extensive simulations to obtain the cycle-accurate latency and gate-level energy consumption metrics for inference across different NNs. We conduct design space exploration (DSE) using the HWDM model on a comprehensive set of benchmarks to minimize inference energy or latency. Experimental results show that our optimal ReSCIM accelerator achieves a 44% reduction in energy-delay-product (EDP) reduction compared to the weight stationary and fixed mapping baseline for SEResNet50. Moreover, our design exhibits  $1.74\times $  higher energy efficiency than the state-of-the-art hybrid TL-nvSRAM (Wang et al., 2023) accelerator on ResNet 18.</description></item><item><title>Self-SHE Pulse-Enabled 2-D Material-Based SOT-MTJ: A Scalable and Energy-Efficient Write Circuit for LiM Architectures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119676</link><description>Spin-orbit torque magnetic tunnel junction (SOT-MTJ) devices have gained significant attention for energy-efficient computing, particularly in Logic-in-Memory (LiM) architectures. However, conventional SOT-MTJ-based write circuits suffer from excessive power dissipation due to the reliance on externally generated spin hall effect (SHE) pulses, necessitating complex synchronization and additional circuit overhead. This work introduces a novel self-SHE pulse generation technique that eliminates the need for an external SHE pulse, simplifying the circuit design and significantly reducing energy consumption. Furthermore, the proposed design leverages 2-D material-based SOT-MTJs, which exhibit superior charge-to-spin conversion efficiency, thereby enhancing write performance. The proposed write circuit is integrated into a 1-bit arithmetic logic unit (ALU), which is further extended to a 4-bit ALU to demonstrate scalability in LiM applications. Simulation results using 45-nm CMOS technology and Verilog-A models for 2-D SOT-MTJs indicate that the proposed write circuit achieves a 16.049% improvement in area efficiency and a 20.72% reduction in energy consumption compared to conventional SHE-assisted SOT-MTJ write circuits. Additionally, the full adder incorporating the proposed write circuit demonstrates a 25.2% improvement in energy efficiency over existing designs. Monte Carlo simulations validate the robustness of the proposed approach under variations in oxide layer and free layer thickness. By eliminating external SHE pulse requirements and utilizing 2-D SOT-MTJ technology, this work presents a significant advancement toward low-power, high-speed, and scalable spintronic computing architectures, making it a strong candidate for next-generation LiM-based processors.</description></item><item><title>MiniBuf: An On-Chip Buffer Allocation Framework Toward Minimizing Buffer Size and Latency for Memristor-Based CNN Accelerator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11130396</link><description>Memristor-based convolutional neural network (CNN) accelerators have gained considerable attention due to their low latency and high energy efficiency, making them promising candidates for edge acceleration. Alongside statically stored model weights, dynamically generated intermediate feature maps during inference occupy a significant portion of the on-chip buffer capacity and directly affect the efficiency of hardware pipeline execution. However, there is a lack of theoretical analysis and methods for efficiently allocating on-chip buffer for feature map data. To address this gap, this article implements three innovative aspects. First, a mathematical model is developed to estimate the minimal buffer size required for pipelined inference of CNNs on memristor-based accelerators, offering accurate and swift evaluations of the buffer size requirement. Second, based on this model, the article establishes mathematical conditions for buffer requirements to maintain a blocking-free pipeline during CNN inference, providing theoretical guidance for on-chip buffer allocation strategies. Third, a simulation-in-loop optimization method is proposed to further reduce latency by efficiently increasing the buffer size of critical layers. To validate our proposed model and method, evaluations were conducted on five representative models: ResNet-18, ResNet-50, YOLO-v5, U-Net, and Faster-RCNN-FPN. The results reveal a remarkably low average estimation error of only 2.6% between the mathematical model and the experimentally measured results, with the maximum error still below 10%. Moreover, our simulation-in-loop optimization strategy achieved significant latency reductions ranging from 5.3% to 57.5% across the five models.</description></item><item><title>iMAC: Toward Accelerating Deep Neural Networks by Predicting and Removing Ineffectual MAC Operations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11121663</link><description>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are employed in a broad range of classification tasks. Despite CNNs have reached high accuracy, they have high computational complexity, so employing this method in many applications, such as Internet of Things (IoT) is challenging. To overcome this challenge, CNN hardware accelerators are proposed. As the main activation function employed in the CNNs is ReLU, a large portion of the output becomes zero. Therefore, sparse CNN accelerators are proposed to reduce the computational complexity. Recent studies show that, rather than employing sparse CNN accelerators, it would be ideal to predict the zero outputs and remove the corresponding computations. In this article, we propose the iMAC accelerator to bypass ineffectual computations (a computation leads to zero). For this purpose, we propose a prediction unit that determines ineffectual computations without accuracy loss. Then we propose a dataflow to bypass ineffectual computations. The results show that by increasing 12% of area and 18% power overhead, iMAC achieves  $2.31\times $  speedup and  $1.95\times $  energy efficiency without any accuracy loss. With 3% accuracy loss, it further improves the speed and the energy by  $2.94\times $  and  $2.49\times $ , respectively. Moreover, compared to the previous prediction method, our method achieves higher speedup and improvement.</description></item><item><title>Robust and Optimal Loading of General Classical Data Into Quantum Computers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11129925</link><description>As standard data loading processes, quantum state preparation and block-encoding are critical and necessary processes for quantum-computing applications, including quantum machine learning, Hamiltonian simulation, and many others. Yet, existing protocols suffer from poor robustness under device imperfection, thus limiting their practicality for real-world applications. Here, this limitation is overcome based on a fan-in process designed in a tree-like bucket-brigade architecture. It suppresses the error propagation between different branches, thus exponentially improving the robustness compared to existing depth-optimal methods. Moreover, the approach here simultaneously achieves the state-of-the-art fault-tolerant circuit depth, gate count, and space&#8211;time allocation (STA). As an example of application, we show that for quantum simulation of geometrically local Hamiltonian, the code distance of each logic qubit can potentially be reduced exponentially using our technique. We believe that our technique can significantly enhance the power of quantum computing in the near-term and fault-tolerant regimes.</description></item><item><title>ApproxiMorph: Energy-Efficient Neuromorphic System With Layer-Wise Approximation of Spiking Neural Networks and 3-D-Stacked SRAM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11122553</link><description>This article proposes ApproxiMorph, a comprehensive framework for both software and hardware co-design, targeting energy-efficient artificial intelligence (AI) applications using 3-D-IC-based neuromorphic systems. By leveraging parallel interconnections and high-bandwidth communications inherent to 3-D-ICs, and the noise-resilience characteristics of spiking neural networks (SNNs), ApproxiMorph achieves significant power savings by exploiting 1) approximate implementation of neuron cells; 2) layer-wise approximation of SNNs through the heuristic exploration algorithm; 3) reduced-voltage operation in the 3-D-stacked SRAM; and 4) incorporating a weight-tuning method. As a result, to search for the energy-optimal layer-wise approximation, ApproxiMorph explores only 0.44%&#8211;0.67% of all possible combinations, achieving a 28.06% power saving for additions with a 0.60% accuracy loss in comparison to the baseline SNN for MNIST. In the VGG16 for CIFAR-10, ApproxiMorph searches around  $10^{3}$  combinations from over  $10^{17}$  possible solutions, resulting in a 29.16% power saving with slight accuracy gain. Furthermore, integrating all methods enhances the accuracy of approximate implementations and demonstrates higher error resilience than accurate implementations.</description></item><item><title>Fraggle: Reducing File Fragmentation on DRAM-Less SSD</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142317</link><description>Mobile devices adopt DRAM-less solid-state storage drives (SSDs) as the flash storage to reduce power consumption and manufacturing costs, yet DRAM-less SSDs are significantly impacted by file fragmentation, thereby degrading the responsiveness of mobile devices. Existing methods to mitigate file fragmentation, including preallocation and defragmentation, face critical limitations. Preallocation prevents file fragmentation by reserving contiguous free logical block address (LBA) space for individual files. However, in the limited LBA space exposed by the SSD, contiguous free space is gradually consumed and fragmented by scattered data blocks, reducing the effectiveness of preallocation. Defragmentation recovers file access performance by reorganizing fragmented file layouts into contiguous ones. However, when applied to DRAM-less SSDs, defragmentation introduces excessive cache eviction of dirty mapping entries to the slow Nand flash, causing significant performance disruption. This article presents Fraggle, a host-device co-design that mitigates file fragmentation on DRAM-less SSDs by preserving the efficacy of preallocation within an extended LBA space. To effectively manage the extended LBA space, Fraggle introduces two key components: 1) HashFTL, a compact, cache-efficient flash translation layer (FTL) mapping mechanism specifically optimized for DRAM-less SSDs and 2) a device-assisted space allocator that simultaneously reduces space allocation overhead and resolves layout imbalance issues in HashFTL caused by sparse LBA distribution. Evaluation results demonstrate that, compared to F2FS and state-of-the-art preallocation methods, Fraggle accelerates execution time by up to  $9.26\times $  and  $8.07\times $  under SQLite and real-world mobile application workloads.</description></item><item><title>A Novel MDM-Based Optical Networks-on-Chip With Reliability Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11124572</link><description>Ever-increasing demands for lower power loss, shorter transmission delay, and higher communication capacity have been a challenge in optical networks-on-chips (ONoCs). To address this, various multiplexing technologies have been proposed and applied to optical interconnection networks. Among these, mode-division multiplexing (MDM) technology stands out for its ability to significantly enhance network throughput and reduce communication delays by simultaneously transmitting multiple-mode optical signals through a multimode waveguide, making it a compelling research area. In this article, we propose a flexible and scalable multimode optical switching element (MOSE) that adjusts transmitted optical signals by modifying its structure. A multimode optical router (MOR) based on the proposed MOSE is introduced, followed by the design of MDM-based optical mesh networks-on-chip (MMONoCs) that support parallel transmission of multiple TE-polarization mode optical signals. Additionally, loss and crosstalk models for multimode optical devices, including MOSE and MOR, are systematically established. In conclusion, the loss, optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR), and bit error rate (BER) for three TE-polarization modes (TE0, TE1, and TE2) at different network scales are analyzed using MOR as a specific example. The findings indicate that the scalability of MMONoC and its communication quality are mainly influenced by mode crosstalk noise. Furthermore, network performance metrics, including end-to-end (ETE) delay and throughput, are discussed based on two-mode (TE0, TE1) and three-mode (TE0, TE1, and TE2) optical signals at 1550 nm in  $4\times 4$  and  $5\times 5$  optical mesh networks. Simulation results demonstrate that MMONoC exhibits significant improvements in ETE delay and throughput compared to traditional single-mode optical modes.</description></item><item><title>Ultra Memory-Efficient On-FPGA Training of Transformers via Tensor-Compressed Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11121368</link><description>Transformer models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of machine learning tasks. There is growing interest in training transformers on resource-constrained edge devices due to considerations, such as privacy, domain adaptation, and on-device scientific machine learning. However, the significant computational and memory demands required for transformer training often exceed the capabilities of an edge device. Leveraging low-rank tensor compression, this paper presents the first on-FPGA accelerator for transformer training. On the algorithm side, we present a bi-directional contraction flow for tensorized transformer training, significantly reducing the computational FLOPS and intralayer memory costs compared to existing tensor operations. On the hardware side, we store all highly compressed model parameters and gradient information on chip, creating an on-chip-memory-only framework for each stage in training. This reduces off-chip communication and minimizes latency and energy costs. Additionally, we implement custom computing kernels for each training stage and employ intralayer parallelism and pipe-lining to further enhance run-time and memory efficiency. Through experiments on transformer models within 36.7 to 93.5 MB using forward propagation (FP)-32 data formats on the ATIS dataset, our tensorized FPGA accelerator could conduct single-batch end-to-end training on the AMD Alevo U50 FPGA, with a memory budget of less than 6-MB BRAM and 22.5-MB URAM. Compared to uncompressed training on the NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU, our on-FPGA training achieves a memory reduction of  $30 \times $  to  $51 \times $ . Our FPGA accelerator also achieves up to  $4.0 \times $  less energy cost per epoch compared with tensor transformer training on an NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU. As an initial result, this article highlights the significant potential of large-scale tensor training on edge devices.</description></item><item><title>A High-Area-Efficiency Computing-in-Memory Deep Learning Accelerator Based on Weight-Sparsity Activation Compression and Sparsity Reciprocity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11129944</link><description>The large number of parameters in deep neural networks (DNNs) poses significant challenges for resource-constrained hardware. To address this, researchers have focused on model sparsity to skip redundant computations and improve inference speed and computing-in-memory (CIM) techniques to reduce data transfer delays and lower energy consumption. However, leveraging activation sparsity within CIM macros remains challenging due to its architectural limitations, leading to bottlenecks in this research direction. This study proposes an activation compression method based on the CIM structure and weight sparsity, along with a new approach called sparse reciprocity, to enhance model sparsity. A high-area-efficiency CIM-based accelerator chip was developed using these techniques and prior expertise.

The aggressive scaling of technology nodes has further compromised circuit reliability in recent years, highlighting the need for effective aging mitigation techniques. Recent advancements in the miniaturization of nanoscale technology have demonstrated the potential of optimizing performance parameters in standard cells using machine learning (ML) models and optimization algorithms through device sizing modifications. Building on this progress, we propose a methodology for optimizing performance parameters in 16 nm high-performance (HP) FinFET for the first time. The approach leverages a multiobjective optimization algorithm framework to mitigate aging impacts across process, voltage, temperature (PVT) variations while addressing negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) and hot carrier injection (HCI) effects by optimally adjusting FinFET design parameters, including channel length (lg), width (tfin), and height (hfin). With SPICE simulations, time-series datasets were generated to train ML models that achieved an R2 score exceeding 0.99 and a mean absolute percentage error below 1% across standard cells. Our approach yields a significant simulation speedup and a reduction in simulation workload compared to traditional SPICE simulations. Using the proposed optimization algorithm framework, we improved the power-delay product (PDP) by up to 36.97% under nonaging conditions and 34.94% with aging considered with respect to the nominal dimension at the fresh year, demonstrating significant performance gains for FinFET-based standard cells. The experimental results on 12 distinct complex cells validate the aging mitigation across years.</description></item><item><title>NPEva: An NoC-Based Neuromorphic Processors Performance Evaluation Framework for Benchmarking Spiking Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11123508</link><description>spiking neural network (SNN) applications place diverse demands on neuromorphic processors&#8217; computational and communication capabilities. Specifically, the sparse parallel computation of SNNs requires storage systems capable of extensive parallel data access and processing. Additionally, the time-dependent nature of SNN computations demands a communication framework to manage spike transmission and synchronization. Addressing these requires continuous early stage evaluation of potential designs, which can be time-intensive. To this end, this article introduces a performance evaluation model for NoC-based neuromorphic processors, named NPEva, which includes a Computation Model (CpMo) and a communication model (CoMo). This model facilitates rapid, high-dimensional exploration of design spaces across a wide range of microarchitectural parameters. computation performance model (CpMo) quickly assesses computation-related latency, power consumption, and area by extracting relevant parameters from hierarchical storage organizations and neuron computation models. CoMo employs communication upper-bound latency analysis to evaluate packet latencies to reduce redundant synchronization time. Comparisons with TrueNorth&#8217;s publicly released data reveal that the model&#8217;s evaluation results are within an 8% error margin. The CoMo offers enhanced precision in estimating latency upper-bounds compared to other models like worst-contention delay (WCD) and worst-case traversal time (WCTT), especially when varying the number of VCs. With VC settings of 2, 4, 8, and 16, CoMo reduced latency by  $0.55\times $ &#8211; $2.53\times $  compared to WCTT and by  $0.83\times $ &#8211; $25.57\times $  compared to WCD. Additionally, using the NPEva model for exploring the design space of liquid state machines (LSMs) networks has shown that optimized hardware can improve cost efficiency by  $2.94\times $  with only a 1% increase in latency.</description></item><item><title>COMET-3D: Compute-in-Memory-Based Transformer Accelerator With Optimized Pipeline and 3D Heterogeneous Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11133480</link><description>Transformers have become the backbone of large language decoder and encoder models, but their compute- and memory-intensive nature makes them inefficient on traditional von Neumann architectures. Compute-in-memory (CIM) architectures offer a promising path forward by enabling in situ matrix operations and reducing memory access overhead. However, existing CIM-based accelerators suffer from: 1) unrealistic assumption of single-cycle activation of entire crossbar; 2) inefficient pipelines that are not optimized for operational unit (OU)-based execution; and 3) high analog-to-digital converter (ADC) cost. To address these limitations, we propose a latency-optimized pipeline tailored specifically for OU-based CIM execution and introduce COMET-3D&#8212;a 3D heterogeneous architecture that integrates static random-access memory (SRAM)- and ReRAM-based CIM arrays with a logic die containing digital MAC units and Softmax modules. The proposed architecture and dataflow maximize hardware utilization and enable efficient acceleration of the multihead self-attention (MHSA) layer. Experimental results across bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), generative pre-trained transformer (GPT2), and large language model meta AI (LLAMA) demonstrate that COMET-3D outperforms baseline architectures with similar compute resources by up to  $34\times $  in energy&#8211;delay product (EDP) for LLAMA, with gains of  $7.4\times $  for GPT2 and  $4.3\times $  for BERT-Large.</description></item><item><title>Binary Weight Multibit Activation Quantization for Compute-in-Memory CNN Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11112716</link><description>compute-in-memory (CIM) accelerators have emerged as a promising way for enhancing the energy efficiency of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Deploying CNNs on CIM platforms generally requires quantization of network weights and activations to meet hardware constraints. However, existing approaches either prioritize hardware efficiency with binary weight and activation quantization at the cost of accuracy, or utilize multibit weights and activations for greater accuracy but limited efficiency. In this article, we introduce a novel binary weight multibit activation (BWMA) method for CNNs on CIM-based accelerators. Our contributions include: deriving closed-form solutions for weight quantization in each layer, significantly improving the representational capabilities of binarized weights; and developing a differentiable function for activation quantization, approximating the ideal multibit function while bypassing the extensive search for optimal settings. Through comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, we show that BWMA achieves notable accuracy improvements over existing methods, registering gains of 1.44%&#8211;5.46% and 0.35%&#8211;5.37% on respective datasets. Moreover, hardware simulation results indicate that 4-bit activation quantization strikes the optimal balance between hardware cost and model performance.</description></item><item><title>Look-Up Table-Based Energy-Efficient Architecture for Neural Accelerators (LANA)</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11115133</link><description>Digital Von-Neumann implementations of neural accelerators are limited by high power consumption and area overheads, while Analog and non-CMOS implementations suffer from noise, device mismatch, and reliability issues. This article introduces a CMOS look-up table (LUT)-based architecture for neural accelerators (LANA) that reduces the power consumption and area overhead of conventional digital implementations through precomputed, faster LUT access while avoiding noise and mismatch challenges of analog circuits. To solve the scalability issues of conventional LUT-based computation, we use a divide-and-conquer (D&amp;amp;C) approach to split high-precision multiply accumulate (MAC) operations into lower-precision MAC. LANA achieves up to  $29.54 \times $  lower area with  $3.34 \times $  lower energy per inference task compared to traditional LUT (T-LUT)-based techniques and up to  $1.24 \times $  lower area with  $1.80 \times $  lower energy per inference task than conventional digital MAC (Wallace tree/array multipliers) without retraining and without affecting the accuracy of pretrained unpruned models, as well as on lottery ticket pruning (LTP) models that already reduce the number of required MAC operations by up to 98%. Finally, we introduce mixed precision analysis in the LANA framework for all LTP pruned and unpruned models (VGG11, VGG19, Resnet18, Resnet34, GoogleNet) that achieved up to  $29.59 \times $  (GoogleNet pruned)- $62.83 \times $  (VGG11 unpruned) lower area with  $3.34 \times $  (GoogleNet pruned)- $8.1 \times $  (VGG11 unpruned) lower energy per inference than T-LUT-based techniques, and up to  $1.24 \times $  (GoogleNet pruned)- $2.63 \times $  (VGG11 unpruned) lower area requirement with  $1.81 \times $  (GoogleNet pruned)- $4.37 \times $  (VGG11 unpruned) lower energy per inference across models as compared to conventional digital MAC-based techniques with ~1% accuracy loss relative to the baseline.</description></item><item><title>DCTDSE: A Bimodal Design Space Exploration Flow via Discrete&#8211;Continuous Transformation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11115145</link><description>The conservation core accelerator presents a promising avenue for improving the computational efficiency of specific applications. However, its design space is ultrahigh-dimensional, significantly increasing the exploratory effort required to identify the optimal design across performance, power, and area metrics. Furthermore, the discrete nature of the microarchitecture space renders conventional search methods ineffective. To tackle these challenges, we propose the discrete&#8211;continuous transformation to speedup design space exploration, namely, DCTDSE. It can operate in either offline or online mode. In offline mode, it transforms the original discrete design space into a continuous space, builds predictive models, performs parallel gradient-based optimization, and maps the results back to the discrete domain. In the online mode, DCTDSE refines the models by iteratively resampling previously found solutions, thereby enhancing exploration quality while maintaining moderate runtime overhead. Experimental results indicate that DCTDSE achieves a  $3.9{\times }$  to  $40{\times }$  speedup over benchmark methods in offline mode. In online mode, it provides a  $2.5{\times }$  speedup, with a 21% reduction in exploration quality relative to the most accurate comparison method.</description></item><item><title>MultiLens: A Multiobjective Adaptive DVFS Framework for Energy-Efficient DNN Inference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11121410</link><description>To tackle power management challenges in deep neural networks (DNNs), dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) has gained attention for its ability to enhance energy efficiency without modifying DNN structures. However, current DVFS methods, which rely on historical data, such as processor utilization and task load, suffer from issues like frequency ping-pong, response lag, and limited generalizability. These challenges are exacerbated by real-world scenarios that prioritize time, energy, or energy efficiency differently, making it even harder for existing methods to effectively configure DVFS under such multiobjective constraints or tradeoffs. This article presents multilens (MTL), a multiobjective adaptive DVFS framework. First, we propose a power-sensitive feature extraction method along with multiobjective constraint modeling to characterize DNN inference behavior. Second, critical power blocks are then identified through clustering based on inference behavior similarity, enabling adaptive DVFS instrumentation point settings. Moreover, to enhance the adaptability of multiple platforms and the flexibility of multiple scenarios, MTL integrates a complete deployment process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the MTL in optimizing energy efficiency across different hardware platforms and deployment scenarios.</description></item><item><title>An Analytical Model for Performance-Carbon Co-Optimization of Edge AI Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142328</link><description>Application-specified integrated circuit (ASIC) accelerators have emerged as vital solutions to deploy various AI workloads, especially in resource-constrained edge scenarios. Existing analytical models for guiding the architectural exploration of these accelerators focus solely on performance and energy efficiency metrics while overlooking the carbon cost. In contrast, existing carbon cost models focus on analyzing specific hardware configurations but lack the support for exploration of the optimal architecture choices and the tradeoff analysis between performance and carbon cost. To fill this gap, this brief aims to analyze the impact of different architecture configurations from both the performance and carbon perspectives, exploring the tradeoff between the performance and carbon cost for AI accelerator design. For this purpose, we first built an analytical model, named CarbonSpot, capable of modeling and estimating both performance and carbon cost for any accelerator architecture in the design space. Then, by benchmarking the overhead of these AI accelerators under MLPerf-Tiny and MLPerf-Mobile workloads, we show that architectures solely optimized for performance and energy efficiency produce  $58\times $  more carbon emissions than designs designed for the highest carbon efficiency. Importantly, co-optimized architectural choices exist, with only &lt;20% drop in performance and &lt;6% overhead in carbon costs when compared to the respective best cases optimized for either maximum performance or minimal carbon impact. The model is open-sourced at: https://github.com/KULeuven-MICAS/carbonspot</description></item><item><title>End-to-End Design Flow for Resistive Neural Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11121349</link><description>Neural hardware accelerators have demonstrated notable energy efficiency in tackling tasks, which can be adapted to artificial neural network (ANN) structures. Research is currently directed toward leveraging resistive random-access memories (RRAMs) among various memristive devices. In conjunction with complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technologies within integrated circuits (ICs), RRAM devices are used to build such neural accelerators. In this study, we present a neural accelerator hardware design and verification flow, which uses a lookup table (LUT)-based Verilog-A model of IHP&#8217;s one-transistor-one-RRAM (1T1R) cell. In particular, we address the challenges of interfacing between abstract ANN simulations and circuit analysis by including a tailored Python wrapper into the design process for resistive neural hardware accelerators. To demonstrate our concept, the efficacy of the proposed design flow, we evaluate an ANN for the MNIST handwritten digit recognition task, as well as for the CIFAR-10 image recognition task, with the last layer verified through circuit simulation. Additionally, we implement different versions of a 1T1R model, based on quasi-static measurement data, providing insights on the effect of conductance level spacing and device-to-device variability. The circuit simulations tackle both schematic and physical layout assessment. The resulting recognition accuracies exhibit significant differences between the purely application-level PyTorch simulation and our proposed design flow, highlighting the relevance of circuit-level validation for the design of neural hardware accelerators.</description></item><item><title>Super-Vth Standard Cells With Improved EDP: Design and Silicon Validation in 65nm LP CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119649</link><description>The ever-increasing computational load and shrinking power budget have accentuated the need for energy-efficient operation of edge devices. In this article, a combination of static CMOS logic and hybrid pass transistor logic with Static CMOS output (HPSC), which has no floating or weak nodes and is thus as robust to noise as static CMOS logic, is used for designing toolchain-compatible super- $\text {V}_{\text {th}}$  standard cells. Optimized HPSC variants of a 2/3-input XOR cell, a 2/3-input XNR cell, a half adder cell, a full adder cell, and two variants of a 1-bit multiply&#8211;accumulate combinational cell are presented in a commercial 65nm low-power CMOS technology. Measurements of test structures based on ring oscillators and dummy path techniques show an average frequency and average energy-delay product improvement of up to 30.3% and 32.5%, respectively, at typical conditions. The proposed cells&#8217; superior performance compared to the commercially available standard cells is also highlighted in terms of propagation delay, leakage, and dynamic power consumption. This shows a promising approach for foundries or other commercial entities to improve digital design performance to about half a technology node at no additional cost.</description></item></channel></rss>
