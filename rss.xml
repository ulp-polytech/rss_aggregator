It is found that compared with the ideal CLLC resonant converter without considering drain-source capacitance, a tiny drain-source capacitance would lead to a significant reduction in the voltage boost gain within the below-resonant region. Moreover, the influence of drain-source capacitance on boost-gain reduction increases with the increasing resonant frequency and drain-source capacitance of the converter. It indicates that the effect of the drain-source capacitance must be taken into consideration when designing the resonant frequency and resonant tanks of the CLLC resonant converter. This work facilitates the understanding of the operating principle and voltage gain characteristics of CLLC resonant converters, and provides the knowledge base with new rules and methods for parameter design of the CLLC resonant converter. Detailed theoretical analysis has been carried out, and the influence of drain-source capacitance has been verified with both simulation and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Single-Driver Series-Parallel IGBTs Solid State Circuit Breaker Component</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11052878</link><description>Solid-state dc circuit breaker (SSCB) has become a key component for fast fault isolation in high-voltage dc systems. However, their effectiveness often relies on complex series and parallel connections of numerous switches. To address the low flexibility and redundancies problems inherent in conventional circuit breakers, this article proposes a single-drive series&#8211;parallel insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) all-solid-state dc circuit breaker component (SCBC). The innovative approach can precisely control multiple series and parallel IGBTs by using only one gate driver and a small number of passive components. In this novel configuration, a shutdown signal triggers the first-stage IGBTs. Once activated, the energy storage capacitor causes the subsequent IGBTs to shut down continuously. In SCBC, the main switches are connected in series and parallel, the breaking current capability is improved. In particular, the componentized design concept makes the topology is extensible and enhances the flexibility of SSCBs. Finally, the operating principle and design guidelines of SCBC are illustrated in detail through the creation of a mathematical model and topology, and their effectiveness is demonstrated through simulation and experimentation.</description></item><item><title>Direct Synthesis Based Centralized PI Controller Design for Single Inductor Multioutput (SIMO) Buck Converter to Alleviate Cross Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11059999</link><description>The main control challenge in the single inductor multioutput buck converter (SIMOBC) is the cross-regulation in the output voltages. To alleviate this cross-regulation, a centralized frequency domain PI controller design methodology based on direct synthesis for SIMOBC is presented. In this method, the controller parameter is evaluated by comparing the closed loop transfer function (CLTF) matrix of the SIMOBC model with the desired CLTF matrix. The desired CLTF is considered as a diagonal matrix to achieve no cross-regulation in the output voltages. The diagonal element of the desired CLTF matrix is selected to have the desired closed-loop dynamics of the individual output of the SIMOBC. The controller is further approximated as a PI controller by frequency response matching at low frequency point. To validate the proposal, two cases are considered, i.e., single inductor dual output and single inductor three output buck converter. The performance of the proposed scheme is investigated using both MATLAB simulations and hardware experiments involving both the converters. Results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.</description></item><item><title>Minimum Loss Trajectory Modulation for Single-Stage SR-DAB Based DC/AC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11058464</link><description>Single-stage dc/ac converter is increasingly adopted in photovoltaic inverters, energy storage systems and electric vehicle chargers due to its high flexibility, high efficiency and low cost. This article introduces a minimum loss trajectory modulation strategy for single-stage SR-DAB based dc/ac converter. By establishing the precise model for the loss of the converter, the operation efficiency is optimized in a 2-D optimization procedure. The two operation modes of the optimized trajectory handle the heavy load and light load operating modes, respectively, which can achieve the highest converter efficiency in the 50-Hz grid cycle. In addition, to solve the problem caused by the discontinuous modulation variables, a seamless mode switching strategy is proposed. An 500-W prototype is implemented, with rated voltage of 48 V on dc side and 220-Vrms on ac side. Experimental results validate the theoretical analysis and the practical feasibility of proposed modulation strategy.</description></item><item><title>An LLC Resonant Converter With Symmetric Pulse-Width Balancing and Fixed-Period Hysteresis Burst Control for High Efficiency Over Full Load Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11028878</link><description>This article presents a high-efficiency LLC resonant converter with an integrated controller. To speed up the transient response, hybrid hysteresis charge (HHC) control is applied. However, identical ramp currents for control compensation pose challenges in precise current matching, leading to output current discrepancies and reduced device lifespan. Furthermore, LLC converter efficiency declines under light load conditions due to increased switching losses. To address the above problems, the proposed controller operates in three modes: high power mode (HPM), low power mode (LPM), and ultralow power mode. HHC control combined with an innovative symmetric pulsewidth balancing technique for accurate ramp compensation currents matching is used in HPM. Fixed-period hysteresis burst control is applied in LPM while minimizing audible noise. An ultralow power mode is incorporated to maintain performance under ultralight load conditions. Experimental results from a prototype converter with an input voltage range from 365 ${V}_{\mathrm{DC}}$ to 410 ${V}_{\mathrm{DC}}$, an output voltage of 24 ${V}_{\mathrm{DC}}$, and an output power range from 2.4 W to 240 W demonstrate a peak efficiency of 95.37% at an output current of 5 A and an input voltage of 410 V. At an ultralight load of 0.1 A with an input voltage of 365 V, the circuit remains 89.05% efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Active Fault-Tolerant Control for Three-Level T-Type Converter With Unbalanced Neutral-Point Voltage Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11024150</link><description>The rectifier and inverter in the T-type back-to-back converter are interconnected via a capacitance with a dc-link midpoint. Faults in the inverter switches of the converter will result in current distortion, load power loss, and dc voltage unbalance, which subsequently impact rectifier operation and grid power quality. While many studies have focused on achieving complete inner switch fault tolerance in three-level inverters, outer switch faults have typically required additional redundant hardware elements or modifications to control references to reduce output voltage amplitude. This article proposes an active fault-tolerant control (FTC) method for three-level T-type converters with unbalanced neutral-point (NP) voltage modulation to tolerate outer switch faults. The rectifier actively induces the unbalanced NP voltage by injecting zero-sequence components and providing sufficient dc voltage support for the inverter&#8217;s voltage synthesis. The inverter&#8217;s separated phase FTC uses healthy legs to achieve the faulty phase voltage synthesis and injects zero-sequence components to fully exploit the dc voltage. This active FTC method avoids the use of faulty switches, maintaining normal converter operation. Hardware-in-the-loop testing results demonstrate that the output ac current harmonics are less than 5% and the dc voltage ripples are less than 4%, verifying that the FTC achieves higher performance under various load conditions.</description></item><item><title>Single-Phase and Evaporating Two-Phase Flow Microchannel Cooling of Power Modules for Temporary Overcurrent Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029139</link><description>Evaporating two-phase flows are usually avoided in cooling applications due to the potential inception of flow instabilities, which result in worse cooling performance. However, the substantial latent heat of liquid evaporation presents a compelling source in power electronics cooling when temporary overcurrent is needed. In this study, we utilise water evaporation to enhance the cooling performance under temporary module overcurrent conditions, while the water remains in its liquid phase during nominal operation. The proof-of-concept is demonstrated for a Si IGBT/diode half-bridge module cooled with a microchannel array integrated below the direct bonded copper ceramic. The microchannel cooling solution is evaluated in terms of reduction in the junction-to-case thermal resistance and of an increase in the temporary overcurrent capability. The thermal resistance is extracted for different flow rates using Simcenter Micred Power Tester. Infrared and visible spectrum cameras are used to simultaneously record the junction temperature and the evaporating flow in the microchannel array. Flow regimes with parts of individual channels occupied by the flow of vapor have been observed in the overcurrent duration, resulting in heat transported downstream from the chip location, where liquid evaporates, to the outlet of the manifold. Results indicate that evaporation enhances the cooling performance for the tested conditions, with no signs of boiling crisis in the microchannel flow.</description></item><item><title>Frequency-Domain Modeling of Electrical Insulation and Application to High-Voltage Power Electronics: A Review</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11051010</link><description>Modern power applications, such as high-voltage direct current transmission, electrified transportation, and industrial systems, increasingly rely on wide-bandgap semiconductors, driving the need for electrical insulation systems capable of withstanding high electric fields and switching voltage waveforms.

However, one potential problem is that the dc-side total capacitor ripple current (TCRC) is considerable, which induces capacitor heating and compromises converter reliability. This article presents a Fourier analysis based dual phase-optimized strategy that considers the constraints of phase shift angle (PSA) in DAB converter, aiming to minimize the root mean square (rms) of the lowest frequency harmonic current (LFHC) in TCRC. First, a mathematical model is developed for the single phase (1P) converter, comprising a frequency domain analytical expression of the ripple current and the PSA adjustable range of 1P converter. Subsequently, using the developed model, the initial phase relationships among the three 1P converters are adjusted at the minimum symmetrical interval (30&#176;) of the power grid cycle. Concurrently, the PSA of converters are dynamically optimized at each switching cycle, thereby achieving maximal attenuation of the LFHC. Experimental validation using a 3&#215;1.1-kW prototype demonstrates a 90% reduction in the rms of the LFHC under rated conditions.</description></item><item><title>Enhanced Observer With Series-Correction for Active Disturbance Rejection Control in DAB Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11023614</link><description>The power supply for pulsed power loads demands exceptional dynamic performance, requiring fast and precise regulation of the output voltage. Active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) with a linear extended state observer (LESO) stands out among control strategies due to its model independence and simplified parameter design. A crucial element of ADRC is the LESO, which effectively tracks total disturbances with limited system information. However, the LESO&#8217;s tracking speed is constrained by the crossover frequency, and it exhibits significant steady-state errors when disturbances take the form of ramp, acceleration, or sinusoidal function. To enhance the speed and accuracy of disturbance tracking, a series-correction-based LESO incorporating an incomplete differential proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is proposed for an ADRC-controlled dual active bridge (DAB) converter. The proposed optimized LESO offers a faster dynamic response and smaller steady-state errors compared to traditional LESO. Additionally, the article addresses system stability and parameter optimization for the improved converter. The effectiveness of the optimized LESO design is validated using a 500W DAB experimental prototype, demonstrating excellent dynamic response and low susceptibility to parameter variations.</description></item><item><title>Characterization of Impedance and Stability for Doubly-Fed Induction Generator Based on Voltage-Modulated Direct Power Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029154</link><description>Voltage-modulated direct power control (VM-DPC) applied to the doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) offers superior steady-state and transient performance but remains underexplored for suppressing wideband oscillations. This article proposes a comprehensive impedance for the VM-DPC-based DFIG, analyzing its impedance characteristics and stability mechanisms compared with the DFIG based on vector-oriented control (VOC). The unified power transfer function is defined for DFIGs employing VM-DPC or VOC to ensure consistent comparison benchmarks. The comprehensive impedance of VM-DPC-based DFIG, incorporating mechanical and grid-side converter (GSC) dynamics, is derived using complex vector modeling in the $\alpha \beta$-frame. Furthermore, the influence of VM-DPC parameters and grid strength on the stability of grid-connected DFIG systems is assessed through eigenvalue trajectory analysis. Impedance analysis reveals the significant contributions of mechanical and GSC dynamics to DFIG impedance, as well as the narrower frequency range of negative resistance in the VM-DPC-based DFIG compared to the VOC-based DFIG. Stability analysis identifies the VM-DPC parameters of the rotor-side converter as dominant factors affecting system stability and confirms that the VM-DPC-based DFIG achieves better stability under weak grid conditions than its VOC-based counterpart. These findings are validated through simulations and experiments.</description></item><item><title>Fault-Tolerant Multiport Quadruple Active Bridge Converter for Resilient Interconnection of Bipolar DC Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029183</link><description>In this article, a fault-tolerant quadruple-transformer quadruple-active-bridge (QT-QAB) converter is proposed for resilient interconnection of bipolar dc systems. During normal operation, the proposed QT-QAB can achieve power balancing at both high-voltage (HV) and low-voltage (LV) bipolar systems. In the event of a monopolar short-circuit fault, the QT-QAB can isolate the faulty pole on the LV side. As a result, the HV bipolar dc system and the LV healthy pole can maintain an uninterrupted power supply during the LV short-circuit fault. The circuit parameter design and control strategy are analyzed with consideration of zero-voltage-switching soft switching, bipolar balancing, and fault isolation capability. The proposed topology is compared with traditional QAB, DAB, and HFB-QAB topologies in terms of current stress, efficiency, and cost. Based on comparative simulations and experimental results, the bipolar balancing and fault-tolerant operation capabilities of QT-QAB are validated.</description></item><item><title>Magnetic Integration With Controllable Leakage Inductance and Unbalanced Current Suppression for CF DAB Converter Based on Single EE Core</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11028887</link><description>A magnetic integrated structure based on single EE core (SEEC) is proposed to integrate all magnetic elements in current-fed dual active bridge (CF DAB) converter to improve power density. Different from previous works, all magnetic components of CF DAB, including two dc inductors, a transformer and a leakage inductance, are integrated in a SEEC. Moreover, the parameters of inductances and turns ratio can be accurately controlled by designing the number of winding turns and the air gap length. Furthermore, the unbalanced current suppression performance of the two interleaved dc inductors for CF DAB is improved due to the natural negative coupling between the two outer leg windings of the SEEC. In addition, based on the SEEC structure, an SEEC DAB converter is derived. Finally, the validity of the proposed solutions is verified by simulated results from Maxwell finite-element analysis and experimental results from a 1-kW laboratory prototype. Compared with CF DAB, the power density and efficiency are improved by 71% and 2.14%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Dual-Channel Gate Driver With Short-Circuit Protection for Series-Connected Medium-Voltage SiC MOSFETs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11031131</link><description>The dual-channel gate driver (D-GD) is widely employed in the industry to support the extensive adoption of half-bridge power modules. With the growing popularity of silicon-carbide (SiC) devices in medium-voltage (MV) scenarios known for their superior switching performance compared to traditional silicon counterparts, this article proposes a comprehensive D-GD design tailored for MV SiC mosfet half-bridge power module. To overcome the constraints imposed by the limited voltage ratings of power devices in high-voltage applications, unlike the traditional D-GD that operates by switching the two devices complementarily, the proposed D-GD is designed to switch them synchronously, aggregating the half-bridge module into a single device with doubled voltage rating. To achieve this, not only does the balanced voltage sharing of two series-connected devices need to be guaranteed, but also the effective short-circuit (SC) protection for series connection needs to be ensured, which is rarely covered in existing literature. Hence, in addition to essential gate driver features such as cross-talk suppression, gate protection, etc., the proposed D-GD incorporates an active voltage balancing circuit to realize balanced voltage sharing. Furthermore, a novel hybrid SC protection design for series connection is seamlessly integrated, achieving faster SC detection and more effective SC protection. The experimental results with a 3.3-kV / 750-A half-bridge SiC mosfet power module are presented, validating its operational performance.</description></item><item><title>A Wide-Input High Step-Up Resonant Converter With High-Ratio Transformer in High-Voltage Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11031226</link><description>This article uses a transformer and a resonant network to present an isolated dc/dc resonant converter with a step-up ratio of tens to hundreds of times.

This article proposes a four-level discontinuous pulsewidth modulation (4L-DPWM) to reduce the switching loss of inverters by clamping the switching state of one phase, and the dc-link capacitor voltage balancing is achieved as well. First, the subsector division is optimized. In each subsector, the switching-state sequence consists of five basic vectors that clamp the phase with the highest current under the unity power factor condition. Then, voltage balancing equations are derived and considered when calculating the dwelling times of five basic vectors. As a result, the switching loss is reduced, and the dc-link capacitor voltage is balanced. Finally, A 6-kVA three-phase four-level inverter prototype is built to conduct experiments. Experimental results show that the proposed 4L-DPWM scheme can effectively balance the capacitor voltage and achieve higher efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Communication-Free Carrier Synchronization High-Frequency Circulating Current Suppression Method Based on Reference Prediction for Parallel Power Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11039098</link><description>Parallel power converter system (PCS) have emerged as a promising solution to reconcile the growing demand for high-power applications with the limited capacity of individual converters. However, in paralleled PCS configurations sharing common dc and ac buses, carrier asynchronization (CA) poses a critical challenge to system performance. CA induces periodic fluctuations in zero sequence circulating current (ZSCC) amplitude proportional to carrier phase deviations, thereby degrading system stability and operational efficiency. To this end, a comprehensive ZSCC analytical model is first established to characterize dynamic interactions among parallel converters, which reveals the detailed relation between CA and ZSCC. Then, a novel reference prediction-based communication-free carrier synchronization method based on reference prediction is developed to suppress ZSCC. It shows strong robustness against grid frequency transients and voltage harmonic distortions. The effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method is verified by simulations and experiments.</description></item><item><title>Machine Learning-Based Forward Design Approach for Grid-Connected Inverters With Enhanced Stability and Dynamic Performance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045836</link><description>Grid-connected inverter (GCI) is extensively utilized in renewable energy power systems. However, these systems are prone to cascaded instability when connected to the power grid, even if both the inverter and the grid are stable themselves. To achieve an integrated design that considers cascaded stability and dynamic response, this article proposes a forward design method for GCI based on machine learning, aiming to design the control parameters including phase-locked loop and current loop controllers. First, based on the theoretical model of few samples, the impedance feasible region is rapidly trained by improved K-nearest neighbor and random forest (RF) algorithms, as well as the preliminary feasible samples are obtained. Second, the neighborhood of preliminary feasible samples is searched based on the trained impedance feasible region, thus further obtaining the parameter feasible region. Compared with the theoretical model-driven method, the proposed method achieves rapid design by few samples, which has low complexity and fast computation speed. Finally, the experimental verifications are carried out on a 5 kW inverter prototype, validating the effectiveness of the proposed design method.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Control of a Three-Phase Five-Port Partially Isolated DC&#8211;DC Converter for DC-Powered Commercial Buildings</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045542</link><description>Integrating low-voltage, high-power energy sources and energy storage devices into medium voltage (e.g., $\mathbf {380}\,\text{V}$) dc microgrids presents significant challenges due to the need for high-current and high-gain power conversion. This paper proposes a five-port, partially-isolated dc&#8211;dc converter to efficiently interface solar photovoltaics (PV), battery, fuel cell, and supercapacitor with a $\mathbf {380}\,\text{V}$ dc bus. At the core of the proposed topology is a current-fed asymmetrical three-phase triple active bridge structure, which results in a higher order system, making its modeling and controller design challenging. To address this, a simplified small-signal modeling approach and a proportional&#8211;integral controller-based control scheme are proposed, enabling seamless operation of the converter under any energy management scheme (EMS). Further, a limiter-based novel autonomous power adjustment strategy is introduced to manage substantial load/PV power variations between consecutive EMS updates. The topology reduces power conversion stages, requires $\mathbf {4\%}$ fewer semiconductor switches, uses $\mathbf {20\%}$ fewer magnetic cores per phase and port compered to existing equivalent fully-isolated and partially-isolated converters. It also lowers the load bus voltage undershoot/overshoot by almost 10 times for the same percentage of load change. The experimental validation on a $\mathbf {2}\,\text{kW}$ laboratory-scale prototype confirms the effectiveness of the control strategy and overall system performance.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-High-Gain Interleaved Boost Converter With Low Electric Stress for 800 V Standalone Photovoltaic Charging System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11051008</link><description>This article proposes a novel family of transformerless, ultra-high-gain interleaved boost converters for efficient, reliable, and cost-effective operation in standalone 800 V photovoltaic charging systems.

However, the traditional equalizers exhibit drawbacks such as large size, low efficiency, and a single equalization function. Therefore, an adaptive and efficient equalization topology based on a bidirectional flyback transform is proposed. The single winding flyback converter bidirectional excitation mechanism is introduced, and only one converter is needed for the whole circuit, realizing low cost and high efficiency equalization. Using odd&#8211;even cell grouping control to drive bidirectional excitation, both cell-to-pack and pack-to-cell equalization paths are achieved. Furthermore, three modes, including charging, discharging, and automatic equalization, are supported, making it possible to flexibly choose the suitable equalization approach to achieve fast equalization. Finally, a battery pack experimental platform was built. The results showed that the average equalization efficiency is more than 95%. The voltage difference of the batteries is less than 5 mV after equalization, significantly improving the consistency of the pack.

To enhance the robustness of the controlled system, model-free predictive control is singled out as an alternative solution. However, conventional model-free predictive control method based on ultralocal model still relies on inductance parameters during the design process, and capacitance parameters are also necessary for neutral point voltage balancing. The dependence on parameters leads to a reduction in the robustness of the control method. To address this issue, a novel model-free predictive control approach based on an online neural network approximator is proposed, which combines neural network predictor with adaptive filtering theory. Meanwhile, the neutral point voltage prediction is achieved through the implementation of an adaptive solution. Notably, this method is completely independent of system parameters. Hence, in the face of changes in system operating conditions, the input gain can be adaptively adjusted. Furthermore, the stability of the system is proven. Finally, experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in power converter control.</description></item><item><title>A Mixed Conduction Mode Control Strategy Based on Fixed Turn-off Time for Totem-Pole PFC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029073</link><description>This article proposes a mixed conduction mode (MCM) control strategy based on a fixed turn-off time (FOT) to address the issues of low light-load efficiency, poor power factor, and high current stress in the single-mode operation of the totem-pole power factor correction (PFC) converter. This strategy enables hybrid operation between discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) and continuous conduction mode (CCM) within a half-line cycle. By FOT of the transistor, the switching boundary between DCM and CCM is clearly defined, enabling adaptive mode switching in accordance with output power. Furthermore, a DCM/CCM turn-on time prediction model has been developed to unify the DCM/CCM control loops, thereby ensuring stable MCM operation. Finally, a 1500-W-rated prototype totem-pole PFC converter has been designed to validate the effectiveness of the control strategy. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the ideal critical conduction mode operation, the proposed control strategy effectively reduces the current stress of the converter, and the peak value of the inductance current is reduced by 16.1% at full load. In comparison to the traditional CCM control, the proposed control strategy significantly enhances the light-load performance of the converter, achieving a maximum improvement of 11.6% in light-load efficiency, a 0.295 increase in power factor, and 7.1% decrease in iTHD.</description></item><item><title>Improvement of Electromagnetic-Thermal Characteristics in a Modular In-Wheel Motor Under Open-Circuit Faults and Asymmetric Working Winding Operations Based on Fault-Tolerant Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045224</link><description>Multiunit modular in-wheel motors have a high utilization rate of remaining healthy windings and a high-power density during fault-tolerant (FT) operations. However, when the open-circuit faulty motor operates with FT control, the working windings are asymmetric in the circumferential space, which will cause some problems, such as decreased electromagnetic characteristics and local windings with a higher temperature.

Finally, the influence of different power amplifier output filtering conditions on the load branch is analyzed, and the overall design process is given.</description></item><item><title>Extending the Strong-Coupling Region and Enhancing the Power Conversion Capability of the Conventional Three-Coil Pseudo-Hermitian WPT System by Using Double Receivers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11023022</link><description>Pseudo-Hermitian wireless power transfer (WPT) system relaxes the rigid symmetry constraints of the parity-time WPT system. However, with series-compensation coils, the conventional three-coil pseudo-Hermitian WPT system has two limitations. One is that it exhibits a limited transfer efficiency under a low load coefficient. The other is if a full-bridge inverter is used to implement the negative resistance, the system&#8217;s output power reaches its minimum at the bifurcation point with a maximum transfer efficiency, significantly restricting the system performance. In this article, a novel double-receiver pseudo-Hermitian WPT system incorporating an intermediate coil is proposed. Compared with the conventional system under the same load, the proposed system has two advantages. One is if the load coefficient is low, using double decoupled RXs can extend the strong-coupling region and enhance the steady transfer efficiency. The other is that a well-designed cross-coupling can be leveraged to enhance the power conversion capability, and circumvent the binary choice between the steady transfer efficiency and the output power. Experimental results demonstrate that by using the proposed system with double decoupled RXs, the strong-coupling region can be extended and the steady transfer efficiency can be enhanced. Experimental results also demonstrate that a few times enhancement in the power conversion capability can be achieved by leveraging the cross-coupling between the double RXs.</description></item><item><title>A Self-Powered Bipolar Rectifierless Series-SSHI Circuit With Dual-Polarity Energy Extraction for Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11027470</link><description>This article presents a self-powered, bipolar, rectifierless series synchronized switch harvesting on inductor (BiReL-SSHI) interface circuit for piezoelectric energy harvesting. At both the positive and negative peaks of the piezoelectric transducer (PZT) voltage, a synchronous switch is automatically activated, enabling energy transfer from the PZT to a storage capacitor, while the inductor simultaneously inverts the PZT voltage for the next half cycle. Compared to conventional full-bridge rectifiers (FBRs) and series synchronized switch harvesting on inductor circuits, the BiReL-SSHI topology employs fewer components by optimizing the positive and negative synchronous switches, thereby reducing power loss and improving energy extraction efficiency. Experimental results show that the BiReL-SSHI achieves a 5.4&#215; improvement in power extraction compared to an FBR, when the open-circuit voltage ($V_{\mathrm{oc}}$) of the PZT is 8 V. Furthermore, in scenarios where a high $V_{\mathrm{oc}}$ is converted to a low output voltage, the BiReL-SSHI achieves superior energy transfer efficiency compared to other interface circuits. Experimental results further demonstrate that at a 3.3 V output under identical vibration conditions, the BiReL-SSHI delivers 5.86&#215; higher output power than the FBR.</description></item><item><title>An Energy Harvesting Interface Based on Reconfigurable Piezoelectric Harvester Array</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11028637</link><description>This article presents a reconfigurable piezoelectric harvester array (RPA) designed for multi-input systems, which dynamically configures its structure based on the intensity of ambient vibrations.

The transient performance of the system is seriously impacted by the presence of the RHPz, particularly when the RHPz is situated near the origin. Recent research has demonstrated that the effects of the RHPz can be mitigated to improve transient output performance by reducing the input capacitance of the Buck converter. However, excessively decreasing the input capacitance may cause the system&#8217;s resonant peak to cross the 0 dB line in the frequency domain, leading to a &#8722;180&#176; phase shift and potential instability. Reducing bandwidth is necessary to keep the system stable, but this approach compromises the Buck converter&#8217;s transient performance. To address the resonant peak issue associated with small input capacitance, this research proposes an active damping control technique, which includes input capacitor voltage feedback and appropriate damping design. This strategy significantly enhances transient performance and increases system bandwidth. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is validated through simulations and experiments.</description></item><item><title>A Vertical Overlapping Decoupled Coil for Wireless Power Transfer With High Interoperability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11066263</link><description>Wireless power transfer technology has received extensive attention from scholars around the world in recent years.

However, for the PSFB WPT system, switching loss is a key factor affecting the system efficiency. Single-side PSFB can regulate the power, but hard switching results in low efficiency and EMI problems. Dual-side PSFB can realize ZVS throughout a wide power range, but at the cost of high conduction loss and turn-off loss at light load.

Model-based control is widely used in converters due to its ease, but it poses challenges when dealing with inaccurate models, critical loads, and multidisturbances.

Their flexibility comes from the possibility to store hydrogen, decoupling electric consumption from hydrogen demand. Therefore, they can help in the integration of more renewable energies by the provision of grid services, such as frequency regulation. Alkaline electrolyzers (AELs) are the most mature and cost effective technology for large-scale hydrogen applications. However, their slow dynamics do not allow a fast response. Therefore, their combination with energy storage systems (ESSs) into hybrid hydrogen systems (HHSs) enhances their flexibility and fast response for frequency regulation. Supercapacitors (SCs) are suitable ESS technology in this application due to the high power and low energy required. A decentralized dynamic power sharing control is proposed for an AEL/SC HHS to provide frequency regulation with scalability. The control strategy respects the slow dynamics of the AEL, while the use of the SC is optimized by the automatic recovery of the dc bus voltage and SC state of charge (SoC). The decentralized approach of the control strategy enables easy expansion of the system, essential for large-scale hydrogen systems. The effectiveness of the method in large-scale power systems, as well as its scalability is shown in simulation results.

However, while operating as a voltage source that is synchronized via active power regulation, the GFM converter exhibits insufficient damping, particularly when synthetic inertia is incorporated for frequency support. To address this concern, this article has developed active-damping control schemes using fractional-order regulators. Differing from the existing control approaches, which may significantly alter the inertial response quantified using an inertia constant, the proposed controls are developed to introduce adequate damping for both power set-point tracking and external disturbances, while maintaining the original explicit relationship between the GFM converter's inertial response and the inertia constant. In this context, a preferable inertial response, precisely defined by the inertia constant as specified by certain grid codes, along with adequate damping, is achieved simultaneously. The effectiveness of the proposed controls has been validated though both theoretical analyses and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Design-Oriented Small-Signal Stability Assessment of Grid-Following Inverter-Based Resources Based on Virtual Dynamic Short-Circuit Ratio</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856703</link><description>Small-signal instability may occur when parallel grid-following inverter-based resources (IBRs) are connected to a grid with low strength, i.e., a weak grid. In such a weak grid, changes in output power and the number of IBRs can significantly impact the small-signal stability margin. However, the short-circuit ratios (SCRs) currently used for small-signal stability assessment of the IBR plant are static indices, and the difference in the IBR plant impedance with different total output power is not considered, resulting in inaccurate stability assessment results. Moreover, the stability margin expressed by the existing SCRs under different operating conditions is not unified. Therefore, the virtual dynamic short-circuit ratio (VDSCR) is proposed in this article, which converts the stability margin of the IBR plant under different working conditions to the rated single IBR unit, so that the proposed VDSCR is accurate and unified. Based on the VDSCR, the IBRs control is designed under the fluctuation of total output power and grid impedance, which can keep the small-signal stability margin at the set value. While ensuring the small-signal stability of the IBR plant, the control performance of the IBRs is further optimized through the control design based on VDSCR. Finally, experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Optimal FNN-Based Energy Management System With High Real-Time Performance and Good Interpretability for Battery in Grid-Connected Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10858356</link><description>In this article, a novel energy management system (EMS) is presented for a grid-connected microgrid using the fuzzy neural network (FNN), aiming to minimize the mismatch between renewable power generation and load power demand in the microgrid by controlling the battery charge/discharge power in real time, so as to effectively promote the local consumption of renewable energy.

The dc&#8211;dc circuit provides isolated low-impedance channels for automatically clamping dc-link voltages. This ensures the linear voltage regulation in normal state and immediate short-circuit-current blocking under fault condition. As compared to the prior arts, the proposal achieves: 1) linear voltage regulations in wide range through step-up and step-down operations guided by pulse width modulation without any dead zones; 2) immediate dc fault blocking by deenergizing short circuit loop rather than by interrupting the current, thereby avoiding spike and stickiness issues; and 3) around 0.5% enhancement in power efficiency due to the fully resonant dc&#8211;dc unit with low switching losses, and the substitution of the two anti-series switch in dc breaker by the one in reversal-blocking unit. The entire system achieves the maximal power efficiency of 98.93%. The feasibility of the proposal is fully confirmed by the experiments rated at 350-V 3.5-kW.</description></item><item><title>A Multifunctional Arc Suppression Device Based on Hybrid Grid-Connected Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856704</link><description>Since the voltage amplitude of the arc suppression device is different during the normal operation and single line-to-ground fault, the problems of high cost and low module utilization rate are serious. An integrated grid-connected converter (IGCC) with reactive power compensation and fault regulation ability is proposed. First, the topology and operation mechanism of IGCC are introduced in this article. A common unit combining neutral point clamped (NPC) and cascaded H-bridge is formed by improving the traditional arc suppression device. By adding a fourth leg in the NPC module and connecting with the arc suppression inductance, the integration of the two structures is realized. The access of NPC unit not only reduces the number of modules of traditional arc suppression device, but also provides an integrated port for arc suppression device and reactive power compensation device. Second, the parameters of active and passive part of IGCC are optimally designed to ensure the stable operation of IGCC. In addition, compared with existing schemes, the superiority of IGCC in cost and volume is proved. Finally, the correctness, feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed topology and functions are verified by the simulation and experiment results.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Modeling of Battery-Based Energy Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10869498</link><description>This article presents a data-driven modeling methodology applied to a battery-based power system comprising a power converter and an electric machine. The proposed method captures the dynamics describing the complete system and allows the identification of its parameters without the need for any explicit theoretical model of the components. In particular, the proposed approach considers the battery as the supplying element of a broader system comprising power electronics converters and direct-current motors, paying special attention to the battery open-circuit voltage curve estimation. This approach successfully yields a state-space representation that optimally describes the more essential variables, such as motor speed and output voltages of the converter and battery. Consequently, the proposed approach allows the generation of higher-order models representing transient and rapid dynamics and facilitates the identification of parameters that define reduced-order models describing slower dynamics. This streamlines the implementation of adaptive control strategies, providing an effective tool for their development and execution.</description></item><item><title>Attention-Based UAV Trajectory Optimization for Wireless Power Transfer-Assisted IoT Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10879146</link><description>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in wireless power transfer (WPT)-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) systems face the following challenges: limited resources and suboptimal trajectory planning. Reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning schemes face issues of low search efficiency and learning instability when optimizing large-scale systems. To address these issues, we present an attention-based UAV trajectory optimization (AUTO) framework based on the graph transformer, which consists of an attention trajectory optimization model (ATOM) and a trajectory lEarNing method based on actor&#8211;critic (TENMA). In ATOM, a graph encoder is used to calculate the self-attention characteristics of all IoTDs, and a trajectory decoder is developed to optimize the number and trajectories of UAVs. TENMA then trains the ATOM using an improved actor&#8211;critic method, in which the real reward of the system is applied as the baseline to reduce variances in the critic network. This method is suitable for high-quality and large-scale multi-UAV trajectory planning. Finally, we develop numerous experiments, including a hardware experiment in the field case, to verify the feasibility and efficiency of the AUTO framework.</description></item><item><title>Assessment of the DSC Technique for Positive-Sequence Extraction in Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10858480</link><description>In the context of electrical power systems, where nonlinear loads, power converters, and exogenous disturbances can significantly distort electrical signals, there remains a critical need to accurately extract signal parameters useful for various essential tasks, including monitoring, synchronization, and protection. Traditionally, a positive-sequence filter, often based on the well-established Park filter, has been used to mitigate these disturbances. However, the delayed signal cancellation technique (DSC) has gained prominence as a viable alternative, offering similar advantages to the Park filter, but without the need for phase feedback. This growing interest in DSC has led to numerous studies that aim to refine its original concept. However, these efforts have not comprehensively evaluated the DSC alongside the Park filter to discern and quantify its benefits and drawbacks. Inspired by the fact that the DSC exhibits spectral replica, characterized by high-gain repeating side lobes in its frequency response, this article aims to conduct a thorough comparative analysis between the DSC technique and the conventional Park filter. The primary objective is to quantitatively evaluate both approaches in positive-sequence extraction tasks, thereby shedding light on their practical advantages in scenarios marked by signal distortion and perturbations.</description></item><item><title>A Fault-Tolerant Control for Hybrid Active Neutral-Point-Clamped Converters With Shared Redundant Unit Under Multiswitch Open-Circuit Fault</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10870874</link><description>Hybrid active neutral-point-clamped (HANPC) converters comprising silicon and silicon carbide devices are promising topologies in middle-low power conversion systems. The reliable operation of such converters is highly desirable, which depends on effective fault-tolerant schemes. However, existing schemes do not provide HANPC converters with the ability to tolerate the failures of multiple outer-switches with satisfactory fault-tolerant performance in terms of neutral-point voltage balancing and rated output voltage. To address this issue, the shared redundant unit is configured into HANPC converters. The matched fault-tolerant control strategy is proposed with rearranged switching sequences by utilizing the available space vector. In this context, the feasible region of the designed vector sequence (FRDVS) for fault-tolerant operation of HANPC converters is defined. Subsequently, the boundaries of FRDVS are quantitatively analyzed under different power factors. The improved fault-tolerant scheme allows the continuous operation of HANPC converters at rated capacity during the fault period, even up to open-circuit faults at all outer-switches. Experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed fault-tolerant scheme.</description></item><item><title>Multiobjective Optimization Control for Nonideal Single-Inductor Dual-Output Buck Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10858475</link><description>Single-inductor dual-output (SIDO) buck converter has been widely applied in fields of portable electronic products and smart homes due to their advantages of small size and multiple outputs. However, cross regulation seriously deteriorates the stability of the converter. In addition, parasitic parameters of circuit components reduce the conversion efficiency of the converter and have a significant impact on cross regulation. To suppress the cross regulation and improve the conversion efficiency of the nonideal SIDO buck converter, a multiobjective optimization control strategy is proposed. Considering the parasitic parameters of circuit components, a large signal model of the converter is established, and a predictive equation is constructed based on the model predictive control theory. Furthermore, an objective function for optimizing output error is established based on weighting the output voltage error and inductor current error. Then, a method is proposed to achieve real-time correction of the state variable reference values. The power loss of the system is analyzed and weighted onto the objective function to improve the conversion efficiency. Compared with the common mode voltage-differential mode voltage control method, simulation and experimental results show that the proposed strategy provides smaller cross regulation and better dynamic performance. The conversion efficiency is improved by 6.6%.</description></item><item><title>A Quasi-Noncascaded DC-Link Voltage Predictive Control of a PWM Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10875037</link><description>The main function of pulse-width modulation (PWM) converters in many applications is to control the dc-link voltage with good dynamic performance and strong disturbance rejection capability. Finite-control-set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) is known for its merits in both the above aspects, especially the noncascaded FCS-MPC control structure. However, as to be discussed in this article, the noncascaded FCS-MPC cannot be used to directly control the dc-link voltage of PWM converters, due to the problem of multiequilibrium points caused by the essential nonlinear characteristic of PWM converters. Hence, a quasi-noncascaded dc-link voltage predictive control structure is proposed for the first time, which keeps the outstanding dynamic performance and strong disturbance rejection capability of noncascaded FCS-MPC while avoids overcurrent caused by the unexpected equilibrium points. In addition, the proposed method can inherently handle the parameter mismatch issue, which is an important merit for MPC. Experimental results validate the theoretical analysis and performance of the proposed control strategy.</description></item><item><title>A Robust Open Circuit Fault Detection and Localization Scheme for HERIC PV Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10855000</link><description>Transformerless inverters are widely used to integrate the photovoltaic (PV) source into the distributed generation system. Within the converter, an open-circuit (OC) switch fault may lead to the partial or total failure of the converter. To address this issue, a new technique for detecting and localizing OC switch faults based on pole-to-pole voltage (voltage measured across the inverter output terminals) is proposed. The proposed variables for fault detection and localization (FDL) are continuously generated with every sampled pole-to-pole voltage and are compared with threshold values which are immune to parameter variation. As a result, OC is detected and located within a switching cycle for the ac side bypass switches. For localizing the OC fault in the H-bridge, the converter is reconfigured once the fault in the H-bridge switch is detected using pole-to-pole voltage. The input voltage required for the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is estimated from the voltage measured with the new sensor arrangement for pole-to-pole voltage measurement. This makes the number of sensors the same as in a conventional converter. The viability and effectiveness of this approach are demonstrated through simulation studies on the highly efficient and reliable inverter concept (HERIC) inverter, a popular transformerless inverter topology. Additionally, a laboratory prototype is developed to validate the practical applicability of the method.</description></item><item><title>Extended Kalman Filtering for Floating Capacitor Voltage Estimation on Triple Star Bridge Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10871191</link><description>Modular multilevel cascade converters (MMCCs) have emerged as one of the most attractive topologies for medium and high-voltage applications due to their modularity, scalability, redundancy, and high power quality. Voltage balancing in power submodule (SM) capacitors plays a critical role in the internal energy balancing of the MMCC, making monitoring SM capacitor voltages a crucial task. However, achieving higher operating voltages requires a substantial increase in the number of voltage sensors and communication lines. This escalation in hardware complexity renders the system more reliant on sensors, reducing its reliability. Several techniques for estimating capacitor voltages have been presented to address this control and design burden. This work proposes an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based observer for capacitor voltage estimation of all SMs in a triple-star bridge converter (TSBC). The proposed approach operates effectively under both open-loop and closed-loop conditions during transients and steady-state operation, enabling a decoupled controller using just one voltage and one current sensor per cluster. Experiments conducted in a TSBC composed of 27 SMs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach during transients and steady-state operation.</description></item><item><title>Dual Storage Power Management for Energy Autonomous Microsystems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854998</link><description>A major challenge towards enabling energy autonomous microsystems is cold-starting, especially in real use case environments which are often uncertain and involve long inactivity periods. In this article, a dual supercapacitor storage power management architecture is proposed, with the primary storage capacitor providing fast start-up and the secondary providing a large energy buffer. The circuit introduces a combination of a MOSFET switch and a buck converter that can handle efficient charge transport and eliminate leakage between the two storage capacitors, leading to faster cold starting. A start-up time reduction of more than two orders of magnitude over conventional solutions is experimentally demonstrated, for a 1.5 mF/470 mF supercapacitor combination, without a compromise in overall efficiency. The various functional modes of the system are experimentally analyzed, using an inductive power line energy harvester with currents that correspond to an industrially defined aircraft sensor use case. For example, 11 mW and 32 mW regulated output was measured from a 10 A and 15 A rms, 500 Hz power line, respectively. The architecture is configurable and can be dynamically parametrized and controlled to optimize power routing according to functional priorities by the microcontroller of the powered system.</description></item><item><title>A Noninvasive Resonant Galvanometer With Multiple Measurement Ranges</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10869509</link><description>Noninvasive, real-time monitoring of large-span currents in power grid and electric vehicles remains a challenge. A resonant galvanometer (RGM) achieving multiple measurement ranges with a single sensing unit is proposed in this article. An electromagnetic torque introduced theory for ac measurement is established to analyze the deviated output voltages, which have not been well physically interpreted and theoretically characterized so far. The deviated output voltages are defined as two asymmetric subpeaks for the first time. According to the Euler&#8211;Bernoulli beam theory, two asymmetric subpeaks have the potential to achieve multirange measurement with the main peak, which is at the magnetic field gradient extremum and directly opposite to the cable. A multirange sensing mechanism is proposed with three peaks, comprised of two newly defined asymmetric subpeaks and one main peak. Measurement ranges of the two subpeaks are two and five times than that of the main peak, respectively. Geometrical design of the sensing unit is analyzed to further adjust the multiranges via three peak values. A prototype with a single sensing unit is designed and fabricated to achieve multiple measurement ranges, and its practical applications in power grid and electric vehicles are also considered.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Method for Identifying the Reverse Recovery State of Thyristors Based on Gate Voltage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10875032</link><description>As a critical power electronic device in dc transmission systems, thyristors are highly favored for their low conduction loss, excellent surge capability, economic efficiency, and reliable current-carrying performance. However, in key applications such as commutation converters, active inverters, and circuit breakers, accurately determining the off-state of thyristors remains a significant challenge for the reliable operation of these systems. The traditional method relies on detecting the reverse recovery current flowing through the thyristor to determine its off-state. This method is often plagued by detection difficulties, high costs, and insufficient accuracy, and no new methods for detecting the off-state of thyristors have been proposed for decades. To address the difficulty in recognizing the off-state of thyristors, this article proposes a novel method for identifying the reverse recovery state of thyristors based on the gate voltage of the thyristor. This method eliminates the need to measure the high current on the primary side, requiring only the measurement of a small voltage on the secondary side to accurately determine the thyristor's reverse recovery state. Experimental validation confirms the feasibility of this approach. The proposed method offers advantages such as low cost and ease of integration, providing an effective solution for identifying the reverse recovery state of thyristors in existing equipment.</description></item><item><title>Ripple Free Modulation Method for Parallel Hybrid DC&#8211;DC Converter to Mitigate DC Link Filter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856685</link><description>The development of dc grids requires compact, economical, and efficient means of dc&#8211;dc integration. The parallel hybrid converter (PHC) is a suitable candidate for dc&#8211;dc integration due to its low energy storage requirement (ESR), soft switching, low submodule (SM) and switch count. However, the requirement of large dc side filtering and harmonic voltage injection (HVI) have been crucial limitations of the PHC.

Small-signal stability is a representative issue. Though, existing frameworks either ignore the uncertainties of renewables, or only focus on the worst case. In this regard, this paper establishes a small-signal stability constrained stochastic-robust optimal power flow (OPF) model, which aims to optimize the expected cost of scheduling results with respect to the probability distributions of uncertainties while ensuring the small-signal stability requirement even in extreme scenarios. However, the synergy of uncertainties and the complicated small-signal stability mechanism significantly increase the solving difficulty. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework to overcome this challenge. First, we solve the stochastic OPF without small-signal stability constraints. For those results that do not meet the stability requirements, we use them as initial points to locate the effective boundary of the OPF feasible region where the robust small-signal stability requirement is satisfied. The effective boundary location is realized in an iterative manner. Then, in the neighborhood of this effective boundary, we construct a linear surrogate expression to represent the original robust small-signal stability constraint with Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and sample weighted support vector machine (swSVM). Finally, we solve the OPF model with the surrogate constraint. Moreover, we further propose a constraint correction strategy to guarantee the stability requirement. Case studies verify that the proposed method can acquire economical operation schemes and meet the robust small-signal stability requirement at the same time.</description></item><item><title>A Self-Supervised Pre-Learning Method for Low Wind Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10839636</link><description>As wind power is becoming a major energy source of power systems, the risk of power shortages due to its intermittent low power output is growing. Accurate forecasting of low wind power is crucial for mitigating these impacts. However, conventional methods struggle with few-sample issues due to the infrequent occurrence of low wind power, limiting accuracy improvements. To address this, a self-supervised pre-learning method is proposed to forecast low wind power occurrence period and output, leveraging the similarities and differences among low output samples to enhance forecasting accuracy. Low wind power output is decomposed into low wind power events (LWPE), which represent the occurrence timeframe, and low wind power processes (LWPP), which represent the power sequences. For LWPE forecasting, a siamese residual shrinkage network based on contrastive learning is introduced. This network pre-learns LWPE features from sample pairs to mitigate the impact of imbalanced sample distribution. For LWPP forecasting, a pattern recognition-based embedded forecasting framework is proposed, embedding typical LWPP fluctuations into the prediction network to improve fit under limited sample conditions. A case study on 3 wind farm clusters shows that this method improves LWPP forecasting accuracy from 84.99%-86.6% to 89.97%, outperforming traditional methods without pre-learning.</description></item><item><title>Estimation of Stability Region for Grid-Forming Inverters Considering Switching Characteristics via Constructing Damping-Reflected Energy Functions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10843855</link><description>Grid-forming (GFM) inverters have been widely used as the interface between renewable energy sources and power grid. During low voltage ride through (LVRT) period, to limit the fault current, GFM inverters will experience the switching of control strategy, which makes the transient stability of GFM inverters exhibit different features from that of synchronous generators (SGs). In this paper, considering the switching characteristics induced by virtual impedance (VI), the framework of predicting the transient stability of GFM inverters during the fault period and after fault clearance is established from the perspective of energy. To reduce the conservativeness of the stability region, a uniform energy function considering the damping dissipation and the dynamics of reactive power control loop is constructed for the transient stability analysis of GFM inverters. Compared with existing approaches, the stability region estimated by the proposed energy function can intuitively show the effect of damping, and effectively reduce the degree of conservatism in transient stability prediction. Finally, simulation and hardware-in-loop experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method in the transient stability prediction of GFM inverters with switching characteristics.</description></item><item><title>A Decentralized Demanded Power Tracking and Voltage Control Method for Wind Farms Based on Data-Driven Sensitivities</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10848501</link><description>Efficient power dispatch in wind farms (WFs) hinges on precise demanded power tracking. This study proposes a decentralized WF power tracking and voltage control method based on data-driven sensitivities (DDSs). This method relies only on local operational variables for model predictive control (MPC), achieving near-global optimal solutions. With a backpropagation algorithm, a new sensitivity calculation method is designed to yield DDSs by computing the gradients of a global mapping model (GMM). The voltage DDSs can be derived simply by calculating the gradient of the voltage GMM and can replace the voltage sensitivities in traditional MPC methods. The power DDSs establishes linear relationships between the power outputs of different wind turbines (WTs), simplifying the WF state-space equations to local prediction models for reducing the quadratic programming dimensions. The three control modes designed based on DDSs enable control without WF line parameters, reduce computational complexity, or combine both effects. The variable spacing constraint linearization method transforms nonlinear constraints into linear ones, addressing the nonlinear coupling between control variables. Testing on a WF with 32 WTs in MATLAB/Simulink demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method comparable to centralized control methods.</description></item><item><title>Approximately Adaptive Distributionally Robust Optimization for Energy and Reserve Dispatch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10849978</link><description>This paper proposes two novel paradigms of approximately adaptive distributionally robust optimization (AADRO) for the energy and reserve dispatch with wind uncertainty. The piecewise linear policy-based AADRO (PLP-AADRO) approximates the adaptive optimization-based recourse decision as piecewise affine adjustment, while the piecewise value function-based AADRO (PVF-AADRO) approximates the quadratic recourse problem as piecewise linear recourse problems. Moreover, an equal probability principle is developed to achieve a high-quality segmentation of the wind power ambiguity set. Consequently, the distributionally robust quadratic cost constraint can be decomposed into decoupled piecewise constraints, allowing the dispatch problem to be formulated as a less-iterative or even non-iterative program. The two-stage AADROs with polyhedron supported uncertainties are first recast precisely as tractable forms with semidefinite constraints, by employing duality theory and S-lemma. Then, the distributionally robust cost constraint in PVF-AADRO is handled by dual vertex generation, and the bilinear terms in both AADROs are addressed by alternating optimization. Numerical simulations verify the efficiency of AADROs in approximating the strict adaptive distributionally robust optimization, and their adaptability in different cases is discussed.</description></item><item><title>Inertia Transmission Control of Full-Power Converter Variable-Speed Pumped Storage System for Grid Frequency Support</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10852016</link><description>Full-power converter variable-speed pumped storage (FPC-VSPS) is a promising technique for flexible power regulation in small-scale distributed hydroelectric power plants. However, conventional vector control limits the synchronous motor of the FPC-VSPS from providing inertia support to the power grid. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces an inertia transmission control for FPC-VSPS based on the concept of DC voltage synchronization. Firstly, the control incorporates the DC capacitor power equation into the GSC control. To enable inertia transmission from the FPC-VSPS synchronous machine, the DC capacitor dynamics are fed into both the speed and torque control of the MSC. Secondly, a torsion spring-rigid body equivalent model is introduced based on the inertia transmission process, analyzing the effects of physical parameters, control coefficients, and transmission delays on the inertia transmission performance. Theoretical analysis and simulation results reveal that the inherent physical differences and transmission delay have a negative impact on the effectiveness of the inertia transmission. Consequently, a DC capacitor design method based on inertia matching is proposed, accounting for the constraints of physical inertia matching, system stability, and operational security. Finally, simulations and experiments prove the necessity of inertia matching and verify the effectiveness of the proposed control to cope with frequency fluctuations in both pumping and generating modes.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Grid-Forming Undersea Pumped Storage to Enable 100% Renewable Offshore Oilfield Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854915</link><description>To advance carbon reduction of the offshore oilfield power system (OOPS), the grid-forming undersea pumped storage system (GFM-UPSS) emerges as a promising solution. This paper introduces a novel framework for a 100% renewable OOPS utilizing the GFM-UPSS. Firstly, the control strategy of the GFM-UPSS is presented. It consists of the grid-side converter (GSC), machine-side converter (MSC), and reversible pump-turbine (RPT) to achieve frequency and voltage regulation. A steady-state model is then developed detailing the water head, power, and volume of the spherical shell. In addition, the paper explores the converter parameter impacts on the GFM-UPSS transient model and derives the closed-form solutions. With the steady-state model, an optimal sizing method is presented and economic advantages in the marine environment are studied for the GFM-UPSS. Finally, EMT simulations are conducted to assess the frequency &amp; voltage stabilities and verify the effectiveness of the GFM-UPSS in enabling a 100% renewable OOPS. The optimal sizing results show that construction costs, mainly for OWP, are dominated and are influenced by sphere radius, placement depth, and start-stop cycles, while a 2.5 capacity ratio between OWP and GFM-UPSS consistently emerges as optimal. Moreover, analysis of transient stability shows that it improves with higher frequency &amp; voltage modulation coefficient and lower virtual impedance. The impact of RPT and MSC, mainly on frequency regulation, is determined by the DC droop coefficient and turbine inertia.</description></item><item><title>A Coordinated Adaptive SMC Method for Frequency Regulation Control in Power Systems With Multiple Wind Farms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10855531</link><description>The extensive integration of renewable energy resources inevitably gives rise to the complex and uncertain power system, where the somber matter of frequency instability becomes apparent. This article presents a coordinated adaptive radial basis function neural network (RBFNN)-based sliding mode control (CAR-SMC) to reduce the frequency deviation and oscillation of the uncertain power system comprising multiple wind farms. Firstly, the SMC is aimed at establishing the upper layer control law of the frequency regulation controllers. Then, the uncertainties are represented with RBFNN, and an adaptive law is employed to estimate the uncertainties online rapidly and realize the free-chattering of SMC. Furthermore, since a single SMC is only capable of handling a single control input system, a power distribution law based on momentum is proposed to implement the multiple control inputs of the AR-SMC, and also coordinate the frequency regulation abilities of wind turbines and energy storage systems (ESSs). Eventually, the proposed CAR-SMC is validated on a modified IEEE 39-bus system. The simulation results demonstrate that CAR-SMC can enhance the frequency stability in the presence of disturbances and uncertainties during steady-state operation, as well as in under-frequency and over-frequency scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Short-Term Spatio-Temporal Wind Speed Prediction Based on OWT-STGradRAM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10869841</link><description>Taking into account the orientation and distance characteristics of wind turbine stations in wind farms can improve the accuracy of wind power prediction. This paper proposed a deep learning spatio-temporal prediction method named orthogonal wind direction transformation spatio-temporal gradient Regression Activation Mapping (OWT-STGrad-RAM) for wind speed prediction.

However, current methods are affected by the intermittent, non-stationary and stochastic nature of solar energy and thus cannot satisfy the requirement of high-precision forecasting. To this end, we propose a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) forecasting method based on bubble entropy and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) regularization, called BesFCM. This method first utilizes bubble entropy to fuse two mode decomposition methods to improve the representation of PV data to capture effective features with significant stability and discriminative ability, then employs a FCM with a combination of fuzzy logic, neural networks, and expert systems to model solar PV power generation, and finally develops a high order FCM learning method based on SCAD regularization to alleviate the overfitting problem, enhancing the robustness and generalization ability of forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate that the BesFCM achieves the best overall performance on PV power datasets from multiple sampling intervals in multiple regions of Belgium compared to multiple state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness for solar power generation forecasting, providing support and reference for improving the quality of smart grid dispatch and reducing spare capacity reserves.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Suppression for Temporary Overvoltage Considering Dynamic Interactions Between LCC-HVDC and Renewable Energy Plants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10874178</link><description>Temporary overvoltage (TOV) severely restricts the development and utilization of renewable power resources (RPRs), especially when RPRs are delivered through the line commutated converter-based high voltage direct current (LCC-HVDC) system. To reveal the TOV mechanism for the sending system during commutation failures (CFs), the transient process of the system is partitioned into different stages, where the evolution of the system trajectories is analyzed. On this basis, the variation of AC voltage and DC current considering complex dynamic interactions between LCC-HVDC and renewable energy Plants (REPs) during repetitive CFs (RCFs) is clearly quantified. After revealing the impact of control parameters of both REPs and the LCC-HVDC on the TOV during RCFs, a collaborative optimization method for control parameters is proposed for TOV suppression. Moreover, when the blocking after the RCF tends to be inevitable, the optimal blocking moment is determined to inhibit the TOV caused by HVDC blocking. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed methods are verified with EMT simulations of a typical benchmark system.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Modeling and Switching Control of Electric Vehicle Aggregation for Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10878811</link><description>The aggregation and control of massive electric vehicles (EVs) are crucial for grid frequency regulation (FR). However, challenges such as disordered charging, high computational and communication burdens need to be addressed. To this end, a hierarchical hybrid modeling and switching control method for EV aggregation (EVA) is proposed. For modeling, a hybrid state set for EVs comprising three discrete states and one dynamic state is established at the local level. The dynamic state's flexibility allows EVs to charge orderly while considering user demands. At the aggregation level, a Markov-based EVA state space model is designed, integrating the user's willingness-to-pay (WTP) index and hybrid state. It estimates the EVA's FR capacity (FRC) with a lower communication burden and reduces computational burden by simplifying control dimensions. For control, a model predictive control (MPC)-based state switching method is designed at the aggregation level, considering user's FR willingness and power cancellation issue. Furthermore, a predictive compensation mechanism is designed to address model parameter errors resulting from asynchronous control cycles. At the local level, a probabilistic response method is proposed for responding to dispatched control signals, which reduces battery degradation through the state of charge (SOC) based response probability generation. Simulation results validate the method's effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Coordinated Control Strategy for Enhanced Performance of Energy Storage System in Secondary Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10879267</link><description>This paper presents a hierarchical coordinated con-trol strategy designed to enhance the overall performance of the energy storage system (ESS) in secondary frequency regulation (SFR). The strategy includes three layers: the system layer, the ESS operation layer, and the coordination control layer. In the system layer, a detailed frequency response model of the multi-area interconnected system is developed. The intrinsic mech-anisms of timing, depth, and the effect of ESS and conventional generating unit (CGU) in SFR are revealed through the sen-sitivity analysis of the power allocation factor. Furthermore, a sensitivity-based adaptive power allocation strategy for ESS and CGU is proposed, which improves the SFR effect while reducing the ESS power and maintaining the state of charge (SOC). In the ESS operation layer, the ESS is divided into two components for integration, employing a monotonic charge-discharge strategy to reduce lifetime degradation caused by frequent charging and discharging, thereby enhancing operational efficiency. In the coordination control layer, considering the power prediction and the ESS operating state, a SOC optimization strategy based on the double-input fuzzy control (DIFC) is proposed. It further dynamically corrects the power allocation factor based on fuzzy rules, optimizing the SOC level to ensure the bidirectional SFR capability of ESS under all conditions. The case studies validate the overall SFR performance of the proposed strategy with different scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Spatiotemporal Graph Contrastive Learning for Wind Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10879260</link><description>Accurate and robust wind power forecasting plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety and stability of the power system. Hybrid spatiotemporal forecasting models based on graph convolutional networks have received widespread attention due to their advantages in spatial feature extraction. However, these methods are susceptible to the quality of the generated graph due to data noise and missing issues, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid deep learning model based on spatiotemporal graph contrastive learning to address the above issues. Specifically, the model's encoder combines an adaptive graph convolutional network with LSTM to capture fine-grained spatiotemporal dependencies. To enhance the robustness of the encoder against data noise, we apply feature-level and topology-level data augmentation techniques to the model's input and design two contrastive learning auxiliary tasks from the temporal and spatial dimensions, respectively. Furthermore, to capture more comprehensive spatial correlations, we construct an adaptive graph by fusing the static graph with a learnable parameter matrix. Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.</description></item><item><title>A Carryover Storage Valuation Framework for Medium-Term Cascaded Hydropower Planning: A Portland General Electric System Study</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884034</link><description>Medium-term planning of cascaded hydropower (CHP) determines appropriate carryover storage levels in reservoirs to optimize the usage of available water resources. This optimization seeks to maximize the hydropower generated in the current period (i.e., immediate benefit) plus the potential hydropower generation in the future period (i.e., future value). Thus, in the medium-term planning, properly quantifying the future value deposited in carryover storage is essential to achieve a balanced trade-off between immediate benefit and future value. To this end, this paper presents a framework to quantify the future value of carryover storage, which consists of three major steps: i) constructing a deterministic model to calculate the maximum possible hydropower generation that a given level of carryover storage can deliver in the future period; ii) extracting the implicit locational marginal water value (LMWV) of carryover storage for each reservoir by applying a partition-then-extract algorithm to the constructed model; and iii) developing a set of analytical rules based on the extracted LMWV to effectively calculate the future value. These rules can be seamlessly integrated into medium-term CHP planning models as tractable mixed-integer linear constraints to quantify the future value properly, and can be easily visualized to offer valuable insights for CHP operators. Finally, numerical results on Portland General Electric's CHP demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented framework in aiding medium-term CHP planning to identify suitable carryover storage strategies.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Hydrogen Production Dispatch of Networked Hydrogen-Based Microgrids via a Distributed Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884064</link><description>Hydrogen has drawn significant attention due to its long-term storage capability and wide industrial applications. How to efficiently utilize renewable energy to maximize hydrogen production of a group of spatially distributed electrolyzers is a fundamental problem urgently needed to be solved. This paper is the first to attempt to address the problem by proposing a hydrogen production dispatch (HPD) model for hydrogen-based microgrids with proton exchange membrane electrolyzers. Considering the limited communication and privacy requirement of distributed energy systems, a distributed hydrogen production dispatch framework is constructed. The original nonconvex optimization problem is transformed into a convex form. Furthermore, it is proven that the marginal hydrogen production benefit of each electrolyzer should be equal for the optimal hydrogen production dispatch via Lagrangian duality. By setting the marginal hydrogen production benefit as a consensus variable, a novel distributed consensus-based dispatch algorithm is developed, in which an event-triggered communication scheme is introduced to alleviate the communication burden. It is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm achieves linear convergence. Results of the case study indicate that the proposed strategy yields the optimal hydrogen production benefit, which is increased by 9.43% compared to on-site hydrogen production and demonstrates excellent solving efficiency especially for large-scale systems.</description></item><item><title>Transient Frequency-Voltage Support Strategy for VSC-MTDC Integrated Offshore Wind Farms Based on Perturbation Observer and Funnel Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884062</link><description>To address the transient frequency and voltage stability challenges posed by low-inertia offshore wind farms (OWFs) connected through voltage source converter (VSC) based multi-terminal high voltage direct current (VSC-MTDC) system, a nonlinear perturbation observer and funnel control-based transient frequency and voltage support (PFTFVS) control strategy is proposed for VSC-MTDC integrated OWFs system. This approach utilizes improved estimation ability of the observer and adaptive feature of the funnel controller to enhance transient support capability and disturbance rejection performance of the system. The strategy comprises three parts: 1) an adaptive transient frequency support and rotor speed control method for wind turbines is devised to enhance the frequency support capability of OWFs; 2) considering the energy storage capability of DC capacitor in VSC-MTDC system, a transient frequency support controller is designed for VSC station to swiftly manage transient frequency variations; and 3) utilizing the rapid power regulation ability of VSC-MTDC, a transient voltage support controller is developed for VSC station to enhance voltage stability and boost the power transmission capacity. Finally, dynamic simulations of VSC-MTDC integrated OWFs system are built to verify the validity and robustness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Integration of Electrical Energy Storage in Wave Energy Hardware-in-the-Loop Test Rigs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10887246</link><description>This paper presents a design methodology for integrating an electrical energy storage unit into a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test rig for wave energy converters (WECs). Typically, the power production from WECs is characterised by pronounced fluctuations at low frequency and high peaks compared to the average. Wave energy test rigs should be able to reproduce these variations to impose realistic conditions to the device under test. Thus, the grid connection of the rig must be sized to cope with high peaks, and additional measures may be required to avoid disturbances on nearby loads and negative effects on voltage quality. The integration of electrical energy storage can smoothen power fluctuations and mitigate these drawbacks, while resulting in lower installation and operating costs. The design methodology indicates how to effectively size the storage unit and which technology to favour based on the type and duration of test campaigns. Numerical simulation results are presented for a dual HIL test rig and operational profiles of three different WEC technologies. For designs with energy storage lifetime shorter than the calendar life, sensitivity analyses indicate that the rig's annual utilisation rate and the level of accelerated testing have a significant effect on the storage energy requirements.</description></item><item><title>Station-Network Cooperative Optimization Planning of Urban Integrated Energy System Considering Heat Storage Capacity of Heat Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891182</link><description>Heat storage capacity of heat network in urban integrated energy system (UIES) has the potential to significantly improve the operational flexibility of the system. To obtain the optimal UIES planning scheme, a UIES station-network cooperative optimization planning (UIES-SNCOP) method considering heat storage capacity is proposed. First, a heat network operation model under constant flow-variable temperature considering flow direction depiction is established for solving the problem that the existing model cannot be directly applied to UIES-SNCOP because the flow direction of pipeline cannot be predetermined. Then, a radial structure-oriented topology model of distribution and heat networks is developed to ensure the radiality of energy supply network while also reducing planning cost. On this basis, a UIES-SNCOP model based on information gap decision theory and stochastic optimization is constructed to realize the co-optimization of the siting and sizing of energy station and topology of distribution and heat networks. Finally, a solution method of UIES-SNCOP model based on relaxation-contraction coupled McCormick envelope is proposed for effectively improving the accuracy of solution result. The planning of UIES is conducted on an urban topology containing 55 nodes to test the performance of the proposed method, and simulation results indicate that the proposed method outperforms other existing methods in terms of reducing planning cost, ensuring radial structure of the energy supply network, utilizing heat storage capacity and enhancing solution accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Two-Stage Adaptive Robust Model for AC Network-Constrained Unit Commitment in Power Systems With Uncertain Wind Power</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891662</link><description>With wind power being extensively integrated into power systems, its inherent uncertainty and variability pose significant challenges to the power system operational security. Traditional robust optimization methods capture the worst-case scenario, which results in overly conservative decisions, with insufficient considerations on AC network constraints in power systems. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a novel adaptive robust AC network-constrained unit commitment (AC-NCUC) model that considers both the AC network security and the uncertainty of wind power output in power systems. More specifically, a convex polyhedral uncertainty set is constructed to characterize the uncertain wind power output. Here, the conservativeness of UC dispatch decisions can be adjusted by modifying the size of the convex polyhedral uncertainty set. Then, we combine Benders&#8217; decomposition and Newton-Raphson methods to solve the AC-NCUC model for the optimal dispatch decisions. Simulation results on the modified IEEE 6-bus and IEEE RTS 79 systems validate the rationality and validity of our proposed approach. The proposed AC-NCUC model effectively maintains the system security while ensuring economic effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Power Control in Wind Farms for Gearbox Load Reduction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891746</link><description>Rapid power and torque fluctuations in time-varying conditions increase the fatigue load and failure rate of wind turbine (WT) gearboxes. In this study, an optimal power control method is proposed for a wind farm (WF) to improve the power flow and service quality, allowing the WF to track the power demand instructions from the transmission system operator while minimizing the fluctuations of vibration displacements inside the gearbox. A comprehensive dynamic model of the gearbox is developed by analyzing the transmission mechanism of key gearbox components, such as the planet carrier, planet gears, sun gears, and spur gears, describing the correlation between the internal vibration and mechanical torque and power output. Then, an optimal power control problem is formulated based on model predictive control to suppress the fatigue load while tracking power. Furthermore, a fatigue evaluation system is built based on the real-time vibration state inside the gearbox to characterize the service quality of WTs and guide the power generation of the WF. This approach provides a safety-oriented boundary regarding the WT fatigue load in the optimal power dispatch issue of WFs to suppress potential WT failures. Case studies in MATLAB/Simulink demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Deterministic Forecasts and Prediction Intervals for Wind Speed Using Enhanced Multi-Quantile Loss Based Dilated Causal Convolutions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891745</link><description>With rising wind power penetration into power systems obtaining wind speed forecasts with associated uncertainty becomes crucial for better planning and dispatch. This study proposes an enhanced multi quantile regression-based loss function specially tailored to train models to generate both deterministic forecast and the corresponding prediction intervals. Though the regression architecture of the model plays an important role in extracting precise forecasts, however, its efficiency is often ignored which may be a downside for short term forecasting scenarios where model training time may also be a significant factor. The present study therefore designed a multi-scale dilated convolution-based architecture for enhanced efficiency. The architecture generates predictions at different scales which are combined using particle swarm optimization to obtain optimal forecasts. The model is trained using the proposed loss function on datasets from both NREL simulations and operational Chinese state grid measurements across three different locations. The proposed model exhibits excellent forecasting performance in comparative experiments with both simulated and real-world operational datasets.</description></item><item><title>Stability Region Estimation and Decentralized Transient Control for Parallel Grid-Tied Grid-Forming Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10892023</link><description>Renewable energyes are highly penetrated in power system through Grid-forming inverter (GFMI). Transient stability of single GFMI system under severe grid fault has been thoroughly analyzed in recent years, but quantitative analysis for parallel grid-tied GFMI system is rarely studied. To fill this gap, the large signal equivalent model of parallel system considering the interaction between inverters is newly built. Based on the model, the Lyapunov function incorporating kinetic energy, potential energy, damping dissipation, and interaction energy is constructed for accurate stability region estimation. Then, the effect of control parameters on stability region is analyzed, indicating that increasing damping, reducing inertia, and lowering reference power of one GFMI can deteriorate stability margin of parallel GFMI system due to the enlarged interaction power, which is distinct from single GFMI system. For this, a decentralized transient control that adaptively adjusts damping, inertia, and reference power is proposed to guarantee transient stability and achieve low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) for parallel system without relying on communication, system information. Finally, simulation and experimental tests validate the correctness of theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of proposed control.</description></item><item><title>Aggregation Feasible Region of Full Power Spectrum Electric Vehicles Based on Polyhedron Projection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10900425</link><description>The aggregation of electric vehicles (EVs) can take full advantage of the power flexibility of EV clusters, based on the aggregation feasible region (AFR) of EVs. However, existing aggregation techniques of conventional distributed energy resources (DERs), exhibit significant inaccuracies or require excessive computational efforts when applied to EVs with high power and small capacity. To solve this problem, an iterative method based on the high dimensional polyhedron projection principle is proposed to derive the exact AFR formula for the full power spectrum of EVs, and the limitations of the existing analytical AFR are revealed. The results reveal that the exact AFR is a set of linear inequalities, whose coefficients can be represented in binary code, and the complexity of the right side is linear with the number of EVs, making it highly conducive to programming calculations. Moreover, this paper proposes a simplified practical AFR based on the exact AFR, which reduces computational complexity. Numerical simulation cases demonstrate that the accuracy of this simplified approach is still higher than that of existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Matrix Adaptive Correction-Based Dynamic Dimensionality Reduction Method for Voltage-Related TSCOPF in Bulk Power Systems With High Wind Power Penetration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10902439</link><description>Transient security-constrained optimal power flow (TSCOPF) is an important class of problems for system operation. Several challenges arise when dealing with bulk power grids, including the large size and complex transient voltage behaviors. This paper aims to address such hurdles by proposing a dynamic dimensionality reduction matrix adaptive correction (DDR-MAC) algorithm, which can effectively evaluate proper Volt/Var levels to guarantee secure system operation. First, this paper performs dimensionality reduction processing at the bus and device levels to obtain a low-dimensional model with dominant modes, which solves the problems of high-order and large computational volumes of differential equations. Moreover, a dimensionality reduction error assessment model is established to ensure reduced-order accuracy. Then, the reduced-order TSCOPF model is equivalently decomposed into a mixed-integer linear optimization model and a combined coefficient correction model for system dynamic constraints and steady-state nonlinear constraints. Furthermore, a secant/tangent sensitivity adaptive correction method is presented to achieve fast computation. The DDR-MAC approach is verified across differently scaled IEEE test systems and the Nordic test system and can improve computational efficiency by 49.07% while offering higher accuracy than traditional computation methods.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Synthetic Inertia Control for Two-Area Power Systems With Wind Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10906542</link><description>Modern power systems may experience decrease in stability due to the increased integration of variable generation sources that depend on power electronics converters. A common control strategy is to incorporate synthetic inertia from wind turbines, typically using state-feedback control in a single-area power system model that assumes uniform frequency. As power systems become more interconnected, different frequency behaviors can emerge in multiple areas, casting doubt on current methods that do not consider multi-area stability. Furthermore, most single-area synthetic inertia methods ignore the limitations of communication systems in real power systems. This paper proposes a decentralized synthetic inertia control strategy for a two-area power system with wind power. This approach accounts for the actual behavior of power systems in different areas and the limitations of communication systems in real scenarios. Numerical results, derived from dynamic models using actual operating data from the Chilean Power System, demonstrate that the decentralized control performs comparably to centralized control in maintaining power system stability and optimizing frequency nadir. However, the decentralized control has the advantage of relying solely on local variables, eliminating the need for communication links between areas during operation.</description></item><item><title>A Unified Strategy for Frequency Regulating and MPPT for Photovoltaic Sources Based on a Novel Three-Parameter Characteristic Curve</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10907967</link><description>The large-scale integration of Photovoltaic (PV) sources may reduce system inertia and power quality, resulting in increased frequency fluctuations and diminished system stability due to lack of the primary frequency regulation (FR) capability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a unified strategy for frequency regulating and Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) for PV sources to provide ancillary services to the power grid. The strategy employs a specifically designed active power control (APC) method to enable rapid and flexible power adjustments of PV sources, with which further FR function may be achieved. The presented APC algorithm adopts an iterative technique with a novel three-parameter PV characteristic curve, making it possible to reconstruct the real-time PV generation model, clarify the relationship between the system frequency, output power, and operating voltage. Its high control accuracy, fast convergence rate, and strong explainability offer significant practical value. Additionally, this adaptive control strategy features autonomous switch between the FR and MPPT modes adapting to real-time irradiation changes, without the need for additional irradiation or temperature sensors. The integration enhances both solar utilization efficiency and the FR capability, while eliminating the controller transitions during operating mode switches. Hardware-in-the-loop tests validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Online Monitoring of Battery Degradation for Enhanced Power Smoothing of PV Power Plants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10908680</link><description>In pursuit of a carbon-neutral future, the integration of photovoltaic (PV) power plants into the electrical power grid is expanding. Although beneficial, this expansion presents challenges due to weather-induced variability, which destabilizes the grid and causes voltage and frequency deviations. A viable solution is the use of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) alongside PV power plants. However, conventional controllers, which lead to uniform and frequent charging cycles, accelerate degradation and reduce efficiency in BESS. To address this, this paper proposes segmenting the BESS units into distinct charging and discharging groups, effectively minimizing battery cycling and enhancing their lifespan. The controller dynamically assigns batteries to each group based on power fluctuation forecasts using a power-sharing model. This model manages battery activation, enables inter-group support, and balances degradation by monitoring BESS charge levels and assessing battery health through an online system. This controller, coupled with a degradation balancing layer, strategically prioritizes units based on their cycling age. The proposed technique was rigorously tested and experimentally validated, demonstrating that it significantly reduces battery degradation to a maximum of 0.099%, in stark contrast to the up to 4.41% observed with conventional controllers.</description></item><item><title>State Transfer Induced Transient Synchronization Instability of GFM-VSC: Analysis and Improvement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909647</link><description>The operation mode of grid-forming voltage source converters (GFM-VSCs) may switch between voltage source mode (VSM) and current source mode (CSM) under some situations such as grid faults, owing to the current limitation control. During the mode-switching process, there is state transfer from the final state of the last mode to the initial state of the next mode, which impacts the transient synchronization stability (TSS) of GFM-VSCs. This paper primarily focuses on analyzing and improving the TSS of GFM-VSCs by considering the effect of state transfer. A novel transient instability mechanism is revealed through the existence analysis of equilibrium points. It clarifies that the state transfer may cause the operating trajectory during faults to bypass the stable equilibrium point in CSM before diverging to the next cycle, thereby resulting in transient synchronization instability. Besides, to further analyze the TSS of mode-switched VSCs considering the dynamics during faults, multiple Lyapunov functions are adopted to derive the TSS criteria and boundaries. It has been identified that lowering the minimum critical current and adjusting the saturated current phase in accordance with virtual power angle (VPA) dynamics can enhance the TSS. Therefore, a VPA feedback-based current limiting strategy is proposed to safeguard GFM-VSCs against overcurrent and ensure the TSS. The validity of the new transient instability mechanism and the efficacy of the proposed strategy are confirmed through simulations of a GFM-VSC connected to an IEEE 39-bus power grid and hardware-in-the-loop experiments.</description></item><item><title>Assessing Dynamic Reserves vs. Stochastic Optimization for Effective Integration of Operating Probabilistic Forecasts</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909649</link><description>Probabilistic forecasting is becoming pivotal in utilities' decision-making processes, offering an accurate portrayal of plausible forecast deviations as opposed to deterministic forecasting which only focuses on the expected forecasted variables. Two methods, dynamic reserve and stochastic optimization, have been used to integrate probabilistic forecasts into power system operational planning. Dynamic reserve predicts system reserve requirements based on observed (from historical observations) or expected (from probabilistic forecasts) uncertainty spreads. This approach has a low computational burden, but it is commitment and dispatch agnostic. Stochastic optimization, on the other hand, considers multiple scenarios simultaneously (from probabilistic forecasts), allocating recourse across the commitment and dispatch variables, but demanding high computational resources and time. The selection between these methods depends on utility requirements and specific situations. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of both methods using a calibrated real-size system representing the Southern Company for medium and high solar penetration levels. Additionally, it proposes a hybrid dynamic reserve and stochastic optimization approach with a risk evaluation pre-scheduling procedure to enhance decision-making.</description></item><item><title>Minimax Regret Robust Co-Planning of Transmission and Energy Storage Systems With Mixed Integer Recourse</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909558</link><description>The growing penetration of renewable energy sources, with intermittent and uncertain nature, brings new challenges to the secure and efficient operation of power systems. Expanding transmission networks and utilizing energy storage (ES) have been introduced as effective solutions to address these challenges. This paper presents a minimax regret robust co-planning model with mixed integer recourse for transmission and ES systems, designed from the perspective of a central planner. The model considers a polyhedral uncertainty set for future peak load growth, while uncertainties in wind farm expansion are addressed through internal scenario analysis. This approach will guarantee the robustness of investment decisions and provide the central planner with a clear picture of the maximum regret among all possible scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed minimax regret framework facilitates strategic planning for ES installation after the resolution of long-term uncertainties. In this paper, we reformulate the model into a standard min-max-min problem, in which the maximization level is only over uncertainties. Subsequently, a five-level solution strategy based on a modified nested column and constraint generation decomposition technique is represented to deal with the intractability and complexity of the problem caused by binary variables of transmission lines and ES blocks. The model is finally evaluated through comprehensive simulation studies to verify its tractability, practicality, and effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>A Dynamic Model-Based Minute-Level Optimal Operation Strategy for Alkaline Electrolyzers in Wind-Hydrogen Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10912757</link><description>Maintaining the export power of wind-hydrogen systems within a stable range is critical for power system security. However, this is challenged by the mismatch between large time-scale of alkaline electrolyzer (AWE) scheduling strategies and the short-term fluctuations of wind power. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel minute-level optimization strategy for AWE operation. Developing effective small time-scale strategies requires a detailed consideration of AWE dynamics. To this end, we first introduce its steady-state electrochemical characteristics and third-order dynamic models for both temperature and Hydrogen-to-Oxygen (HTO) ratio. Based on these refined models, we develop an AWE optimization framework that enables electrolysis power to track minute-level wind power fluctuations by dynamically adjusting fine-grained variables, such as the lye flow rate, cooling flow rate, and pressure, at 1-minute intervals. To overcome the computational challenges posed by the detailed modeling, we propose an improved model predictive control (MPC) framework. This framework incorporates model simplifications to improve computational efficiency, along with an optimization-simulation iterative procedure to ensure operational feasibility. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed strategy extends the AWE load range by 13.8% and reduces wind power curtailment by 15.06%. Additionally, synergies among control variables enable the system to achieve a balance between operational efficiency, stability, and security, highlighting the potential of this approach to enhance the performance of wind-hydrogen integrated systems.</description></item><item><title>Promote Data Sharing in Integrated Power-Traffic Networks: A Coalition Game Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10910214</link><description>Accurately estimating spatial-temporal electric vehicles' (EVs) charging demands is crucial for the secure and economic operation of power systems. At present, the distribution system operator (DSO) relies on historical data collected at each charging station to estimate future EV charging demand. However, the station-level forecast disregards EVs' spatial correlations within traffic networks (TNs) and might suffer significant forecast error, forcing the DSO to make conservative scheduling at the expense of operation economics. To this end, this paper proposes to leverage cross-sector information (i.e., traffic demand data and network parameters in TNs) to enhance forecast accuracy and avoid over-conservative operations. To facilitate the data sharing among the DSO and TN data holders (i.e., traffic authority and navigation App. companies), we adopt the Coalition Game theory to uncover how these entities could cooperate to benefit each other, and to fairly allocate the extra profits (i.e., the operational cost reduction induced by the improved forecasts) among themselves. The conditional value-at-risk theory is adopted to model the risk-averse behavior of the DSO. In case studies, we reveal the non-negligible impact of TN condition variations on EV charging distributions. Moreover, numerical results show that sharing high-quality traffic data contributes to the reduction in DSO's operating cost by utmost 20.8% as compared to the current practice without data sharing.</description></item><item><title>An Optimization Framework for Component Sizing and Energy Management in Electric-Hydrogen Hybrid Energy Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10915713</link><description>This paper proposes an optimization framework to address the component sizing and energy management problems in an electric-hydrogen hybrid energy storage system connected to a wind turbine. The total cost of the hybrid system is minimized using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. In particular, four decision variables are optimized: the electrolyzer (EL) size, the supercapacitor (SC) size, and two parameters in the energy management strategy (EMS). To determine the power split factor for the wind power, the EMS introduces an artificial potential field (APF) and defines a virtual force based on the SC state of charge (SOC). Two APF parameters are optimized to tune the power allocation between the EL and the SC: the shaping parameter of the virtual force and the basis parameter of the power split factor. Since the cutoff frequency of the low pass filter (LPF) in the EMS is adaptively updated based on the optimized APF parameters, the proposed framework is referred to as the &#8220;OP-APF&#8221; framework. The effectiveness of the OP-APF framework is validated by performing MATLAB and real-time simulations. Compared to three baseline frameworks, OP-APF is more effective in reducing the system total cost, controlling the SC SOC, and alleviating the EL degradation.</description></item><item><title>Photovoltaic Power Prediction Considering Multifactorial Dynamic Effects: A Dynamic Locally Featured Embedding-Based Broad Learning System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916943</link><description>Accurate photovoltaic power (PVP) prediction is a prerequisite for the efficient and stable operation of new power systems. While existing research has extensively explored the relationship between global factors such as temperature, irradiance, and photovoltaic power, the local dynamic impacts of these factors are often overlooked, which may reduce the accuracy of predictions. To address this issue, this paper considers the dynamic interrelationships among multiple factors and proposes a dynamic locally featured embedding-based broad learning system (DLFE-BLS) algorithm for PVP prediction. Firstly, a novel dynamic phase space reconstruction method (DPSR) is proposed to characterize the dynamic properties of multivariate data. Furthermore, a dynamic local featured embedding (DLFE) algorithm is introduced to extract local dynamic features from multivariate data. Finally, by integrating the dynamic reconstruction and dynamic feature extraction processes into the broad learning system (BLS) framework, we propose the DLFE-BLS algorithm to improve the accuracy of PVP prediction. Case studies have shown that DLFE-BLS outperforms other models in terms of prediction accuracy. Additionally, it has the highest accuracy when applied to transfer prediction.</description></item><item><title>Optimal VSG BESS Sizing for Improving Grid-Following Converter Stability Under Various Dispatch Scenarios and Grid Strengths</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10924310</link><description>As renewable energy integration increases, ensuring stability of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) in weak grids is crucial, as grid-following (GFL) converters often become unstable under such conditions. Integrating virtual synchronous generator (VSG) batteries has shown potential to improve GFL stability, but determining the optimal size of the VSG required for stability remains an open question. Existing research typically relies on small-signal or impedance models for stability analysis, which are only valid at a single operating point and do not consider the full range of operating conditions, including various dispatch scenarios and grid strengths. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel methodology to visualize the system's stable operating region, offering insights into stability boundaries across various real power and grid impedance variations. Additionally, it introduces an optimal VSG battery sizing strategy that accounts for these variations, ensuring stability while minimizing VSG capacity. The strategy's effectiveness is validated through comprehensive PSCAD simulations, demonstrating its reliability across a wide range of real power and grid impedance operating points.</description></item><item><title>Fast Centralized Model Predictive Control for Wave Energy Converter Arrays Based on Rollout</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10923686</link><description>Centralized control of wave energy converter (WEC) arrays for grid-scale generation can achieve higher energy production than decentralized (independent) control, due to its capability of fully exploiting mutual radiation effects. However, the state-of-the-art centralized model predictive control (CMPC) is significantly more computationally challenging than decentralized MPC (DMPC), since the number of control moves to be optimized grows in proportion to the number of WECs. In this paper, a fast CMPC controller is proposed, whose idea is to optimize only the first few control moves while rolling out future system trajectories using a fixed controller. A linear, two-degree-of-freedom (2-DoF) controller with a sea-state-dependent control coefficient tuning strategy is further proposed to serve as the rollout controller. It is shown that the proposed rollout-based CMPC (R-CMPC) can maintain almost the same energy production as conventional CMPC under a wide range of sea states, while significantly reducing the optimization dimension (in the studied case, by a factor of 6), enabling ultra-fast online computation (about 40 times faster than conventional CMPC).</description></item><item><title>Energy Management of Multi-Energy Communities: A Hierarchical MIQP-Constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10923740</link><description>This paper proposes a hybrid mixed-integer quadratic programming-constrained deep reinforcement learning (MIQP-CDRL) framework for energy management of multi-energy communities. The framework employs a hierarchical two-layer structure: the MIQP layer handles day-ahead scheduling, minimizing operational costs while ensuring system constraint satisfaction, while the CDRL agent makes real-time adjustments. The goal of this framework is to combine the strengths of CDRL in addressing sequential decision-making problems in stochastic systems with the advantages of a mathematical programming model to guide the agent's exploration during the training and reduce the dependency on opaque policies during real-time operation. The system dynamics are modeled as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), which is solved by a model-free CDRL agent built upon the constrained policy optimization (CPO) algorithm. Practical test results demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in improving the optimality and feasibility of the real-time solutions compared to existing stand-alone DRL approaches.</description></item><item><title>Complex Variable Design for Power Control of Grid-Forming Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854804</link><description>The analysis and design of the grid-forming (GFM) power loop and decoupling control can be challenging due to the coupled high-order system, where active and reactive power controls are typically designed separately using a dual-input-dual-output model.

Managing frequency, voltage, and power dynamics in microgrids under varying conditions, however, poses significant challenges. This paper proposes an adaptive, data-driven secondary control framework for real-time tuning of hierarchical controllers in both islanded and grid-connected modes. The approach employs a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning (VRFT) method with a novel low-memory formulation optimized for digital signal processor (DSP) implementation. Integrated with a performance detector, it enables automated controller retuning during open- and closed-loop operations, ensuring robust reference tracking and dynamic performance under disturbances. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations, incorporating significant communication delays, validate the framework&#8217;s effectiveness. The results highlight the proposed method&#8217;s practical applicability, offering a scalable solution for microgrid management in real-world conditions.</description></item><item><title>Uninterruptable Hierarchical Distributed Coordinated Control Scheme of Islanded AC/DC Microgrid Clusters Under Grid-Forming Converter Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10974648</link><description>Grid-forming converter faults in islanded hybrid AC/DC microgrid clusters could lead to voltage and frequency instability risk in the subgrid, thus threatening system operating safety. To solve this issue, this paper has proposed an uninterruptable hierarchical distributed coordinated control scheme of islanded hybrid AC/DC microgrid clusters. Firstly, when grid-forming converter faults occur in a certain AC microgrid (ACMG), the interlinking converter connected with the faulty subgrid switches its control mode into grid-forming, providing stable voltage and frequency support for the faulty ACMG. Then, a two-layer coordinated control scheme is presented, where the first layer is designed for the remaining interlinking converters, and the second layer is designed for converters in normal subgrids and grid-following converters in abnormal ACMG together with its interlinking converter. By the control mode switch of the IC and the two-layer coordinated control scheme, accurate power sharing can quickly fill the power deficit in the faulty subgrid, and the voltage and frequency of the microgrid clusters can remain stable. Verification results indicate that with the proposed scheme, the islanded AC/DC microgrid clusters can operate uninterruptedly under different kinds of grid-forming converter faults.</description></item><item><title>Robust Consensus-Based Secondary Control for Microgrids Considering Communication Delay and Noises: A Kalman Filter-Based Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10994544</link><description>To achieve the frequency and voltage regulation as well as active and reactive power sharing, the consensus-based secondary controls of microgrids rely on communication network to exchange signals between neighbor inverters, which may be affected by the communication delay and noises. Unlike the existing methods that focus solely on communication delay, this paper proposes a Kalman filter-based robust consensus control to address the communication delay and noises comprehensively. Based on the discrete differential equation of the signal transmitted via communication network, the multi-step prediction model of the delayed signal is firstly built by considering the prediction errors. The state space model is then constructed by taking the predicted signals at each step as the state variables while the delayed and noise-involved signal and its differential value are seen as the measurements. A Kalman filter is further designed to comprehensively handle the communication delay, noises and prediction errors to estimate the true signal generated from neighbor inverters. With the estimated signals of all neighbor inverters, the consensus control is performed to coordinate the grid-following and grid-forming inverters within the microgrid. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with simulations and experiments performed on the modified IEEE-33 bus-based microgrid.</description></item><item><title>A Unified Directional Protection Element for Converter-Based Islanded Hybrid Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11006132</link><description>This paper proposes a unified directional element (UDE) for protecting converter-dominated islanded hybrid microgrids (IHMGs) relying on phase current samples. For the AC sub-network, the fault diagnosis component (FDC) is constructed by averaging the first-order derivative (FOD) of the phase currents at each line end over one power cycle. On the DC side, the FDC is obtained directly by computing the FOD of the pole current. The current direction of each phase/pole can be identified based on the first peak sign of the FDC. Once a disturbance occurs, the UDE is activated utilizing a startup unit, and the first peak sign of the FDC of each phase/pole is shared between both terminals of the line to differentiate internal faults from other disturbances or external faults. A phase/pole is being faulted if both values of the FDC at both sides of the line have the same sign. The developed UDE is verified by simulating the modified IEEE 33-bus IHMG on PSCAD/EMTDC. Several scenarios are carried out including load switching as well as external and internal faults. Additionally, the effect of different factors is examined, encompassing measurement inaccuracies and high resistance faults.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Power Flow Estimation for MVDC Distribution Systems Based on Physics-Embedded FCN</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10945791</link><description>Maintaining high prediction accuracy with varying grid topologies poses a significant challenge to adopting neural network (NN)-based approaches for power flow (PF) estimation in medium-voltage direct current (MVDC) distribution systems. This paper proposes a physics-embedded fully convolutional network (PEFCN) to improve the accuracy. Physics-embedded techniques are incorporated in the proposed PEFCN through 1) architecture reconstruction, and 2) loss function reformulation. Architecture is reconstructed by input channel conversion calculation in a new physics operation layer. This process offers physical connections among the three input matrix channels (voltage, current, and line conductance). Three new physics loss terms are included in the loss function to restrict the outliers violating the limits of converter power ratings and terminal MVDC voltages. The two operations enable the FCN to achieve improved prediction accuracy and strong generalization capabilities. Five MVDC distribution systems, characterized by different dc voltage levels and topology configurations, serve to validate the superiority of the proposed PEFCN over other NNs in the PF estimation for scenarios involving both fixed and varying system structures. Moreover, a modified IEEE 69-bus distribution system is further used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed PEFCN for larger systems.</description></item><item><title>Non-Iterative Sensitivity-Based Switch Exchange Method for Distribution Network Reconfiguration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10960360</link><description>In this paper, a non-iterative sensitivity-based zsolve the distribution network reconfiguration (DNR) problem and ensure the security of the switch operation process, while maintaining the node voltage within the feasible range. The NSSE method involved the sensitivity-based network reconfiguration (SNR) stage and sensitivity-based power optimization (SPO) stage. In the SNR stage, the computational speed was improved by considering the dynamic voltage sensitivity with respect to the compensated power analysis, while the network power losses and number of switching times were minimized. The closed-loop and open-loop operation model was developed to solve the compensated power for simulating the switch operation process. Moreover, the maximum loop current was set as a constraint to avoid the equipment risk of switching operation. Each switch operation process can be formulated as integer quadratic programming (IQP) to obtain the optimal network topology and switch operation sequence with the non-iterative calculations. In the SPO stage, the active and reactive power outputs of distributed generations (DGs) were optimized to regulate the node voltage and reduce the active power curtailment. The effectiveness of the proposed NSSE method on the calculation speed and accuracy was validated in MATLAB.</description></item><item><title>Multiagent System-Based VPPs Cooperative Power Control for Frequency Regulation Considering Diverse Communication Issues</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948420</link><description>Virtual power plants (VPPs) possess significant potential to support power systems&#8217; frequency regulation through the aggregation of demand-side distributed energy resources. However, due to their heavy reliance on information technology, VPPs inevitably face diverse communication issues, such as cyber-attacks, privacy disclosure, and packet losses, which poses a serious challenge to ensure efficient power control for frequency regulation. To this end, this paper proposes a multiagent system-based VPPs cooperative power control strategy to achieve frequency regulation in a resilient, optimal, and scalable manner. First, a joint design scheme of VPPs cooperative power control and information interaction mechanism is presented to determine the optimal regulation power of VPPs for frequency regulation, where a consensus-based collaborative strategy is designed for cyber-attacks and a homomorphic encryption technology is introduced for privacy protection. Also, an event-triggered mechanism is adopted for communication burden. Second, a dynamic power control scheme for inverter is presented to enable the internal units of VPPs to track the power reference from the joint design scheme, in which an improved model predictive control method is suggested for packet losses to enhance control performance. Finally, simulation results reveal that, when confronting diverse communication issues, the proposed strategy exhibits significant effects in defending against cyber-attacks, ensuring privacy security, alleviating the communication burden, and achieving fast response, thus effectively facilitating VPPs frequency regulation.</description></item><item><title>Voltage-Source Control for Green-Hydrogen Hybrid Energy Storage System With Operational Constraints and Current Rate Limiter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947357</link><description>Green hydrogen produced from renewable energy generation (RES) is facilitating the energy transition. Due to the complicated operational constraints of green-hydrogen hybrid energy storage system (GH-HESS), the existing two-layer power-based control architecture is prevalent, but it heavily relies on the communication infrastructure and the prediction accuracy of RES&#8217;s power. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel voltage-source hierarchical control framework for the grid-connected GH-HESS to solve the above problems. Considering the electricity price, the hot-standby current and safety of the hydrogen production of the electrolyzer, the current allocation between hydrogen energy storage and power grid is achieved for the continuous stable operation of GH-HESS even in the situation with potential communication failure. When the current rate limiter is adopted for the fuel starvation phenomenon of fuel cell, the current feed-forward loop and current-based secondary control are designed to solve the trade-off problem between the current overshoot and convergence speed of the tradition voltage-source control, where the large current overshoot will cause irreversible damage to hydrogen energy storage. Battery energy storage rapidly responses the power fluctuation from RES, while the steady-state power vacancy is undertaken by hydrogen energy storage. Finally, a 800V DC microgrid based on NI-PXI real-time platform is built to validate its advantages.</description></item><item><title>Reliability and Comfort-Aware Operation Optimization for Hydrogen-Based Building Energy Systems in Off-Grid Mode</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10965864</link><description>Hydrogen-based energy systems have gained wide attention due to their significant potential for relieving energy crises and environmental problems. However, existing studies neglect occupant comfort control in hydrogen-based building energy systems (HBESs). In this paper, we investigate a reliability and comfort-aware operation optimization problem of an HBES in off-grid mode. Achieving the above aim encounters several challenges due to multi-source uncertainties, implicit indoor environmental dynamics, temporally and spatially coupled constraints, and nonlinear constraints. To address the above challenges, we propose a physics-embedded neural network (PENN)-assisted hierarchical model predictive control (MPC) algorithm. Specifically, the PENN architecture is adopted to capture the indoor dynamics accurately. Then, the PENN-assisted upper-level MPC implements occupant comfort control and optimizes the multi-energy demands. Next, the lower-level MPC optimizes the system operation cost and reliability with known multi-energy demands decided by the upper-level MPC. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms baselines in terms of operation cost, system reliability, and indoor occupant comfort.</description></item><item><title>Exploring the Feasible Regulation Region of Building HVAC Systems Within Hygro-Thermal Comfort</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11006322</link><description>Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems are widely recognized as promising demand response (DR) resources for enhancing grid flexibility. Despite extensive research on evaluating the regulation capacity of HVAC systems, the role of humidity in air dynamic description and occupant comfort assessment during DR has been overlooked. This paper addresses these gaps by exploring the feasible regulation region of HVAC systems while meeting occupant hygro-thermal comfort. Firstly, a comprehensive model of HVAC systems is developed to describe the hygro-thermal air dynamics and equipment characteristics. Subsequently, the hygro-thermal comfort area is defined to establish permissible temperature and humidity boundaries. Based on key constraints, the hygro-thermal air dynamics are categorized into 3 distinct types. Moreover, a novel criterion is proposed to identify these dynamics without requiring full knowledge of boundary conditions. On this basis, the maximum regulation capacities are quantitatively evaluated to explore the feasible regulation region throughout the day. Finally, numerical case studies are conducted to validate the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that humidity plays a crucial role in the operating power and the feasible regulation region of HVAC systems. Incorporating humidity improves hygro-thermal comfort, thereby encouraging more occupant participation in DR programs.</description></item><item><title>Automated Fast Frequency Response From Inverter-Based Motor Loads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002578</link><description>The increasing integration of inverter-based renewable generation presents challenges for the frequency stability of power systems, primarily due to reduced system inertia and governor response&#8212;collectively known as Fast Frequency Response (FFR). Obtaining FFR from inverter-based generation requires reserving operational headroom, resulting in a lost opportunity to generate more renewable energy. Recently, inverter-based loads have been proposed as potential sources of FFR; however, critical gaps remain in the control algorithms needed to transform these loads into grid-supportive loads (GSLs) capable of delivering FFR. To address this gap, this paper introduces a novel algorithm that enables automatic, communication-free, grid-supportive behavior in inverter-based motor loads. The algorithm&#8217;s efficacy is demonstrated through comprehensive simulations and hardware experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that GSLs equipped with the proposed controller can provide FFR by adjusting power consumption, reducing it by up to 32% for a 1.8% drop in grid frequency and increasing it by 10.65% for a 0.4% rise, within 1.5 seconds in response to frequency events. By retrofitting existing, or designing new inverter-based motor loads with this controller, end-use devices can automatically deliver aggregated FFR without communication infrastructure, enhancing frequency stability in grids with high levels of variable renewable energy.</description></item><item><title>Bayesian Active Learning-Based Soft Data Space Calibration for System-Wise Aggregate Flexibility Characterization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10945771</link><description>There have been growing interests in characterizing system-wide aggregate flexibility to support transmission-side ancillary services and promote large-scale integration of distributed energy resources (DERs). However, accurately characterizing the power flexibility region (PFR) at the substation interface is computationally challenging due to the heterogeneity of the DER devices and the need to satisfy network constraints, resulting in a nonlinear and unpredictable geometry. Therefore, this paper proposes a network-aware, near-optimal, and sample-efficient data-driven method. First, a bus-level PFR estimation model is proposed to aggregate local DER devices at each bus into an inner-box approximated region. Second, a feeder-level PFR estimation model is proposed to aggregate all bus-level PFRs into an outer-box approximated region. A Bayesian active learning-based soft calibration strategy is proposed to iteratively and interactively learn a decision boundary of the binary classifier as an improved feeder-level PFR while providing trustworthy measurement to system operators. Case studies on a small, illustrative IEEE system and modified IEEE 123 bus test feeder validate effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description></item><item><title>Aggregated DER_A Model Parameterization via Online Moving Horizon Estimation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10945798</link><description>This paper introduces a methodology for parameterizing the DER_A model using a novel smooth mathematical representation, simplifying the process and preserving accuracy in modeling inverter-based generator (IBG). The methodology employs an online parameterization process that can operate in real-time. The model parameterization process is structured into five sequential steps, each targeting a specific aspect of the DER_A model through moving horizon estimation. This approach adapts to systems with varying voltage and frequency support requirements by selectively applying each step. Simulation results on systems with both known and unknown parameters validate the methodology&#8217;s effectiveness. The online moving horizon estimation technique accurately captures the dynamics of the overall system and ensures that the parameterized DER_A model closely mirrors the real system&#8217;s voltage, current, and power dynamics. The findings highlight the potential of this methodology to substantially improve and simplify the dynamic modeling of power systems, paving the way for more reliable and robust IBG and grid integration.</description></item><item><title>Network-Security Informed Offer-Making of Aggregator With Utility-Owned Storage Lease Opportunity: Robust Stackelberg Game and Distributed Solution Methods</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10974673</link><description>Aggregators of distributed energy resources are increasingly encouraged to participate in wholesale market bidding. However, the delivery of the power they are awarded can result in over-voltage or congestion issues within the distribution network (DN). The opportunity to lease energy storage from the utility that manages the DN provides the aggregator with a means to mitigate these issues, while also benefiting the utility in terms of additional lease revenue. Nevertheless, this leasing opportunity considerably complicates the aggregator&#8217;s offer-making process, as it requires the consideration of market uncertainties, uncertain power injection at DN buses, and the strategic interactions between the aggregator and the utility. This paper presents a robust Stackelberg game model that effectively captures the interactions between the aggregator and the utility, ensuring DN security across all potential uncertainty scenarios. Furthermore, in light of the privacy concerns of both the aggregator and the utility, two distributed solution methods are proposed. The first method follows a traditional predict-then-optimize framework and has been validated to achieve the game equilibrium. The second method employs an end-to-end framework, which has been empirically shown to yield superior economic results. Case studies conducted on 69 and 533-bus DNs illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.</description></item><item><title>New Insights on the Stability of Sampled-Data-Based LFC for Power Systems: A Delay-Interval-Dependent LKF Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981893</link><description>This paper analyzes the stability problem of load frequency control (LFC) for power systems under uncertain transmission delays. First, an argumented LFC system model accounting for uncertainties in transmission delays is proposed. Then, a novel delay-interval-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) that takes into account both the upper and lower bounds of the transmission delay is proposed. Several less conservative stability criteria are derived using the proposed LKF. Based on the stability criterion obtained, the sampling interval and the upper and lower bounds of the transmission delay are taken as the conditions to guide the controller design. Finally, case studies are conducted based on a one-area power system and a three-area power system, both integrated with wind and solar power generation. The simulation comparison results demonstrate that the proposed LFC scheme exhibits strong robustness against uncertain transmission delays, load fluctuations, and the intermittent generation of wind and solar power.</description></item><item><title>Advancing Privacy-Preserving Wind Generation Forecasts With Selective Spatial-Temporal Dependencies Extraction, Encryption and Sharing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988895</link><description>The adoption of renewable energy sources (RES) is essential for accelerating the low-carbon transition. Accurate forecasting of renewable energy generation is vital for its effective integration into power systems, allowing for mitigation on variability and intermittency of RES and facilitating economic and secure grid operation. In this context, collaborative wind generation forecasting task faces multiple challenges, including secure information sharing, spatial-temporal dependencies characterization and utilization, as well as uncertainty quantification via probabilistic forecasting. To this end, this paper proposes a novel collaborative forecasting framework which features 4 core functionalities: a temporal convolutional network-autoencoder based secure data encryption and temporal dependencies extraction module; a self-attention based secure data sharing and selective spatial-temporal dependencies extraction module; a privacy-preserving collaborative point/probabilistic forecasting module based on improved pinball loss function; and an adaptive fine-tuning procedure to further leverage feature extraction performance and prediction accuracy through joint training. Case studies using real-world data from 10 wind farms located across Jiangsu province, China, validated superior performance of the proposed method while highlighting the value of the developed functionalities. The proposed collaborative forecasting method achieves 18.21%, 15.23%, 8.69% improvement in RMSE compared to the worst-performing baseline method, in benchmarking against individual forecasting, pre-training only and statistical pre-screening based methods. Furthermore, a maximum 26.62% improvement in Coverage Width-based Criterion is attained with respect to parametric and non-parametric baseline methods.</description></item><item><title>Robust Microgrid Dispatch With Real-Time Energy Sharing and Endogenous Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10999049</link><description>With the rising adoption of distributed energy resources (DERs), microgrid dispatch is facing new challenges: DER owners are independent stakeholders seeking to maximize their individual profits rather than being controlled centrally; and the dispatch of renewable generators may affect the microgrid&#8217;s exposure to uncertainty. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a two-stage robust microgrid dispatch model with real-time energy sharing and endogenous uncertainty. In the day-ahead stage, the connection/disconnection of renewable generators is optimized, which influences the size and dimension of the uncertainty set. As a result, the uncertainty set is endogenously given. In addition, non-anticipative operational bounds for energy storage (ES) are derived to enable the online operation of ES in real-time. In the real-time stage, DER owners (consumers and prosumers) share energy with each other via a proposed energy sharing mechanism, which forms a generalized Nash game. To solve the robust microgrid dispatch model, we develop an equivalent optimization model to compute the real-time energy sharing equilibrium. Based on this, a projection-based column-and-constraint generation (C&amp;amp;CG) method is proposed to handle the endogenous uncertainty. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed model and method.</description></item><item><title>Systematic Design of Active Power Control Parameters for Multi-VSG Systems Based on Active Power Separation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11003181</link><description>According to emerging guidelines, system operators are increasingly emphasizing three critical performance aspects from grid-forming (GFM) plants: active power-frequency (P-f) droop, low-frequency oscillation (LFO) damping, and active power setpoint tracking (APST) bandwidth. In GFM plants implemented by multiple virtual synchronous generators (VSGs), these performance aspects are dominated by VSGs&#8217; active power control (APC) parameters, i.e., the inertia constant H and damping coefficient D. However, an APC parameter design with these performance aspects comprehensively considered remains unexplored, potentially leading to inappropriate P-f droop, underdamped LFOs, or excessive APST bandwidth. To address this issue, first, by separating the multi-VSG system&#8217;s active power responses into a common part and a differential part, the analytical expressions for its LFO damping ratio and APST bandwidth are derived. Second, by aligning these performance aspects with the requirements outlined in representative GFM plant guidelines, a systematic APC parameter design method is proposed. This method explicitly formulates the feasible region for the APC parameters that ensures appropriate P-f droop, LFO damping, and APST bandwidth. Finally, real-time simulations and experiments are conducted in various multi-VSG systems to validate the theoretical analysis and the proposed APC parameter design method.</description></item><item><title>A Bi-Level Nash Bargaining Model for Electricity Trading Among Microgrids With Endogenous Nodal Prices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11006478</link><description>Determining a fair trading price is challenging, and this complexity is further heightened in power systems as the price must consider network constraints, fluctuating and endogenous electricity prices, and generation cost. This paper proposes a novel Nash-in-Stackelberg model designed to coordinate a collection of independently operated microgrids. Within this framework, the microgrids engage in a bargaining game to collectively decide a fair trading price as well as other operational decisions. We use the Nash bargaining solution (NBS) to model this interaction. Microgrids&#8217; trading decisions impact the locational marginal prices of the main power grid. Hence, a Stackelberg game is used to determine these prices. The Stackelberg model considers microgrids as leaders (upper-level problem) and the independent system operator as follower (lower-level problem). The NBS guarantees a fair allocation of the generated profit based on individual characteristics of the microgrids. In specific, in scenarios of higher generation, we achieve a cost reduction of  ${\$}$ 884 and  ${\$}$ 904 per microgrid compared with a grand coalition where only one microgrid receives the total cost reduction ( ${\$}$ 1788). Also we noticed that increasing the amount of solar-generated electricity reduces the nodal price in 1.53% and consequently the trading price in 1.27%.</description></item><item><title>Optimal PMU Placement via Quantum Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10980373</link><description>Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) are essential for real-time monitoring and improving grid observability. Determining the optimal PMU installation is critical, especially as the penetration of renewable energy resources increases, as the Optimal PMU Placement (OPMUP) can guarantee full system observability and reduce the installation cost. However, identifying the optimal PMU installation is a prototypical combinatorial optimization problem, requiring substantial classical computational resources. Furthermore, the significant expansion of the grid in terms of renewable energy integration makes the determination of optimal PMU placement increasingly computationally intensive. In this work, a hybrid quantum-classical approach, Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), is developed to effectively solve the optimal PMU installation problem under normal and channel limitation scenarios. A tailored objective function is proposed for quantum optimization, which takes into account both PMU placement cost and system observability constraints. To analyze the observability of QAOA-generated solution distributions, recursion-based Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search algorithms are proposed for normal and channel-limited scenarios. These methods determine solution feasibility on classical computers with  $\mathcal {O}(N+M)$  complexity, outperforming the  $\mathcal {O}(N^{2})$  complexity of inequality-based approaches, where N and M denote the number of buses and branches, respectively. In addition, the proposed quantum optimization framework can significantly reduce the computational complexity from the polynomial or exponential levels required by previous classical methods, i.e.,  $\mathcal {O}(RN)$  on quantum circuits and  $\mathcal {O}(R(M+N))$  on classical resources, where R is the repetition times of quantum circuits executions. The proposed method is tested on IEEE 9-, 14-, 24-, and 30-bus systems, where better installation results are achieved compared to the state-of-the-art results, providing a new baseline for further quantum studies in OPMUP. Furthermore, a landscape optimization strategy is introduced to improve QAOA solution quality. This approach also reduces the time cost of quantum computing resources, making it more efficient for current quantum applications. Additionally, parameter studies are conducted to identify key factors influencing QAOA performance. This work is expected to lay the foundations for addressing challenging power system problems through quantum technology in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Operation and Control Schemes of Retired Batteries in DC Microgrid for Secondary Usage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964325</link><description>The utilization of repurposed second-life batteries from electric vehicles in DC microgrids presents a sustainable and cost-effective solution. However, efficiently integrating these batteries within DC microgrids poses two main challenges: (1) poor consistency among retired battery packs; (2) fluctuations in the DC bus voltage. Traditional approaches primarily focus on achieving the state of charge (SOC) balancing within retired battery packs, often neglecting the suppression of voltage fluctuations, thereby compromising system stability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a virtual DC machine (VDCM)-based control strategy that enhances both the power quality of the DC microgrid and the consistency of retired battery packs. On the one hand, reconfigurable topology and SOC balancing strategies are developed to manage the equalization current, achieving SOC balancing within the retired battery packs. On the other hand, a VDCM strategy is designed to leverage the capacity characteristics of retired batteries to increase the inertia of the DC microgrid. Compared to conventional methods, experimental results show that the proposed strategy not only maintains SOC balancing during both the charging and discharging phases but also significantly reduces overshoot and settle times of dc voltage to 64.2% and 55.6%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>V2Sim: An Open-Source Microscopic V2G Simulation Platform in Urban Power and Transportation Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10970754</link><description>This paper proposes V2Sim, an open source Python-based simulation platform designed for advanced vehicle-to-grid (V2G) analysis in coupled urban power and transportation networks. By integrating a microscopic urban transportation network (MUTN) with a power distribution network (PDN), V2Sim enables precise modeling of electric vehicle charging loads (EVCL) and dynamic V2G operations.

Meanwhile, wireless charging lanes (WCLs) and solar-powered EVs (SEVs) offer a promising solution by providing wireless and solar charging power while driving. Under this circumstance, addressing the optimal planning of WCLs while considering SEV operations is crucial for facilitating the widespread adoption of EVs. Considering the uncertain solar power harvesting of SEVs, we propose a data-driven two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model for this integrated planning and operation problem. In the first stage, we optimize the deployment of WCLs with budget constraints, and the second stage determines the optimal operation schedules of SEVs under uncertain solar charging power characterized by a moment-based ambiguity set. To address the computational challenges (due to the discrete variables in both stages and the infinite-dimensional optimization in the second stage), we develop two approximation models and an integrated distributed method. Finally, extensive numerical experiments with synthetic and real transportation networks are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our proposed models and algorithms. Specifically, the proposed DRO model achieves a 1.17% lower total cost in out-of-sample tests than the sample average approximation method, and with higher wireless charging power rates and increased battery capacities, we can build fewer WCLs.</description></item><item><title>A Real-Time Robust Method for Post-Disaster Load Restoration of Coordinated Power-Transportation System With Vehicle-to-Grid Response</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10994444</link><description>With the proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs), vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capability emerges as a potential resource for load restoration after a large disruption. This paper presents a real-time post-disaster load restoration method for the coordinated power distribution networks (PDN) and urban traffic networks (UTN) with V2G response. The multi-period restoration problem is modeled as a dynamic programming-based multi-stage robust optimization model, addressing uncertainties of renewable generation and traffic demands. It incorporates a dynamic traffic assignment scheme to characterize vehicle travels and V2G services within short time slots. Then, an improved robust dual dynamic programming algorithm is proposed to solve the multi-stage robust optimization problem. For online application, the solved value functions from each stage serve as per-period policies, leveraging knowledge of future uncertainties to quickly guide real-time load restoration through distributed resource dispatch, network reconfiguration, and V2G assignments. Numerical experiments with a 33-bus PDN and 20-road UTN, plus a real-world 91-bus PDN with 35-road UTN, validate the effectiveness of proposed restoration method.</description></item><item><title>Best Response Learning Assisted Asynchronous ADMM for Real-Time Energy Sharing Under Communication Delay</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981894</link><description>Energy sharing can activate prosumer flexibility to support power system operations. However, in practice, communication delays are inevitable and seriously threaten the real-time energy sharing equilibrium. While many asynchronous methods aim to address this, they ignore the learnability of prosumer&#8217;s response and often struggle to balance convergence speed and stability. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel asynchronous algorithm based on best response (BR) learning. First, we demonstrate that the prosumer&#8217;s best response in ADMM-based energy sharing can be represented as the piecewise linear function. Besides, we propose a batch-fitting method to learn the BR function with high accuracy and low computational cost. Building on this, we develop an asynchronous ADMM algorithm with a practical error criterion to ensure strict convergence of energy sharing under severe delays. Numerical studies indicate that the proposed algorithm can achieve faster convergence with fewer iterations and greater reliability across various energy sharing scales and asynchronous rates than existing asynchronous algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Data Aggregation Reconfiguration Scheme to Mitigate Stealthy False Data Injection Attacks in Energy Management Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947360</link><description>Stealthy false data injection attacks (SFDIAs) pose serious threats to the stability and operation of power systems, with the potential to initiate cascading failures. These attacks depend on extensive access to system measurements, and the likelihood of gaining such access is closely linked to the structure of the system&#8217;s cyber-layer. However, the role of the cyber-layer in assessing SFDIA vulnerabilities has been largely overlooked in the literature, leading to oversimplified risk evaluations and suboptimal mitigation strategies. To address this gap, this paper first proposes a new cyber-physical risk metric (CPRM) to assess the system&#8217;s vulnerability to SFDIAs. The CPRM combines the physical impact of losing a transmission line-such as load shedding or generation loss-with the probability of such a loss resulting from an SFDIA. The likelihood of losing a transmission line is estimated by identifying all critical phasor measurement unit (PMU) sets, defined as sets whose measurements can be manipulated to stealthily overload the line. These critical PMU sets are determined using an algorithm that solves multiple bi-level optimization problems. Next, Bayesian attack graphs (BAGs) are developed for each substation and communication link to model potential access pathways and calculate the probability of compromising the identified critical PMU sets. Building on this analysis, the paper introduces a novel data aggregation reconfiguration (DAR) scheme that dynamically modifies the cyber-layer structure using software-defined networking (SDN) to minimize the risk of SFDIAs. Simulation results from the IEEE 39-bus test system demonstrate that the proposed DAR scheme significantly enhances the system&#8217;s resilience against SFDIAs.</description></item><item><title>Privacy Preservation for Cloud-Edge-Collaborative Energy Management System Using Post-Quantum Homomorphic Encryption</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10980370</link><description>Cloud-based energy management systems (EMS) in smart grids face privacy challenges, as existing methods based on traditional homomorphic encryption support limited operations and are vulnerable to quantum attacks.

However, current privacy-preserving approaches often compromise either control performance or privacy preservation performance. To address this challenge, this paper presents a node-decomposition privacy-preserving (NDPP) method for fully distributed, finite-time secondary control in DC microgrids. By splitting each node in the communication graph into multiple sub-nodes, the method enhances both convergence speed and privacy preservation without sacrificing control accuracy. Sub-nodes communicate within groups, and the topology of the generated graph is concealed from malicious nodes and eavesdroppers. Theoretical analysis is provided to prove finite-time voltage regulation and current sharing with privacy preservation against malicious nodes and external eavesdroppers. Simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the method in maintaining control performance and power quality.</description></item><item><title>Early-Stage Anomaly Detection in IT-OT Power Grid Communication Networks Using Wavelet Transform and Hybrid Deep Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988657</link><description>In cyber-physical power systems, the imperative convergence of information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) engenders enhanced operational efficiency, yet increases susceptibility to cyberattacks. This scenario accentuates the necessity for deploying effective anomaly detection (AD) mechanisms to protect these critical infrastructures against the devastating impacts of cyberattacks. Traditional AD algorithms often focus on identifying anomalies through analyzing spatial and temporal patterns derived from the physical system measurements, an approach that typically proves effective only after a cyberattack has been successfully executed at the later stages of the cyberkill chain. This reactive approach fails to respond to evolving cyber threats. To tackle this issue, this article introduces an innovative framework for early-stage AD in integrated IT-OT power grid communication networks. Our approach models the IT-OT network as a traffic dispersion graph and applies wavelet transform to decompose the real-time traffic throughput of each information node into its constituent sub-bands to extract time-frequency features. These features are then weighted and prioritized using a graph attention mechanism and fed into a bidirectional long short-term memory for temporal analysis, ultimately classifying the nodes as normal or abnormal. Our experiments confirm the methodology&#8217;s precise detection and localization of active cyberattack sites, outperforming existing state-of-the-art AD models.</description></item><item><title>Observer-Based Finite-Time Fuzzy Load Frequency Control for Multiarea Nonlinear Power Systems Under Input Delays and Cyber Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10993468</link><description>This paper presents an observer-based finite-time fuzzy load frequency control (LFC) strategy for multiarea nonlinear power systems with uncertain parameters, considering the impact of cyber attacks and input delays. To tackle the nonlinearities and uncertainties, an LFC model incorporating multiple input delays is developed within the interval type-2 (IT2) Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy framework. In response to unmeasurable states and unknown false data injection attacks (FDIAs), state and attack observers are designed to estimate these unknowns, thereby enabling effective compensation for FDIAs during the controller design. Furthermore, an observer-based reduction method is employed to transform the multiple input-delay system into a delay-free one, which reduces conservatism. Sufficient conditions are derived such that the closed-loop system is finite-time stable with  $H_{\infty }$  performance. Finally, simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A New Method for Stealthy False Data Injection Attack Detection Using Advanced Feasibility Areas Considering Spatial Distribution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11004030</link><description>The Feasibility Area (FA) in power system applications defines the region within which Power System State Variables (PSSVs) typically exist under normal operating conditions. Accurate characterization of the FA helps enhancing optimal power flow, detecting anomalies, and identifying stealthy False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs). Traditional FA-based approaches assess the location of PSSVs based on discrete time instances, using a binary flag to indicate whether the PSSVs lie inside or outside the FA. This paper introduces an advanced FA-based stealthy FDIAs detection method that improves upon this by incorporating the spatial distribution of PSSVs relative to the estimated FA. Unlike conventional methods, the advanced FA incorporates spatial distribution to evaluate the proximity of the current PSSV to the expected FA in the complex plane. A sigmoid-expansion flag is employed to represent the probability of the current PSSVs belonging to the expected FA, replacing the conventional binary flag. This sigmoid-expansion flag is then used as an input to a Deep Neural Network (DNN), where both the sigmoid-expansion flag and DNN model parameters are fine-tuned during training to ensure optimal compatibility, thereby improving detection accuracy. The proposed method significantly improves the detection of stealthy FDIAs, offering superior performance over traditional FA. Additionally, it enables the extraction of key attack characteristics, such as type, nature, and magnitude, further strengthening the system&#8217;s defense capabilities.</description></item><item><title>Carbon-Aware Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading in an Unbalanced Distribution Network via a Nash Equilibrium Discovery Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10966432</link><description>Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading offers an innovative platform for prosumers to engage in bilateral electricity and carbon trades, enabling promoting the integration of distributed energy resources and supporting low-carbon operations in distribution networks. However, existing studies often rely on single-phase approximations, leading to inaccuracies in emission accounting and potential economic inefficiencies loss. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a carbon-aware P2P energy trading mechanism for unbalanced distribution networks. A novel joint electricity and carbon trading market framework is developed, integrating carbon permits trading with a continuous double auction mechanism. The trading process is formulated as a cooperative Markov game to capture the stochastic nature of market dynamics and to enable intelligent bidding decisions. A Nash equilibrium (NE) discovery multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework is employed, utilizing a trust region policy optimization-based algorithm to enhance trading reliability and policy interpretability. Simulations on a modified IEEE-123 unbalanced distribution network demonstrate the proposed effectiveness in reducing operational costs and carbon emissions, providing rigorous NE validation and showcasing its practical applicability in complex energy markets.</description></item><item><title>Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring via Binary Integer Search and Transient Load Feature Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10976991</link><description>Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) aims to analyze energy consumption and monitor loads without intrusive measurements. However, existing household NILM models often depend heavily on specific datasets or electricity usage scenarios, which limits their performance consistency across different households. To enhance adaptability across diverse households and regions, this paper proposes an optimization-based NILM solution consisting of two key steps: using binary integer search to determine a feasible solution space, and incorporating transient load features in the final solution selection. The proposed model only requires a few electrical parameters for each appliance, eliminating the need for device-level load training data. Tests on real-world datasets across multiple households demonstrate the model&#8217;s effectiveness in load disaggregation and its computational efficiency, making it suitable for practical applications. Furthermore, the model&#8217;s physical interpretability lays a strong foundation for further research and development.</description></item><item><title>RL2: Reinforce Large Language Model to Assist Safe Reinforcement Learning for Energy Management of Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11016112</link><description>As large-scale distributed energy resources are integrated into the active distribution networks (ADNs), effective energy management in ADNs becomes increasingly prominent compared to traditional distribution networks. Although advanced reinforcement learning (RL) methods, which alleviate the burden of complicated modelling and optimization, have greatly improved the efficiency of energy management in ADNs, safety becomes a critical concern for RL applications in real-world problems. Since the design and adjustment of penalty functions, which correspond to operational safety constraints, require extensive domain knowledge in RL and power system operation, the emerging ADN operators call for a more flexible and customized approach to address the penalty functions so that the operational safety and efficiency can be further enhanced. Empowered with strong comprehension, reasoning, and in-context learning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) provide a promising way to assist safe RL for energy management in ADNs. In this paper, we introduce the LLM to comprehend operational safety requirements in ADNs and generate corresponding penalty functions. In addition, we propose an RL2 mechanism to refine the generated functions iteratively and adaptively through multi-round dialogues, in which the LLM agent adjusts the functions&#8217; pattern and parameters based on training and test performance of the downstream RL agent. The proposed method significantly reduces the intervention of the ADN operators. Comprehensive test results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Distribution Network Expansion-Friendly Adaptive Deep Reinforcement Learning for Inverter-Based Volt-Var Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10975829</link><description>In recent years, in response to the challenges posed by the volatility and uncertainty of increasing renewable energy sources (RESs), numerous studies have emerged on inverter-based Volt-Var control (VVC) using data-driven deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods. However, most of these methods assume fixed distribution network (DN) scales, which may not be applicable under potential DN expansion involving newly connected nodes and controllable devices. To address this issue, this letter proposes a novel DRL framework for inverter-based VVC capable of adapting to evolving DN environments. Specifically, state embedding for expanding state space (SE-ESS) and action branching for expanding action space (AB-EAS) are designed to facilitate model fine-tuning for the expansion of DN scales. Case studies on a modified IEEE 33-bus system validate the proposed method&#8217;s strong adaptability to DN expansion.</description></item><item><title>Aggregated Modeling of Massive Heterogeneous Building HVAC Loads for Demand Response: A Fluid Dynamics Perspective</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988639</link><description>The aggregation of massive heterogeneous building HVAC (heating, ventilation and air-conditioning) loads is essential for enhancing the flexibility of power grids in demand response contexts. However, practical challenges such as unavailability of load parameters and sensor update delays significantly hinder the development of accurate aggregation models. To this end, this letter introduces a novel fluid dynamics perspective to model the HVAC aggregation behavior under more realistic scenarios that account for these practical issues. A novel analogy is established to treat the HVAC population as a fluid system, enabling the aggregation dynamics to be intuitively captured through well-established fluid phenomena. Building on this perspective, a 2-D advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) equation-based aggregation model is developed. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately predict the aggregated power variation under these realistic scenarios. In addition, control strategies guided by this model can accurately track the reference load regulation signal, with an average relative error of less than 2%.</description></item><item><title>UAV Path Optimization Using High-Altitude Data and Mutated Fruit-Fly Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10932721</link><description>In uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation, one of the foremost challenges is devising efficient flight paths that navigate complex environments while conserving energy and avoiding obstacles. The paper proposes a High-Altitude Platform aided Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm (HAPFOA) as a novel approach to address sub-optimal path planning in dynamic complex environments by leveraging fruit fly's innate foraging strategies and adapting them to the three-dimensional challenges of UAV navigation at high altitudes. This approach applies the Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm (FOA), where each UAV is analogous to a &#8216;fly' exploring potential pathways. The paths chosen by these UAVs are evaluated using a comprehensive &#8217;smell' metric that integrates crucial navigational factors such as closeness to the target, obstacle avoidance, energy utilization, and maneuverability. This process is iterative, with each UAV continuously adjusting its flight path based on the &#8216;smell' metric feedback, aiming to find the route with the best possible &#8217;smell' score. The algorithm helps to avoid obstacles during the vision phase. Cubic spline interpolation is used to refine and smoothen the UAV trajectories to ensure the practical application of these flight paths, making them more applicable and realistic for risky operations. Based on obstacle warnings from HAPUAV, the simulation results show an efficient route formulation by the proposed model with no idle time and a faster convergence rate. Another advantage of HAPFOA is its ability to preserve more energy than other models.</description></item><item><title>Edge-Assisted Flexible Platooning of Connected and Automated Vehicles Under Traffic Anomaly</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10917005</link><description>The platooning of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) has the great potential to significantly improve travel experience in terms of safety, comfortableness, and energy efficiency. However, constrained by sensing range and prediction accuracy, the performance of CAV platoon can not be guaranteed in the scenario of mixed traffic consisting of CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). This is not only due to the uncertainty of HDVs but also related to the occurrence of various traffic anomalies, such as emergency braking and accidents. In this paper, we aim to investigate an efficient control strategy to guarantee the operation of the platoon in mixed traffic, especially in the case of traffic anomalies. To tackle the problem, an edge-assisted platoon control strategy, called E-CACC, is proposed. First, an error-aware flexible tracking policy is designed to adapt to HDV uncertainties and speed prediction errors. Based on the tracking policy, a zone model predictive control (ZMPC) method is then designed to guarantee travel safety and avoid undesired acceleration. Further, a coordination strategy of CAV platoon and roadside unit (RSU) is proposed to prevent the platoon from potential collision in the case of traffic anomalies, where an event-based communication trigger is designed to determine whether and when the platoon establishes communication links with RSU to acquire exogenous sensing data of anomaly segment. Finally, the evaluation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving travel safety and comfortableness.</description></item><item><title>R-MDDQN: A V2V-Based Secure Computation Offloading Algorithm for Video Analytics in Vehicle Edge Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916985</link><description>Real-time analytics on video data requires substantial computational resources and high energy consumption, and computational offloading has emerged as a promising solution to support such resource-intensive services. However, most of the existing research fails to consider the collaboration between video quality and security optimization in wireless offloading, making it less efficient in real-world scenarios with diverse requirements. To address these challenges, we propose a novel V2V-based secure computation offloading algorithm for video analysis, called radial basis function (RBF)-based multi-objective double deep Q-network (R-MDDQN). We use Wyner's wiretap coding scheme to obtain the achievable secrecy capacity and ensure that video data cannot be decoded by eavesdroppers. To address the trade-off problem among multiple objectives, we employ an RBF weight network to dynamically adjust the weights by learning the variations of different objective values. Each DDQN agent receives reward evaluations based on different objective functions and effectively and dynamically approximates the optimal offloading strategy. Extensive experiments conducted using real-world datasets from Shenzhen demonstrate that the proposed R-MDDQN reduces latency by approximately 9.32$\%$, decreases energy consumption by around 7.3$\%$, improves video analysis accuracy by about 18.9$\%$, and enhances security capacity by roughly 14.8$\%$ compared to existing task offloading schemes.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Active-Passive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Assisted URLLC Services for Energy Efficiency Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10912728</link><description>This paper investigates a hybrid reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) architecture incorporating both passive and active elements, to enhance the ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) services between a central controller (CC) and remote devices in mission-critical scenarios. Specifically, with the objective of maximizing the energy efficiency (EE) of the system under target reliability, an optimization problem in terms of the transmit precoding of CC, the reflecting coefficients of hybrid RIS, and the allocated blocklength is proposed. To deal with the intractability of the non-convex problem considering the various quality of service (QoS) issues of remote devices such as transmission latency and rate constraints, Dinkelbach's method is invoked to transform the original problem into a parameterized concave-convex function. Subsequently, efficient algorithms are developed based on alternating optimization, successive convex approximation, and Big-M formulation methods. In addition, the effects of several vital parameters on the performance of the proposed scheme are investigated. Numerical results show that compared to conventional full-passive/active RIS and no-RIS systems, the proposed hybrid RIS offers significant performance advantages. Furthermore, the optimal number and distribution of active/passive elements allocation are demonstrated. It is observed that the proposed hybrid RIS with only a few active elements can achieve higher EE than conventional passive RIS even with infinite blocklength, sufficiently revealing the potential of hybrid RIS to reduce transmission latency, guarantee rewarding reliability, and enhance EE for URLLC services.</description></item><item><title>A Glimpse of Physical Layer Security in Internet of Vehicles: Joint Design of the Transmission Power and Sensing Power</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10938968</link><description>The urgent need for higher sensing accuracy and transmission reliability in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), along with the limited availability of spectrum resources, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) tends to operate in higher frequency bands. This shift, however, introduces severe sensing-communication coupling interference. Due to the openness nature of the wireless medium, ISAC enabled IoV faces more significant security concerns. Centered at the communication interference, traditional physical layer security (PLS) schemes aim to maximize the channel quality difference between legitimate and eavesdropping channels to ensure the perfect secrecy. However, transforming directly current PLS methods into secure communication in ISAC-assisted IoV systems faces two significant challenges, because of sensing-communication coupling interference and strong directional beamforming caused by higher frequency bands. To address these challenges, this paper formulates an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the average secrecy rate by jointly designing the transmission power allocation and radar sensing power allocation, while ensuring the desired sensing accuracy and transmission reliability. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, we introduce the block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to optimizing transmission power or radar sensing power individually, joint optimization significantly improves the average secrecy rate upon convergence, with increases of at least 265% and 441%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Performance Analysis and EE Optimization in AAV-Assisted Dual-Layer Heterogeneous Communication Network Based on RSMA</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10912793</link><description>This paper investigates a dual-layer heterogeneous communication network assisted by multiple autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) based on rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). Considering the repulsion characteristics between AAVs' positions and terrestrial base stations (BSs), AAVs are deployed in non-hole areas outside the BSs. The positions of AAVs are modeled by Poisson hole process (PHP). Due to the difficulty of directly solving the user association problem under PHP, the nearest neighbor hole approximation method is introduced. Due to the complex interference caused by multiple communication links in the dual-layer heterogeneous network, we adopt the conditional Laplace transform method to represent interference, deriving expressions for coverage probability and area spectral efficiency (ASE). Considering the energy constraints of the AAV network, this paper defines the system-level network energy efficiency (EE) as the ratio of the ASE to the average energy consumption per unit area. Utilizing this framework, we jointly optimize the AAV network density and the RSMA power allocation coefficients to maximize EE. The numerical results ultimately validated the accuracy of the theoretical analysis. Through simulation analysis, this paper explores the impact of network deployment parameters on system performance and provided the AAV network density and RSMA power allocation scheme that maximizes EE.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Geometry-Based Stochastic Model for Indoor Scenarios Incorporating Dense Multipath Components Towards Standardization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10912741</link><description>Wireless channel measurements in both indoor office and industrial Internet of things (IIoT) scenarios reveal the presence of not only specular multipath components (SMCs) but also dense multipath components (DMCs). However, existing standard channel models including the 3GPP TR 38.901 channel model lack the capability to characterize DMCs in these indoor scenarios. In this paper, an improved algorithm for estimating delay-angular parameters of DMC clusters is proposed for processing channel measurement data in indoor office and IIoT scenarios. Statistical properties of SMCs and measured DMCs are analyzed. Then, a novel time-domain non-stationary sixth generation (6G) standard channel model is proposed based on the extension of the 3GPP TR 38.901 channel model by including DMCs for indoor scenarios. In the proposed 6G model, DMCs are incorporated by sharing the same cluster centers with SMCs but exhibiting different intra-cluster parameters, e.g., larger numbers of rays and larger values of intra-cluster delay spread. To accurately describe the cluster birth-death process, a squared sine function is introduced to model power changes of SMCs and DMCs with different rates. Moreover, simulation results of the proposed model are compared with those of the 3GPP TR 38.901 channel model, 6G pervasive channel model, and measurement data. The proposed model shows the closest agreement with measurement results.</description></item><item><title>Cooperative Sensing in Uplink ISAC System: A Multi-User Waveform Optimization Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10912780</link><description>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is expected to become a crucial component of the sixth-generation (6G) networks owing to its outstanding spectrum management capability. However, improving the cooperative sensing capabilities of multiple ISAC user equipments (ISAC-UEs) in complex interference environment presents a significant research challenge. This paper focuses on the multi-user cooperative sensing in uplink orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) ISAC system. By utilizing the stochastic geometry, we model the distribution of communication UEs (COM-UEs) as a one-dimensional Matern hard-core point process (1-D MHCP), and derive a closed-form expression for interference power. To further enhance cooperative sensing accuracy while maintaining quality of service (QoS) in communication, we perform waveform optimization by jointly optimizing the weighted range-velocity Cramer&#8211;Rao lower bound (CRLB) subject to communication data rate (CDR) and subcarrier power ratio (SPR) constraints. This approach involves selecting the optimal subcarriers for sensing and allocating the corresponding power on each subcarrier for communication and sensing subsystems. By employing the convex relaxation and the cyclic minimization algorithm (CMA), we decompose the complex optimization problem into three sub-problems, simplifying the original NP-hard problem into a solvable one via a cyclic optimization framework. The simulation results validate the effectiveness of our optimization strategy, and evaluate the influence of CDR and SPR constraints using the CRLB and root mean square error (RMSE).</description></item><item><title>Delay-Aware Digital Twin Synchronization in Mobile Edge Networks With Semantic Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916988</link><description>The synchronization of digital twins (DT) serves as the cornerstone for effective operation of the DT framework. However, the limitations of channel capacity can greatly affect the data transmission efficiency of wireless communication. Unlike traditional communication methods, semantic communication transmits the intended meanings of physical objects instead of raw data, effectively saving bandwidth resource and reducing DT synchronization latency. Hence, we are committed to integrating semantic communication into the DT synchronization framework within the mobile edge computing system, aiming to enhance the DT synchronization efficiency of user devices (UDs). Our goal is to minimize the average DT synchronization latency of all UDs by jointly optimizing the synchronization strategy, transmission power of UDs, and computational resource allocation for both UDs and base station. The formulated problem involves sequential decision-making across multiple coherent time slots. Furthermore, the mobility of UDs introduces uncertainties into the decision-making process. To solve this challenging optimization problem efficiently, we propose a soft actor-critic-based deep reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize synchronization strategy and resource allocation. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can reduce synchronization latency by up to 13.2% and improve synchronization efficiency compared to other benchmark schemes.</description></item><item><title>Joint UAV Deployment, Power Allocation, and Coalition Formation for Physical Layer Security in Heterogeneous Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916952</link><description>In the coming sixth-generation era, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been explored for convenient air access and strong environmental adaptability to provide communication services for ground Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. However, the inherent broadcast nature of wireless makes UAV communications vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks. This paper explores a secure uplink communication in a heterogeneous network, where a UAV provides communication services to ground IoT nodes in the presence of an eavesdropper. We propose a transmission scheme to maximize the overall sum secrecy rate, in which the cooperative jamming technique and coalition formation game are employed, and the UAV endurance is considered. Specifically, a double-layer optimization problem is formulated, including a non-convex optimization problem in the lower layer, and a game theory problem in the upper layer. We use block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation methods to decompose the lower layer problem into UAV deployment and power allocation sub-problems, and convert them into a difference of two convex functions programming problem and a second-order cone programming problem, respectively. Moreover, we develop an algorithm to solve the upper layer problem, obtaining a stable coalition formation. Simulation results show that the proposed transmission scheme can effectively improve the overall sum secrecy rate, and has dynamic adaptability to eavesdropping attacks.</description></item><item><title>300 GHz Dual-Band Channel Measurement, Analysis and Modeling in L-Shaped Scenarios</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10918843</link><description>The Terahertz (THz) band (0.1&#8211;10 THz) has been envisioned as one of the promising spectrum bands for sixth-generation (6 G) and beyond communications. In this paper, THz channel measurement, simulation, and modeling for the generalized L-shaped intersection scenario are conducted. First, a dual-band angular-resolvable wideband channel measurement in an L-shaped hallway is presented and THz channel characteristics at 306-321 GHz and 356-371 GHz are analyzed. Then, a generic L-shaped intersection scenario model is developed, by adapting the ray-tracing (RT)-statistical hybrid channel modeling method THz channel characteristics in the L-shaped scenario. Especially, the spatial consistency of reflected multi-path components (MPCs) in the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) region is analyzed, and the continuous change of dominant MPCs is statistically modeled, in terms of their power, delay and angles of arrival. As a result, the proposed hybrid approach reduces the computational cost by reducing the determination of dominant MPCs in the NLoS region of the L-shaped scenario. Besides, as conventional close-in and alpha-beta path loss models cannot take good care of large-scale fading in the NLoS case, a modified alpha-beta (M-AB) path loss model for the NLoS region of L-shaped scenarios is proposed and verified 80% more accurate for L-shaped scenarios at different frequency bands.</description></item><item><title>Outage-Aware Online Prediction Control for Securing UAV-Aided Communication</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10919016</link><description>Considering an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided multi-user system with multiple mobile eavesdroppers, this paper aims to develop an outage-aware online control strategy to counter the imperfect information of mobile user equipments (UEs) and mobile eavesdroppers. To perform online control effectively, a novel online prediction model is proposed, which models the trajectory of UEs as a stochastic Gauss-Markov mobility model and the trajectory of eavesdroppers as a worst-case model based on the current imperfect location information. The online control problem is formulated as a new multi-stage optimization framework, in which we perform online control by solving per-slot prediction problems and a resource allocation problem for the initial point. In the per-slot prediction problem, we jointly optimize the predictive trajectory and transmit power for the upcoming time slot (TS) by maximizing the minimum achievable secrecy rate (ASR) among all UEs. For resource allocation at the initial TS, we optimize transmit power by maximizing the minimum ASR among all UEs. The per-slot prediction problem and the resourceallocation problem are all non-convex problems hence they are intractable in terms of computational complexity. To address them, we propose an efficient inner-approximation methods, by applying successive convex approximation (SCA) methodand S-procedure as well as Bernstein-type inequality. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed online control scheme over the conventional benchmark schemes which include existing offline schemes and online scheme without outage based prediction as well as shortest-path navigation scheme.</description></item><item><title>On Spectral Intelligence in 6G URLLC Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916508</link><description>Cognitive radio (CR)-empowered 6G networks are deemed a key candidate technology to achieve ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) with enhanced spectrum utilization efficiency. However, there are several challenges to address in achieving this objective. In particular, the sequential and random sensing performed by secondary users (SUs) to find idle channels within a given band in a CR network (CRN) leads to time and energy consumption, and processing overheads, which consequently cause early depletion of the device's energy, underutilization of the available spectrum, and prolonged delays in communication. To circumvent this problem, in this paper, a spectrum efficient scheme is proposed based on idle spectrum inference and ranking, which takes into account the devices' heterogeneity as well as their priorities in resource allocation. Based on the probabilistic approach, the scheme uses multiple parameters in a channel's evaluation and suitability assessment before selection for transmission. Markov chain modeling is leveraged to deal with the users' arrival and departure uncertainties and to derive expressions for core performance metrics, including service capacity and retainability, spectrum utilization efficiency, reliability, network unserviceable and handoff probabilities, channel availability, and communication latency. The scheme is analyzed under various patterns of users' arrivals. The acquired analytical and simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme compared to the state-of-the-art to realize URLLC applications.</description></item><item><title>Joint Task Offloading and Resource Allocation for LEO Satellite-Based Mobile Edge Computing Systems With Heterogeneous Task Demands</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916814</link><description>To satisfy the growing demand for supporting intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) applications in remote areas, satellite mobile edge computing (SMEC) systems are expected to be widely deployed. Meanwhile, as IoT applications are increasingly diversified, the tasks received by SMEC systems present heterogeneous demands for various resources and quality of service (QoS) metrics, necessitating customized design to accommodate such heterogeneity. In this paper, we investigate the problem of joint task offloading and resource allocation in SMEC systems with heterogeneous task demands. We first propose a customized task utility model that captures the diversified demands, which is an extension of traditional unified task utility models. Based on the model, we then formulate a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem for joint optimization of task offloading, computing resource allocation, transmission power control, and user association, aiming to maximize the sum utility of all tasks. To solve the MINLP, a multi-layer iterative framework is proposed that decomposes the original problem into two subproblems, which are solved by successive convex approximation (SCA) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, respectively. Simulation results show that, by applying the proposed task utility model, the average utility performance of UEs can be improved by 50% and 100% compared to applying a single metric-based utility model and a typical classification-based utility model, respectively; the proposed task offloading and resource allocation scheme achieves a $30\%\hbox{--}80\%$ performance gain compared to benchmark schemes.</description></item><item><title>A Dynamic Optimization Framework for Computation Rate Maximization in UAV-Assisted Mobile Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10918796</link><description>Mobile edge computing (MEC) significantly boosts the computing power and reduces the energy consumption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, serving as a valuable complement to cloud computing. The application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for MEC systems can effectively alleviate the issue of insufficient or damaged communication facilities in remote areas, further expanding the scope of MEC applications. In this article, we present a system model for UAV-assisted wireless-powered MEC systems in a dynamic environment with the objective of maximizing the computation rate of user devices. Due to the complexity of the optimization objective in dynamic environments, we propose a swarm intelligence-based optimization framework with a mechanism for responding to environmental changes, which is intended to enhance population diversity in both static and dynamic environments with the aim of overcoming premature convergence. We integrate particle swarm optimization and harmony search into the proposed framework, naming them DOPSO and DOHS, respectively. Simulation results for two offloading modes in UAV-assisted MEC systems indicate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms other dynamic optimization algorithms.</description></item><item><title>High-Speed Ultra-Energy-Efficient Memristor-Based Massive MIMO SIC Detector Circuit With Hybrid Analog-Digital Computing Architecture</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11017468</link><description>The emerging memristor crossbar array based computing circuits exhibit computing speeds and energy efficiency far surpassing those of traditional digital processors. This type of circuits can complete high-dimensional matrix operations in an extremely short time through analog computing, making it naturally applicable to linear detection and maximum likelihood detection in massive multiple-input&#8211;multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, the challenge of employing memristor crossbar arrays to efficiently implement other nonlinear detection algorithms, such as the successive interference cancellation (SIC) algorithm, remains unresolved. In this paper we propose a memristor-based circuit design for massive MIMO SIC detector. The proposed circuit comprises several judiciously designed analog matrix computing modules and hybrid analog-digital slicers, which enables the proposed circuit to perform the SIC algorithm with a hybrid analog-digital computing architecture. We show that the computing speed and the computational energy-efficiency of the proposed detector circuit are 43 times faster and 110 times higher, respectively, than those of a traditional 8-core digital signal processor (DSP), and also advantageous over the benchmark high-performance field programmable gate array (FPGA) and graphics processing unit (GPU).</description></item><item><title>A AAV-Enabled Integrated Sensing and Covert Communication System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10945513</link><description>In this paper, an integrated sensing and covert communications (ISACC) framework is established for autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV) system, where one mobile AAV is deployed to provide sensing and communication services simultaneously, while there exists a malicious warden attempts to detect whether the AAV is communicating with multiple ground users during the whole flight. First, we consider that the communication signal from the AAV is hided under the cover of noise uncertainty in the presence of sensing signal. Then, to maximize the minimum achievable rate among all users with the required sensing performance and covertness, an efficient iterative solution is designed by jointly optimizing the power allocation, trajectory and communication scheduling of AAV. Numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of our proposed solution and demonstrate the fundamental trade-off between covertness, sensing requirement and communication achievable rate.</description></item><item><title>Target Detection for OTFS-Aided Cell-Free MIMO ISAC System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10922196</link><description>This paper focuses on enhancing target detection performance for a multi-user integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system using cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology and orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) waveform in high-speed vehicular environments. The former helps integrate sensing and communication technologies, whereas the latter enables delay-Doppler processing in which a doubly dispersive channel appears with almost constant and flat frequencies. We propose a sensing-centric (SC) approach for target detection using communication signals with/without sensing signals. Power allocation is optimized to maximize the sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the proposed SC scheme while ensuring a required quality-of-service (QoS) for the communication user equipment (UEs), and adhering to each access point's (AP's) power budget. Numerical results show that the proposed SC scheme vastly outperforms a communication-centric method that minimizes the total power consumed at the APs subject to the same constraints.</description></item><item><title>Channel Modeling and Rate Analysis of Optical Inter-Satellite Link (OISL)</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10924779</link><description>Optical inter-satellite links (OISLs) improve connectivity between satellites in space. They offer advantages such as high-throughput data transfer and reduced size, weight, and power requirements compared to traditional radio frequency transmission. However, the channel model and communication performance for long-distance inter-satellite laser transmission still require in-depth study. In this paper, we first develop a channel model for OISL communication within non-terrestrial networks (NTN) by accounting for pointing errors caused by satellite jitter and tracking noise. We derive the distributions of the channel state arising from these pointing errors and calculate their average value. Additionally, we determine the average achievable data rate for OISL communication in NTN and design a cooperative OISL system, highlighting a trade-off between concentrating beam energy and balancing misalignment. We calculate the minimum number of satellites required in cooperative OISLs to achieve a targeted data transmission size while adhering to latency constraints. This involves exploring the balance between the increased data rate of each link and the cumulative latency across all links. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed analytical model and provide insights into the optimal number of satellites needed for cooperative OISLs and the optimal laser frequency to use.</description></item><item><title>Diagnosis of PV Cell Antireflective Coating Degradation Resulting From Hot-Humid High-Voltage Potential Aging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10966198</link><description>Corrosion of the antireflective coating on a photovoltaic cell (&#8220;${\text{AR}}_{\text{c}}$ corrosion&#8221;) has previously been observed in studies using hot-humid test conditions with external high-voltage (HV) bias. This study primarily focuses on known vulnerable legacy aluminum back surface field cells in mini-modules (MiMos) put through comparative stepped stress tests. Each cell type had MiMos at +1500 V, &#8211;1500 V, or unbiased (&#8220;$V_{\text{oc}}$&#8221;) potential, which were sequentially subjected to test conditions of 60 &#176;C/60% relative humidity (RH) for 96 h, as in International Electrotechnical Commission Technical Specification 62804-1; 70 &#176;C/70% RH for 200 h; and 85 &#176;C/85% RH for 200 h. Characterizations at each step included visual camera and electroluminescence (EL) imaging, colorimetry, and current&#8211;voltage curve tracing. Final characterizations included: Suns&#8211;$V_{\text{oc}}$, spatial mapping of external quantum efficiency, high-resolution photoluminescence, EL, and dark lock-in thermography imaging. Forensics were performed on extracted cores, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning Auger microscopy (SAM). Forensics were also conducted on MiMos from previous studies that underwent stepped HV aging and separate outdoor aged full-sized modules. ${\text{AR}}_{\text{c}}$ corrosion was specifically seen for the glass/encapsulant/cell side of the +1500 V (HV+) stressed MiMos and modules. Appearance, color, and reflectance were the most distinguishing characteristics relative to glass corrosion, gridline corrosion and delamination, and other concurrent degradation modes. SEM/EDS and SAM identified the conversion of silicon nitride to hydrated silica, hydrous silica, or hydrated amorphous silica, which preferentially occurred at the edges and tips of the pyramidal textured cell surface.</description></item><item><title>CsGeI3 Perovskite-Based Solar Cells for Higher Efficiency and Stability: An Experimental Investigation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988679</link><description>Among the recent developments in photovoltaic technologies, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have drawn significant attention, owing to their exceptional power conversion efficiency (PCE), cost-effectiveness, and better optoelectronic characteristics. However, the stability and presence of lead (toxicity) in PSCs remains a major challenge to their commercialization. In this study, we experimentally investigated all-inorganic, lead-free CsGeI3-based PSCs in an n-i-p configuration. The CsGeI3 films were synthesized using a one-step spin-coating technique and their crystallographic characteristics were analyzed. Furthermore, we fabricated and tested different device architectures incorporating CsGeI3 as the absorber layer with various electron transport layers (ETLs), including TiO2, ZnO, and graphene oxide (GO), while employing MoS2 as the hole transport layer. The resulting device structure was Fluorine doped Tin oxide (FTO)/(TiO2/ZnO/GO)/CsGeI3/MoS2/Ni). All fabricated devices demonstrated excellent performance, with the TiO2-based ETL device achieving the highest PCE of 10.79%. In addition, incorporating reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as an interface layer on top of the absorber layer further enhanced photovoltaic performance by approximately 3% across all configurations (achieving outstanding efficiency of 13.57%). The hydrophobic nature and high conductivity of rGO suggest its potential as a promising strategy for improving the stability and efficiency of lead-free PSCs in future applications.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Photovoltaic Module Characterization: Using Image Transformers for Current&#8211;Voltage Curve Prediction From Electroluminescence Images</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002587</link><description>Individual photovoltaic (PV) module health monitoring can be a daunting task for operation and maintenance of solar farms. Modules can be inspected through luminescence, thermal imaging, and current&#8211;voltage (I&#8211;V) curve analyzes for identification of damage and power loss. I&#8211;V curves provide easily interpretable data to determine module health as they directly provide electrical performance metrics. However, in order to obtain these curves, modules must be disconnected from the array and either removed to a solar simulator or characterized in situ with corrections for module temperature, the incident solar spectrum, and intensity. Luminescence or thermal images of a module are relatively easy to acquire in situ. Electroluminescence (EL) images highlight physical defects in the modules but do not provide easily interpretable features to correlate with electrical performance. This work presents a SWin transformer network to predict I&#8211;V curves for PV modules from their corresponding EL images. The predicted I&#8211;V curves allow the accurate prediction of the maximum power point (MPP), short-circuit current $I_{\text {sc}}$, and open-circuit voltage $V_{\text {oc}}$ with a mean error less of than 1%. Comparing single diode model (SDM) parameters extracted from the predicted curves to those extracted from the true curves, the series resistance $R_{\text {s}}$ demonstrates a mean error of 5.19%, and the photocurrent $I$ a mean error of 0.197%. The shunt resistance $R_{\text {sh}}$ and dark current $I_{\text {o}}$ parameters are predicted with larger errors because of their sensitivity to small changes in the I&#8211;V curve.</description></item><item><title>Probability Mass Function of Energy for Light-Collecting Surfaces in Rough Geometries and Its Applications in Urban Energy and Photovoltaics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10971967</link><description>Sunlight throughout urban areas largely impacts local climate [sustainable development goal (SDG) 13], residents&#8217; well-being (SDG 3), and access to clean energy (SDG 7). However, sunlight availability on various urban surfaces is affected by urban geometry. Here, in this work, a probabilistic framework to evaluate the interplay between sunlight and urban geometry is presented, and its immediate applications in urban energy studies are demonstrated. A probability mass function that predicts the energy production of a group of light-collecting surfaces, such as solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, installed in rough geometries, such as urban areas, is derived. Along the way, an expression for the sky view factor (SVF) is formulated within rough geometries as well as a link between the capacity factor of the residential PV fleet and urban geometry. The predictions of the mathematical framework are validated using the digital surface model and collected PV systems data in The Netherlands. This work primarily helps understand the underlying relation between the geometrical parameters of a rough surface and the received sunlight energy on a subset of that surface. Exemplified applications are swift SVF calculations and residential PV fleet yield predictions, which, respectively, support efficient urban energy assessments and privacy-preserving electrical grid management.</description></item><item><title>Deep Learning-Based Health Monitoring for Photovoltaic Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10993290</link><description>The transition to renewable energy sources like photovoltaic (PV) systems is essential for societal progress, counteracting the adverse effects of fossil fuels. However, managing PV systems entails significant challenges and economic implications. PV fault occurrence necessitates swift detection and resolution, exacerbating financial burdens. Effective fault diagnosis relies heavily on data from PV plant monitoring and energy management systems. Historically, PV monitoring relied on manual inspections, but autonomous aerial vehicle (UAV) technology provides a more efficient and comprehensive solution, enhancing safety and offering detailed imagery, scalability, environmental monitoring, and advanced data analytics. This study utilizes deep learning (DL) approaches to monitor the health of the PV, focusing on analyzing UAV-captured scenes. Specifically, this article presents an end-to-end two-stage DL-based health monitoring framework that consists of semantic segmentation model, SegFormer, for isolating solar panels and object detection model, YOLOv8, for identifying anomalies within the PV modules. The proposed framework is validated and compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on a three publicly available UAV-captured datasets.

We find that a global optimization approach to backtracking results in climate-specific annual energy gains of 2.4%&#8211;3.2% relative to a traditional backtracking algorithm baseline. We identify a strong logarithmic correlation between local diffuse fraction and yield improvement, and highlight the effect of seasonal precipitation on performance gains. We also find that a backtracking approach, which approximates the terrain as constant, does not offer significant annual energy gains over the baseline on the synthetic terrain. Our findings suggest that specific yield from backtracking in the USA can be improved by as much as 88 kWh/kW by considering terrain when selecting a backtracking algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Vertical Bifacial Photovoltaic System Model Validation: Study With Field Data, Various Orientations, and Latitudes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10985871</link><description>Accurate modeling of photovoltaic (PV) systems is critical for the design, financial analysis, and monitoring of solar PV plants. For bifacial PV applications, models must additionally offer robust rear-side irradiance algorithms. However, bifacial PV irradiance models have yet to be sufficiently validated for east&#8211;west vertically oriented systems, where direct beam solar irradiation swaps at solar noon. Here, we validate five bifacial irradiance models with field data collected in Golden, CO, USA (40&#176;N) and Fairbanks, AK, USA (65&#176;N) for east&#8211;west vertical, north&#8211;south vertical, and south-tilted arrays. There is no clear best performer among subhourly models; Bifacial_radiance, bifacialVF, the System Advisor Model, and dual-sided energy tracer (DUET) comparably predict seasonal and daily changes in PV production, with root-mean-squared error (RMSE) falling in the range of 11&#8211;28% depending on the location and system orientation. PVSyst (v7.4.8), limited by hourly resolution, demonstrates RMSE in the range of 33&#8211;45%. The primary causes of high RMSE are similar for all models; using an irradiance cutoff of &gt;100 W/m2, using clear-sky filtering, and removing time stamps with snow, lowers model RMSE to 4&#8211;13% for subhourly models and 12&#8211;25% for PVSyst. Regular meteorological station servicing is found to further decrease model RMSE by up to 3% abs. in Alaska. Finally, we model bifacial PV systems in over 250 locations between 15 and 85&#176;N, finding that deviations between model-predicted annual insolation tend to be 2&#8211;3&#215; higher for vertical PV systems than south-facing fixed-tilt systems. We discuss potential methods for improving vertical PV modeling and provide recommendations for high-quality field data collection in northern environments.</description></item><item><title>Sustainability Impact of Different PV Mounting Systems and Pathways for Decarbonizing Emissions of PV Deployment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11007072</link><description>The amount of electricity generated by a solar panel varies according to the installation location and chosen mounting structure.

This article investigates the impact of different photovoltaic (PV) mounting systems on energy yield, material consumption, and carbon emissions, focusing on the key configurations of fixed-tilt (FT), east&#8211;west, and single-axis tracking systems. As global PV capacity rapidly expands, understanding the sustainability of these systems is crucial for decarbonizing the electricity sector. We highlight the impact of different mounting systems on yield at different latitudes and demonstrate that the effective material consumption can vary by over 30% in terms of both g/Wp and g/kWh, along with the impact on carbon emissions in terms of both gCO2-eq/Wp and gCO2-eq/kWh. Pathways to reduce the carbon footprint in gCO2-eq/kWh by up to 60% compared with the FT baseline case are also discussed, including incorporating green steel and decarbonized concrete.</description></item><item><title>RHT_NoC: A Reconfigurable Hybrid Topology Architecture for Chiplet-Based Multicore System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11026095</link><description>Chiplet-based system-on-chip (SoC) architectures, leveraging 2.5-D/3-D integration technologies, provide scalable solutions for a wide range of applications. Achieving high performance and cost-effectiveness in these systems relies heavily on optimizing die-to-die interconnect topologies and designs, which are essential for seamless interchiplet communication. This article introduces a reconfigurable hybrid topology (RHT) architecture designed for chiplet-based multicore systems. RHT achieves high performance and energy efficiency by dynamically reconfiguring the network topology to traffic variations, adaptively selecting transport subnets, and optimizing link bandwidth allocation, thereby minimizing congestion and maximizing packet throughput. Furthermore, RHT leverages global traffic information to dynamically combine Torus loops, maximizing opportunities for rapid packet transmission delivery while guaranteeing minimal hop counts. Moreover, RHT accelerates packet transmission via bufferless combined loops, extending the continuous sleeping periods of routers, improves power gating efficiency, and significantly reduces static power consumption. Simulation results indicate that the Mesh-DyRing achieves over a 40% reduction in network latency and more than a 20% decrease in power consumption overhead compared to the baseline design. When compared to WiNoC, an advanced hybrid wired-wireless topology design, the Mesh-DyRing-PG configuration reduces power consumption by 56.2% while maintaining equivalent average network latency.</description></item><item><title>A Trifilar Transformer-Based Class-F23 VCO With Noise-Circulating Technology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10993331</link><description>This article presents a low-phase noise (PN) trifilar transformer-based Class-F23 voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) with noise-circulating technology.

A large gain and dead-zone free phase detector (PD) is proposed. When the DLL reaches the locked state, the phase error between the two input signals of the PD can be reduced to 0.53 ps (0.095&#176;), which has an 18-time improvement compared to the conventional DLL. Therefore, the SPO of the entire DLL can be effectively reduced to be less than 0.87 ps. Furthermore, the auxiliary circuit, consisting of a large phase difference detector (LPDD) and fast-adjusting branches (FABs), accelerates the DLL&#8217;s locking process to 42 clock cycles and improves the locking speed by 4.1 times.

Backside power delivery network (BSPDN) has been introduced in the industry for 2-nm node with passive wires. In this work, we propose adding active components (power transistors) to the backside of silicon in a back-end-of-line (BEOL)-compatible fabrication process. The goal is to enable 12&#8211;0.7-V voltage downconversion at the backside of silicon (near the point of load, i.e., the frontside logic compute die) to minimize the IR drop and improve overall system-level conversion efficiency. This work leverages a hybrid monolithic 3-D (M3D)dc-dc converter architecture combining switched-capacitor (SC) and synchronous buck converter topologies with BEOL-compatible active and passive devices.

With the experimentally calibrated compact models, the simulated hybrid converter design achieves 12&#8211;0.7-V conversion with a peak efficiency of 95.6% at a power density of 330 mW/mm2, demonstrating the feasibility of M3D SC dc-dc converters for next-generation power management in high-performance edge devices.</description></item><item><title>A Compact High-Speed Capacitive Data Transfer Link With Common Mode Transient Rejection for Isolated Sensor Interfaces</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11021663</link><description>In this article, a compact differential data transfer link architecture for isolated sensor interfaces (SIs) and immune to common mode transients (CMTs) is presented. The proposed architecture shows low latency supporting high-speed transmission with a low bit error rate (BER) in the presence of CMT noise for applications, such as data acquisition, biomedical equipment, and communication networks. In transportation applications, motors and actuators are subjected to harsh environmental conditions, e.g., lightning strikes and abnormal voltage operations. These conditions introduce noise and can cause damage to small electronics due to high-voltage power surges. To ensure human safety and circuitry protection, a data transfer system must be implemented between high-voltage and low-voltage domains.

Nevertheless, due to power sensitivity and speed demands, SC acceleration suffers from limitations in traditional von-Neumann architectures. To overcome this challenge, we propose accelerating SC and convolution using a static random access memory (SRAM)-based in-memory computing (IMC) architecture through an algorithm-architecture co-optimization manner. We develop the first SC algorithm that transforms nonlinear operations into the IMC paradigm, enabling IMC array to handle both SC and artificial intelligence (AI) tasks and making the IMC array a reusable module. Our architecture extends computing functions of macro dedicated to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with less than a 1% area increase. The proposed SC algorithm for FP32 data achieves high accuracy within 1 unit in the least significant place (ulp) error margin compared with C math library. Moreover, we build an intelligent IMC system that supports various CNNs.

While various machine learning (ML) algorithms have been applied to the  $\mu $ -arch DSE problem, the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) remains underexplored. In this article, we propose a novel RL-based approach to address the reduced instruction set computer V (RISC-V) CPU  $\mu $ -arch DSE problem. This approach enables dynamic selection and optimization of  $\mu $ -arch parameters without relying on predefined modification sequences, thus significantly enhancing exploration flexibility. To address the challenges posed by high-dimensional action spaces and sparse rewards, we use a discrete soft actor-critic (SAC) framework with entropy maximization to promote efficient exploration. In addition, we integrate multistep temporal-difference (TD) learning, an experience replay (ER) buffer, and return normalization to improve sample efficiency and learning stability during training. Our method further aligns optimization with user-defined preferences by normalizing PPA metrics relative to baseline designs. Experimental results on the Berkeley out-of-order machine (BOOM) demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its effectiveness and efficiency for  $\mu $ -arch DSE.

However, three critical challenges constrain performance gains: 1) complex fetching logic for nonzero (NZ) data pairs; 2) load imbalance across processing elements (PEs); and 3) PE stalls from write-back contention. This brief proposes an energy-efficient accelerator addressing these inefficiencies through three innovations. First, we propose a Cartesian-product output-row-stationary (CPORS) dataflow that inherently matches NZ data pairs by sequentially fetching compressed data. Second, a multilevel partial sum reduction (MLPR) strategy minimizes write-back traffic and converts random PE stalls into manageable load imbalance. Third, a kernel sorting and load scheduling (KSLS) mechanism resolves PE idle/stall and achieves PE array-level load balancing, attaining 76.6% average PE utilization across all sparsity levels. Implemented in 22-nm CMOS, the accelerator delivers  $1.85\times $  speedup and  $1.4\times $  energy efficiency over baseline and achieves 25.8 TOPS/W peak energy efficiency at 90% sparsity.</description></item><item><title>A High-Density Energy-Efficient CNM Macro Using Hybrid RRAM and SRAM for Memory-Bound Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11038945</link><description>The big data era has facilitated various memory-centric algorithms, such as the Transformer decoder, neural network, stochastic computing (SC), and genetic sequence matching, which impose high demands on memory capacity, bandwidth, and access power consumption.

The proposed nMOS array dynamically detects the PSN and creates a pathway, channeling the PSN forwarded through the digitally controlled resistor (DCR) directly to the ground. To support the proposed power supply noise compensation (PNC) technique in wide-range operation, the output bits from the digital loop filter (DLF) control not only the DCR but also the total transconductance of the nMOS array. The supply-sensing amplifier (SSA) between the supply and the gates of the nMOS array amplifies supply noise to lower the voltage headroom, allowing the DCO to run faster. Fabricated in 40-nm CMOS technology, the prototype DPLL demonstrates an rms jitter of 1.27 ps under 1 MHz, 20-mVPP sinusoidal noise, while the rms jitter without the regulator is measured as 3.26 ps. The total power consumption and area occupation of the DPLL are 13.5 mW and 0.066 mm2, respectively.

PPFDs have high harmonic rejection, but suffer from limited power efficiency and conversion gain, mainly due to second-harmonic feedback. Conventional harmonic reflectors (HRs) minimize this undesired feedback introducing a common-mode second-harmonic resonance, at the price of increased area and reduced bandwidth. In the proposed design, the HR is embedded into a transformer-based input-matching network to decouple the differential-mode inductance from the common-mode inductance. This results in a more compact design, with higher output power and improved power efficiency. A common-gate transistor is stacked with the push-push pair to further boost the output power while reusing the same current. Two PPFDs are cascaded without additional power amplification stages. The quadrupler, implemented in 28-nm CMOS, achieves a peak output power of 0 dBm and peak power efficiency of 5% at 77 GHz and the 3-dB bandwidth is from 70 to 86 GHz.</description></item><item><title>A 94.7-dB Dynamic Range Fully Passive Switched-Capacitor Low-Pass Filter With Enhanced Selectivity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884547</link><description>In this article, a passive gain-boosting technique is employed to improve the bandpass gain, input-referred noise, and area usage of a charge-rotation switched-capacitor (CRSC) filter.

The proposed low-power global clock distribution not only significantly reduces power consumption across multi-lane RXs but is capable of compensating for the frequency offset without any phase interpolators (PIs). To this end, a fractional divider (FDIV) controlled by CDR is placed close to the global phase locked loop. Moreover, in order to address the suboptimal lock point of conventional baud-rate phase detectors, the proposed CDR employs a background eye-climbing algorithm (ECA), which optimizes the sampling phase and maximizes the vertical eye margin (VEM).

The low-noise front end utilizes a capacitor assisting triple-winding transformer (CTTF) to expand bandwidth and suppress noise. An injection-locked oscillator driven by a delay-locked loop is used to generate the quadrature clocks without using the divider and the associated high-frequency clock. The hybrid baseband filter consisting of passive RLC and active-RC biquad simultaneously achieves high linearity and flexible gain/bandwidth adjustments. The analog baseband circuitry employs a feedforward compensated transconductance amplifier that greatly relaxes the power-bandwidth trade-off.

A pulsewidth-modulation (PWM)-based capacitively coupled chopped voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)-based continuous-time  $\mathrm {\Delta \Sigma }$  modulator (CTDSM) for bio-potential monitoring is presented in this article. A PWM-based positive feedback loop is proposed to cancel the coupling and decoupling effect inside the chip, thus boosting the input impedance with simplified calibration digital to analog converter (DAC). A frequency-domain loop stability detection is proposed to continuously monitor the VCO outputs with a fully digital implementation. Therefore, a background auto-calibration scheme is developed to achieve sub-second convergence time. The proposed VCO-based neural front end was fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS process. With a chopping frequency of 640 kHz, the prototype achieves 1.84- $\mu $ Vrms input-referred noise (IRN) from 0.07-Hz to 1-kHz bandwidth. With a linear input range of 150 mVpp, it exhibits an signal to noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) of 72.4 dB and a dynamic range (DR) of 90.2 dB.

However, with the increase of power level, the thermal and size issues become the limiting factors for fast charging, especially for compact devices. This article presents the concept of the voltage-regulating cable (VRC) which integrates the charging IC and all the associated passive components into the universal serial bus (USB) cable connector. By relocating the power converter and its associated heat from the devices to the cable, this design significantly reduces the device size and provides an alternative solution for the overheating issues. The VRC can regulate a bidirectional step-down voltage for two kinds of typical application scenarios: adapter-to-device (A2D) and device-to-device (D2D) scenarios. In addition, a symmetrical VRC structure is also proposed to facilitate a reversible and user-friendly connection. The designed VRC prototype, fabricated in 180-nm high-voltage BCD process, occupies an area of  $4.7\times 2.9$  mm2, including all passive components.

The CIHSUC combines the advantages of both a boost converter and a KY converter by proposing a novel hybrid converter topology that connects the input and output terminals of the converter in series with the coupled-inductor, resulting in a high conversion ratio (CR) and load-independent ultra-low output voltage ripple. By utilizing a coupled inductor instead of two discrete inductors, the CIHSUC further reduces inductor current ripple, output voltage ripple, and system size. Furthermore,  $V^{2}I_{\text {C}}$  adaptive off-time (AOT) control method is proposed to enhance the transient response and loop stability. Fabricated in a  $0.18~\mu $ m BCD process, the converter achieves a peak efficiency of 94.4% at  ${V_{\text {IN}}} =5$  V,  ${V_{\text {O}}} =12$  V and  ${I_{\text {Load}}} =300$  mA. Additionally, the measured output voltage ripple remains below 20 mV within the input range of 2&#8211;5 V and the output range of 5&#8211;15 V, representing up to a  $6.6\times $  reduction compared to the theoretical optimum of a conventional boost converter.</description></item><item><title>A 26-G&#937; Input-Impedance 112-dB Dynamic-Range Two-Step Direct-Conversion Front-End With Improved &#916;-Modulation for Wearable Biopotential Acquisition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10810351</link><description>This article presents a high dynamic range (DR) direct conversion front-end (Direct-FE) IC enabling the wearable acquisition of weak bio-potentials superposed onto large motion artifacts (MAs).

Departing from traditional static architectures, a dynamic light sensing architecture is proposed, which allows for the decoupling of time-of-flight (ToF) resolution from the system power consumption through duty-cycle modulation, thereby enhancing energy efficiency. In addition, to improve the measurement precision of both ToF and intensity loss, an inter-stabilized intensity and phase-to-digital converter (IS-IPDC) is proposed to resolve coupling issues between intensity and phase quantification. The chip is implemented in a standard 180-nm CMOS process. Test results indicate that the light ToF resolution is 2.2 ps within a 10-Hz bandwidth, while consuming only 12.5 mW. Thanks to its high resolution and crosstalk-free characteristics, compared with the high-precision instrument-based reference system, the maximum measurement errors for the absorption coefficient ( $\boldsymbol {\mu _{a}}$ ) and reduced scattering coefficient ( $\boldsymbol {\mu '_{s}}$ ) are 4.2% and 4%, respectively.

The conversion dead time is greatly reduced by reusing the coarse interpolation channel (CIC) during the quantization of Start and Stop signals. A high resolution is achieved by a coarse-fine interpolation with a calibration-free high-linearity time amplifier (TA). A flash sub-TDC using a novel fully symmetric quantization (FSQ) scheme is proposed to implement fine interpolation, which helps improve the linearity.

However, FP-CIM with FP32/FP16/BF16 data format incurs a performance bottleneck due to the large storage requirements and MAC power. The emerging POSIT data format exploits dynamic bit width that adapts to varied data distributions, enabling using a low-bit-width to reach nearly the same accuracy performance as conventional high-bit-width FP (POSIT $8~{\approx }$  FP16/BF16). Therefore, a POSIT-based CIM exhibits inherent advantages over the traditional FP-CIM. Despite the theoretical superiority, the dynamic property of POSIT introduces huge exponent processing overhead, cell underutilization of the CIM array, and redundant logic toggles in mantissa addition for POSIT-base CIM. This article presents a POSIT-based digital CIM (PD-CIM) macro with three features to tackle the above challenges: 1) a bi-directional regime processing unit (BRPU) simplifies the complicated codec logic to reduce the energy overhead in dynamic exponent processing; 2) a critical-bit pre-compute-and-store (CPCS) CIM utilizes the spare CIM cells caused by the dynamic bit-width of mantissa to improve cell utilization of the CIM array; and 3) a cyclically alternating computing-scheduling unit replaces the bit-wise addition of dynamically aligned mantissas with bit-wise OR to save logic toggles power. Fabricated in a 28 nm CMOS technology, PD-CIM occupies an area of 1.41 mm2. It reaches an 83.23 TFLOPS/W peak energy efficiency at POSIT(8,1) for ImageNet classification on the vision transformer base (ViT-B) model. Compared with the state-of-the-art FP-CIM, PD-CIM reduces energy by  $2.36{\times }$  and offers  $3.51{\times }$  speedup.</description></item><item><title>An 8-bit 20.7 TOPS/W Multilevel Cell ReRAM Macro With ADC-Assisted Bit-Serial Processing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10899870</link><description>Analog compute in memory (CIM) with multilevel cell (MLC) resistive random access memory (ReRAM) promises highly dense and efficient compute support for machine learning and scientific computing.

The classification accuracy loss is 1.6% when compared to the quantization-aware trained model. The measured raw and normalized peak efficiencies are 20.7 and 662 TOPS/W, respectively. The compute density is 8.4 TOPS/mm2.</description></item><item><title>A 22-nm Delta-Sigma Computing-In-Memory SRAM Macro With Near-Zero-Mean Outputs and LSB-First ADCs for Edge AI Processing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10892305</link><description>This work proposes a static random access memory (SRAM)-based delta-sigma computing-in-memory ( $\Delta \Sigma $  CIM) processor for edge intelligence applications in 22-nm CMOS technology. This  $\Delta \Sigma $  CIM processor effectively mitigates redundant operations associated with unchanged input features and adaptively adjusts computing-in-memory (CIM) outputs to achieve a near-zero-mean (NZM) distribution, thereby benefiting the energy-intensive analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The proposed  $\Delta \Sigma $  CIM macro involves three main innovations at the architecture and circuit levels: first, it replaces absolute inputs with deltas computed from consecutive input values, resulting in a notable 35.8% reduction in energy consumption for the CIM array; second, the delta matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) implemented by  $\Delta \Sigma $  CIM array can self-adaptively shift the analog CIM outputs to be NZM distributed, facilitating streamlined centralized data processing; and third, the introduction of a least significant bit first (LSB-first) ADC, whose number of conversions adjust dynamically based on instantaneous input values, allows for efficient analog output conversion of highly concentrated NZM analog data without compromising full-scale range or precision.

We propose a memory stationary (MS) dataflow to ingeniously combine the input and output features in a single memory block in a cyclic manner, significantly increasing the OCMU. The MS dataflow also reduces the feature memory access by 78.0%. Furthermore, residual paths in a ResNet model require large feature buffering. We introduce layer-wise clipped-asymmetric residual distillation (LCARD) quantization, removing the residual paths with minimal accuracy degradation.

Although the functions of its processing elements (PEs) and interconnections can be defined by a high-level software program, the circuit parameters are mostly managed by hardware or the compiler, leaving opportunities for in-depth optimization and novel features. Considering that the circuit adjustment is of great value in terms of low power and security, this article presents a novel software-defined accelerator named cross-domain software-defined chip (CDSDC), of which most chip properties including circuit parameters, logic, and pipelines can be programmed synergistically by software at runtime. With this design scheme, CDSDC provides new features including: 1) dynamic pipeline-voltage-frequency scaling (DPVFS), which combines pipeline reconfiguration with voltage-frequency scaling to generate an optimal chip configuration for various applications; 2) intrinsic physical unclonable function (PUF), which leverages the uniform PEs as measured circuit delay elements by adjusting the circuit parameters, extracting the entropy of manufacturing process variation, and taking response bits as a PUF; and 3) device-binding confidential configuration, which uses the intrinsic PUF and ASCON algorithm to encrypt/decrypt configuration. The CDSDC has been implemented in silicon as a 28-nm Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) HPC+ 1P8M 6-mm2 test chip, operating at peak 400 MHz and 0.9 V, achieving a peak energy efficiency of 51 GOPS/W.

While Sturdy MASH (SMASH) reduces the need for precise analog/digital matching in MASH, it reintroduces stability concerns and distortion in integrators due to larger signal swings. This brief presents a modified SMASH design with an efficient architecture that includes one active integrator and three passive ones. Compared to SMASH, the proposed design achieves a flatter signal transfer function (STF) and lower distortion across a wide band. The quantization noise from the first active integrator is filtered by a passive switched-capacitor filter (SCF) before being fed to a second-order passive noise-shaping (NS) quantizer. The structure can be transformed into a cascade of integrators with feedforward (CIFF) delta-sigma modulator (DSM) that traditionally requires a high-gain block. A fourth-order DSM was designed in 65 nm technology for performance validation and comparison, demonstrating an 89.5 dB SNDR and 92.8 dB dynamic range (DR) within a 500 kHz bandwidth using a 25 MHz clock with OSR =25.

We present such an enhancement that is implemented by replacing standard CAN bus transceivers with a new transceiver that permits automatic authentication of CAN frames. The theoretical basis of our approach is based on incorporating a secondary communications channel in a virtual manner that simultaneously transmits an authentication signature with each CAN frame. To implement the authentication mechanism, a new backward-compatible transceiver is described, designed and validated that implements the virtual channel through selectively delaying the rising edges in a Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ) waveform that encodes a CAN frame at the physical layer. Novel aspects of the CAN transceiver include the use of use of authentication signature generators and comparators, rising edge time-based modulator/demodulator circuitry, and phase-preserving rail converters.

When designing compact systems like portable consumer electronics and wireless microsensors, single-inductor topologies are therefore preferred. Specifically, single-inductor multi-input and multi-output (SL-MI/O) power supply designs pose unique challenges that have yet to be fully addressed. This paper aims to provide design guidelines for maximizing efficiency in the design of SL-MI/O systems, especially in the sub-5W domain. To simplify the choice between NFETs and PFETs for the multitude of power switches in SL-MI/Os, which is not straightforward, an intuitive metric called the Favorability Index (F ${}_{\mathrm {NP}}$ ) is proposed. A new, optimal supply voltage theory is also presented, suggesting that the most efficient voltage to supply power switches&#8217; gates is around twice the threshold voltage (v ${}_{\mathrm {T}}$ ). The paper also proposes using dynamic selectors in gate drivers. This allows for blocking cross conduction without increasing vSUP drastically, ensuring efficiency. A two-transistor selector is recommended as a simple implementation, and the tradeoffs are discussed. An example topology is designed using guidelines proposed by the paper to demonstrate the design flow and efficiency improvements.</description></item><item><title>Design of a Contingent Decision Equalizer Using Analog-in-Time Processing for PAMN Wireline Receivers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10880483</link><description>The need to rapidly increase per-lane data rates to meet system bandwidth demands has led to the adoption of digital equalization schemes in wireline transceivers. However, for short reach applications, mixed-mode designs offer better power and area efficiency, especially if their complexity explosion with data rates can be alleviated. This paper presents a new hybrid linear/nonlinear equalizer that unfolds the popular recurrent equalization architecture to remove any fundamental timing constraints in the wireline receiver. The modular multi-stage architecture drastically reduces the receiver complexity and enable real-time architecture tuning to improve energy efficiency. This paves the way for continual data rate enhancement with improved circuit performance. To ensure reliable performance in advanced CMOS processes, time-domain analog signal processing is used. This choice also enables linear energy scaling with data rate and allows proportional power scaling with degree of equalization. A 3-tap realization of the receiver fabricated in 28 nm CMOS process achieved a data rate of 52 Gb/s with an efficiency of 1.0 pJ/b and BER below 1e-4 with moderate ISI where channel loss at Nyquist is less than 12 dB.</description></item><item><title>Optimization of DTC-Based and Harmonic-Mixer-Based Fractional-N PLLs: Comparative Analysis of Jitter and Power Trade-Offs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10918863</link><description>As phase-locked loop (PLL) architectures become increasingly complex, optimizing the jitter and power performance through calculation alone is becoming more challenging for fractional-N PLLs. To find the most suitable PLL architecture that meets the jitter-power requirements of various applications, a simple and widely-applicable method is in demand to find the optimal jitter-power relation of different PLL architectures. In this paper, we propose the use of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) to optimize the jitter and power of PLLs, specifically focusing on two popular fractional-N PLL architectures: digital-to-time converter (DTC)-based and harmonic-mixer (HM)-based PLLs. By applying the MOEA, we can achieve optimal jitter and power relationships for both architectures, and the observed trends in jitter and power are explained and supported with calculations.</description></item><item><title>A 500-kS/s Continuous-Time Linear-Exponential Incremental ADC Achieving 90.1-dB DR and 103.1-dB SFDR</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10849806</link><description>This article presents a continuous-time (CT) linear-exponential incremental ADC (IADC) that achieves 15-bit resolution at 250kHz bandwidth with 40 cycles for one conversion. It is based on an energy-efficient CT linear-exponential IADC, which alleviates the requirements of the power-hungry input buffer and loop filter. The proposed IADC employs a coarse 9-bit first-order IADC followed by a fine 8-bit cyclic ADC. The first-order IADC performs the coarse conversion by linearly accumulating input signals, resulting in a small thermal noise penalty. The residual quantization noise is exponentially reduced by the cyclic ADC, significantly shortening the conversion cycle. The cyclic ADC achieves the required accuracy by reconfiguring the loop filter of the coarse IADC and effectively compensating for the excessive loop delay.

This paper describes radiation-tolerant (RT) ADC design tradeoffs and design strategies. Then, the paper introduces a 13-bit RT pipelined-successive-approximation register (pipelined-SAR) ADC fabricated in 65 nm CMOS technology based on the concluded tradeoffs. To further improve the ADC power efficiency, a semi-time-interleaved (Semi-TI) structure is employed. Besides, the ping-pong auto-zeroing (AZ) scheme is implemented in the residue amplifier (RA) to reduce the TID-induced offset while maintaining low power dissipation. The proposed ADC is designed and hardened against Single Event Effects (SEEs) and Total Ionizing Dose (TID) effects from the structure to layout levels. All sub-blocks were examined, and only the critical blocks were hardened to avoid over-hardening. From the measurement results, the prototype ADC attains an 80 MS/s sampling rate and achieves 70.8-dB SNDR and 80.3-dB SFDR at the Nyquist input frequency. With a total power consumption of 13.8 mW, the prototype ADC establishes a state-of-the-art Walden Figure of Merit of 60.7 fJ/conv step, yielding an efficiency comparable to non-RT ADCs with similar specifications. Irradiation tests validate the consistent performance of the ADC up to a cumulative dose of 500 krad (Si) in X-ray testing, while laser testing indicates a robust SEE threshold and swift post-SEE recovery.</description></item><item><title>A 0.3-mm2 1.3 &#956;W Wireless Monitoring System IC for Hermeticity Testing of Biomedical Implants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10851714</link><description>Advances in bioelectronic medicine have led to a reduction in implant size and notable improvements in energy management and data transmission techniques. Bulky titanium casings traditionally used to shield implant electronics are being gradually replaced by more streamlined materials, primarily composed of polymers and thin film ceramics. This transition offers numerous advantages, including a smaller form factor, enhanced flexibility, and the facilitation of wireless power and data transmission. However, it is essential to acknowledge potential drawbacks of these innovative encapsulation materials, such as the unknown longevity and adhesion issues that may compromise hermeticity. To investigate the hermeticity and long-term performance of conformal encapsulations, we propose a fully encapsulated wireless monitoring system with novel circuitry. The system comprises energy harvesting, humidity assessment, and passive communication. In this paper, we delve into each of these areas, presenting innovative solutions that are later implemented and tested. The final system is realized in an integrated circuit technology of 65 nm, fitting in a compact area of 0.3 mm2 ( $76~\%$  occupied by the integrated receiver coil), while consuming  $1.3~\mu $ W. All the necessary components are fully integrated, allowing for increased miniaturization and lower power consumption.</description></item><item><title>Advancement of High-Impedance Fault Detection in Primary Distribution Systems Using a Sequence Components Energy Detector</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10904854</link><description>A reliable solution for detecting high impedance faults must be provided by the existing primary distribution system.

The focus of this design is on area- and power efficiency, as well as multi-purpose usage for various catheters. It contains 32 individual analog front-ends and 12 bit SAR ADCs operating at 40MS/s to enable off-chip digital beamforming. The analog front-end is programmable in power, bandwidth, gain and can be partially bypassed. The front-end bypass and slew-rate can be dynamically adjusted to save power during a receive period. On-chip supply regulation is included, which can be duty-cycled between receive periods to power down the system and save power. This leads to a power supply consumption between 4.5 and 14.1mW when always on, or between 0.37 and 1.15mW when duty-cycling at an 8% ratio. When operating at maximum power, an SFDR of 57.5dB and SNR of 56.1dB are achieved.The ADC performance can optionally be improved by clocking the array in 4 separate clock phases, resulting in lower peak currents, less power supply disturbance and an overall linearity improvement of 6dB. The 32 channel array occupies 1mm2 including decoupling capacitance, combining low area and low power operation.</description></item><item><title>Design, Implementation, and Analysis of an Integrated Switched Capacitor Analog Neuron for Edge Computing AI Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10918870</link><description>Parallel computing is the key to accelerate artificial neural networks, both in digital and analog implementations.

In recent works, DCIM macro based on approximate computing mitigates the adder tree overheads, however, it faces a trade-off between power and neural network (NN) accuracy. The trade-off becomes more complicated in array-level CIM architecture since output channels of NN model have different sensitivities to approximation errors. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous approximate DCIM-based accelerator design framework that achieves a good energy-accuracy trade-off for a specific NN model. The framework includes three key features: 1) Evolutionary algorithm-based search finds cost-efficient approximation points by pruning the design space. 2) Genetic algorithm-based channel-wise mapping creates heterogeneous approximation methods that effectively reduce DCIM energy consumption while maintaining high accuracy. 3) A hardware generation strategy decides the number of DCIM macros and their sizes, resulting in an energy-efficient DCIM-based accelerator tailored for the given NN model. Experimental results show that employing the proposed heterogeneous channel-wise mapping significantly enhances the energy efficiency compared to a homogeneous mapping. Moreover, the proposed framework can produce heterogeneous DCIM-based accelerators that consume less energy than state-of-the-art approximate DCIM approaches.</description></item><item><title>State-of-the-Art ASCON ASIC Achieving 4.3 Gbps@0.8V and 3.5Tb/J@0.6V Outperforming AES by 25 Times</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854668</link><description>NIST selected ASCON as the standard Lightweight Cryptography (LWC) algorithm in 2023. ASCON&#8217;s implementations promise bringing lightweight Authenticated Encryption (AEAD) to resource-constrained devices surpassing Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) implementations. In this work, a standard compliant ASCON Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) hardware (HW) is designed and fabricated using CMOS GF22FDx technology. This study provides a quantitative assessment of the HW with two other standard compliant implementations of ASCON. One is software implementation (SW), and the other is a hardware accelerated (HW/SW co-design) implementation. The assessment shows that HW outperforms the SW implementation by up to three orders of magnitude in energy efficiency and throughput, whereas HW/SW co-design throughput and energy efficiency falls in the middle between HW and software. ASCON ASIC HW is also compared with a standard HW implementation of the AES fabricated over the same chip. ASCON uses only 39% of AES&#8217;s area and boosts energy efficiency by up to 25 times. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first work providing a silicon-based analysis for ASCON ASIC implementation reaching a throughput of 4.3 Gbps @ 0.8V and 2 Gbps @ 0.6V, and energy efficiency of 1.9 Tb/J @ 0.8V and 3.5 Tb/J @ 0.6V in  $2505~\mu $  m2 on GF22FDx at 620MHz @ 0.8V.

The conventional von Neumann architecture, in which large quantities of data are transmitted between processing units and memory units, creates a bottleneck in AI applications. In-memory computing (IMC) offers an efficient solution to this problem by enabling computations within memory units, thus reducing the need for data transmission. This paper proposes a multilogic sense amplifier (MSA) with a dynamic reference voltage (DRV) generation circuit (hereafter denoted as MSA-DRV) to enhance the performance and reduce the power consumption of static random-access memory (SRAM)-based IMC. The proposed MSA-DRV performs six logic operations, namely the AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR, and XNOR operations, within an SRAM array by using a novel DRV circuit. The DRV circuit enables the voltage threshold to be adaptively changed according to the requirements of different operations. Experimental results indicated that the proposed MSA-DRV had lower computational latency (on average 29.9% lower) and power consumption (on average 30.6% lower) than did a conventional sense amplifier design and reconfigurable assist sense amplifier. Thus, the proposed design can overcome the von Neumann bottleneck to facilitate high-speed, energy-efficient data processing, which is crucial for AI-based and other data-intensive applications.</description></item><item><title>OFQ-LLM: Outlier-Flexing Quantization for Efficient Low-Bit Large Language Model Acceleration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10924797</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, becoming essential to modern intelligent computing. Their large memory footprint and high computational cost hinder efficient deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is a promising technique to alleviate this issue and accelerate LLM inference. However, the presence of outliers impedes the advancement of LLM quantization to lower bit levels. In this paper, we introduce OFQ-LLM, an algorithm-hardware co-design solution that adopts outlier-flexing quantization to efficiently accelerate LLM at low-bit levels. The key insight of OFQ-LLM is that normal data can be efficiently quantized in a slightly reduced data encoding space, while the rest encoding space can be used for flexible outlier values. During quantization, we use rescale-based clipping (RBC) to optimize accuracy for normal data and group outlier clustering (GOC) to flexibly represent outlier values. At the hardware level, we introduce a memory-aligned outlier-flexing encoding scheme to encode activations and weights in LLMs at a low bit level. The outlier-normal mixed hardware architecture is devised to leverage the encoding scheme and accelerate LLMs with high speed and high energy efficiency. Our experiments show that OFQ-LLM achieves better accuracy compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) low-bit LLM PTQ works. OFQ-LLM-based accelerator surpasses the SOTA outlier-aware accelerators by up to  $2.69\times $  core energy efficiency, up to  $3.83\times $  speed up and  $2.44\times $  energy reduction in LLM prefilling phase, and up to  $2.01\times $  speed up and  $2.88\times $  energy reduction in LLM decoding phase, with superior accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Memristor-Emulator-Based Crossbar Array for Object Detection and Recognition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948485</link><description>Object detection and recognition are crucial for autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and human-computer interaction. We present a new fully complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuit-based system for object detection and recognition using a Spiking Neural Network (SNN). Our holistic CMOS circuit integrates neuromorphic elements, including a leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model, spike time-dependent plasticity (STDP) memristor synapse, and basic analog and digital building blocks. The learning mechanism is manifested by a completely different approach based on an array of XOR gates to recognize six different objects with  $256 \times 6$  size crossbar arrays.

We also show the accuracy of our design for the digit recognition task using a confusion matrix plot, and the accuracy turns out to be 82.5 %. Our pioneering approach using a CMOS memristor-emulator STDP crosspoint array-based architecture achieves minimal energy consumption per neuron block, which amounts to  $\approx ~2.59$  pJ per neuron block and an overall energy budget of 663.66 pJ for the entire system considering the object recognition task.</description></item><item><title>Knowledge Distillation and Contrastive Learning for Detecting Visible-Infrared Transmission Lines Using Separated Stagger Registration Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10820014</link><description>Multimodal transmission-line detection (TLD) and other vision-related tasks in smart grids have garnered increasing attention due to advances in deep-learning technologies and escalating need for reliable power supplies. However, current TLD methodologies encounter several limitations. First, complex weather conditions often introduce substantial background noise, resulting in inaccurate object detection. Second, high parameter counts of extant models impede their deployment in real-world applications. Third, insufficient data samples results in overfitting and instability. To address these challenges, we proposed a separated stagger registration network (SSRNet-S $^{\ast } $ ), augmented with knowledge distillation (KD) and contrastive learning, specifically designed for RGB-T TLD. This method integrates a separated stagger registration mechanism into the fusion module to investigate relationships between cross-modal features. This approach enhances feature representation and effectively reduces background noise. Additionally, we devised a joint training framework incorporating KD and contrastive learning and proposed a hierarchical distillation strategy to compress the model while mitigating the impact of limited data samples. Complementary features were captured at various stages of SSRNet-S $^{\ast }$  by employing three levels of distillation. Extensive experiments on a TLD dataset demonstrated that both SSRNet-T and SSRNet-S $^{\ast }$  (with KD) outperform state-of-the-art methods. When using P2T-Large and P2T-Tiny as backbone networks in SSRNet-T and SSRNet-S $^{\ast }$ , respectively, the number of parameters decreased from 68.37M to 15.06M, and the computational floating-point operations decreased from 26.99G to 3.01G.

The applications running on these devices rely on frequent communication with central database servers, which are vulnerable to impersonation attacks by adversarial clones. We propose NoCiPUF, a novel NoC-based intrinsic Physically-Unclonable-Function (PUF) framework for MPSoCs authentication. We re-use the circuit switched nature of NoC with path-pairs as challenges to obtain secret responses, collectively called challenge-response-pairs (CRPs). Due to the random nature of manufacturing variations, equal hop paths exhibit unequal delays. We leverage the delay differences of flits traversing in equal-hop paths to generate unique responses. NoCiPUF is fully-synthesizable and readily scalable as it requires changes only at the behavioral level. To counter Machine-Learning (ML)-based modeling attacks on PUFs, we provide a comprehensive technique and reduce the prediction accuracy to ~52%. NoCiPUF framework incurs low area (0.76%) and power (1.14%) overheads and has no impact on NoC performance in normal mode due to independent authentication mode. Obtained responses have near-ideal PUF metrics and are verified against the NIST randomness test suite. This scheme offers high number of CRPs in larger NoC networks (&gt;0.74 million CRPs in  $5 \times 5$  mesh), proving its scalability.</description></item><item><title>Hardware Implementation of Projection-Aggregation Decoders for Reed-Muller Codes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10778655</link><description>This paper presents the hardware architecture and implementation of two variants of projection-aggregation-based decoding of Reed-Muller (RM) codes, namely unique projection aggregation (UPA) and collapsed projection aggregation (CPA).

The existing quaternion least mean square (QLMS) and quaternion maximum correntropy criterion (QMCC) algorithms are based on stochastic gradient descent and gradient ascent methods, respectively. Due to their reliance on instantaneous gradient approximations, these approaches exhibit slower convergence characteristics. To circumvent this limitation, quaternion recursive least square (QRLS) algorithm is proposed in the literature, which exhibits fast convergence and achieves lower MSE. However, the QRLS algorithm is based on minimum MSE (MMSE) criterion which optimizes error-energy, and is thus not a sufficient statistic for impulsive noise. In this paper, we propose novel non-MMSE criterion based recursive algorithms, namely quaternion recursive maximum correntropy criterion (QRMCC) and quaternion recursive maximum Versoria criterion (QRMVC). The proposed QRMCC and QRMVC algorithms exhibit robustness against impulsive/non-Gaussian distortions due to the inclusion of higher order error statistics. Simulations are presented for quaternion-valued channel estimation, which indicate that the proposed QRMCC and QRMVC algorithms deliver improved convergence compared to existing approaches. Lastly, the convergence of the proposed algorithms is analyzed with performance-validation using relevant computer simulations.</description></item><item><title>UniDec: A Unified Factor-Graph-Based Decoder Fully Compatible With 5G NR LDPC/Polar Codes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11039498</link><description>In comparison to 4G, 5G wireless needs to support a broader range of applications. Therefore, both low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and polar codes have been standardized by 5G new radio (NR) to fulfill the requirements of data channel and control channel, respectively. Usually, LDPC/polar decodings are implemented by separate hardware, leading to low area efficiency. Though decoders which can handle both codes have been proposed, how to compromise between throughput and efficiency has always been a persistent dilemma due to the absence of a unified and smooth integration methodology. To this end, by fully utilizing the common parts of graph-theoretic algorithms for both codes, this paper presents a unified decoder (UniDec) which is fully compatible with 5G NR LDPC/polar codes. This UniDec enables three key approaches: 1) unified processing nodes for both codes, 2) configurable permutation networks with multi-parallelism, and 3) flexible scheduling for 5G NR parameter configuration, guaranteeing both high data throughput and area efficiency. Implemented in 40nm CMOS, the UniDec attains a maximum of  $33.64\times $  throughput and  $5.98\times $  area efficiency compared to its multi-mode counterparts. Even compared with the state-of-the-art (SOA) dedicated ones, the UniDec still maintains a competitive edge in terms of throughput, energy, and area efficiency. It is noted that this methodology can be generalized to other factor-graph based signal processing algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Flexible Quadrature Spatial Modulation: Transmission, Detection, and Implementation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856548</link><description>In the conventional spatial modulation schemes, such as spatial modulation (SM) and quadrature SM (QSM), the number of the transmit antennas must be an integer power of 2, which limits the spectral efficiency and raises the hardware cost. To overcome the antenna limitation, a new modulation method, namely flexible QSM (FQSM), is proposed in this paper. Computer simulation results show that in contrast to the existing SM-like schemes, the proposed FQSM can provide better bit error rate (BER) performance under the same bit per channel use (bpcu). To further make the implementation of the FQSM systems feasible, a low-complexity symbol detection algorithm with matrix merging, group-based Givens rotation, candidate searching, symbol estimation, and likelihood estimation (LE) is introduced. Furthermore, the corresponding very-large-scale integration (VLSI) architecture is also proposed. Finally, the results of simulation and computational complexity reveal that the proposed symbol detection algorithm can offer the near-optimal BER performance with lower computational complexity, compared to other related detection methods. The results of the VLSI architecture implemented under the TSMC 90-nm CMOS technology at an operating frequency of 625 MHz show that the proposed hardware requires 554.37 KGEs and performs a 1562.5 Mbps detection throughput.</description></item><item><title>A Soft-Switching Boost-Type Resonant Forward Converter With Load-Adaptive Efficiency Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829499</link><description>This paper presents a fully soft-switching resonant forward converter, whose primary side adopts an active-clamp structure to achieve adjustable on-time of the main switch, and the secondary side adopts a boost switch to achieve boost-type voltage gain regulation and high efficiency. Based on proper resonant parameter design, the voltage across the resonant capacitor, as well as the drain-source voltage of the secondary boost switch, can decrease to zero each cycle, allowing zero voltage switching for the boost switch. Therefore, the penalty associated with the widened gain range is alleviated. To further improve efficiency, two optimization schemes are proposed to reduce the conduction loss of the boost switch and the core loss of the forward transformer. The experimental comparison with a conventional structure effectively validates that the proposed converter can achieve better efficiency performance, reduced noise, and lower cost while accommodating a wide input voltage range.</description></item><item><title>A Reconfigurable Wireless Power Receiver With Shared-Inductor Buck-Boost Converter for NFC-Powered Battery-Less Electronic Shelf Label</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10849767</link><description>This paper proposes a reconfigurable wireless power receiver for NFC-powered battery-less electronic shelf label (ESL).

Recent research indicates that minimizing ripple in inductor current is feasible by maintaining a fixed interleaving angle of  $\frac {100}{N}$  % between the SMs during equal duty ratio operating conditions. This study explores the application of these converters in photovoltaic (PV) systems incorporating individual maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control. In this context, individual MPPT control imposes varied duty ratio conditions on the SMs, arising from differences in the sources of each SM, especially in instances of partial shading condition (PSC). This variability can potentially influence the current ripple within the system. This article conducts a thorough theoretical analysis to derive the optimal interleaving angle criteria for minimizing current ripple under conditions of unequal duty ratios. Additionally, a control strategy is proposed to integrate angle optimization with MPPT control based on the derived conditions. Further, it is observed that operating the converter at this optimal angle leads to a significant reduction in ripple current, by a factor of at least  $\frac {1}{N}$ . The MATLAB/PLECS simulations and experimental results verify considerable improvements in ripple reduction compared to the conventional interleaving angle method, both during steady-state and PSC.</description></item><item><title>Enabling Long Chain Lengths and High-Throughput for Time-Domain Neuromorphic Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10912655</link><description>This brief investigates the limitations on throughput and delay chain length in time-domain neuromorphic computing and proposes solutions to overcome these challenges.

A reconfigurable pre-filter-amplifier (RPFA) structure is proposed to pre-process the output current of the harmonic generator. By switching between two modes, the RPFA effectively filters out the undesired harmonics and amplifies the desired 4th harmonic. Therefore, both the harmonic rejection and locking range of the ILFQ are improved. In addition, a load tank based on a three-coil coupled transformer and an impedance-boosting transformer is designed to further extend the locking range, increase the output power, and reduce the DC power consumption. The measured results show that the proposed ILFQ achieves a 31.9% locking range (28.4 GHz to 39.2 GHz). Across the whole locking range, the measured 1st/2nd/3rd harmonic rejection ratio (HRR) is better than 42.4/37.4/15 dBc, respectively. Within the range of 28.4 to 36.2 GHz, &gt;29 dBc 1st/2nd/3rd HRR is achieved. The measured maximum DC power consumption is 13.3 mW.</description></item><item><title>SPECTRUM1k &#8211; 75 &#956;m Pixels Pitch IC With In-Pixel Histogramming for X-Ray Color Imaging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11046196</link><description>A new single photon-counting IC prototype called SPECTRUM1k with pixel matrix  $40\times 24$  and pixel pitch  $75~\mu $ m is developed by the Microelectronics Group of the AGH University of Krakow as a solution for X-ray color imaging. The chip, produced in CMOS 40nm technology, is made up of 960 individually configured pixels, each composed of an amplifier, an analog-to-digital converter, and  $64\times 12$ -bit memory cells that allow one to perform in-pixel energy histogramming. Thanks to the proposed architecture working with the 200 MHz chip clock and 1 Gcps/mm2 multi energy photon intensities up-to about 23 ms exposition time is feasible ( $365~\mu $ s exposition time whenever monoenergetic photons are used only). In-pixel offsets ( ${=} 3.5$ %) and gain ( ${=} 5.8$ %) spread, the amplifier performance (Equivalent Noise Charge  ${=} 95$  e-RMS) and the ADC resolution (Effective Number of Bits  ${=} 5.4$  b) allow to convert the incoming photons&#8217; energy with FWHM  ${=} 3.7$  ke @134.2 keV upon  $81~\mu $ W or  $48~\mu $ W per pixel power consumption.

A customized convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to extract the information of the linear and the third-order nonlinear gain errors of RA with dither injection. Compared to traditional correlation-based calibration algorithms, the proposed method can significantly improve convergence speed and robustness against dither capacitor mismatch. Compared with previous neural network-based calibration techniques which are commonly used for foreground calibration, the proposed method can operate in background to follow error variations without any risk of signal fidelity problems. Off-chip validation with a silicon-proven 14-bit 1.3 GS/s pipelined ADC shows that, after calibration, the SNDR and SFDR are improved from 46.6 dB and 55.2 dB to 63.1 dB and 80.4 dB, respectively. Moreover, the proposed method takes only 75K samples to reach convergence, whereas traditional algorithms require several to hundreds of millions of samples to achieve convergence ( $10{^{{2}}} \sim 10{^{{4}}}$  times faster). The implementation result shows that the power consumption of the proposed calibrator is 34.8 mW at 1.3 GHz clock frequency.</description></item><item><title>Calibration-Free Edge-Computing IMC Macro With Direct Current-to-Digital Conversion</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045166</link><description>In-memory computing (IMC) has emerged as a promising solution to the &#8220;memory wall&#8221; problem of traditional Von Neumann architectures by integrating computation directly within the memory.

However, as the bit width of the operands increases, the area and latency of stochastic circuits also need to increase exponentially to meet the precision requirements, resulting in a decrease in performance. This brief introduces a low-cost and high-speed parallel approximate stochastic computing multiplier (PASCM), which takes binary streams as both inputs and outputs. The PASCM is suitable for multiplication operations with multi-bit width. In order to further enhance the accuracy of the PASCM, an error compensation mechanism has been proposed. To verify the performance of PASCM, validation was conducted on FPGA. The experimental results indicate that the proposed design exhibits significant area and latency advantages among existing multipliers. Take 8-bit as an example, the PASCM shows a 48.33%, 18.61%, 45.74%, and 57.95% reduction in Look-Up Table (LUT), latency, power delay product (PDP), and area delay product (ADP), respectively, compared to the 8-bit precise binary multiplier implemented using an IP core. To further validate the design, the PASCM was constructed into Multiply-Accumulate units (MAC) and applied to several image processing algorithms on FPGA. The proposed multiplier showed excellent results in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and mean structural similarity index (MSSIM), with some algorithms achieving complete consistency with binary computation results, and the hardware performance also surpasses the most advanced designs.</description></item><item><title>UniPRE: An SNN-ANN Accelerator With Unified Max-Pooling Prediction and Redundancy Elimination</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11048618</link><description>The integration of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for specific tasks has attracted considerable interest due to their potential for high energy efficiency and accuracy.

The proposed method employs NMOS switches as the resistive component (RRES), which are controlled by a rectangular signal from a CMOS inverter. This configuration adaptively enables (disables) the NMOS switches during reverse (forward) conduction phases, and self-adaptively provides gate-biasing, resulting in conserved forward charge with mitigated reverse charge. As a result, the output power is enhanced with higher charge accumulation at the output terminal.

However, the compute and memory requirements introduced by transformer models make them challenging to adopt for edge applications. Furthermore, fine-tuning pretrained transformers (e.g., foundation models) is a common task to enhance the model&#8217;s predictive performance on specific tasks/applications. Existing transformer accelerators are oblivious to complexities introduced by fine-tuning. In this article, we propose the design of a three-dimensional (3D) heterogeneous architecture referred to as Atleus that incorporates heterogeneous computing resources specifically optimized to accelerate transformer models for the dual purposes of fine-tuning and inference.

To improve the resource utilization and handle the mixing workloads in the real-world, multiple tasks sharing the whole CGRA has became an important technical trend, and the varying resource requirements throughout their life cycles also makes run-time dynamic resource allocation (DRA) necessary for higher-multitask throughput. As the key stage of DRA, dynamic mapping (DM) is responsible for mapping kernels within each task to the dynamically allocated CGRA resources. However, existing DM methods have difficulty to balance the mapping time and the mapping quality, resulting in a significant gap between the actual and the optimal task throughput. To address the challenge, we propose DynMap, a heuristic dynamic mapper for CGRA multitask DRA. With the support of specialized scheduling and routing schemes, DynMap heuristically references the placement tendency in the static mapping result to dramatically save the mapping time, while maintaining the high-mapping quality by minimizing the possibility of resource conflicts. Experimental evaluation demonstrates DynMap not only achieves the average 1.17 ms mapping time and average 98.33% of the optimal mapping quality on different CGRA architectures, but also reaches average 98.85% of the optimal task throughput expected by different CGRA multitask DRA scenarios, reducing the gap between actual and optimal task throughput average  $31.75\times $  smaller than that of the current methods.</description></item><item><title>MACS: A Multidomain Collaborative Adaptive Clock Scheme for Large-Scale Reconfigurable Dataflow Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10851296</link><description>To guarantee reliability and correctness, VLSI circuits are designed with conservative margins to maintain timing and power integrity against process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations across diverse workloads. However, worst-case PVT and workload conditions rarely occur in practice, resulting in significant timing slack and hence performance and energy loss, especially in reconfigurable dataflow accelerator RDA due to their large-scale and configurable features. Previous studies have attempted to exploit workload or PVT slack, yet achieving limited benefits for reconfigurable dataflow accelerator (RDAs) with large-scale processing element PE arrays. The key issues come from restricted scaling ranges for the clock, insufficient representations for the workload, and unbalanced workloads within processing elementss (PEs). To address these challenges, this article proposes the first multidomain collaborative adaptive clock scheme (MACS) to efficiently exploit both the workload and PVT timing slack for large-scale reconfigurable dataflow acceleratorss (RDAs). MACS partitions the RDA into several clock domains and allows constrained clock domain crossing, which enhances the hardware efficiency with minimal overhead and supports timing validation using conventional static timing analysis (STA) tools. In each domain, an operand-aware workload detection unit is developed, using both static configurations and dynamic operands to assess workload. The detected workload, combined with the monitored PVT conditions, determines the subsequent clock period. Additionally, to enable the exploration of timing slack over a broader range, the period range of the adaptive clock is extended. Experimental results show that MACS achieves a performance improvement of 76.3% or an energy saving of 36.6% with a hardware cost of 3.5%.</description></item><item><title>Re-CATA: Real-Time and Flexible Accelerator Design Framework for On-Device Codec Avatars</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10876391</link><description>Real-time Codec Avatars, which employ deep generative models for 3-D reconstruction of human features, are crucial for immersive telepresence in augmented reality and virtual reality (AR/VR) environments. However, deploying these avatars in real-time on AR/VR headsets is challenging due to the inability of existing devices to achieve satisfying performance within stringent hardware resource constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce Re-CATA, an innovative full-stack and flexible Codec Avatar accelerator design framework. Re-CATA is designed to deliver real-time throughput (greater than 120 FPS) for the complete Codec Avatar processing pipeline within an edge-level power budget of 5 W under FPGA prototyping. Our approach begins by abstracting the operation mapping and scheduling challenges inherent in Codec Avatars, which require both centralized and distributed processing to handle dynamically changing workloads. We propose a novel hardware resource and workload partitioning scheme optimized for these fluctuating demands. To complement this, we introduce an agile runtime scheduling system for efficient workload reallocation among computing units as needed, recognizing the limitations of static partitioning in rapidly evolving workload scenarios. Furthermore, our micro-architecture design incorporates unified computing modules and efficient hardware peripherals, enabling seamless workload balancing across the Codec Avatar processing pipeline. We evaluate the Re-CATA accelerators via on-board FPGA prototyping, comparing them to various baselines, including commercial AR/VR system-on-chips and academic accelerators. This evaluation demonstrates a maximum speedup of up to  $5.95\times $  under similar settings.</description></item><item><title>Reducing Transistor Count in CMOS Logic Design Through Clustering and Library-Independent Multiple-Output Logic Synthesis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10870256</link><description>We propose a novel transistor-level synthesis method to minimize the number of transistors needed to implement a digital circuit. In contrast with traditional standard cell design methods or transistor-level synthesis methods based on single-input &#8220;complex&#8221; gates or &#8220;super&#8221; gates, our method considers multioutput clusters as the basic resynthesis unit.

To achieve this objective effectively, we present an automatic tool that leverages a reference initial circuit design to generate a diverse set of schematic and layout options for logic-equivalent circuit variants and various transistor threshold voltage (Vth) modifications, while ensuring compliance with design rules. Subsequently, leveraging the range of circuit options generated, Bayesian optimization is employed not only to identify optimal circuit parameters but also to select the most appropriate circuit topology and individual transistor  $V_{th}$  to attain the desired design objectives. TSMC 28 nm process simulation results demonstrate the proposed methodology reducing power by 26.28%&#8211;46.44%,  $T_{\mathrm { access}}$  by 25.60%&#8211;42.29%, and leakage current by 22.73%&#8211;50.11% compared to the compiler-generated design, with a runtime of 10&#8211;40 h.</description></item><item><title>LayoutCopilot: An LLM-Powered Multiagent Collaborative Framework for Interactive Analog Layout Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10841395</link><description>Analog layout design heavily involves interactive processes between humans and design tools. electronic design automation (EDA) tools for this task are usually designed to use scripting commands or visualized buttons for manipulation, especially for interactive automation functionalities, which have a steep learning curve and cumbersome user experience, making a notable barrier to designers&#8217; adoption. Aiming to address such a usability issue, this article introduces LayoutCopilot, a pioneering multiagent collaborative framework powered by large language models (LLMs) for interactive analog layout design. LayoutCopilot simplifies human-tool interaction by converting natural language instructions into executable script commands, and it interprets high-level design intents into actionable suggestions, significantly streamlining the design process. Experimental results demonstrate the flexibility, efficiency, and accessibility of LayoutCopilot in handling real-world analog designs.</description></item><item><title>SPIRAL+: Efficient Signal&#8211;Power Integrity Co-Analysis for Interchiplet Links Validation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10849658</link><description>Chiplet technology has recently emerged as a promising solution to improving chip performance through the modularization of complex designs and communication facilitated by high-speed interchiplet serial links. However, the increasing on-package routing density and data rates of these links introduce complex signal and power integrity challenges, surpassing those encountered in traditional large monolithic chips. Addressing these complexities with efficient analysis and design tools is crucial for maintaining design robustness. In this article, we propose SPIRAL+: signal-power integrity co-analysis framework for high-speed interchiplet serial links validation. The framework employs machine learning (ML) to construct transmitter models and utilizes an impulse response extraction method for modeling the channel and receiver. It then performs signal-power integrity co-analysis through a novel double-edge response-based method, leveraging the developed equivalent models. Additionally, an efficient ML model is crafted to accurately predict eye diagram metrics. The analysis provides valuable insights for design optimization. Experimental results show that SPIRAL+ achieves eye diagrams with a mean relative error of 0.07%&#8211;7.47%, while realizing a speedup of  $31\times $ &#8211; $326\times $  over traditional commercial tools.</description></item><item><title>SANA-FE: Simulating Advanced Neuromorphic Architectures for Fast Exploration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10869378</link><description>Neuromorphic computing is concerned with designing computer architectures inspired by the brain, with recent work focusing on platforms to efficiently execute large spiking neural networks (SNNs). Future designs are expected to improve their capabilities and performance by incorporating novel features, such as emerging neuromorphic devices and analog computation. There is, however, a lack of high-level performance estimation tools to evaluate the impact of such features at the architectural level, to evaluate architectural tradeoffs, and to aid with co-design and design-space exploration. Existing neuromorphic simulators either do not consider hardware performance, only model abstract SNN dynamics or are targeted to a single specific architecture. In this work, we propose SANA-FE, a novel simulator that can rapidly and accurately estimate performance and energy efficiency of different SNN-based designs. Our simulator uses a general and configurable architecture description format that can specify a wide range of neuromorphic designs. Using such an architecture description, SANA-FE simulates system activity when executing a given spiking application at an abstract time-step granularity, and it uses activity counts and per-activity performance metrics to estimate energy and latency for each time-step. We further show a calibration methodology and apply it to model performance of Intel&#8217;s Loihi platform. Results demonstrate that our simulator can predict Loihi&#8217;s energy and latency for three real-world applications, within 12% and 25%, respectively. We further model IBM&#8217;s TrueNorth architecture, simulating a random network over  $20\times $  faster than existing discrete-event-based TrueNorth simulators. Finally, we demonstrate SANA-FE&#8217;s design-space exploration capabilities by optimizing a Loihi baseline architecture for two application, reducing run-time by 21% while increasing dynamic energy usage by only 2%.</description></item><item><title>HISIM: Analytical Performance Modeling and Design Space Exploration of 2.5D/3D Integration for AI Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10844846</link><description>Monolithic designs face significant fabrication cost and data movement challenges, especially when executing complex and diverse AI models. Advanced 2.5D/3D packaging promises high bandwidth and connection density to overcome these challenges, yet it also introduces new electro-thermal constraints. This article develops a suite of analytical performance models to enable efficient benchmarking of a 2.5D/3D heterogeneous system for energy-efficient AI computing. These models encompass various performance metrics related to computing units, network-on-chip (NoC), and network-on-package (NoP). The results are summarized into a new tool, HISIM, which is  $10^{4} \times $ &#8211; $10^{6} \times $  faster than state-of-the-art AI benchmark tools. Furthermore, HISIM integrates rapid thermal simulation for the 2.5D/3D system, helping shed light on both the potential and limitations of 2.5D/3D heterogeneous integration (HI) on representative AI algorithms.

The suggested approach iteratively and incrementally optimizes the placement of macros in order to enhance IC layout routability and timing performance. To achieve this,  $\textsf {IncreMacro}$  utilizes several methods, including kd-tree-based macro diagnosis, gradient-based macro shifting, constraint-graph-based LP for macro legalization, and diffusion-based cell migration. By employing these techniques iteratively,  $\textsf {IncreMacro}$  meets two critical solution requirements of macro placement: 1) pushing macros toward the chip boundary and 2) preserving the original macro relative positional relationship. The proposed approach has been incorporated into  $\textsf {AutoDMP}$  and  $\textsf {DREAMPlace}~4.0$ , and is evaluated on seven RISC-V benchmark circuits and four TILOS macro placement circuit designs at the 7-nm technology node. Experimental results show that, compared with the macro placement solution provided by  $\textsf {AutoDMP}~(\textsf {DREAMPlace}~4.0$ ), our approach reduces routed wirelength by 15.1% (14.9%), improves the routed worst negative slack (WNS) and total negative slack (TNS) by 99.9 (82.6%) and 99.9% (81.3%), and reduces the total power consumption by 4.4% (4.3%). Meanwhile, compared with  $\textsf {IncreMacro}$  [1], our approach augmented with the cell migration algorithm improves the routed WNS and TNS by 24.7% and 23.1%, and remains the average routed wirelength and total power consumption almost unchanged.</description></item></channel></rss>
