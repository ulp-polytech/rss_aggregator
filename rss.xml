This article suggests a new spatial magnetic field configuration for transmitting coils in wireless power transfer systems to tackle these problems. The construction features a square base with a rhombus embedded inside it, along with four rectangular sides that are coiled in a noncrossing manner. This configuration ensures a consistent distribution of magnetic field in three dimensions. In order to guarantee that many UAVs are charged simultaneously without interfering with one another, the LCC-S topology is used to accomplish the characteristic of constant current at the main side and constant voltage at the output side. During UAV hovering, output dc&#8211;dc is combined with charge management to achieve hovering power supply and constant current charging with minimum size. The experimental results show that when the UAV hovers in the three-dimensional conical space volume above the WPT platform, it maintains a stable output power with an approximately constant 84.5% transmission efficiency.

Through the strategic adjustment of the input admittance, the conductance of the low-power diode decreases progressively with increasing power, while the conductance of the high-power diode increases correspondingly. This conductance-based power allocation method ensures that the power is rectified consistently by the most appropriate diode, regardless of the power level, and, thus, enables efficient rectification across an extended range. This letter presents a rectifier typology to substantiate the proposed strategy. Experimental results confirm the efficiency of the adaptive power division strategy, with the rectifier showing efficiency in excess of 60% from 5 to 29.5 dBm, giving a power dynamic range of 24.5 dB.</description></item><item><title>Conditional Sixth-Harmonic Injection to Improve the Linear Modulation Range of Three-Phase Voltage-Source Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10648706</link><description>Overmoduation techniques are used to improve dc bus voltage utilization for three-phase voltage-source converters (VSCs), resulting in significant reduction in fundamental voltage gain.

The goal is to provide a low-cost and easy-implemented impedance measurement technique that does not rely on actual disturbance sources or prior controller knowledge. In this method, only two-phase sampling channels are needed to measure positive- and negative-sequence impedances of GCC at the same time. This method works well with converters employing various control strategies, and its universality is proved by theoretical analysis.

This letter leverages the spread spectrum technique in a class E inverter-driven, highly resonant system to address these challenges. However, a conventional class E inverter would be optimized toward a single frequency, and directly leading to hard switching issue when applying spread spectrum. By examining original classical class-E design method, it enriches the understanding of the design under frequency modulation scenarios. Through simulation, it investigates the tradeoffs among various goals, including efficiency, voltage stress, output ripple, and EMI reduction. It develops an IPT system according to the design strategy, achieving zero-voltage switching across a frequency modulation range of 0.95&#8211;1.05 MHz and maintaining an efficiency of 87%. This approach resulted in a 13-dB EMI reduction compared to a 1 MHz classical class E design.</description></item><item><title>A Modulation Method With Current Zero-Crossing Distortion Elimination and Voltage Balance Control for the RSHMC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10645288</link><description>Hybrid multilevel converters have gained more popularity due to their unique superiority. Thus, the reduced switch hybrid multilevel (RSHMC) converter is adopted in this article which consists three H-bridge cells and a Vienna rectifier. The RSHMC converter combines the advantages of these two topologies and can output higher voltage level by adopting fewer switching devices compared with other multilevel converters. However, the Vienna rectifier of the RSHMC converter has the inherent current zero-crossing distortion (CZCD) problem, which will increase the total harmonic distortion of the grid-side current. Thus, a modulation method based on phase disposition-pulsewidth modulation is proposed to eliminate the CZCD of the RSHMC converter by selecting redundant switching states. Besides, in order to ensure the normal operation of the RSHMC converter, the proposed modulation method can also realize the voltage balance control of the floating capacitor and the neutral point which is also realized by selecting the switching states to charge or discharge. Consequently, the RSHMC converter can operate normally with balanced voltage and without CZCD after adopting the proposed modulation method. Finally, the feasibility and correctness of the proposed modulation method are verified by simulation and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Evaluation of Capacitor Voltage Balancing Control Strategies for Multilevel DAB Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10666267</link><description>Dual active bridge converter with multilevel neutral point clamped topology has shown potential to be a viable solution for medium-voltage dc systems. However, it will face a crucial challenge with regard to capacitor voltage balancing. In order to mitigate the negative effects caused by the voltage imbalance, e.g., overvoltage on certain devices, various control strategies for voltage balancing have been developed. To better design and implement the voltage balancing strategies, this article evaluates several voltage balancing approaches, i.e., modified duty cycle (MDC) method, modified phase shift and duty cycle (MPSDC) method, fixed switching state (FSS) method, and complementary switching state (CSS) method. These voltage balancing approaches have distinct characteristics in terms of dynamics, efficiency, robustness, applicability with modulation strategy, and implementation complexity. Evaluation results show that the MDC and MPSDC methods have advantage of extending to various control strategies. However, they are affected by current polarity identification, and have large current and power fluctuations. The FSS method is the most robust and the simplest one, but it also has poor dynamics. On the other hand, the CSS method can deliver smooth dynamics and high efficiency, but it relies on identifying the polarity of inductor current, and it cannot be used to the single phase shift and triple phase shift control strategies. Based on the evaluation results, the suitable applications of different voltage balancing methods are discussed.</description></item><item><title>Forced Fluorinated Liquid Cooling for Medium Voltage SiC Power Modules: Concurrently Addressing Electrical and Thermal Challenges</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638826</link><description>Enhanced insulation and superior thermal characteristics are crucial in advanced packaging for medium voltage (MV) silicon carbide (SiC) power modules. Nonetheless, the reduction in thermal resistance typically compromises insulation level due to the decreased number of insulation layers. In this paper, the forced fluorinated liquid cooling is proposed, whereby fluorinated liquid (3M FC-40) is directed into the power module, substituting silicone gel and diminishing thermal resistance. Through the utilization of forced fluorinated liquid cooling, a reduction of 21&#176;C in junction temperature at full load is demonstrated in the experiment, compared to traditional water cooled power modules. Furthermore, there is a 35.6% reduction observed in the maximum temperature rise &#916;Tj. As dissipation power is transferred from the topside of the chip to the fluorinated liquid, the possibility of unlimited stacking of direct bonded copper (DBC) is enabled to lower the electrical field, thereby facilitating insulation at the chip bottom side without any worries regarding heightened thermal resistance. Forced fluorinated liquid cooling resulted in a 39&#176;C reduction in the double-stacked DBC power module. Moreover, partial discharge (PD) detection under square wave revealed that the DBC immersed in the fluorinated liquid remains free from PD at 10 kV, a significantly higher threshold than observed with silicone gel. A higher partial discharge inception voltage (PDIV) is anticipated for double-stacked DBC when immersed in 3M FC-40. Thus, the forced fluorinated liquid cooling can be considered a promising solution for the next generation of MV SiC power modules.</description></item><item><title>A High Accuracy and Low-Cost Fatigue Life Evaluation Method for IGBTs Based on Variable-Parameter Power Cycling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10648866</link><description>Fatigue life of insulated gate bipolar transistor modules (IGBTs) is critical to the reliable application during their long-term servicing. At present, time-consuming and costly power cycling tests are commonly used to obtain the fatigue life model of power electronics devices. In this article, a lower cost and higher efficiency method for the evaluation on the fatigue life of IGBTs was proposed based on variable-parameter power cycling. First, theoretical feasibility of the proposed method was discussed based on fatigue theory. Then, details concerning on the proposed method were described combining with the power cycling data obtained from electro-thermal coupling simulations. Finally, power cycling under both constant and variable parameter was carried out to IGBT modules for experimental verifications. Results dedicate that the fitted fatigue life deduced from the degradation curve of electro-thermal characteristics of IGBTs under variable-parameter power cycling was well consistent with that directly measured from constant-parameter power cycling. It results in an order of magnitude increase in test efficiency and an order of magnitude decrease in costs, which brings huge economic benefit and high efficiency to the fatigue life evaluation of IGBTs.</description></item><item><title>An Alternative Junction-to-Case Thermal Resistance Test Method for High Power Press-Pack IGBTs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10660505</link><description>Press-pack insulated gate bipolar transistors (PP IGBTs) is well suited for high-voltage, high-power applications due to their double-side cooling, ease of series connection, and higher power density. It is very important to measure the junction-to-case thermal resistance (Rthjc) for evaluating thermal performance, with high accuracy. However, the existing thermal resistance test methods will have the problem of low accuracy when it is used in PP IGBTs. In this article, a new thermal resistance test method is proposed based on the transient dual-interface method (TDIM), different from traditional TDIM, which can obtain two transient thermal impedance (Zth) curves without disassembling the fixture, and determine the Rthjc through the separation point. The 4500 V 3000 A StakPak PP IGBTs is used as the measurement object. The results show that compared with the traditional TDIM, the new method is very simple to operate, and the test results are more accurate than thermocouples, which is more suitable for PP IGBTs. The single-side thermal resistance of the PP IGBTs is analyzed, and the emitter side is even worse due to the disc spring. The Rthjc calculated by single-side thermal resistance is close to the proposed method, but fluctuates widely.</description></item><item><title>Coordinated PWM-Based Active Thermal Control for Power Semiconductor Devices in Parallel Grid-Tied Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10663216</link><description>This article proposes a new active thermal control method for power semiconductor devices in parallel grid-tied inverters using coordinated pulsewidth modulation (PWM), which breaks the limitation that the PWM-based active thermal control cannot reduce the switching frequency below rated value, and therefore provides more regulation freedom to improve the reliability of power semiconductor devices. In specific, both frequency and phase shift values of PWM sequences will be adjusted coordinately to relieve the junction temperature of parallel inverters while keeping the total high-frequency harmonics at point of common coupling (PCC) to meet the quality requirement. The presented method is applicable to parallel inverters with identical or different input power. Finally, experimental results verified the performance of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Optimization and Validation of Current Sharing in IGBT Modules With Multichips in Parallel</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10665971</link><description>Multichips paralleled insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) power modules are widely employed in industrial and automotive power conversion systems. The asymmetry of the circuit topology and the differences in chip characteristics are the main reasons for the unbalanced current distribution among parallel chips, leading to excessive electrical stress in power modules, which in turn forces the power modules to operate at a reduced rated current. Additionally, the unbalanced current distribution inevitably results in different chip losses, which are further amplified under high current loading conditions, causing some chips to be overheated, and significantly reducing the reliability. Optimizing the circuit topology is a common method to improve current distribution, but global changes often entail higher costs and longer development cycles. Moreover, the electrical parasitic of the fast recovery diodes (FRD) chip branches are not given sufficient attention in circuit topology research. Under rectification and blocked conditions in electric vehicles, FRDs often become the bottleneck for lifespan due to excessively high junction temperatures. Therefore, this article conducts a comparative analysis of the circuit parasitic in IGBT and FRD loops with several typical layouts, without changing the substrate and chip dimensions, and proposes a current sharing slot structure design to balance the parasitic parameters. Compared with the direct bonded copper (DBC) layout of the typical EconoDUAL power module, the optimized module reduces the current imbalance of FRD from 45.5% to 11.6% and the switching loss can be reduced by 8.6%. By adopting the current sharing groove, the parasitic parameter distribution can be further improved while maintaining a fixed DBC layout, considering the IGBT and FRD branches in concert. Finally, the steady-state and transient current sharing characteristics were verified under constant current and inverter conditions. Under constant current conditions, the temperature difference of FRD in the upper and lower parallel layout modules was reduced by 16.7&#8201;&#176;C, and the junction temperature of IGBT was significantly lowered. Under inverter conditions, the highest junction temperature of the columnar layout modules could be reduced by 10&#8201;&#176;C, and the temperature difference of FRD decreased by 62%. This article significantly optimizes the current imbalance issue through layout design, reduces the thermal equilibrium difference of the module under application conditions, and is conducive to improving the output capacity and fatigue life of the module, providing a solution for the design of power modules with high junction temperature operation capability and high-reliability.</description></item><item><title>Evaluation and MHz Converter Application of 1.2-kV Vertical GaN JFET</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638831</link><description>The 1.2 kV vertical GaN fin-channel junction field-effect transistor (JFET) is an emerging industrial device with low specific on-resistance (RON), normally-off operation, and avalanche capability. This article reports the first comprehensive evaluation of 1.2 kV, 75 m&#937; gallium nitride (GaN) JFET in converter applications. The RC-interface gate driver is optimized through the double-pulse test (DPT). To quantify the device's conduction loss, an in-situ measurement of dynamic RON is performed in a continuous DPT at steady-state. The vertical GaN JFET shows no dynamic RON issue. Subsequently, a GaN JFET-based half bridge is evaluated in a zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) buck converter under various frequencies, duty cycles, and load conditions. For comparison, similarly-rated SiC mosfet and Si IGBT are tested in the same converter. Benefitting from the lowest output capacitance and output charge, the GaN JFET requires a short deadtime and enables MHz operation in the 800-V ZVS buck converter. The GaN converter achieves a maximum efficiency of 97.7% at 1 MHz and 98.0% at 500 kHz and shows a general advantage in frequency and efficiency compared to the same converters based on SiC mosfet and Si IGBT. In addition, under the operational driver condition, the 1.2 kV GaN JFET shows a long short-circuit withstanding time of over 40 &#956;s at 800 V. These results provide key reference for the application of 1.2 kV GaN JFETs and suggest that a GaN device with proper designs can achieve excellent stability and robustness.</description></item><item><title>Miniaturized Current Shunt With High Bandwidth and Low Parasitics for High-Integrated Applications: Electro-Thermal Considerations and Co-Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638787</link><description>The development of current sensors for wide-bandgap (WBG) applications consistently emphasizes high bandwidth, minimal invasiveness, and integration. Despite the meticulous design that enables current shunts to achieve excellent performance with high bandwidth and low parasitics, their inherent bulkiness remains a significant challenge for their integration into high-integrated applications that depend on the high switching speeds of WBG power devices. This study thoroughly investigates and uncovers the tradeoff faced by traditional current shunts in balancing miniaturization and high bandwidth. Building upon this understanding, the miniaturized current shunt (MiniShunt) concept is introduced to overcome inherent limitations and achieve both high performance and compact size. To realize this concept, a physical implementation that involves the high-density stacking of multiple coupled transmission lines is presented. Additionally, a thermal network model specifically for the proposed MiniShunt configuration is developed and a comprehensive thermal analysis methodology for the current shunts is established. By applying this methodology to finite element analysis, the thermal safe operating area for the MiniShunt can be determined, further providing valuable insights into its maximum static power dissipation and maximum energy loss. These findings contribute to the development of a highly compact 9 &#215; 9-mm, 100-m&#937; current shunt with an ultrahigh bandwidth of 3 GHz, near-zero parasitic inductance, and a maximum energy loss of 2.0 J at a reference temperature rise limit of 20 &#176;C. Extensive experiments conducted in both the frequency and time domains serve to further validate the advantages of the MiniShunt in terms of its miniaturization, integration, ultrafast response, and low invasiveness for future high-integrated power electronics applications.</description></item><item><title>Insulation Capability at 10 kV, &gt;300 V/ns of a Nonlinear Resistive Polymer Nanocomposite Field-Grading Coating in a 15-kV Silicon Carbide Module</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10648830</link><description>Emerging medium-voltage silicon carbide devices offer the potential to achieve more efficient and compact power electronics for grid-tied applications. However, the lack of an effective insulation solution for packaging the devices has slowed their widespread adoption. Recently, a nonlinear resistive polymer nanocomposite coating has been introduced to enhance the insulation by reducing localized electric field stress inside the modules. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the insulation capability of the polymer nanocomposite under high dv/dt. Half-bridge modules of 15-kV silicon carbide devices were packaged with the nanocomposite coating at the triple points on the module substrate. All the modules were tested free of partial discharge at 20 kV for 1 min. One module underwent a repetitive double-pulse test at 10 kV, 2 A and was switching at a peak dv/dt &gt; 300 V/ns. These findings further support the coating's potential as a viable practical solution to the insulation challenge of medium-voltage power modules.</description></item><item><title>Droop Control of Three- and Four-Leg Hybrid Parallel Inverters Based on Three-Phase Generalized Coordinate Transformation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10637483</link><description>In recent years, widespread adoption of three-leg inverters has been observed. However, there is often a need for three-phase four-wire inverters to provide a neutral connection for asymmetrical loads within microgrid contexts. This article proposes a three- and four-leg hybrid inverter parallel structure to address the above issues. The aim is to fulfill the four-wire requirement under asymmetrical load conditions and mitigate the voltage unbalance problem. The article begins by investigating the output voltage balance control of three- and four-leg inverters and the control techniques of the hybrid parallel system. Deficiencies in traditional power droop control and virtual impedance control under unbalanced conditions are identified by calculating the inverter's output power under asymmetric load conditions. To address these issues, the article adopts average power droop and proposes a novel virtual impedance method. This method considers the impact of line impedance differences on the distribution accuracy of active power and unbalanced load current, effectively improving their distribution accuracy. Connecting three- and four-leg inverters in parallel, the four-leg inverter is capable of significantly reducing the zero-sequence voltage of the common load terminal and enhances three-phase voltage balance. Finally, experimental results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the improved virtual impedance control.</description></item><item><title>An Additional Damping Torque Method for Low-Frequency Stability Enhancement of Virtual Synchronous Generators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638828</link><description>Low-frequency oscillations may occur in a virtual synchronous generator (VSG), resulting from an insufficient equivalent damping ration, which may be a serious stability issue for VSG. Thus, an additional damping ration is expected to be provided without affecting droop behaviors and the inertia response of VSG. To that end, an analytical approach based on combining a damping torque model and a small-signal model is developed to investigate the damping behaviors of the VSG. The relationship between the two models is brought to light, indicating that the damping torque model is suitable for qualitative analysis to give the contribution of different feedback loops to the system damping level. Subsequently, the latter is adopted for quantitative analysis to illustrate the damping ration of the system. Furthermore, an additional damping torque method is proposed, which can provide an extra damping ration for the system by increasing the equivalent positive damping torque and guaranteeing that the original droop characteristics and inertia are not compromised. Besides, the proposed control method is implemented by inserting an auxiliary branch into the power control loops of VSG. Experimental results verify the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed additional damping method.</description></item><item><title>Exact Linearization Control of a Two-Stage DC&#8211;AC Converter With a Power Pulsating Buffer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638817</link><description>This article proposes to combine full feedback linearization with full state feedback and trajectory tracking control in order to obtain a high performance dc&#8211;ac boost converter. The system is composed of a boost converter, an inverter, and a power pulsation buffer, which removes the ripple from the dc-link, and allows reducing the size of its capacitor. This can improve the reliability of the system, as smaller capacitors do not need to be electrolytic. The use of full feedback linearization enables a stable controller at any point of operation, while the trajectory tracking control allows high performance tracking of the references (required for smaller capacitor values). The steady state performance and disturbance rejection capabilities are provided by the full state feedback control. In addition, the effect of parametric mismatches is analyzed, and the robustness of the proposal is validated through simulations and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>A Nonlinear Hybrid Impedance Matching Technique for Electromagnetic Exploration Transmitter With 96% Multifrequency Signal Energy Utilization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10640305</link><description>In electromagnetic exploration applications, the grounded cable and transmitting coil transducers are typical inductive loads that can cause reactive power occupation problems to power converters and limit the effective utilization of transmission signal energy. However, the existing impedance matching techniques show poor compatibility with nonlinear square voltage signals, which use multiple harmonic components to efficiently acquire geological information of multiple depths. To address these issues, a novel nonlinear hybrid impedance matching (NHIM) technique that combines a passive thyristor-controlled capacitor (TCC) and active insulated-gate bipolar transistor-controlled converter (ICC) is proposed to provide multifrequency impedance matching simultaneously under varying frequency conditions. In this article, the nonlinear matching strategy is first introduced. Then, the NHIM parameter optimal design is proposed considering the reduction of dc supply voltage requirement. After that, a cooperative control strategy is proposed, including multifrequency power calculation, impedance identification, and control reference calculation for TCC and ICC to constitute fundamental and high-frequency reactive power compensation. Finally, comparative simulations and experiments verify the cooperative design methodology of the proposed NHIM. Compared with the existing broadband matching, the proposed method ensures 12%&#8211;460% spectral amplitude enhancement and over 96% multifrequency signal energy utilization, which is a 10%&#8211;13% performance improvement over previous techniques.</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid Control for Smooth Power Direction Transition of Bidirectional Resonant CLLC Converter With Wide Voltage Gain</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10645296</link><description>The resonant CLLC circuit has become a mainstream choice for isolated bidirectional dc&#8211;dc converters due to its high efficiency. However, the power is inversely related to the switching frequency, resulting in a power control blind area under conditions of low gain and light load. This blind area can induce voltage oscillations during power direction transitions, potentially affecting the connected circuits and the grid. Incorporating phase-shift control can eliminate the blind area, but it also reduces efficiency. Consequently, the operational scope of phase-shift control should be minimized as much as possible. Meanwhile, the switching devices driven by frequency control differ between forward and backward modes. As an intermediate state, phase-shift control must ensure smooth transitions of the drive signal of primary and secondary sides. To address these challenges, this article analyzed the boundaries of the blind area at different gains and calculated the relationship between power and the phase-shift angle. Furthermore, it analyzed the coupling variations of frequency and phase-shift angle and achieved smooth transitions in frequency and phase-shift angle during the transition based on digital synchronous rectification control. Finally, a unified control scheme was established and verified through experiments to achieve overall high efficiency and smooth bidirectional transitions.</description></item><item><title>A Non-Resonant ZVS Four-Switch Flyback Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10645305</link><description>The four-switch flyback (FSF) converter has the advantages of low switch voltage stress and zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) with the leakage inductance energy. However, if the clamping capacitor is too small, its voltage will oscillate, and the negative magnetizing current for realizing ZVS is difficult to be accurately obtained since it is generated by resonance. In this article, the clamping capacitor is intentionally designed quite large so that its voltage keeps nearly constant. The resultant converter is called nonresonant ZVS FSF converter. The operating principle of the converter is analyzed, and the method to accurately control the negative magnetizing current is proposed, which not only minimizes the magnetizing current ripple, but also realizes ZVS for all the power switches. Finally, a 400-W prototype is built and tested in the lab, and experimental results are provided to verify the operating principle of the FSF converter and the proposed control method.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Intelligent Control Using Hippocampus-Based Fuzzy Neural Networks for Active Power Filter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10645310</link><description>To tackle harmonic issue in the power grid, an intelligent control scheme consists of fast integral terminal sliding-mode control and hippocampus-based fuzzy neural network (HBFNN) is proposed and applied to active power filter (APF) to eliminate harmonics in this article.

Afterwards, a fast integral terminal sliding-mode controller is developed for APF. The system stability is subsequently proved according to Lyapunov stability criterion, and the finite-time convergence of tracking error is certified. In addition, based on the biological structure and characteristics of the hippocampus, an innovative HBFNN is constructed to approximate the controller. Furthermore, the adaptive laws derived by the Lyapunov's theorem can realize the automatic adjustment of parameters and ensure closed-loop stability. Ultimately, relevant simulation and experimental results corroborate the availability and superiority of the designed intelligent control strategy in harmonic elimination.</description></item><item><title>Active Power Decoupling Control for Three-Level Buck Four-Leg Current Source Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10652896</link><description>Significant pulsating power exists on the dc side of three-phase four-wire inverters in the case of unbalanced or nonlinear loads, which will degrade the power quality of the dc side voltage.

These unique characteristics introduce challenges to the impedance matching of ULF electroacoustic transducer. In other words, advanced impedance matching strategies to simultaneously maintain high transmission efficiency and broadband acoustic radiation are untapped. To address these issues, a controllable T-type broadband impedance matching network (CTIMN) is proposed here. First, the matching principle of CTIMN is newly developed by deriving two equivalent circuits from both the output of power amplifier and the input of ULF electroacoustic transducer. Then, the parameter design method based on the exhaustive method is proposed to yield the optimal parametric design for CTIMN. Combined with the adaptive proportional-resonant control strategy, the operating principle of CTIMN is illustrated.

However, there exists a tradeoff between disturbance rejection and noise immunity for traditional linear ESO (TLESO). Compared to TLESO with similar bandwidth, phase-locking loop observer (PLLO) exhibits a better output tracking performance but weaker noise suppression capability. By combining the advantages of TLESO and PLLO, an adaptive LESO (ALESO) is proposed in this article, which utilizes TLESO in steady state and PLLO during transient state. The dynamic and noise-suppression performances of different observers are analyzed and compared systematically. The proposed ALESO inherits good dynamic response of PLLO and noise-suppression performance of TLESO, without using high bandwidth. It also possesses the advantages of simple structure, requiring few tuning parameters and ease of parameter tuning. To verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed ALESO design, it is employed to a 500 W dual-active-bridge dc&#8211;dc converter for pulsed power applications. Experiments results show that, in comparison with TLESO, the proposed ALESO has resulted in 33.3%/37% and 60%/73.3% reductions in output voltage undershoot/overshoot and setting time, respectively, under load step-up/down.

However, the nonidentical high-frequency link (HFL) inductor is unavoidable, causing mutual interferences among submodules, and deteriorating the decoupling and voltage balance performances of conventional IVS strategies. Thus, a general decoupling IVS control strategy is proposed for ISOP DAB converter with nonidentical HFL inductors. First, an improved small-signal state-space model of ISOP DAB converter with a full-rank matrix is proposed to present the coupled performance of the ISOP DAB converter with nonidentical HFL inductors. Based on the improved model, a general decoupling method is proposed by invertible and gain-regulated matrices to achieve a diagonal matrix with uniform diagonal elements in the small-signal model, revealing and solving the sneak coupled performances among control loops. Next, a decoupling IVS control strategy is proposed by shaping full-order input impedance to solve the issues and coupled effects of multiple modes in the operation submodules. Then, the IVS controller is designed and detailed in the frequency and time domains, achieving input voltage balance and avoiding oscillation among submodules with better dynamics and more stable responsiveness. Moreover, the better characteristics of input impedance, output impedance, and input voltages in the proposed decoupling IVS control strategy are discussed and compared with traditional strategies. Finally, experiments are set up to verify the proposed general decoupling IVS control strategy for ISOP DAB converter with nonidentical HFL inductors.</description></item><item><title>Design and Validation of a Multioutput Wireless Power Transfer System Using MPC Controller</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10706646</link><description>This article presents a novel approach that combines Kalman filtering and model predictive control (MPC) algorithms to achieve stable output in a multioutput wireless power transfer (WPT) system for automated guided vehicles (AGVs).

However, existing temperature evaluation methods cannot accurately evaluate the temperature distribution of chips under surge conditions. This article proposes an experimental-simulation iterative modeling method, which is based on the electro-thermal coupling finite element model to simulate and calculate the temperature distribution of diode chips under surge conditions. The simulated I-V trajectory and temperature distribution are in good agreement with the experimental results. In addition, by monitoring the degradation of electrical characteristic parameters of diode chips under surge conditions and analyzing the scanning electron microscope results of failed chips, it was concluded that the single surge limit of the chip can be determined by the occurrence of aluminum electromigration phenomenon, and the critical conditions for the chip to reach the surge limit were quantitatively determined with the assistance of simulation results. Finally, based on the proposed temperature evaluation method, the relationship between the number of chip bonding wires and the surge limit was obtained.</description></item><item><title>A Compact, Single Stage, &gt;1 kV Medium-Voltage Line Impedance Stabilization Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643328</link><description>This article presents the design of a single-phase, single-stage line impedance stabilization network (LISN) for medium-voltage (MV) applications. More than 1 kV rated wide-bandgap (WBG) power semiconductor switches are increasingly utilized in new, emerging power electronics energy systems to improve power density and efficiency. However, due to inherently fast-switching speeds, WBG switch modules emit considerable electromagnetic interference (EMI) (e.g., common mode or differential mode). State-of-the-art offers standardized LISN solutions to validate and certify the new energy system for electromagnetic compatibility. However, most are for low voltage applications (i.e., &lt; 1 kV). MV LISNs (i.e., &gt; 1 kV) are rare until recently and literature does not provide sufficient guidelines for designing and characterizing such devices. It has been a critical challenge for many scientists and engineers to reliably certify the emerging MV energy systems (e.g., electric ships and aircraft). This article addresses such a technology gap. Specifically, a CISPR 16-1-2 compliant 50 &#937;/50 &#181;H LISN with 1.5 kV, 75 A and 30 MHz measurement capability has been proposed. Detailed performance study versus non-linear parasitic parameters variations in MV inductors and capacitors have been done. Based on new understandings, novel techniques to intuitively mitigate unwanted parasitic have been proposed to develop the proposed LISN successfully. Thorough characterization of important LISN parameters are presented and factors influencing them are analyzed. A rigorous analysis, experimental tests, and in-depth comparisons over state-of-the-art have been made to validate the effectiveness. This is done through the state-of-the-art 300 kVA MV EMI testbed.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Analysis of a Novel Distributed Magnetic-Pole Permanent Magnet Planetary Machine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10531764</link><description>A novel distributed magnetic pole permanent magnet planetary machine (DMPPMPM) is proposed in this article, which has the advantages of high power density, high integration, reliable transmission, and simple controllability.

In view of the drag reduction requirements of micro vehicles, a piezoelectric traveling wave drag reducer (PTWDR) is proposed in this article. The PTWDR can be embedded into the surface of micro vehicles, with the merits of small size, high drag reduction efficiency and low energy consumption. We analyzed the structural changes of turbulent flow field caused by the actuation of PTWDR, and revealed the turbulent drag reduction mechanism. The control parameters selecting method to achieve required drag reduction performance under different operating conditions are proposed. The good drag reduction effects in various regions of the vehicles can be achieved by reasonably arranging PTWDR. The friction drag and total drag experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of PTWDR in achieving drag reduction, and the maximum drag reduction rate can reach 58%. Finally, the energy saving efficiency of PTWDR are studied, and it is confirmed that PTWDR can achieve net energy savings. This study provides an important reference for on-demand active drag reduction and net energy saving of micro vehicles.</description></item><item><title>Robust Control System Tuner and Cascaded Adaptive Vectorial Filter-Based PV-Battery System With a Dual-Loop ANF-PLL</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10528786</link><description>This article presents a three-phase, single-stage photovoltaic (PV) system with a battery energy storage (BES) that functions in both grid-tied and islanded modes.

A parameter-switching methodology with the selected scheduling parameter is provided and the visual analyses of performance guarantees are analyzed. MADRC-gs is applied to a practical denitrification process of an in-service 660MW power plant. Actual operational data illustrate that MADRC-gs can reduce hourly average integral absolute error by about 22.61% and 43.18% in high-load and low-load ranges, respectively. Even though the power plant experiences lifting and lowering powers frequently, MADRC-gs can still obtain better control performance compared to the original controller and MADRC, and show a promising application potential in energy and chemical industries.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Round-Robin Protocol-Based Secondary Control for ESSs Under FDI Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10538177</link><description>This article focuses on the distributed secondary control problem for energy storage systems (ESSs) under false data injection (FDI) attacks. To solve the problem, a $\boldsymbol{k}$-step attack estimation method is first proposed to estimate the unknown attacks and the estimation error converges to zero as the number of estimation steps increases to infinity. Next, we design a Round-Robin (RR) communication protocol to alleviate the communication burden among ESSs. Based on the estimator state and the RR communication protocol, a distributed secondary security controller is proposed by introducing a time-varying gain for each ESS. Different from the existing secondary control results on ESSs, the developed result can achieve state of charge (SoC) balancing and proportional power-sharing with restricted communication under FDI attacks. It is shown that the SoC balancing and proportional power-sharing objectives can be achieved under the developed methods. Finally, a real-time experiment is introduced to show the effectiveness of the developed methods.</description></item><item><title>Self-Adjusting Domain Adversarial Transfer Learning Algorithm for Power Transformer Lifetime Prediction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10546914</link><description>Accurate prediction of the remaining useful lifetime of power transformers plays a crucial role in effective operation and health maintenance of the entire power grid. Machine-learning based data-driven solution is effective on mitigating the high financial and time costs induced by traditional prediction schemes, however, this solution is limited by data distribution, data volume, data quality, and variations of prediction scenarios, making it difficult to achieve good prediction performance. To address this concern, a self-adjusting domain adversarial transfer learning (SDATL) algorithm for power transformer lifetime prediction is first proposed in this article. It extracts features from source and target domains by stacked convolution sparse auto-encoder (SCSAE), measures distributions of source and target domains by the adversarial domain adaptive module. Furthermore, it implements advantageous transfer learning after determining the transfer object. Moreover, the parametric linear rectification unit (PReLU) adaptive adjustment module is designed and constructed to further improve the prediction accuracy by optimizing the network structure through network transfer and iteration. The proposed SDATL network is evaluated by using condition monitoring data from six dry-type transformers and compared with existing prevalence data-driven algorithms. The evaluation and comparison results validate higher prediction accuracy and better adaptability of the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>A Fractional-Order Gradient Neural Solution to Time-Variant Quadratic Programming With Application to Robot Motion Planning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10551266</link><description>This article proposes the fractional-order gradient neural network (FO-GNN) model for time-variant quadratic programming (TVQP) problems, marking the first integration of fractional calculus into neural solver design for cyclic motion planning in robotics. The FO-GNN evolves from traditional GNNs by employing fractional gradient operators, thus bypassing the differentiation typically required in zeroing neural networks (ZNNs). This innovation leads to a streamlined computational approach and convergence that does not rely on the convexity of the energy function. Compared to ZNN, standard GNN, and MATLAB&#8217;s quadprog, the FO-GNN offers enhanced precision and expedited convergence for both time-invariant and TVQP challenges.

The reliability of the SST is crucial. However, active switches are prone to failures, which can have severe consequences. For the matrix-type SST (MT-SST), the time-varying dc-link voltage poses challenges for accurate and rapid fault diagnosis. This article proposes a comprehensive fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control method for the open-circuit (OC) fault of a single switch in MT-SST. By comparing the estimated and measured values of the resonant capacitor voltages, the algorithm identifies the OC fault. Additionally, a reduction in the duty cycle of specific switches is introduced to assist in fault localization through monitoring of voltage changes. However, this method can only identify the OC fault on one side of MT-SST when the direction of power flow remains constant. To ensure fault tolerance, the primary and secondary side full-bridge is reconfigured into a quasi-half-bridge structure. The developed methods have the advantages simplicity and reliability. Finally, a 1.5 kW prototype is built, and the validity and feasibility of the proposed methods are verified.</description></item><item><title>Parameter Estimation of DAB Converter Using Intelligent Algorithms and Steady-State Modeling Considering Nonidealities</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10546328</link><description>Parameter estimation of dual active bridge (DAB) converters is a powerful tool in the applications of fault location, modulation strategy optimization, and preventive maintenance. However, most of the existing parameter estimation techniques often rely on costly experimental measurements and only estimate some converter parameters. To address these problems, we apply intelligence techniques to propose a flexible, generalized, and reliable multiparametric estimation methodology. Specifically, the circuit nonidealities, including the dead-time effect and the power loss, are considered to derive accurate open-loop and closed-loop steady-state models of the DAB converter. Then, the dynamic behavior and stability of the DAB converter are investigated based on those theoretical models. Next, a back-propagation (BP) neural network optimized by the genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to establish training models. Notably, the datasets used in training are generated from the derived DAB models, eliminating the need for parameter data collection from different converters. Finally, the accuracy, robustness, and generalization ability of the GA-BP are compared with traditional estimation methodologies and the pretrained BP model. Illustrative results demonstrate that the proposed intelligent approach is an effective approach for parameter estimation.</description></item><item><title>Online Bridge-Level Junction Temperature Evaluation of IGBTs via Emitter Parasitic Inductance Voltage Undershoot</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10530860</link><description>Insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) junction temperature evaluation is vital for health assessment. However, most of the existing IGBT junction temperature (Tj) evaluation approaches require the same number of detecting units and IGBTs. In this article, a thermosensitive electrical parameter based on the turn-off induced voltage veE undershoot between Kelvin and power emitters of lower IGBT for two IGBTs junction temperatures estimation in half-bridge module is proposed, which is independent of bond wires fatigue. The veE ringing of lower IGBT under designed time sequence has a good linear dependency with Tj of upper and lower IGBTs. An improved peak detector circuit is designed to extract the veE with no disruption to normal operation. Double-pulse test and three-phase converter platforms are built to verify the feasibility of industrial applications. Calibration results show that there is good linearity and high sensitivity between IGBT junction temperature and veE undershoot under various working conditions. Besides, the approach has high accuracy in junction temperature monitoring validated by infrared. Therefore, this novel bridge-level Tj estimation method has a good commercial prospect.</description></item><item><title>Interleaved Switching for Loss Minimization in Adjacent Cell-to-Cell Balancing Architectures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10521813</link><description>The cell-to-cell variation in capacity and impedance leads to a charge imbalance within the battery pack, which tends to degrade its various states and the available energy. Therefore, a Battery Management System (BMS) equipped with a charge equalization circuit (CEC) will enhance the overall performance of the pack, resulting in improved electric range and grid storage capacity. The adjacent cell-to-cell (AC2C) architecture has a higher equalization loss because charge distribution is limited between adjacent cells and the hard-switching operation of their connected CECs. A charge equalization algorithm where interleaved switching of CECs with variable duty control is proposed in this article. The proposed switching operation improves the equalization loss by regulating the equalization current (rms and average) relative to the balanced state of the individual cell. To study the equalization performance for diverse scenarios of imbalance, a 48 V, 20 Ah pack with AC2C buck-boost CEC is configured in the PLECS simulation environment, where the proposed algorithm has achieved around 32% reduction in equalization loss. For experimental validation, an 18 V, 10.4 Ah LCO battery pack connected to the BMS and a series AC2C equalization unit are developed for the balancing operations.</description></item><item><title>A Digital Twin Approach for Online Impedance-Based Stability Analysis of Three-Phase AC Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10541872</link><description>In contemporary electrical distribution systems, multiple parallel inverters collaborate to form an advanced power distribution network, which poses stability challenges. Small-signal analysis is a fundamental method for characterizing interactions between system impedances. In three-phase ac systems, stability assessment involves examining the source-to-load impedance ratio in the complex dq plane using the Generalized Nyquist criterion (GNC). In this context, the digital twin (DT) concept is arising as the forefront of energy sector digitization, providing real-time data through high-fidelity models mirroring physical systems. This article presents a stability analysis method employing a DT approach to determine the closed-loop impedance of the physical system and estimate the connected system's equivalent impedance. Broadband excitation based on pseudorandom binary sequences (PRBS) is applied with Fourier techniques for frequency response extraction. Impedance ratio assessment is performed on an edge-computing platform, delivering real-time stability information. Experimental results are provided for a dual-hybrid converter, one operating as a grid-forming system and the other in grid-following mode. The outcomes demonstrate the feasibility and potential of the proposal as a foundational approach to enhance robustness based on stability indexes.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Step-Wave AC Voltage Collection System for Renewable Energy Sources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10530354</link><description>To further reduce the losses and footprint of the key power conversion equipment in the conventional sine-wave alternating current (ac) voltage collection system for renewable energy sources, a novel step-wave ac voltage collection system is proposed in this letter, where the voltage on the point of common coupling (PCC) is regulated as a four-level step wave by sending end converter (SEC). With this particular waveform, the semiconductor switches in SEC are able to operate at only line frequency and two-level voltage source converter (VSC) can be used to eliminate the bulky capacitor of the MMC submodule. Therefore, the switching losses are significantly reduced compared with the conventional sine-wave voltage converters. Moreover, the direct current (dc) voltage utilization is improved by 10%. The power loss of the whole collection system can be reduced by 27.2% compared with the traditional sine-wave system using MMC. The effectiveness of the proposed system is verified by simulation and a 500&#160;W prototype.</description></item><item><title>Operating-Point-Parameterized State-Space Models of Black-Boxed Grid-Following Inverters for Maximum Transferable Active Power Prediction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10541860</link><description>This letter introduces an efficient method for analytically predicting the maximum transferable active power (MTAP) of a grid-following inverter (GFLI), considered as a black box, under any arbitrary short circuit ratio (SCR), X/R ratio, and reactive power injection level. By measuring the GFLI's admittance at several different operating points, an operating-point-parameterized state-space model (OPP SSM) is developed and exploited to predict the MTAP. The proposed method obviates the need for repetitive electromagnetic transient time-domain simulations or frequency-domain impedance criteria by gradually increasing active power output until the MTAP is reached. The feasibility of the synthesized OPP SSM for MTAP prediction has been experimentally validated on a power-controlled GFLI, demonstrating its potential for aiding the integration of inverter-based resources in modern power systems.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Two-Stage Benders Decomposition and Dual Dynamic Programming for Hydrothermal-Wind Planning With Intra-Stage Cost Functions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10552437</link><description>The continuous increase of renewable energy sources (RES) brings challenges to electric power system planning, since RES effects must be considered in both short-term dispatch and mid/long-term planning (MLTP). In the latter, immediate or intra-stage cost functions (ICF or ISCF) have been proposed in the literature to provide thermal generation costs for each weekly/monthly stage, to address the uncertainty and high variability of RES without explicitly discretizing the stage in hourly steps. This work proposes a combined two-stage Benders decomposition and dual dynamic programming (DDP) approach to improve the construction and consideration of such ISCF for the MLTP problem. In this case, a set of subproblems considering hourly aspects as load curve, RES intermittency and peak capacity of hydro-generation are iteratively solved in the DDP master problem of each stage, for several scenarios of RES generation profiles, along DDP iterations. Since the discretization points of the ISCF are obtained on demand, this approach yields more accurate ISCF functions, specially in multi-area systems. The methodology is validated for both a tutorial case and a case based on data from the large-scale Brazilian system, where more realistic mid-term policies are obtained when compared to current approaches, with a reduced number of subproblems.</description></item><item><title>Graph Spatio-Temporal Networks for Condition Monitoring of Wind Turbine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10552429</link><description>Condition monitoring of wind turbines (WTs) is essential for advancing wind energy. Existing data-driven methods heavily rely on deep learning and big data, leading to challenges in distinguishing true faults from false alarms, impacting operational decisions negatively. Thus, this paper proposes a spatio-temporal graph neural network framework that incorporates prior knowledge. Prior WT knowledge is utilized by establishing a spatially structured directed graph embedded in a graph attention network (GAT). The features in WTs&#8217; supervisory control and data acquisition system are indicated by the nodes in GAT. Then, the global and local attention embedding layers as well as long short-term memory layers are employed to combine spatio-temporal information from each node. Finally, the condition monitoring in WTs&#8217; graph and node-level are established, and a fault propagation chain at node-level is constructed for explaining condition monitoring results. To demonstrate the explainability, robustness and sensitivity of the proposed approach, a comparative analysis between a true fault case and a false alarm case are given, and anomaly detection results are also reported.</description></item><item><title>Nonlinear Behavior and Transient Stability of Grid-Following Converters Using Direct Power Control Under Weak Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10555420</link><description>Ensuring reliable operation of renewable energy sources requires robust grid-connected converters. Depending on the choice of synchronization methods, grid-connected converters may exhibit distinct nonlinear behavior that plays a vital role in determining their transient stability. Recently, the grid-voltage-modulated direct power control (DPC) has been proposed as an alternative to the conventional phase-locked loop (PLL) to enhance the dynamic response of the grid-following converter (GFLC). However, existing studies have primarily treated the DPC-based GFLC as a linear system. In this paper, we investigate the nonlinear behavior of this converter under weak grids using a large-signal model based on double reference frames. Our findings reveal that the DPC-based GFLC demonstrates sustained oscillation. Interestingly, the stable periodic orbit observed does not arise from a Hopf bifurcation but rather a saddle-node bifurcation of periodic orbits. This critical bifurcation is characterized by the coexistence of a stable periodic orbit and a stable equilibrium point, resulting in a sudden contraction of the converter's stability region. Furthermore, we provide a comparison between the nonlinear behavior of PLL-based GFLCs and DPC-based GFLCs. To validate our findings, we present full-circuit simulations and laboratory experiments.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Functional Integrated Converter for Dynamic Voltage Restoration and Reactive Power Compensation in Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10555312</link><description>Conventionally, parallel-connected or series-connected power quality control devices cannot compensate for both the voltage fluctuation and reactive power simultaneously. To improve the equipment utilization and reliability of the existing power quality control devices, a multi-functional integrated converter (MFIC) is proposed, which can effectively integrate the functions of both dynamic voltage restoration and reactive power compensation. When the grid voltage sags or swells, the MFIC works in the series access mode to achieve voltage regulation function. When the grid voltage is normal, the MFIC works in the parallel access mode to achieve unity power factor operation at the grid side. Compared with the traditional series-connected power quality control device, the MFIC only has one more coupling capacitor, markedly improving the utilization factor of equipment. In addition, the port voltage of the converter module in MFIC is clamped to zero when a short circuit or grounding fault occurs. Meanwhile, a large equivalent impedance is formed to effectively limit the line fault current, which improves the reliability of the MFIC itself and its connected grid as well. Furthermore, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed topology and strategy are verified by simulation and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Power System Decarbonization: A Comparison Between Carbon Taxes and Forcing Coal Power Plant Retirements</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10555380</link><description>The U.S. power system faces a 2035 decarbonization target, though the exact pathway to the target remains unclear. Policy instruments, like carbon taxes and forcing coal plants to retire through various mechanisms, could help achieve the target. It is critical to analyze and compare decarbonization policies as different policies lead to different costs, emissions pathways, and political challenges. In this paper, we explore the ramifications of adopting alternative decarbonization policies. We assume a particular carbon tax to be the benchmark policy and compare it to alternative carbon tax and forced coal retirement policies in terms of emissions and costs. We use a power system dispatch model that co-optimizes unit commitment, energy, and frequency regulation capacity to simulate system evolution over multiple years, including retirements and renewables/storage expansion, under each policy. Our case study highlights the trade-offs between policies. We find that, counter-intuitively, higher carbon taxes do not always achieve lower emissions due to the complexity of dispatch, resulting profits and retirements, and the addition of renewables/storage. In contrast, forced coal retirements result in lower power system costs but higher emissions than the benchmark policy, with a large range of possible outcomes across different retirement cases.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Multistage Distribuionally Robust Programming to Hydrothermal Economic Dispatch With Renewable Energy Sources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10561496</link><description>The multistage solution is very important to achieve optimal hydrothermal economic dispatch considering the uncertainty of renewable energy sources. In data-driven settings, only some historical trajectories are available and the probability distribution is unknown. A data-driven scheme for multistage stochastic hydrothermal economic dispatch with Markovian uncertainties is proposed in this paper. Then a data-driven distributionally robust stochastic dual dynamic programming (DDR-SDDP) is proposed to tackle the corresponding computational intractability, where the conditional probability distributions are estimated by using kernel regression. The out-of-sample performances are improved by distributionally robust optimization on a Wasserstein distance-based ambiguity set. Furthermore, a scenario aggregation method is designed to reduce the computational burden. Numerical results for a practical regional power system in China are presented and analyzed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Co-Optimizing Distributed Energy Resources in Linear Complexity Under Net Energy Metering</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10568387</link><description>The co-optimization of behind-the-meter distributed energy resources is considered for prosumers under the net energy metering tariff. The distributed energy resources considered include renewable generations, flexible demands, and battery energy storage systems. An energy management system co-optimizes the consumptions and battery storage based on locally available stochastic renewables by solving a stochastic dynamic program that maximizes the expected operation surplus. To circumvent the exponential complexity of the dynamic program solution, we propose a closed-form and linear computation complexity co-optimization algorithm based on a relaxation-projection approach to a constrained stochastic dynamic program. Sufficient conditions for optimality for the proposed solution are obtained. Numerical studies demonstrate orders of magnitude reduction of computation costs and significantly reduced optimality gap.</description></item><item><title>Control and Power Balancing of an Off-Grid Wind Turbine With Co-Located Electrolyzer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10569094</link><description>Co-locating electrolyzers and offshore wind can significantly reduce the cost of green hydrogen. However, without a grid connection, a new control paradigm is required for the electrolyzer to follow the variable power supplied by the wind turbine. Commercial electrolyzers have power ramp rate limitations, which can result in a mismatch between the wind turbine and electrolyzer power, leading to frequent shutdown and potentially unstable operation. This paper is the first to develop a control system for this off-grid operation with three mechanisms to dynamically balance the power, including energy storage, rotor inertia, and enhanced pitch control. The results show that a $6.8 million supercapacitor is required with a power rating and capacity of approximately 6.7 MW and 8.5 kWh to enable the system to operate through 99% of the annual wind variation. If the electrolyzer ramp rates can be doubled, the same operating hours can be achieved using only control-based power balancing methods at the cost of a marginal reduction in energy production. If commercial electrolyzer ramp rates can be tripled, the system is able to operate without the need for any power balancing.</description></item><item><title>Real-World Scale Deployment of Hydrogen-Integrated Microgrid: Design and Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10571822</link><description>The development and utilization of hydrogen hold the potential to revolutionize new power systems by providing a clean and versatile energy carrier.

Addition of energy storage systems in an IBR power plant makes it feasible to have frequency control at the power plant level. While frequency control appears as a simple frequency-power droop control to adjust real power commands to inverter-level controls with measured frequency as an input, care must be taken to avoid interactions among the plant frequency control with communication delays, inverter-level control effects, and the frequency sensor, usually a phase-locked-loop (PLL). This paper present two types of interaction scenarios that makes frequency control design challenging. The first interaction scenario may occur if the frequency control's gain is large, while the second interaction scenario may occur at a small control gain if the plant-level PLL lacks sufficient damping. We contribute to the fundamental understanding of the causation of stability issues due to plant frequency control through the derivation of a simplified feedback system focusing on the frequency and power relationship, and the follow-up frequency-domain analysis for gaining insights. For validation, we also design a data-driven approach to obtain models from data generated from an electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation testbed. The findings from analysis have all been validated by EMT simulation. Finally, we contribute to mitigating strategies and also the understanding of the role of additional proportional integration power feedback control. This addition has been demonstrated as an efficient stability enhancement strategy to mitigate the effect of communication delay.</description></item><item><title>Differential Power Processing Based Control Framework for Multiple Battery Energy Storage Systems in DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10579077</link><description>Multiple battery energy storage systems (BESSs) have been widely used in the DC microgrids to balance generation and demand. To achieve this, the BESS converters need to deliver the full required input/output power imposed on BESSs under the conventional BESS-DC bus configuration, which often demands high power ratings for the converters, hence leads to high installation cost as well as high power losses. To reduce the power ratings for BESS converters while delivering the same power from BESSs, this paper proposes a new differential power processing (DPP) based control framework where the DPP techniques and BESSs are firstly combined without losing the following control objectives, namely, the accurate current-sharing and state of charge (SoC) balance of BESSs as well as DC bus voltage regulation. This is achieved first by introducing inverted bidirectional buck converters to function as a front-end converter and DPP converters. Then, a virtual state variable combining BESS output current and its SoC is proposed, based on which a consensus control strategy is proposed. The stability of the proposed DPP-based control framework is also analyzed. Finally, the real-time hardware-in-loop (HIL) tests confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control framework, showing that the proposed DPP-based control framework reduces the power ratings of the converters to less than 20 $\%$ of BESS converters used in conventional BESS-DC bus configuration even in the worst operating scenario, while delivering the same required power from BESSs, paving a way for an innovative BESS DC microgrid design with much down-sized converters for BESSs.</description></item><item><title>Replicating Power Flow Constraints Using Only Smart Meter Data for Coordinating Flexible Sources in Distribution Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10584114</link><description>The increasing integration of distributed energy resources necessitates effective coordination of flexible sources within distribution networks. Traditional model-based approaches require accurate topology and line parameters, which are often unavailable. Neural constraint replication can bypass this requirement, but it relies on complete nodal and branch measurements. However, in practice, only partial buses are monitored, while branches often remain unmeasured. To address this issue, this paper proposes a topology identification-incorporated neural constraint replication to replicate power flow constraints with only partial nodal measurements. Utilizing the additive property of line parameters, we develop a recursive bus elimination algorithm to recover topology and line impedance from power injection and voltage measurements on limited buses. We then estimate missing voltage and branch flow measurements based on the recovered model information. By combining observed and estimated measurements to construct training sets, we train neural networks to replicate voltage and branch flow constraints, which are subsequently reformulated into mixed-integer linear programming forms for efficient solving. Monte-Carlo simulations on various test systems demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed method, even with limited nodal measurements.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Power Tracking Performance and Small Signal Stability Analysis of Integrated Wind-to-Hydrogen System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10582460</link><description>To achieve the 2050 global climate target, offshore wind will increase to meet the growing demand of direct and indirect electrification (e.g. green hydrogen production for the hard-to-abate sector). To keep up with the rapid increase of offshore wind generation, the energy balancing challenges due to the intermittency nature of wind and the network congestion/capacity challenges resulting from structural network capacity planning latency are to be addressed with system integration technology. In this paper, it is proposed that the hydrogen electrolysis plant be co-located with the wind farm, where the power consumption is controlled to track the wind generation profile accurately to cancel the intermittency of wind generation, reduce the required grid connection capacity, and thereby avoid expensive grid expansion. However, this power tracking controller introduces a cross-plant feedback path from the wind farm to the hydrogen plant, posing challenges for partitioning the power tracking loop completely for stability analysis, which also makes it difficult to make a good trade-off between the tracking performance and stability margins. To address this issue, this paper proposes an equivalent transformation to eliminate the cross-plant feedback path. Then, the criteria for choosing the optimal partition method are proposed and examined for different types of partition methods, which are mathematically proven to be equivalent in terms of stability conditions but provide different insights. An optimal partition method is then proposed in this paper, which not only provides clear insight on the ideal and non-ideal power tracking performances but also can also identify the stability issues of different minor loops individually. Finally, the proposed optimal partition method and its valuable insights into power tracking performance and stability analysis are validated through time-domain simulations of a 180 MW integrated wind-to-hydrogen plant with a realistic complexity.</description></item><item><title>Toward on Rolling Optimal Dispatch Strategy Considering Alert Mechanism for Antarctic Electricity-Hydrogen-Heat Integrated Energy System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10582516</link><description>Renewable energy will be the important form of energy supply for future Antarctic scientific research station. This will complicate the dispatch of the Antarctic integrated energy system (IES), due to the harsh operation environment and diverse operation situation of the Antarctic system, especially for the problem of equipment outage caused by extreme weather. To cope with that, a rolling optimal dispatch method considering alert mechanism for Antarctic integrated energy system is proposed in this paper. First, the output of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is characterized by the feasible region and converted into a linear P-H-T model. By introducing the alert mechanism, a rolling optimal dispatch strategy is then established to ensure the security operation of the Antarctic integrated energy system. Furthermore, the normalized multiparametric disaggregation technology (NMDT) is presented to deal with the bilinear terms in dispatching formulation, in which a mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming (MIQCP) is converted into mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Finally, case study is verified on the actual Antarctic energy system. The results indicates that the proposed fuel cell P-H-T model can enhance the flexibility and economy of the operation system. Also the load shedding can be reduced during the emergency operation by developed optimal dispatch strategy, which improves the resilience of IES.</description></item><item><title>Improving Resiliency of Cyber-Dependent Power Distribution Network Using UAVs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10587086</link><description>Resiliency enhancement of the power distribution network (PDN) through restoration is paramount in the face of escalating natural disasters. State-of-the-art literature has centered on augmenting resiliency through network reconfiguration, along with the integration of renewable energy resources (RES) and mobile energy storage systems (MESS). However, these approaches often assume an intact communication infrastructure, a premise that fails to address the damage in the cyber or communication network (CN). This study introduces the integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for wireless communication in the aftermath of communication infrastructure damage. Motivated by this, a comprehensive mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem-based restoration framework is proposed, aiming to elevate PDN resiliency considering a cyber-dependent PDN. This approach encompasses network reconfiguration, MESS, and UAV integration. The proposed method's efficacy is evaluated through rigorous testing and validation on the cyber-dependent IEEE 33 bus system and IEEE 123 bus system. This work pioneers a holistic approach to PDN resiliency, considering communication challenges often overlooked.</description></item><item><title>Fault Current Limiting and Grid Code Compliance for Grid-Forming Inverters&#8212;Part I: Problem Statement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10589298</link><description>Grid-forming (GFM) inverters are controlled to directly regulate the voltage. A major challenge stemming from this control model is that sustaining the voltage during faults would require high currents&#8212;beyond the levels that an inverter can withstand. Various fault current limiting (FCL) methods have been developed in recent years for GFM inverter-based resources (IBRs). The theoretical analysis supported by detailed simulation studies in Part I of this paper investigates whether existing FCL methods for GFM inverters can be deemed feasible solutions for future IBR-centric power grids. The challenges revealed for the first time in this paper are multifaceted and depend on the type of the FCL method. The focus is not only on a GFM inverter's internal operation, but also on its impact on the grid and the practical requirements for grid integration of an IBR considering most recent grid codes. Part II of this paper will address these challenges.</description></item><item><title>Fault Current Limiting and Grid Code Compliance for Grid-Forming Inverters &#8212; Part II: Solution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10589281</link><description>Part I of this paper unveiled various shortcomings of existing fault current limiting (FCL) methods for grid-forming (GFM) inverters. Part II of this paper develops a new FCL method that overcomes these drawbacks. Additionally, the FCL method proposed in this paper follows the strict requirements of recent grid codes for the low-voltage ride-through mode of inverter-based resources (IBRs). This makes the exact response of GFM inverters during faults fully predictable. Such predictability is a prerequisite for the reliable design/setting of protection systems, operation, and planning of power grids with high penetration of IBRs. The paper uses PSCAD simulations to corroborate if the proposed method meets these objectives. It also uses simulation results to compare this new method with existing FCL solutions for GFM inverters.</description></item><item><title>Per-Phase Unsymmetrical Adaptive Derivative Optimized Droop for Mitigating Voltage Quality Issues of Unbalanced Islanded Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10589303</link><description>The proliferation of unbalanced linear and nonlinear loads in microgrids degrades the voltage quality at the inverter terminals, and thus, load terminals receive unbalanced and distorted voltages. To alleviate these voltage quality issues, this paper proposes a per-phase unsymmetrical adaptive derivative optimized droop control scheme for unbalanced islanded microgrids (UIMG). The proposed controller is coupled with a per-phase unsymmetrical virtual impedance (UVI) to mitigate the unbalance of the inverter-based UIMG. Additionally, a proportional multi-resonant (PMR) controller is adopted to compensate for the voltage distortion. To improve the UIMG dynamics response while changing the loading states, derivative terms of active and reactive powers are added to the proposed control. The derivative gains are adaptively updated with the change in the microgrid loading to achieve the desired transient response. The proposed scheme is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem to determine the per-phase unsymmetrical droop settings and UVI that fit different loading states simultaneously. Several case studies are designed to test the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme under different types of disturbances and operating conditions. The cases are conducted on the IEEE 34-bus benchmark power distribution feeder with a combination of unbalanced linear and nonlinear loads. Moreover, the proposed control is validated using real-time simulations carried out in OPAL-RT system. The results show that the proposed control scheme is capable of mitigating voltage quality issues by reducing the voltage unbalance factor and voltage distortion.</description></item><item><title>Design and Tank Testing of Reinforcement Learning Control for Wave Energy Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10592659</link><description>This paper introduces a model-free control strategy utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the electrical power generation of a point absorber wave energy converter (WEC). While model-based methods may suffer from control performance degradation due to modeling errors, such as inherent Coulomb-type friction, RL-based approaches are well-suited for the WEC environment, where system dynamics are complex or unknown. The strength lies in their ability to learn from interactions with the environment, bypassing the necessity for precise models. To enhance the control performance in electrical power generation, a control-oriented loss model is established, and a force penalty term is introduced into the reward function to avoid the WEC system operating in high-loss, low-efficiency regions. To further eliminate the reliance on wave information and improve applicability, an analysis is conducted to examine the contribution of each state feature to the training outcomes and a loss-considering and wave information-independent RL-based control scheme is developed. The RL-based controller is further validated on a point absorber WEC prototype in the wave tank experiment, demonstrating effective implementation and commendable performance in both regular and irregular waves.</description></item><item><title>Towards Improving Unit Commitment Economics: An Add-On Tailor for Renewable Energy and Reserve Predictions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10592660</link><description>Generally, day-ahead unit commitment (UC) is conducted in a predict-then-optimize process: it starts by predicting the renewable energy source (RES) availability and system reserve requirements; given the predictions, the UC model is then optimized to determine the economic operation plans. In fact, predictions within the process are raw. In other words, if the predictions are further tailored to assist UC in making the economic operation plans against realizations of the RES and reserve requirements, UC economics will benefit significantly. To this end, this paper presents a cost-oriented tailor of RES-and-reserve predictions for UC, deployed as an add-on to the predict-then-optimize process. The RES-and-reserve tailor is trained by solving a bi-level mixed-integer programming model: the upper level trains the tailor based on its induced operating cost; the lower level, given tailored predictions, mimics the system operation process and feeds the induced operating cost back to the upper level; finally, the upper level evaluates the training quality according to the fed-back cost. Through this training, the tailor learns to customize the raw predictions into cost-oriented predictions. Moreover, the tailor can be embedded into the existing predict-then-optimize process as an add-on, improving the UC economics. Lastly, the presented method is compared to traditional, binary-relaxing, neural network-based, stochastic, and robust methods.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive Controller of a Hybrid Storage System for Power Smoothing With Enlarged Battery Lifetime</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10596967</link><description>The volatility of grid-coupled photovoltaics can cause local voltage deviations, while the impact on frequency becomes obvious in isolated weak grids. Thus, a standalone battery is usually proposed for smoothing purposes. However, the frequent cycles and abrupt power variations shrink its life and impair control performance. To this end, this study introduces a controller for a hybrid system composed of a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) and a battery. The proposed method establishes an idling zone for battery to eliminate its short-term activity, while SMES handles any power mismatch. The zone limits are dynamically adjusted in case of power balance detection, while an adaptive saturation is applied to them for maximal SMES utilization and minimal battery degradation. When SMES current deviates from this zone, battery operates with an adaptive ramp rate (i.e., di/dt) depending on the state of charge of SMES, to further optimize its life. Additionally, to prevent unnecessary power circulation among SMES and battery, supervisory control loops are implemented. Finally, to evaluate this scheme against preceding controllers regarding battery life extension, a real-time approach is followed using a dedicated simulator, while a hardware-in-the-loop verification is presented using an actual controller.</description></item><item><title>Transient Stability of Synchronous Condenser Co-Located With Renewable Power Plants Under High-Resistance Faults and Risk Mitigation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10599822</link><description>Synchronous condensers (SynCons) are widely used in supporting the integration of renewable power plants (RPPs) in weak grids. However, recent research suggests that a SynCon co-located with RPPs may be prone to transient rotor angle instability due to the excessive active power injected by nearby RPPs during metallic faults. This paper further discovers that the transient stability of the SynCon may be lost even it generates electrical power during high-resistance faults. This novel mechanism of instability is investigated by deriving power-angle characteristics in different fault scenarios, and then the effect of the system parameters on the stability is analyzed via a proposed index based on the critical clearance time (CCT). It reveals that inappropriate parameters of SynCons, weak grid, and voltage support during fault ride-through (FRT) all contribute to such transient instability. To mitigate such instability, an adaptive FRT strategy is proposed. The electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations based on the PSCAD are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis and the proposed adaptive control strategy.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Chance Constrained Optimization Method for Risk-Based Routing and Scheduling of Shared Mobile Energy Storage System With Variable Renewable Energy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10599624</link><description>This paper proposes a pricing and scheduling method for shared mobile energy storage systems (SMSs) in coupled power distribution and transportation networks. Different from existing shared energy storage studies, which mostly focus on stationary resources, the paper investigates the SMS operation considering the negotiation of rental prices as well as mobility and charging/discharging among SMS owners and different users. Specifically, the SMS pricing and scheduling with variable renewable energy are established as a bilevel mixed-integer chance-constrained distributionally robust optimization problem. In the upper-level problem, the SMS owner determines pricing and day-ahead mobility strategy to maximize its payoff. In the lower-level problem, the SMS users, i.e., distribution grid operators, determine the SMS charging/discharging power according to the SMS day-ahead pricing results and intra-day distribution grid operation strategies for accommodating variable renewable energy. The distributionally robust chance constraint is designed to cope with the intra-day operational risk caused by the variability of renewable power generation. To cope with the solution difficulty in the proposed bilevel optimization problem, the chance constraint is reformulated as second-order cone constraints, which are further transformed into a set of linear constraints, and then the reformulated bilevel mixed-integer linear programming problem is decomposed and iteratively solved to avoid enumerating lower-level integer variables. Simulation results show that the utilization rate of SMS batteries is increased and the excess renewable power is fully consumed when SMSs are shared among different distribution grids. The proposed distributionally robust optimization achieves higher revenue for the SMS owner and smaller operating costs of distribution grids than robust optimization under uncertain environments.</description></item><item><title>Reliability Indexes for Variable Energy Resource Generation in IEEE Standard 762-2023</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10602780</link><description>IEEE Standard Definitions for Use in Reporting Electric Generating Unit Reliability, Availability, and Productivity has recently been revised to extend the standard to variable energy resource (VER) generating facilities.

Thus, an adjustable robust tri-level defender-attacker-defender (ART-DAD) model is proposed to improve the resilience of power systems by hardening critical transmission lines. The proposed ART-DAD model considers both uncertain attacks and uncertain wind power output, which provides meaningful insights into the resilience improvement of power systems that involve uncertainties. More specifically, the proposed defense model integrates dynamic N-K criterion for attack budgets and the polyhedral uncertainty set for wind power output to develop resilient line hardening strategies. The proposed defense model can be formulated as a mixed integer tri-level programming problem that is decoupled into a master and sub-problem. Then, a constraint-generation based solution algorithm is proposed to solve the overall ART-DAD model with a master and sub-problem scheme. Simulation results on IEEE RTS-79 and RTS-96 systems validate the effectiveness of the proposed resilience improving strategy.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Multi-Mode Single-Step Power Tracking for Microinverter-Based Photovoltaic System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10612237</link><description>The conventional de-load power tracking algorithm, utilizing a perturb and observe method, manifests deficiencies in terms of speed, stability, and efficacy in identifying operating points within the inverter's voltage range.

However, existing data-driven methods cannot be applied to new wind farms due to the lack of operational data. This paper presents a novel Bayesian deep learning-based adaptive wind farm power prediction (BDL-AWFPP) method, which is the first time to utilize the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation results as the prior of BDL-based method, thus avoiding the problem that data-driven approaches cannot be applied to newly constructed wind farms. Firstly, a CFD-based wind farm numerical simulation database and a wind turbine power curve database are established to construct a multi-source heterogeneous prior dataset. Then, the BDL-AWFPP model is proposed to utilize the multi-source heterogeneous prior dataset, which can be updated adaptively with newly acquired operational data and saved periodically throughout the life cycle. And an auxiliary aging assessment method for wind turbines is also developed according to the periodically-saved models. Finally, a stochastic variational inference (SVI)-based parameter updating algorithm is derived for the proposed BDL-AWFPP model. Case studies on an actual wind farm validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Net-Zero Scheduling of Multi-Energy Building Energy Systems: A Learning-Based Robust Optimization Approach With Statistical Guarantees</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10620675</link><description>Buildings produce a significant share of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, making homes and businesses a major factor in climate change. To address this critical challenge, this paper explores achieving net-zero emission through the carbon-aware optimal scheduling of the multi-energy building integrated energy systems (BIES). We integrate advanced technologies and strategies, such as the carbon capture system (CCS), power-to-gas (P2G), carbon tracking, and emission allowance trading, into the traditional BIES scheduling problem. The proposed model enables accurate accounting of carbon emissions associated with building energy systems and facilitates the implementation of low-carbon operations. Furthermore, to address the challenge of accurately assessing uncertainty sets related to forecasting errors of loads, generation, and carbon intensity, we develop a learning-based robust optimization approach for BIES that is robust in the presence of uncertainty and guarantees statistical feasibility. The proposed approach comprises a shape learning stage and a shape calibration stage to generate an optimal uncertainty set that ensures favorable results from a statistical perspective. Numerical studies conducted based on both synthetic and real-world datasets have demonstrated that the approach yields up to 8.2% cost reduction, compared with conventional methods, in assisting buildings to robustly reach net-zero emissions.</description></item><item><title>Deriving Sufficient Conditions for Exact Relaxation of Complementarity Constraints in Optimization Problems With Energy Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10629239</link><description>Energy storage is becoming increasingly important in power and energy systems. However, its strongly nonconvex complementarity constraints, which prevent simultaneous charging or discharging behavior, hinder its application in optimization-based decision making. One remedy is to relax these constraints, but the existing relaxation methods are specific to power system applications with limited universality. To bridge this gap, we provide a methodology to derive the general form of sufficient conditions for the exact relaxation of a general energy storage-concerned optimization problem (ESCOP). Specific sufficient conditions for a wide range of ESCOPs can be easily accessed via the proposed methodology. This paper provides mathematical proofs and analyses of the proposed conditions, where sufficient conditions obtained from specific forms of ESCOPs are numerically validated to guarantee exact relaxation and significantly improve the ESCOP solution efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Joint Electricity and Carbon Sharing With PV and Energy Storage: A Low-Carbon DR-Based Game Theoretic Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10623777</link><description>This paper proposes a joint electricity and carbon sharing framework with photovoltaic (PV) and energy storage system (ESS) for deep decarbonization, allowing distributed PV prosumers to participate in a sharing network established by aggregator of prosumers (AOP). The ESS-equipped AOP plays multiple roles as a carbon aggregator, an ESS operator, and an energy-sharing provider at the same time. First, a demand response (DR)-based model that incorporates the multi-strategy of ESS is proposed to optimize energy-carbon transaction. A low-carbon DR with consideration of electricity-carbon coupling is developed to incentivize prosumers to adjust consumption behavior for costs and emissions reduction. Second, a joint optimization based on Stackelberg game is proposed, where AOP is leader, and prosumers act as followers. A dynamic pricing mechanism is proposed for AOP to determine the electricity-carbon coupled selling and buying prices simultaneously. Meanwhile, prosumers would adjust their energy consumption as response to different sharing prices. In addition, a distributed optimization algorithm with interactions is used to reach the Stackelberg game equilibrium. Finally, through a practical testing case, the effectiveness of the method is validated in terms of economic benefits and PV sharing enhancement, as well as the reduction of carbon emissions.</description></item><item><title>Cooperative Planning of Multi-Energy System and Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10631701</link><description>Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) can play critical roles in transitioning to global net-zero emissions. However, existing works only focus on small-scale or local CO2 utilization. For the first time, this paper proposes a cooperative planning model of multi-energy system and CCUS considering the regional CO2 availability. In this model, the multi-energy system and CCUS are coupled through interconnected energy hubs. To leverage its inherent operational dispatchability and flexibility, the physicochemical and thermo-electrochemical processes of CCUS are mathematically formulated with source-sink matching analysis. The multi-energy planning is a demanding optimization challenge owing to its inherent nonconvexities and substantial energy-interest couplings. The original problem is firstly relaxed as mixed integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) to ensure satisfactory computational efficiency. A carbon-oriented bargaining problem can then be reformulated to share the cooperative surplus, which is further decomposed into a joint investment/operation subproblem and a cost-sharing subproblem. The proposed methodology is benchmarked over interconnected energy hub systems to show its effectiveness and superiority in technical, economic, and environmental aspects.</description></item><item><title>Semi-Peer-to-Peer Safety Coordination Control for Distributed Battery Energy Storage System in DC Microgrids via Saturated Limitation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10631704</link><description>This paper presents a semi-peer coordination control strategy to ensure the bus voltage stability and effectively constrain the power trajectory, thereby mitigating safety concerns arising from excessive unit power and communication failures in distributed battery energy storage systems (DBESS) based DC microgrids. Firstly, the primary controller is employed a saturated feedforward design to maintain bus voltage stability and address the excessive part of power allocation with droop control. The saturation results enable flexible switching of the reference state, allowing energy storage units (ESUs) to autonomously transition between voltage tracking and power tracking modes. Secondly, the dual-dynamic power allocation strategy is introduced with distributed consensus and saturation allocation.The power allocation with distributed consensus aims to achieve synchronous proportional charging and discharging for SOC balancing. For the offline ESUs of communication failures, saturation power allocation is designed with arrived operation point to avoid the over-utilization of offline ESUs. To address potential communication failures in offline ESUs, the saturation power allocation strategy based on the current operational point is devised to mitigate the risk of over-utilization of offline ESUs. Finally, simulations and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>An Equitable Active Power Curtailment Framework for Overvoltage Mitigation in PV-Rich Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10636072</link><description>There are various active power curtailment (APC) approaches to mitigate overvoltage. In PV-rich networks, the overvoltage happens to be especially at the end of the distribution feeders. While APC helps maintain voltage within operational limits, it results in varying degrees of renewable curtailment for each prosumer. This curtailment increases as the distance from the transformer grows. Hence, these approaches introduce unfairness among prosumers. This study proposes an equitable APC (EAPC) based on the prosumer's self-consumption rate (SCR). The method calculates each prosumer's SCR, compares it with the precalculated critical SCR, and calculates a fair share of curtailment for each prosumer. Subsequently, leveraging the voltage sensitivity matrix obtained from the inverse of the Jacobian matrix, the new active power injection at the point of common coupling (PCC) is calculated to mitigate the overvoltage. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, a comparison with three other methods is presented under various PV penetration levels. The proposed EAPC is less sensitive to the prosumer's location and improves fairness among prosumers. In addition, a battery deployment scenario is analysed considering the annual supply and demand balance to suppress the extra curtailment introduced by EAPC without increasing the battery capacity.</description></item><item><title>Shape Optimization of a Point Absorber Wave Energy Converter for Reduced Current Drag and Improved Wave Energy Capture Using Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638322</link><description>The shape of the floating buoy of a point absorber wave energy converter (WEC) plays a crucial role in both wave energy harvesting and current drag reduction. In this study, an approach to optimizing the buoy hull geometry with a neural network that replaces the hydrodynamic analysis software is presented, aimed at reducing the ocean current drag force while improving wave energy captured. A new parametric model is introduced to describe the complex shape of the buoy by utilizing the control points of non-uniform rational b-splines. A neural network is developed to significantly reduce the computational time compared to traditional hydrodynamic simulation methods. The optimal hull shape of the buoy is determined by solving an optimization problem using a genetic algorithm, a global optimization technique. The results of the case studies show that the optimal buoy hull shape reduces 68.7% and 71.1% of the current drag, and 50% of mooring line forces compared to the cylinder-shaped buoy and the optimal-power-shaped hull from literature. The optimal buoy hull shape increases the wave energy extraction by 46.1% compared to the thin-ship-shaped buoy but performs 21.1% worse than the optimal-power-shaped hull from the literature.</description></item><item><title>Electric Energy Maximization for Oscillating Water Column Wave Energy Systems Using a Receding-Horizon Pseudospectral Control Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10636763</link><description>Among the various wave energy technologies, oscillating water columns (OWCs) have shown some of the greatest promise, due to their simplicity of operation and possibility for shore mounting, with consequent ease of access and integration with other infrastructure, such as breakwaters. To minimize the levelized cost of energy, OWC energy capture must be maximized. To date, most focus has been on maximizing air turbine efficiency, while neglecting other aspects of the system. This paper presents an integrated wave-to-wire optimal control approach, considering the OWC hydrodynamics, turbine characteristics, and generator. The approach is based on a receding-horizon pseudospectral formulation, which transcribes the continuous-time optimal control problem into a finite-dimensional nonlinear program. The results show optimal exploitation of the hydrodynamic, aerodynamic, and electric subsystem efficiency characteristics, surpassing the electric energy production available through a specific focus on turbine efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Comparative Evaluation of Converter Control Impact on Torsional Dynamics of Type-IV Grid-Forming Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10637722</link><description>This paper explores the impact of back-to-back converter control strategies on the torsional dynamics of grid-forming permanent magnet synchronous generator wind turbines (GFM-WTs). Two general converter control methods for GFM-WTs, distinguished by the placement of dc-link voltage control (DVC)&#8211;either in the machine-side converter or the grid-side converter, are evaluated through the complex torque coefficient method to offer a theoretical basis. It reveals that a negative damping is introduced when the DVC is with the machine-side converter. Then, to further characterize the parametric impacts of electrical and mechanical system constants and controller gains, the sensitivity analysis is performed by employing the partial derivative algorithm, which is based on the feedforward neural network training. It is found that the converter control has a limited impact on the damped frequency in both GFM converter control methods. Finally, electromagnetic simulations based on full-order nonlinear models of GFM-WTs are carried out to confirm the theoretical findings.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive Transfer Learning Framework for Data-Scarce HVAC Power Consumption Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10637762</link><description>Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems constitute a large proportion of building energy consumption and provide considerable potential for power grid regulation. While the HVAC power consumption forecasting task is generally straightforward with sufficient historical data, it becomes challenging when dealing with scarce data. Such situation is common in cases of intermittent data collection or early system implementations, where precise forecasting is required despite limited data available. Considering accessible datasets from nearby or similar HVAC systems through energy management systems, this paper proposes an adaptive transfer learning framework to tackle this issue. Specifically, the framework leverages diverse source domains, employing model-level regularizers to quantify domain discrepancies and an adaptive parameter regulation mechanism to dynamically align source domains with the target domain. Embedded within the framework, a unique deep learning architecture with attention mechanisms is proposed, capable of identifying complex temporal patterns and hierarchical features in HVAC systems. Experiments on public HVAC datasets demonstrate the generalization, accuracy and robustness of our methodology under diverse data-scarce scenarios.</description></item><item><title>A Novel GAN Architecture Reconstructed Using Bi-LSTM and Style Transfer for PV Temporal Dynamics Simulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10601515</link><description>The stochastic production simulation of photovoltaic (PV) power is crucial for the analysis of power balance in power planning, annual or monthly operational planning, and long-term transactions in the electricity market, especially in power systems with a high share of PVs.

However, existing LFO analyses lack the consideration of microgrids&#8217; required rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) and steady-state active power-frequency (P-f) characteristics when designing the VSG&#8217;s inertia and damping. With these practical considerations, this paper reveals that the interactions between VSGs can cause significant LFOs, posing a threat to the microgrid&#8217;s stability. In contrast, the LFOs related to the interactions between SGs are less pronounced. To this end, a distributed LFO damping (DLFOD) control is proposed to suppress the LFOs between VSGs from two aspects: the adjustment of the VSG&#8217;s phase angle mitigates the uneven instantaneous active power sharing, while the adjustment of the VSG&#8217;s active power setpoint enhances the mutual damping. Compared with existing methods, the proposed DLFOD control 1) pertains to multi-bus microgrids, 2) guarantees the RoCoF and steady-state P-f characteristics, and 3) possesses a linear structure. Furthermore, a dynamic switching variable is devised to handle the disconnection and reconnection of communication links or VSGs, which enables the DLFOD control to remain partially functional during these interruptions. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated through theoretical analysis, real-time simulations, and experiments.</description></item><item><title>Parameter Boundary Characterization for DC Microgrid Islanding Detection Based on Time-Domain Voltage Oscillation Trajectory Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10571933</link><description>Unintentional islanding events cause potential threats to the safety of dc microgrids. Selected frequency islanding detection is considered a promising technology thanks to its good power quality and high detection accuracy. However, the conventional frequency-domain-based islanding detection parameter boundary cannot consider the impact of detection time, which causes a quite slow detection speed and thus leads to detection failure. To overcome this obstacle, a linear model of the islanding dc system is developed first to analyze the steady-state response of the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC). On top of that, the components of the islanding system characteristic equation are analyzed based on modal analysis, which lays a good foundation for simplifying the time-domain response model of the PCC voltage. Then, the oscillation trajectory of the PCC voltage triggered by the islanding event is characterized in the time domain, which facilitates the analysis and calculation of islanding detection time. Furthermore, the boundary of the islanding detection parameters considering the detection time effect is accurately depicted to guide the resonator design. In this manner, the effect of resonant parameters on the detection time can be evaluated visually while the fast detection speed is also ensured. Finally, the proposed method is validated in simulations and hardware-in-loop experiments.</description></item><item><title>Research on Generic Diagnostic Methods for Short-Circuit Faults in AC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10580987</link><description>Micro grid fault of rapid detection and removal is the key to ensure its reliability. With the access of many distributed generations (DG) to the system, the characteristics of short-circuit faults of microgrids in grid-connected and islanded modes have changed, and the traditional protection methods can no longer be applied to both operating modes of microgrids simultaneously. Due to the advantages of wavelet energy spectrum in the identification of the mutation characteristics of the weak signal as well as that of neural network in the location accuracy, this paper proposes a short circuit fault detection and protection method in AC microgrids. The method takes the current at the detection point as the object of analysis, uses the wavelet energy spectrum transform to analyze the current waveforms under normal and fault operation states, and extracts the fault characteristic quantities. At the same time, considering the effect of transition resistance, a generalized fault area identification model for both grid-connected and islanded modes is established by using a neural network algorithm. Simulation and experimental results show that this method can realize accurate judgment and area location of short-circuit faults in different modes, different DG capacities, different fault types and different fault regions.</description></item><item><title>A Comprehensive Review of High-Frequency AC Microgrids for Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10586271</link><description>Continuous advancements in distributed generation, energy storage, electric vehicles, and industrial modernization have forced the electrical distribution system to operate efficiently and controllably. To address these challenges, in addition to ensuring efficient bidirectional power flow while minimizing power losses, a comprehensive grid restructuring is crucial. The deployment of a high-frequency AC (HFAC) microgrid has emerged as a feasible solution, offering the potential to establish a reliable and efficient energy supply that aligns with the demands of the current distribution landscape. This necessitates thorough planning and operational assessments. However, parallel operations of the current HFAC involve multiple power conversion stages. This review outlines insights, challenges, opportunities, and recommendations for future HFAC research directions. The practical feasibility of the HFAC microgrid is tested on a typical IEEE-33 bus system in MATLAB/Simulink by incorporating AC-AC converters and their switching modulation techniques. The promising simulation results and existing research demonstrate that the HFAC microgrid architecture works well, illustrates the need and benefits in the context of the distribution system compared with the existing traditional system, and has possibilities for further extension with multiple case studies. This review can serve as a substantial foundation for researchers in HFAC microgrids to pave the way for promoting energy efficiency to unprecedented heights.</description></item><item><title>A Global Optimal Benchmark for Energy Management of Microgrid (GoBuG) Integrating Hybrid Energy Storage System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10614145</link><description>This paper proposes a general benchmark for evaluating online/real-time energy management strategies (EMS) for microgrids (uG) supported by hybrid energy storage systems (HESS). A multi-objective optimal control problem with multiple control/state variables, multiple control/state constraints, and multiple boundary conditions is introduced to reduce power losses, prevent the HESS from oscillations, and increase source lifespan, which is handled by using an alternative Pontryagin&#8217;s minimum principle and inheriting finite difference methods. On that foundation, the multi-objective Global optimal Benchmark for uG (referred to as GoBuG) is constructed and assessed via several numerical scenarios, including a real case study of a uG located in B&#7841;ch Long V&#297; island, Vi&#7879;t Nam. The assessment shows that GoBuG is tens of times faster than conventional methods like dynamic programming when computing EMS in the islanded uG with a single battery ESS. Moreover, for uG consisting of HESSs, while dynamic programming is unable to provide solutions, GoBuG remains superior with high accuracy, reliability, and speedy computation. With its superior performance, the proposed GoBuG is therefore compatible with benchmarking purposes for general uG systems.</description></item><item><title>An Improved Probe Power Unit (PPU)-Based Fault Location Estimation in Low-Voltage DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10553240</link><description>Good accuracy in estimating the exact fault location in low-voltage DC microgrids (LVDC MGs) reduces the time for fault restoration, power outage and maintenance.

This paper proposes a parametric estimation-based fault location using a more accurate computation of the natural oscillating frequency. The proposed algorithm considers the advantage of both time as well as frequency domain analysis. Peak fittings of the probe current in time domain and exact resonating frequency in the Fourier magnitude spectrum, are used to find out the accurate natural oscillating frequency of the fault path. The proposed fault location technique is tested for various fault conditions of the LVDC network on MATLAB/Simulink environment and provides improved performance even in presence of noise in the measured probe current. The proposed algorithm is found to be robust for different line parameters and network topology of the LVDC network, ensuring an accurate and reliable protection measure for the LVDC network.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Voltage Control to Coordinate Multiple PV Inverters as a Cluster</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10582911</link><description>Dynamic voltage support is a critical ancillary service in electric power networks, and with the increasing penetration of inverter-based renewable energy resources such as solar photovoltaics (PV), utilizing their idle capacity to provide dynamic voltage support is becoming indispensable.

Based solely on the measured input/output data of the controlled system, the proposed method dynamically linearizes the controlled system through online identification. Subsequently, a data-driven cooperative adaptive controller is designed to coordinate multiple PV inverters as a cluster. The method can effectively regulate the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC) of the controlled PV cluster with adaptability to system changes. The stability of the proposed control method is theoretically clarified. Numerical simulation using MATLAB/Simulink shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Coordinated Islanding Partition and Scheduling Strategy for Service Restoration of Active Distribution Networks Considering Minimum Sustainable Duration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10609444</link><description>This paper presents a coordinated islanding partition and scheduling strategy for service restoration of active distribution networks (ADNs) to maximize weighted restored energy considering the minimum sustainable duration (MSD) of controllable islands (CIs). To avoid the forming of uncontrollable islands, the concept of dominated buses is proposed and integrated into the topological model of ADNs for islanding partition. The co-optimization of mobile distributed generator (MDG) dispatch and dominated bus identification is carried out to accelerate the restoration process. The MSD of CIs is explicitly modeled, and the CIs are scheduled in a risk-adjusted way, whose conservatism can be adjusted by controlling the predefined risk confidence level. Interruptible loads are considered as flexible resources in the islanding partition strategy considering the effects of the MSD of CIs. To improve the practicability of the presented method, time-varying power demands and distributed renewable generation outputs are incorporated into the presented framework. The studied problem is formulated as a mixed-integer second-order cone programming model, which can be efficiently solved by commercial solvers. Finally, a modified version of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company 69-bus distribution system, a practical medium-voltage distribution system in Denmark, and a modified IEEE 123-bus distribution system are employed to demonstrate the performance of the developed model.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Risk-Averse Optimal Dispatch for Integrated Power and Transportation System Considering Carbon Trading</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10556757</link><description>With the global climate change, the significance of carbon emission reduction is widely recognized. As an effective tool for emission reduction, carbon trading needs to be considered in the operation of the integrated power and transportation system (IPTS). This paper proposes a distributed risk-averse optimal dispatch scheme for IPTS considering carbon trading. First, a carbon trading framework for IPTS is developed, in which the microgrids (MGs) within the power distribution system (PDS) and the electric vehicle agent (EVA) of the transportation system (TS) jointly participate in the carbon trading market. Furthermore, the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) method is used in the proposed scheme to manage the risks arising from diverse uncertainties, including power load, renewable power generation, traffic demand, and carbon price. To protect the privacy of the PDS and TS and improve computational performance, the spectral penalty parameter based alternating direction method of multipliers (S-ADMM) distributed solution method is developed to solve the IPTS dispatch model. Numerical results on two test systems illustrate the economic and carbon reduction benefits, risk management ability, and computational performance of the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>Supervised Optimization Framework for Charging and Discharging Controls of Battery Energy Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10561610</link><description>Although residential houses have widely adopted battery energy storage (BES) in conjunction with solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, it has been challenging to optimize BES controls owing to the uncertainty inherent in electricity prices, renewable energy resources, and electricity demand loads. The main objective of this study is to propose a supervised optimization (SO) framework designed to enable supervised learning to infer efficient BES operations in conjunction with mathematical optimization. Based on the proposed SO framework, a mathematical optimization model is formulated and solved to generate optimal charging and discharging controls given historical data in an offline optimization fashion. Then, a supervised learning model can be trained based on the optimal charging and discharging controls to infer efficient BES charging and discharging controls in an online optimization fashion. Specifically, an objective function and constraints driven by the mathematical optimization model are reflected in the course of training and inferring by supervised learning models so that the SO framework can infer feasible and efficient BES controls. Numerical experiments are conducted with data collected from a residential community in Texas, and the results reveal that the proposed SO framework results in better performance compared to the benchmark model, such as reinforcement learning and model predictive control.</description></item><item><title>Asynchronous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-Based Framework for Bi-Level Noncooperative Game-Theoretic Demand Response</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10566880</link><description>Demand response (DR) is proposed to address the uncertainty of distributed energy resources (DER) and energy storage systems in distribution networks. However, current research neglects the temporal relationships and the noncooperative relationship of demand response participants. A novel bi-level non-cooperative Stackelberg-Nash dynamic game-theoretic framework is proposed in this paper, specifically designed to address the issue of overlooking consumers&#8217; interests and temporal relationships of participant actions in traditional demand response frameworks. Within this innovative framework, an asynchronous multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed and named as Stackelberg-Nash multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm (SN-MAPPO). SN-MAPPO allows utility company (UC) and consumers to maximize their utilities within the proposed framework, ultimately leading to the convergence of UC and consumers&#8217; strategies to Stackelberg-Nash equilibrium. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, simulations are conducted using authentic data, involving one UC and eight power consumers. Simulation results confirm that the proposed demand response mechanism, while safeguarding consumers&#8217; benefits, fosters the integration of distributed energy resource and effectively mitigates load fluctuations.</description></item><item><title>Eliminating Distribution Network Congestion Based on Spatial-Temporal Migration of Multiple Base Stations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10571587</link><description>The integration of high proportions of distributed energy resources and the soaring development of 5G base stations (BSs) could lead to operational issues such as grid congestion in distribution networks. Meanwhile, 5G BSs can also serve as the flexible resources to support the distribution network. In this regard, this paper proposes a novel method to eliminate distribution network congestion with spatial-temporal migration of multiple base stations (BSs). First, the collaborative structure of the distribution network operator (DNO) and mobile network operator (MNO) is presented and the event-driven congestion management framework of the distribution network with multiple BSs is illustrated. Secondly, the specific spatial-temporal migration models of multiple BSs are established, which contain traffic migration, BS sleeping, and dispatchable capacity of the BS backup energy storage system.

Finally, the modified IEEE 33-node and IEEE 123-node distribution system are adopted for case studies, from numerical analysis we can draw that, the proposed congestion management method can alleviate the congestion issue of the distribution network effectively while reducing costs of both DNO and MNO.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Preserved Aggregate Thermal Dynamic Model of Buildings</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10577505</link><description>The thermal inertia of buildings brings considerable flexibility to the heating and cooling load, which is known to be a promising demand response resource. The aggregate model that can describe the thermal dynamics of the building cluster is an important interference for energy systems to exploit its intrinsic thermal inertia. However, the private information of users, such as the indoor temperature and heating/cooling power, needs to be collected in the parameter estimation procedure to obtain the aggregate model, causing severe privacy concerns. In light of this, we propose a novel privacy-preserved parameter estimation approach to infer the aggregate model for the thermal dynamics of the building cluster for the first time. Using it, the parameters of the aggregate thermal dynamic model (ATDM) can be obtained by the load aggregator without accessing the individual&#8217;s privacy information. More specifically, this method not only exploits the block coordinate descent (BCD) method to resolve its non-convexity in the estimation but investigates the transformation-based encryption (TE) and the secure aggregation protocol (SAP) methods to realize privacy-preserved computation. Its capability of preserving privacy is also theoretically proven. Finally, simulation results using real-world data demonstrate the accuracy and privacy-preserved performance of our proposed method.</description></item><item><title>POMDP-Based Dispatch Scheme for Residential Distributed Energy Resources Under Customer Fatigue Consideration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10577471</link><description>With rapidly growing penetration of renewable energy, there is an increasing need for real-time balance in the power system. In recent years, as a vital component of the end user side, residential distributed energy resources (RDER) have shown promising prospects in demand response (DR). This paper addresses the RDER optimal dispatch problem from an online learning perspective. The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and the logistic regression model are employed to describe how the DR service contractor learns the uncertain response model of the customer affected by the fatigue and recovery effect. A non-stationary combinatorial multi-armed bandit paradigm is applied to dispatch RDER. In addition, we use the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) technique to estimate the customer&#8217;s unobservable states. Through simulations based on public datasets, our proposed Greedy-MLE and CUCB-MLE policies for dispatch decision-making outperform existing methods in relative power adjustment mismatch, collective fatigue, and cumulative regret. The simulation results highlight the benefits of the proposed RDER dispatch approach in ensuring customer satisfaction, service quality, and economic efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Robust Coordinated Planning of Multi-Region Integrated Energy Systems With Categorized Demand Response</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10606443</link><description>In this paper, categorized demand response (DR) programs are proposed to address the coordinated planning problem in multi-region integrated energy systems (MRIESs). The categorized DR programs comprise a discrete manufacturing production model for industrial areas, a real-time pricing-based DR program for commercial areas, and diverse operational tasks for various electrical appliances in residential areas. Subsequently, the detailed DR model is leveraged to minimize the operation cost and gas emissions in a renewable-integrated MRIES considering the uncertainties from wind and solar power. Then, a flexible adjustable robust optimization (FARO) approach is presented to deal with all uncertainty sources. The FARO approach aims to ensure the safe operation of the MRIES against any uncertainty while meeting predefined performance objectives. Furthermore, a bi-level solution algorithm is designed by combining the stochastic dichotomy method and the column-and-constraint generation (C&amp;amp;CG) algorithm to solve our coordinated planning model. Finally, case studies are conducted on a practical MRIES in Changsha, China. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the categorized DR programs in adjusting allocable resources to maximize holistic system profits. Besides, compared to the commonly used information-gap decision theory (IGDT) method, our FARO approach can maintain the optimality of the solution while reducing conservatism.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Frequency Control of Heterogeneous Energy Storage Systems Considering Short-Term Ability and Long-Term Flexibility</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10659173</link><description>Renewable energy sources introduce more fluctuations into the power system and bring challenges to maintain the system stability. Conventional generation units are gradually replaced and may soon become inadequate to meet the frequency regulation (FR) requirements. Consequently, demand-side resources for FR have received increasing attention. Among demand-side sources, inverter air conditioners (IACs) have huge regulation capacity and account for nearly 40% of the total power consumption in summer, while energy storage systems (ESSs) excel in rapid response and powerful ramp rate. However, the inadequate ramp speed of IACs and the insufficient regulation capacity of ESSs render them incapable of providing FR independently. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a distributed coordinated control algorithm that allows the effective utilization of ESSs and IACs to provide FR considering the respective advantages. Firstly, an equivalent thermal energy storage model of IAC in alignment with ESS is introduced considering heterogeneous parameters. Subsequently, a coordinated control framework is proposed for heterogeneous ESSs (hetero-ESSs), which are composed of ESSs and IACs. Based on the framework, a distributed consensus algorithm is devised for hetero-ESSs, and its stability is demonstrated through the application of the Lyapunov theorem. Finally, numerical studies verify that the proposed framework can promote ESSs&#8217; short-term ability and IACs&#8217; long-term flexibility.</description></item><item><title>Alleviating the Curse of Dimensionality in Minkowski Sum Approximations of Storage Flexibility</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10576684</link><description>Many real-world applications require the joint optimization of a large number of flexible devices over time. The flexibility of, e.g., multiple batteries, thermostatically controlled loads, or electric vehicles can be used to support grid operation and to reduce operation costs. Using piecewise constant power values, the flexibility of each device over d time periods can be described as a polytopic subset in power space. The aggregated flexibility is given by the Minkowski sum of these polytopes. As the computation of Minkowski sums is in general demanding, several approximations have been proposed in the literature. Yet, their application potential is often objective-dependent and limited by the curse of dimensionality. We show that up to  $2^{d}$  vertices of each polytope can be computed efficiently and that the convex hull of their sums provides a computationally efficient inner approximation of the Minkowski sum. Via an extensive simulation study, we illustrate that our approach outperforms ten state-of-the-art inner approximations in terms of computational complexity and accuracy for different objectives. Moreover, we propose an efficient disaggregation method applicable to any vertex-based approximation. The proposed methods provide an efficient means to aggregate and to disaggregate energy storages in quarter-hourly periods over an entire day with reasonable accuracy for aggregated cost and for peak power optimization.</description></item><item><title>Continuous Approximate Dynamic Programming Algorithm to Promote Multiple Battery Energy Storage Lifespan Benefit in Real-Time Scheduling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10586215</link><description>This paper aims to promote the lifespan benefit of multiple battery energy storage (BES) in real-time scheduling.

Numerical analysis demonstrates the validity of the proposed scheduling model, and superior computation tractability and solution optimality of the proposed PLFC-ADP algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Attention-Enhanced Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Against Observation Perturbations for Distributed Volt-VAR Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10587051</link><description>The cloud-edge collaboration architecture has been widely adopted for distributed Volt-VAR control (VVC) problems in active distribution networks (ADNs). To alleviate the computation and communication burden on edge sides, centralized training &amp; decentralized execution (CTDE) based multi-agent reinforcement learning methods have been proposed. However, the performance of these methods relies heavily on the agents&#8217; coordination mechanism and accurate observations. Given access to a vast amount of distributed energy resources, it becomes increasingly challenging to achieve efficient coordination within CTDE framework. Furthermore, the agents&#8217; observations always involve perturbations such as measurement noises and even cyber-attacks in real-world ADNs, which can significantly degrade the distributed VVC performance and may cause severe security issues. In this paper, we propose an attention-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning method to address observation perturbations for distributed VVC. In our proposed method, a mix network on the cloud platform with an agent-level attention mechanism is used to approximate the global reward, successfully capturing the intercorrelations between agents and achieving excellent coordination. A novel robust regularizer is also designed to enhance the agents&#8217; robustness facing the observation perturbations, which greatly improves the applicability of reinforcement learning methods.

Access to this granular metering data raises privacy concerns, hindering global adoption of the smart grid. Aggregation-based frameworks aim to address these concerns, but suffer from several limitations such as, a high computational overhead on smart meters, architectural complexity, and vulnerability to single points of compromise. Distributed aggregation-based frameworks show promise, but often assume an unrealistic semi-honest threat model, a lack of integrity verification capabilities for metering data, and dynamic billing (Time Of Use) capabilities. This paper introduces a distributed framework in a malicious setting that provides integrity verification of metering data while preserving customer privacy. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed framework is the first attempt to include integrity verification capabilities of metering data and dynamic billing in a distributed data collection setting while considering a malicious adversary. A proof of concept demonstrates our proposed framework&#8217;s viability and performance against other frameworks. Our framework is shown to be lightweight on smart meters, resilient to cyberattacks, and more efficient, compared to competing techniques in the literature.</description></item><item><title>A Semi-Decentralized Real-Time Charging Scheduling Scheme for Large EV Parking Lots Considering Uncertain EV Arrival and Departure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10580944</link><description>Developing large commercial electric vehicle (EV) parking lots to support the rapid EV adoption arouses interest in optimizing their real-time charging schedules with enhanced economic efficiency. This problem has been studied in literature via fully centralized or decentralized schemes, i.e., EV charging schedules are solely determined by the parking lot central operator or individual chargers, confronting the dilemma of scalability and parking-lot-wise economic optimality. This paper studies a semi-decentralized real-time charging scheduling scheme, in which the central operator and individual chargers collaborate to achieve optimal EV charging schedules. Specifically, the central operator uses a chance-constrained model to estimate aggregate charging energy needs in a rolling process at a coarse time granularity, while considering uncertainties of aggregate arrival and departure EV charging demands via a Gaussian mixture model; with the estimated aggregate charging energy, the central operator further calculates charging energy references of individual chargers regarding their distinct charging urgency and discharging availability; each charger finally determines the actual charging power by leveraging the charging dynamics, EV departure uncertainty scenarios, and charging energy reference at a fine time granularity. The economics and efficiency of the proposed scheme are evaluated by comparing it to various forms of fully centralized schemes via numerical simulations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme, with proper settings on the charging urgency factor, time granularity, and discount factor, significantly enhances efficiency in the minute-wise charging scheduling of large-scale EVs at the slight cost of compromised revenue.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Method for Estimating Inertia of a PV-Integrated Power Grid for Enhanced Security</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10592076</link><description>The decommissioning of traditional thermal power plants with high levels of renewable energy resources (RES) always causes a reduction in system inertia. A hybrid power grid must maintain stable frequency during severe disturbances. Therefore, this study provides a generalized approach for estimating the online grid inertia under normal and disturbed operating conditions. Large-scale deployment of photovoltaic (PV) power generation is considered to replicate the rapid growth of RES and its impact on actual power grids. The individual inertia of existing conventional synchronous generators in the hybrid system is quickly estimated using the online recursive least square (RLS) method. A Kalman filter is used to reject any noise contained in the measured signals. The noise-free rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) and electrical power are further used to refine the estimation of inertia, damping coefficient, and mechanical power to enhance the overall accuracy of the proposed tracking scheme. Next, the virtual inertia of the existing PV system is derived mathematically from the identified model parameters, which are further verified using simulation results, thereby demonstrating the robustness of the proposed approach. Finally, the spectral cluster-based method is used to determine the sets of coherent machines and provide online tracking for each coherent group&#8217;s inertia, as well as the total grid inertia in response to different disturbances and intermittency of RES power generation. The proposed inertia estimation method is proven to be very fast, allowing preventative action to be taken before any instability occurs.The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested and verified using IEEE 39-bus, 68-bus, an islanded AC microgrid, as well as a modified IEEE 39-bus based MTDC test system.</description></item><item><title>Peer-to-Peer Energy Transactions for Prosumers Based on Improved Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10571970</link><description>With the evolution of the power market, the active involvement of prosumers in both consuming renewable energy and maximizing financial gains has emerged as a pivotal and compelling trend in the prospective landscape of energy market development. However, the optimal energy trading strategy for prosumers under a complicated peer-to-peer (P2P) market environment is still a great challenge, due to the incomplete information and large decision space. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an improved deep deterministic policy gradient (IDDPG) algorithm to optimize the P2P energy trading and operation strategy for prosumers. The proposed IDDPG algorithm uses a wave-attention network to model the external interactive environment of each prosumer to simplify the complexity of multi-agent trading environment. Moreover, a priority sampling mechanism is proposed to learn valuable experiences purposefully and adopts a cyclic learning rate to avoid local optimality. Finally, the feasibility of the method is verified by the case study of P2P trading with different scales of prosumers. The numerical results show that the proposed IDDPG algorithm outperforms the traditional reinforcement learning algorithms in both calculating efficiency and convergence, and provides a reference for the P2P transaction strategy of prosumers.</description></item><item><title>A Dynamic and Static Combined State Recovery Method Against FDI Attacks in Power Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10564142</link><description>The widespread integration of information technology into power systems increases their vulnerability to false data injection (FDI) attacks, where attackers can mislead the power system state estimator to produce incorrect results. Consequently, it is critical to identify the attack and recover the real system state of the power grid. The primary method of state recovery is to derive the real state from measurements covered by the static measurement protection (SMP) methods, which are expensive to apply. The dynamic reactance perturbation (DRP) methods are low-cost but may fail in some conditions to detect attacks due to the topology limitation. In this paper, we propose a dynamic and static combined defense (DSCD) method, which combines the DRP and SMP methods to identify attacks and enhance the resilience of the state estimator at a lower cost. First, we propose the framework of DSCD and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for recovering the system state. Second, we develop a non-convex optimization model to implement DSCD and propose heuristic algorithms under two extreme scenarios. Using these algorithms, defenders have the flexibility to balance between cost and delay. Simulation results on four IEEE test systems validated the superior performance of the proposed DSCD method.</description></item><item><title>Barrier-Function Adaptive Finite-Time Trajectory Tracking Controls for Cyber Resilience in Smart Grids Under an Electricity Market Environment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10566851</link><description>The advancement and proliferation of digitalization and communication infrastructure have facilitated the rise of real-time bidding markets in smart grids. In these dynamic markets, energy distribution companies and power-generating companies interact to establish energy exchange contracts based on offered prices. However, the fluctuation in power flow resulting from contract changes within the real-time bidding market introduces a potential vulnerability that malicious attackers can exploit to launch successful stealthy attacks. To enhance the smart grid resiliency against cyber-attack in the power market bidding environment, a new barrier-function adaptive finite-time trajectory tracking control is proposed in this paper. The developed controller is utilized to actively counteract and mitigate potential cyber-attacks to ensure their rejection and prevention. The stability analysis convincingly demonstrates the rapid convergence of system states within a finite time frame, empowering the system to effectively reject cyber-attacks in real-time. Test results of an IEEE test systems, considering governor dead bound nonlinearity and communication time delay are presented and compared with those obtained from other methods to ensure and demonstrate the performance of proposed method. The Speedgoat real-time target machine, along with Simulink real-time, validates the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Blockchain-Based Authentication Scheme for Energy Trading in Electric Transportation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10580954</link><description>Authentication between Electric Vehicle (EV) users and Battery Charging/Switching (BCS) stations is a significant problem for energy trading. Although there are many existing authentication schemes, cross-domain authentication for EV users and BCS stations from different domains (such as different regions, companies, manufacturers) has not been well addressed; several blockchain-based cross-domain authentication schemes have more than 11 times communication rounds and involve over 4 times exponentiation, scalar multiplications and bilinear pairing cryptographic operations; this leads to high communication and computational costs. This work aims to tackle this problem by using blockchain and certificate-based public-key cryptography. It proposes an authentication scheme that uses a blockchain ledger to record authentication materials across different domains. A two-stage smart contract is designed and deployed to verify the authentication materials before storing them permanently in the blockchain. A novel certificate-based authenticated key establishment (CB-AKE) protocol is proposed to authenticate EV users and BCS stations. Based on the theoretical analysis and practical evaluation on the security and performance, the proposed scheme can well address the cross-domain authentication problem with acceptable cost. Compared to benchmark schemes, the authentication latency of CB-AKE is decreased by at least 25% and the throughput of CB-AKE is increased by at least 34%.</description></item><item><title>Data-Enabled Modeling and PMU-Based Real-Time Localization of EV-Based Load-Altering Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10586268</link><description>Recently, the integration of electric vehicles (EVs) and their associated electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) has increased significantly in smart grids. Due to the cyber vulnerabilities of this EV ecosystem, such integration makes the entire grid prone to cyberattacks, which can result in the outage of generators or even blackouts. On this basis, this paper leverages a data-enabled predictive attack model (DeeP-AM) to design an EV-based dynamic load-altering attack (EV-DLAA) that targets the frequency stability of the grid. Subsequently, a robust localization framework for the developed EV-DLAAs is proposed using power system measurements obtained from phasor measurement units (PMUs). First, frequency measurements in the transmission grid are used to develop an optimal EV-DLAA without having perfect knowledge of the grid&#8217;s topology. Such an optimal attack model ensures that the targeted frequency deviation is reached by utilizing the least number of EVs and a minimized time of instability (ToI). Then, a PMU-based real-time localization framework is developed based on the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) method, which simultaneously estimates the magnitude and location of EV-DLAAs. The equations obtained from the SINDy method are effectively solved using a modified basis pursuit de-noising (MBPDN) approach. This approach enhances the accuracy and robustness of the localization framework, particularly when confronted with noise. The attack implications and the localization performance are evaluated using the New England 39-bus and Australian power systems.</description></item><item><title>Anomaly Observer-Based Cyber-Resilient Torque Control Against Hybrid Attacks in Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10599829</link><description>Inspired by the continued focuses on renewable energy cybersecurity issues, this paper aims to propose a cyber-resilient torque control framework for wind turbines to defend against the hybrid attack. The cyber threat model is established combining denial-of-service and data manipulation attacks, which attempts to destabilize the wind turbine system by implementing the attacks on the communication link from the rotor speed sensor to the controller. Particularly, the impact of hybrid attack is analyzed and classified into two cases, and the corresponding compensatory measures are developed. To mitigate the impact of the hybrid attack and stabilize the wind turbine system, a cyber-resilient torque control scheme combining zero-order holder and anomaly observer is proposed, which requires simple computational ability of the wind turbine system. Using the Lyapunov theory, the control target of optimal rotor speed tracking is guaranteed and the tolerable attack range under the proposed method is derived. Extensive studies are carried out on a 1.5 MW doubly-fed induction generator-based wind turbine, and the simulation results indicate that the proposed control strategy could effectively reduce the impacts caused by the hybrid attack.</description></item><item><title>PAP: A Privacy-Preserving Authentication Scheme With Anonymous Payment for V2G Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10613000</link><description>Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) networks, as an emerging smart grid paradigm, can be integrated with renewable energy resources to provide power services and manage electricity demands. When accessing electricity services, an electric vehicle  $\left ({{\mathcal {E}\mathcal {V}}}\right)$  typically provides authentication or/and payment information containing identifying data to a service provider, which raises privacy concerns as malicious entities might trace  $\mathcal {E}\mathcal {V}$  activity or exploit personal information. Although numerous anonymous authentication and payment schemes have been presented for V2G networks, no such privacy-preserving scheme supports authentication and payment simultaneously. Therefore, this paper is the first to present a privacy-preserving authentication scheme with anonymous payment for V2G networks (PAP, for short). In addition, this scheme also supports accountability and revocability, which are practical features to prevent malicious behavior; minimal attribute disclosure, which maximizes the privacy of  $\mathcal {E}\mathcal {V}$  when responding to the service provider&#8217;s flexible access policies; payment binding, which guarantees the accountability in the payment phase; user-controlled linkability, which enables  $\mathcal {E}\mathcal {V}$  to decide whether different authentication sessions are linkable for continuous services. On the performance side, we implement PAP with the pairing cryptography library, then evaluate it on different hardware platforms, showing that it is essential for V2G applications.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Blockchain-Based Data Aggregation Scheme With Privacy-Preserving on the Smart Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10612996</link><description>With the development of smart grid, the introduction of blockchain technology provides a novel idea for secure power data sharing. The existing blockchain-based data aggregation schemes generally rely on a unique leader node to perform verification algorithms, but there may be a lazy leader node not performing aggregation data verification to save computation costs. In addition, in the existing verification mechanism, light nodes need to perform the same verification operations as the leader node, which results in resource-constrained light nodes being unable to bear. In this paper, we propose an efficient blockchain-based data aggregation scheme with privacy-preserving on the smart grid, called EC-ASPG, which implements a supervised mechanism for the lazy leader node, enhancing the security of the system. Furthermore, we propose a separable consensus verification mechanism, which can prevent other light nodes from performing duplicate verification operations like the leader node, effectively improving the efficiency of consensus verification. Finally, we present a formal security proof and comprehensive performance evaluations. The results show that our scheme is secure and outperforms the compared schemes in terms of performance analysis.</description></item><item><title>LLRA: A Lightweight Leakage-Resilient Authentication Key Exchange Scheme for Smart Meters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10623401</link><description>The authentication between smart meters and Neighbourhood Area Communication Network (NAN) gateways is a critical issue due to various types of side channel attacks. To address this, a new protocol called Lightweight Leakage-Resilient Authentication Key Exchange (LLRA) was proposed for smart meters. LLRA incorporates continuous after-the-fact leakage-resilient property. Furthermore, extended BPR (CLR-eBPR) security model and extended GNY (CLR-eGNY) logic were introduced. Through provable security analysis, logic analysis, and practical performance evaluations, we demonstrated that LLRA effectively mitigates side-channel attacks while maintaining minimum authentication delay and energy consumption for the computing devices used in smart meters and NAN gateways. Compared to benchmark protocols, the authentication delay of LLRA was decreased by at least 14%; in addition, the energy consumption of LLRA was decreased by at least 7%.</description></item><item><title>Detection of Malicious Command Injection Attacks Against Static Var Compensators in Smart Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643841</link><description>In a smart grid, voltage control and reactive power control are crucial to its safe and reliable operation. Static Var compensators (SVCs) are widely used to achieve these controls in a transmission system, either through centralized control by Energy Management Systems or through local closed loop control systems. In smart grids, the command channels to control SVCs are vulnerable to cyber attacks. In this paper, attack scenarios involving injection of malicious commands to SVCs are studied in detail. Attack models are established for both methods of control. Based on these attack models, two detection algorithms are proposed. The principle behind these algorithms involves the notion that even though an adversary can manipulate the commands and measurements related to SVCs, it is nearly impossible to hide the effect on other state variables and measurements in the system. The algorithms are developed mathematically using electrical quantities, making these schemes independent of the underlying Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) used. The rationale behind the choices made during the development of the algorithms are proven formally. Finally, two algorithms are formally proposed, which are easy to implement and computationally less intensive, when compared to iterative and multi-stage algorithms. These algorithms are then tested on various test-cases on the IEEE 118-bus system and found to be effective.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Optimal Power Flow for Multi-Agent Active Distribution Networks: A Differentially Private Consensus ADMM Algorithm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10659236</link><description>In multi-agent active distribution networks, the information exchanges in the ADMM algorithm for the decentralized distribution-level optimal power flow (D-OPF) may expose sensitive load flows of tie-lines across adjacent agents. This may be overheard by adversarial agents for business competition. To preserve this privacy, this paper proposes a differentially private consensus ADMM (DP-C-ADMM) algorithm, which can offer a mixture solution of both realistically optimal generator outputs and obfuscated-but-feasible load flows of tie-lines. And  $\epsilon -$ differential privacy holds for load flows of tie-lines across agents over iterations. Case study justifies the theoretical properties of this algorithm up to specified privacy parameters.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Charging Scheduling and Speed Control for Delay-Bounded Drone Delivery</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10637488</link><description>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have demonstrated success in delivering goods, but their delivery distances are limited due to their finite battery capacity. While roadside charging stations can replenish the battery, they cause delays and prevent timely delivery. In this paper, we present a novel UAV charging scheduling and speed control framework that optimizes the decisions on flight speed and charging schedule at roadside charging stations to achieve timely and energy-efficient goods delivery. The approach we take is to first formulate a finite-horizon Markov decision process (FH-MDP) problem and then analytically and rigorously reveal the underlying structure of the optimal solution to the problem. Specifically, a FH-MDP is put forth to minimize the energy requirement of the UAV while guaranteeing timely delivery at the destination. We analytically reveal an underlying monotone deterministic Markovian policy, asserting that the optimal charging time and speed are monotonic regarding the distance remaining and the time elapsed. We also show that the optimal charging time and speed change only when the UAV reaches the derived distance- and time-related thresholds. Simulations also show that our approach can extend the flight distance of the UAV by at least 19.8% under our simulation setting, compared to the benchmarks.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Energy Management Strategy for Battery Electric Vehicles: Incorporating Cell Balancing and Multi-Agent Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Architecture</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10598364</link><description>This paper introduces a real-time multi-objective adaptive Energy Management Strategy (EMS) based on a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) architecture.

Furthermore, it achieves a final state of charge (SOC) within a mere 0.3% deviation from the Dynamic Programming (DP) approach. The EMS excels by effectively balancing battery cells and optimizing temperature, mitigating long-term battery aging. Importantly, it outperforms the highest reported SOC value in the 2021 Motor Vehicle Challenge while satisfying all specified criteria.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Communication Network for Electric Vehicles Aggregation and Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10646585</link><description>The hierarchical aggregation and control of electric vehicles (EVs) is an effective way to promote the consumption of clean energy and ensure the balance of power demand-supply. In the case of increasingly insufficient wireless resources of cellular networks, one challenging problem is how to guarantee the real-time and accurate service interaction requirements of massive services in EV aggregation response. In this paper, in order to support the communication process of EV hierarchical aggregation and control, a hierarchical communication network architecture of &#8220;Central cloud- Regional cloud- Edge unit- EVs&#8221; is proposed. Considering the differences of service processing functions and communication demands of each layer, the utility function models are constructed to describe the different demands on the timeliness and accuracy. And based on the utility functions, a network communication resource allocation model is established to allocate power and channel resources on demand. Finally, to reduce the amount of computation, this paper proposes the joint allocation algorithm of power and channel resources based on the improved water-filling algorithm, adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm and two-sided matching theory. The simulation experiment results illustrate that the total utility of the proposed algorithm is increased by 0.43 times on average compared with the channel average allocation (H-A), and 0.08 times compared with the layer-by-layer optimization (H-NJO).</description></item><item><title>User-Centric Cooperative Transmission in Intelligent Reflecting Surface Assisted Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10602527</link><description>The intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) exhibits notable benefits in flexibility, low power consumption, and cost-effectiveness, offering a promising prospect for extensive deployment. However, the performance of the IRS-assisted networks can be hindered by double path-loss fading, resulting in limited serving region and IRS selection constraints. Therefore, it becomes imperative to propose a more rational network architecture that surpasses the current limitations of IRS. This paper proposes a user-centric IRS group cooperative serving scheme, which integrates the benefits of user-side IRS selection and multi-IRS cooperative transmission, and establishes a comprehensive system-level performance analysis framework under the proposed scheme via stochastic geometry. Specifically, IRS cooperative group is decided by an adjustable radius $C$ centered on each user and the IRSs within this circle collaborate to provide services to the user. The average signal strength under cooperative transmission approximated via moment matching, where we propose a general framework to calculate the high order moments of combined channel of IRS-reflected paths as a random sum. In addition, our proposed architecture exacerbates the irregularity of network topology, and more accurate interference Laplace functions by quantifying the irregular interference partitioning are obtained. Numerical results demonstrate that under our proposed user-centric IRS group cooperative serving scheme, the coverage probability can be improved by 3.66x when signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) equals to 0 dB, compared to traditional network with no IRSs.</description></item><item><title>A Joint Design for Full-Duplex OFDM AF Relay System With Precoded Short Guard Interval</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10621622</link><description>In-band full-duplex relay (FDR) has attracted much attention as an effective solution to improve the coverage and spectral efficiency in wireless networks. Considering the residual self-interference (RSI) at the FDR, the overall equivalent channel can be modeled as an infinite impulse response (IIR) channel. For this IIR channel, a joint design for precoding, power gain control and equalization of cooperative OFDM relay systems is presented. Compared with the traditional OFDM systems, the length of the guard interval for the proposed design can be distinctly reduced, thereby improving the spectral efficiency. By analyzing the noise sources under the single relay with single antenna scenario, this paper theoretically evaluates the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the proposed scheme and presents a power gain control algorithm at the FDR for the cases of with and without direct link. With the direct link considered, the FDR transmission system can be regarded as a $2\times 1$ virtual MISO system and the proposed scheme can achieve a diversity order of two. Furthermore, the proposed FDR system is generalized to multiple relay nodes and multiple antennas at each node. Simulation results show the proposed scheme achieves 5.7 dB and 2.9 dB gains compared with the traditional OFDM method with the same guard interval length in the Rayleigh fading condition and Rician fading condition at BER = $10^{-3}$, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Full-Duplex Cooperative NOMA Network With Multiple Eavesdroppers and Non-Ideal System Imperfections: Analysis of Physical Layer Security and Validation Using Deep Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10598216</link><description>In this work, we consider a full-duplex (FD) relay-assisted cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (FD-CNOMA) network and examine the physical layer secrecy (PLS) performance with multiple non-colluding eavesdroppers, considering residual self-interference (RSI) at the FD relay, residual hardware impairments (RHI) at the transceivers and imperfect successive interference cancellation conditions. Initially, we develop analytical equations for the secrecy outage probabilities (SOPs) of the downlink users and the system SOP (SSOP) of the FD-CNOMA network. It is observed that the users suffer notably higher SOPs and exhibit zero-diversity order, leading to an outage floor in the high transmit power regime. In order to enhance the PLS performance, we suggest a jamming-assisted (JA) framework and evaluate the SOPs and the SSOP through analytical and simulation studies. In comparison to the network without a jammer, the suggested JA framework greatly lowers the SSOP and the SOPs, while the diversity order is enhanced to unity, provided both RHI and RSI are negligible. We also develop a deep neural network (DNN) framework for accurate and fast prediction of SOPs and SSOP, that can overcome the limitations of the intricate mathematical modelling approach. For further improving the PLS performance, we determine optimal transmit powers for the users at the BS and at the relay that separately minimizes the SSOP of the JA-FD-CNOMA network. The findings indicate that, in comparison to equal/random power allocation approaches, the suggested approach leads to a significant reduction in SSOP and SOPs and a notable improvement in system secrecy throughput (SST) and secrecy energy efficiency (SEE).</description></item><item><title>Average Energy Detection With Adaptive Threshold for Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10598350</link><description>Spectrum sensing (SS) based on energy detection (ED) is a simple yet effective approach to detect the presence of unknown signals that are active in a specific band of frequencies. The classical ED (CED) algorithm uses the value of the energy detected in the current sensing slot as test statistic and has a fixed threshold, but improved signal detection performance is possible by modifying the test statistic and/or the detection threshold. In this paper we propose a novel ED algorithm for SS that considers a binary activity model for the signal to be detected and combines the use of an average energy test statistic with an adaptive decision threshold for improved detection performance. We present the analytical characterization of the proposed test statistic in terms of its mean and variance, and derive the expressions corresponding to the correct decision probability (CDP) and false alarm probability (FAP). Using the derived CDP and FAP expressions, we also determine the detection thresholds that yield desired values for the false alarm and missed detection probabilities. The proposed algorithm is illustrated with numerical results obtained from simulations, which confirm our theoretical findings and also show that the algorithm outperforms alternative adaptive ED algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Intelligent Reflecting Surface vs. Conventional Full-Duplex Relay in mmWave MIMO Networks: A Comprehensive Performance Comparison</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10598369</link><description>This article aims to provide a comprehensive performance comparison between intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) and conventional full-duplex (FD) relays, making it clear under which conditions and with what protocols, the performance boundaries are achieved by the two methods. We target millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input-multiple-output networks that are key players for the next generation mobile communication and consider the scenarios where an IRS or a FD relay is adopted to establish transmission links between two terminals that may suffer from blocked direct channels. In the comparison, both amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward relaying schemes are considered. Furthermore, practical power consumption models for IRS and FD relay are built. Aimed at maximizing the energy efficiency, we optimize the element/antenna sizes, active/passive beamforming and power allocation for IRS-aided and FD relay-aided systems, respectively. Our numerical results show that the superiority of each relaying scheme highly depends on the carrier frequency. Though IRSs exhibit lower spectral efficiency than active relays, this gap could be narrowed by decreasing the carrier frequency. Moreover, IRSs' energy efficiency is higher than that of active relays at sub-6 GHz. Specially, when the transmission/receiving gain of transceivers is very high, IRSs can further achieve higher energy efficiency at mmWave band. Compared to amplify-and-forward relays, decode-and-forward relays exhibit better performance in general, however, increasing transmit power can substantially enhance the performance of amplify-and-forward relays. Finally, we apply our conclusion to the relevant works to reveal the reasons for their seemingly conflicted findings.</description></item><item><title>Energy Efficiency Optimization of FBMC/OQAM-Based Massive MIMO Systems Subject to Electromagnetic Exposure Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10599856</link><description>The performance of offset-quadrature-amplitude-modulated filter bank multi-carrier (FBMC/OQAM) waveform based on massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is investigated considering not only the transceiver's classic metrics, but also the health concerns associated with exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF). Closed-form expressions are obtained for the lower-bounds on the uplink spectral efficiency (SE) for FBMC/OQAM-based Massive MIMO systems with both the maximum ratio combiner (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) receivers, in the face of realistic imperfect channel state information (CSI). Subsequently, by employing our closed-form SE expressions, a framework is developed for maximizing the global energy efficiency (GEE) of the proposed FBMC/OQAM-based system subject to both power and EMF exposure constraints. A nested quadratic-transform (NQT)-based approach is proposed next for maximizing the non-convex GEE objective by first approximating it as a concave-convex function and then by applying the quadratic transform. Subsequently, a low-complexity iterative algorithm is developed that sequentially applies the Lagrangian dual transform, quadratic transform and Dinkelbach's transform to obtain a closed-form solution of the GEE optimization problem formulated. Our simulation results verify the analytical SE expressions and also demonstrate the improved GEE of the proposed FBMC-based massive MIMO systems subject to the EMF exposure limits.</description></item><item><title>Ergodic Secrecy Capacity Analysis for RIS-Aided Wireless Powered Communication System Under Different Phase Shifting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10606085</link><description>This paper investigates the physical layer security (PLS) of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided wireless powered communication (WPC) system, where an energy-limited user first harvests energy from a hybrid access point (HAP) and then uses the harvested energy to transmit information in the presence of a passive eavesdropper. In particular, four phase shifting designs at RIS are considered, i.e., imperfect continuous phase shifting, perfect continuous phase shifting, imperfect discrete phase shifting, and perfect discrete phase shifting. To reveal the impact of four phase shifting designs on the secrecy performance of system, we analyze the ergodic secrecy capacity (ESC) and derive new closed-form expressions. Then, the asymptotic ESC is derived to gain useful insights. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the imperfect continuous phase shifting has the same ESC performance with the imperfect discrete phase shifting, while the ESC of perfect continuous phase shifting is similar to that of perfect discrete phase shifting. Besides, the ESC firstly increases and then decreases with the increasing time switching factor, and each phase shifting design has a different optimal time switching factor. Moreover, RIS aided WPC system under four phase shifting designs outperforms the traditional WPC system without the aid of RIS under high transmission power, verifying the superiority of using RIS to enhance the secrecy performance.</description></item><item><title>Unsupervised Power Allocation Based on Combination of Edge Aggregated Graph Attention Network With Deep Unfolded WMMSE</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10603410</link><description>To address the challenge of optimizing power distribution within ad hoc wireless networks, deep learning techniques have been employed to navigate the complexities of evolving network topologies and variable channel characteristics. Moreover, there's an anticipation for the deep learning model to unearth more generalized and distinct features. In this paper, we introduce the Unsupervised Power Allocation based on Attentive Graph Representation (UPAR) method. UPAR combines an Edge Aggregated Graph Attention Regression Network (EGRN) with Deep Unfolded Weighted Minimum Mean Square Error (DU-WMMSE) within an unsupervised learning framework. Initially, EGRN leverages an attention mechanism and Gate Recurrent Units (GRU) to amalgamate features from adjacent nodes and their connecting edges, enhancing the identifiability and generalization of the graph's features. Subsequently, DU-WMMSE applies unsupervised learning to refine these graph features through regression training, transforming WMMSE iterations into efficient, interpretable layers within the neural network. This process introduces adjustable parameters, employing both feed forward and back propagation phases during end-to-end training. The proposed method significantly narrows the solution space for the objective function, accelerating the training process and enhancing the efficiency of the deep learning model. Simulation results confirm the UPAR method's superior performance and adaptability across a variety of scenarios.</description></item><item><title>UAV-Assisted Wireless Networks: Mobility and Service Oriented Power Allocation and Trajectory Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10603393</link><description>In this paper, we consider a downlink wireless network assisted by single unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in an area with no-fly zones (NFZs), where there are multiple moving users with diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements to be served. In addition to the cylindrical NFZs, we also modeled and analyzed the polygonal NFZs that are common in reality but seldom investigated in research. We aim to maximize the sum-rate of all user by jointly optimizing the power allocation and trajectory design of the UAV under the constraints on the limited power resource, the QoS requirements of users and the NFZs evasion for UAV. Since the formulated joint optimization problem is non-convex, to deal with it, we design a low-complex iterative scheme based on the proposed modified water-filling algorithm, the successive convex approximation (SCA) technology, disjunctive programming and penalty functions. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly increase the system sum-rate while ensuring the QoS requirements of all users, reasonably evading the NFZs and adapting well to the real-time mobility of uses.</description></item><item><title>Electric Vehicle Cluster Assisted Multi-Tier Vehicular Edge Computing System: Cross-System Framework Design and Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10603416</link><description>Cooperative vehicle infrastructure is critical for facilitating multi-tier vehicular edge computing (VEC) systems to collaboratively process latency-sensitive intelligent tasks. However, the dynamic topology and the scarcity of available computing resources on real traffic roads pose significant challenges. While previous works have explored using public transit and parked vehicles as cooperative vehicles, they often overlook the incentive mechanisms and the specific tasks of these vehicles, rendering these solutions impractical. Motivated by the achievements in smart electric vehicles (EVs), this paper presents an electric vehicle cluster (EVC) assisted multi-tier VEC system that leverages the capabilities of the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology to provide stable computing resources to traffic areas. The proposed EVC-assisted multi-tier VEC system employs a cross-system two-level optimization method that jointly considers offloading and resource allocation decisions for road task vehicles (RTVs) in the VEC system and charging power decisions for the EVs in the EVC. At the lower level, we minimize the task latency for RTVs by utilizing the computing resources of idle EVs. At the upper level, we build a multi-agent two-step game model and introduce a potential game-based strategy and a Nash equilibrium (NE) based EV-RSU mapping method to derive the optimal decision strategy for the EVC. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the efficient reduction in total-task latency of RTVs and lower cost for the EVC while meeting the essential requirements in the V2G.</description></item><item><title>Communication-Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning via Joint Knowledge Distillation and Differential Privacy in Bandwidth-Constrained Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10618889</link><description>The development of high-quality deep learning models demands the transfer of user data from edge devices, where it originates, to centralized servers. This central training approach has scalability limitations and poses privacy risks to private data. Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed training framework that empowers physical smart systems devices to collaboratively learn a task without sharing private training data with a central server. However, FL introduces new challenges to Beyond 5G (B5G) networks, such as communication overhead, system heterogeneity, and privacy concerns, as the exchange of model updates may still lead to data leakage. This paper explores the communication overhead and privacy risks facing the implementation of FL and presents an algorithm that encompasses Knowledge Distillation (KD) and Differential Privacy (DP) techniques to address these challenges in FL. We compare the operational flow and network model of model-based and model-agnostic (KD-based) FL algorithms that enable customizing per-client model architecture to accommodate heterogeneous and constrained system resources. Our experiments show that KD-based FL algorithms are able to exceed local accuracy and achieve comparable accuracy to central training. Additionally, we show that applying DP to KD-based FL significantly damages its utility, leading to up to 70% accuracy loss for a privacy budget $\epsilon \leq 10$.</description></item><item><title>Optimized Federated Multitask Learning in Mobile Edge Networks: A Hybrid Client Selection and Model Aggregation Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10596975</link><description>Clustered federated multitask learning is introduced as an effective strategy, specifically designed to tackle statistical challenges, including non-independent and identically distributed data among clients. This is achieved by clustering clients based on a similarity in their data distributions and assigning a specialized model for each cluster. However, this approach encounters complexities when applied in hierarchical wireless networks due to hierarchical two-level model aggregation and resource-based client selection. This results in a slower convergence rate and deprives clients of the best-fit specialized model for those having similar data distribution from different mobile edge networks. To this end, we propose a framework comprising two-phase client selection and two-level model aggregation schemes designed for IoT devices and intelligent vehicles. For client selection, the cloud ensures fairness among all clients by providing them with equal priority to participate in training, contributing to more accurate clustering. Once a particular cluster reaches a stopping point, the related edge server performs two client selection methods separately, greedy and round-robin. The greedy algorithm prioritizes clients with less latency and superior resources, while the round-robin algorithm allows for cyclic participation in training. The cloud then executes model aggregation in two distinct ways: one based on reaching pre-determined aggregation rounds (round-based model aggregation) and the other by performing at least one split at the edge servers (split-based model aggregation). We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our proposed approach. Our results show that the proposed algorithms significantly improve the convergence rate, minimize training time, and reduce energy consumption by up to 60% while providing every client with a specialized model specifically attuned to its data distribution.</description></item><item><title>Power Allocation Game Between Multiple Statistical MIMO Radar Networks and Multiple Jammers Based on Mutual Information</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654577</link><description>This article investigates the power allocation problem between multiple statistical multiple-input multiple-output(MIMO) radar networks and multiple jammers. Specifically, the main objective of multiple statistical MIMO radar networks is to maximize the mutual information(MI) between the received signal and the path gain matrix under power constraints, whereas the jammers aim to minimize the MI. Based on the theory of Stackelberg game, multiple statistical MIMO radar networks and the jammers are taken as the leader, respectively, and the power allocation problem between the opposing players is effectively solved by using the Lagrange multiplier method. In addition, we derive the existence and uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibria.

However, the huge energy consumption during the rendering process is challenging for UAV-enabled VR systems. The existing energy management strategies neglecting the dynamic and tiling features of VR tasks may not achieve optimal performance. To cope with these issues, we present a dynamic energy optimization framework for UAV-enabled VR systems. In the proposed framework, a tile-based collaborative rendering scheme for multi-UAVs is developed by exploiting the correlation among different tiles of VR users. Further, we formulate an optimization problem by jointly considering the collaboration decision, resource allocation, and UAV trajectory, aiming to reduce the long-term energy consumption under the motion-to-photon (MTP) latency requirement. Due to the tight coupling variables and the dynamic factors, the formulated problem is non-convex and difficult to tackle by adopting the traditional method. To this end, we first decompose the original problem into two sub-problems, i.e., the UAV trajectory and collaboration decision (UTCD) problem, and the resource allocation (RA) problem. Then, we design a dynamic UTCD algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and present an optimal RA algorithm based on the Lagrangian multiplier iterative (LMI) method. To enhance the solving efficiency, a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based solving method is introduced by embedding the RA algorithm in the learning environment of DRL. Finally, simulation results prove that the proposed scheme can obtain good performance for UAV-enabled VR systems.</description></item><item><title>Double Self-Sustainable Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces Aided Wireless Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10599855</link><description>A double self-sustainable reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) assisted multi-user multiple input multiple output (MIMO)system is investigated, where two RISs are equipped with energy harvesting circuit to achieve self-sustainable transmission. We aim to minimize the transmission power at the base station (BS), while guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) requirements of the users and meeting the power consumption requirements of the RISs. In order to address the formulated coupled non-convex problem, we employ a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm based on the penalty-based method and successive convex approximation (SCA) to alternatively optimize the active beamforming at the BS and the phase shifts, as well as amplitude coefficients of two RISs. Simulation results show that the required power consumption at the BS for the proposed double self-sustainable RISs system is significantly reduced compared to conventional RIS systems.</description></item><item><title>Energy Minimization for Radio Map-Based UAV Pickup and Delivery Logistics System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10603397</link><description>Cargo UAVs have been used in short-distance logistics scenarios in cities, and this paper investigates the path planning problem for multi-user pickup and delivery of UAVs. The UAV takes off from the depot, completes the pickup and delivery tasks, and returns to the depot; it needs to maintain a reliable connection with the ground base station (GBS) during the UAV's flight. In the mission, the energy consumption of the UAV is closely related to the order of pickup and delivery as well as the weight of the goods. Therefore, this paper achieves the goal of minimizing UAV energy consumption and designing UAV flight trajectory by optimizing the access sequence. In this paper, we first construct a radio map of the target area, and then we propose an improved Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the path which is the shortest between any two access points that satisfies reliable communication. Then, using the constructed distance matrix, we use a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) to solve the UAV trajectory of the minimum energy pickup and delivery problem (PDP). Finally, through the simulation analysis of traditional PDP and energy-efficient PDP on the python platform, it can be found that our proposed minimum energy consumption PDP saves about 20% of energy consumption compared with the traditional PDP without considering energy consumption.</description></item><item><title>IRS-Aided Multi-Antenna Wireless Powered Communications in Interference Channels</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10608074</link><description>This paper investigates intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided multi-antenna wireless powered communications in a multi-link interference channel, where multiple IRSs are deployed to enhance the downlink/uplink communications between each pair of hybrid access point (HAP) and wireless device. Our objective is to maximize the system sum throughput by optimizing the allocation of communication resources. To attain this objective and meanwhile balance the performance-cost tradeoff, we propose three transmission schemes: the IRS-aided asynchronous (Asy) scheme, the IRS-aided time-division multiple access (TDMA) scheme, and the IRS-aided synchronous (Syn) scheme. For the resulting three non-convex design problems, we propose a general algorithmic framework capable of suboptimally addressing all of them. Numerical results show that our proposed IRS-aided schemes noticeably surpass their counterparts without IRSs in both system sum throughput and total transmission energy consumption at the HAPs. Moreover, although the IRS-aided Asy scheme consistently achieves the highest sum throughput, the IRS-aided TDMA scheme is more appealing in scenarios with substantial cross-link interference and limited IRS elements, while the IRS-aided Syn scheme is preferable in low cross-link interference scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Transistor-Based Dynamic Equivalent Circuit Modeling of Mesostructured-Based Solar Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10676321</link><description>This study introduces a pioneering transistor-based equivalent circuit model explicitly tailored for mesostructured-based solar cells, primarily focusing on dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs).

However, the data obtained mostly contains errors. Commercial I-V curve tracking units are generally expensive, hard to transport, slow to respond, and limited at low irradiations. This article proposes a novel I-V tracer (SEPIV) based on an optimized single-ended primary inductance converter. The SEPIV comprises a linear variable dc load connected to the solar panel's output. In this study, the experimental performance of the SEPIV was compared with the outcomes of commercial and lab devices, which are PVPM 1000 C 40 (PVPM) and WAVELABS SINUS-3000 PRO, respectively. SEPIV's accuracy matched lab units and surpassed PVPM's. As a highlight of this study, the introduced setup can capture the I-V curves of PV modules up to 650 W, a maximum VOC of 60 V, and a maximum ISC of 20 A. In contrast to commercial units, the SEPIV measurement does not depend on irradiation level. Moreover, it has the Internet of Things capability through a Wi-Fi connection for remote measurement.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Photovoltaic Power Prediction Based on CEEMDAN and Hybrid Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10670083</link><description>Accurate photovoltaic (PV) power prediction technology plays a crucial role in effectively addressing the challenges posed by the integration of large-scale PV systems into the grid. In this article, we propose a novel PV power combination prediction model based on complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) in conjunction with a hybrid neural network. To mitigate the influence of strong fluctuations in PV power on prediction outcomes, we employ CEEMDAN to decompose the PV data into several subsequences. Subsequently, sample entropy (SE) is used to quantify the complexity of each subsequence. Subsequences with similar SE values are then restructured to reduce computational load. Moreover, to overcome the limitations of a single neural network in capturing historical data features of PV power, a hybrid sequential convolutional neural network-gate recurrent unit (CNN-GRU) neural network is proposed. The effectiveness of our proposed model is validated through case studies involving PV power stations in two regions. To provide a comprehensive assessment, we conduct comparative validation by building and evaluating alternative models, including long-short term memory (LSTM), GRU, CEEMDAN-LSTM, CEEMDAN-GRU, and CNN-GRU. The results unequivocally demonstrate that the model presented in this article exhibits exceptional prediction performance, characterized by high accuracy and robust generalization.</description></item><item><title>Power-Efficient Analog Hardware Architecture of the Learning Vector Quantization Algorithm for Brain Tumor Classification</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10659713</link><description>This study introduces a design methodology pertaining to analog hardware architecture for the implementation of the learning vector quantization (LVQ) algorithm.

Due to the nonidealities of the calibration circuits, the calibrated bit weights carry errors. This error could propagate during the calibration procedure. Due to the high precision requirement of these ADCs, such residue error commonly becomes the signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) bottleneck of the overall ADC. This article presents an analysis of the residue error from bit weight self-calibration methods of high-resolution SAR ADCs. The major sources contributing to this error and the error reduction methods are quantitively analyzed. A statistical analysis of the noise-induced random error is developed. Our statistical model finds that the noise-induced random error follows the chi-square distribution. In practice, this random error is commonly reduced by repetitively measuring and averaging the calibrated bit weights. Our statistical model quantifies this bit weight error and leads to a clearer understanding of the error mechanism and design trade-offs. Following our chi-square model, the SNDR degradation due to the circuit noise during the calibration can be easily estimated without going through the time-consuming traditional transistor-level design and simulation process. The required repetition time can also be calculated. The bit-weight error models derived in this article are verified with measurement on a 16-bit SAR ADC design in a 180-nm CMOS process. Results from our model match both simulations and measurements well.</description></item><item><title>A nMOS-R Cross-Coupled Level Shifter With High dV/dt Noise Immunity for 600-V High-Voltage Gate Driver IC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10596101</link><description>In digital integrated circuits with multiple power domains, level shifters (LSs) are essential circuit elements that can transform the voltage region from low to high. However, high-frequency gate drivers can generate hundreds of voltages per nanosecond noise (high dV/dt noise). Such high dV/dt noise can cause malfunction of a conventional pulse-triggered cross-coupled LS (CCLS) that is used to control the high-side nMOS switch. In this article, a novel LS with noise immunity is proposed and investigated. Compared with the conventional resistor load LS, the proposed circuit adopts nMOS-R cross-coupled (NRCC) LS, and realizes the selective filtering ability by exploiting the path that filters out the noise introduced by the dV/dt. The high-voltage gate drive integrated circuit (HVIC) is implemented using a 600 V silicon-on-insulator (SOI) BCD process. Analyses and experiments show that the proposed design can help the HVIC maintain a high common-mode transient immunity (CMTI) of up to 137 V/ns while allowing a negative VS swing down to -9.4 V under a 15 V supply voltage. Compared with the traditional HVIC with resistance load LS, the proposed novel HVIC with the NRCC LS improves the noise immunity of dV/dt by 182%.</description></item><item><title>A Two-Channel Interleaved ADC With Fast-Converging Foreground Time Calibration and Comparison-Based Control Logic</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10669386</link><description>A dual-channel interleaved analog-to-digital converter (ADC) operating at 320 MS/s is prototyped to validate a fast-converging foreground time calibration algorithm that is independent of ADC offset errors. An input polarity switching technique is introduced to eliminate the impact of sub-ADC offset mismatches during foreground time calibration. After foreground calibration, the signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) and spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) are improved by 8.6 and 18.4 dB, respectively. In the sub-ADC design, a comparison functionality is enabled in the digital circuits to prevent metastability and expedite data conversion. The single-channel conversion rates reach 160 MS/s. The ADC is implemented via 40-nm digital CMOS technology, achieving a 52.01 dB signal-to-noise plus distortion ratio (SNDR) at near-Nyquist input while sampling at 320 MS/s.

However, this method imposes a significant area and power/energy overhead. Also, the majority-based voter in the typical TMR designs is highly sensitive to soft errors and the design diversity of the triplicated module, which may result in an error for a small difference between the output of the TMR modules. However, a wide range of applications deployed in critical systems are inherently error-resilient, that is, they can tolerate some inexact results at their output while having a given level of reliability. In this article, we propose a high precision redundancy multiplier (HPR-Mul) that relies on the principles of approximate computing to achieve higher energy efficiency and lower area, as well as resolve the aforementioned challenges of the typical TMR schemes, while retaining the required level of reliability. The HPR-Mul is composed of full precision (FP) and two reduced precision (RP) multipliers, along with a simple voter to determine the output. Unlike the state-of-the-art RP redundancy multipliers (RPR-Muls) that require a complex voter, the voter of the proposed HPR-Mul is designed based on mathematical formulas resulting in a simpler structure. Furthermore, we use the intermediate signals of the FP multiplier as the inputs of the RP multipliers, which significantly enhance the accuracy of the HPR-Mul. The efficiency of the proposed HPR-Mul is evaluated in a 15-nm FinFET technology, where the results show up to 70% and 69% lower power consumption and area, respectively, compared to the typical TMR-based multipliers. Also, the HPR-Mul outperforms the state-of-the-art RPR-Mul by achieving up to 84% higher soft error tolerance. Moreover, by employing the HPR-Mul in different image processing applications, up to 13% higher output image quality is achieved in comparison with the state-of-the-art RPR multipliers.</description></item><item><title>MCAIMem: A Mixed SRAM and eDRAM Cell for Area and Energy-Efficient On-Chip AI Memory</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10684121</link><description>AI chips commonly employ SRAM memory as buffers for their reliability and speed, which contribute to high performance. However, SRAM is expensive and demands significant area and energy consumption. Previous studies have explored replacing SRAM with emerging technologies, such as nonvolatile memory, which offers fast read memory access and a small cell area. Despite these advantages, nonvolatile memory&#8217;s slow write memory access and high write energy consumption prevent it from surpassing SRAM performance in AI applications with extensive memory access requirements. Some research has also investigated embedded dynamic random access memory (eDRAM) as an area-efficient on-chip memory with similar access times as SRAM. Still, refresh power remains a concern, leaving the trade-off among performance, area, and power consumption unresolved. To address this issue, this article presents a novel mixed CMOS cell memory design that balances performance, area, and energy efficiency for AI memory by combining SRAM and eDRAM cells. We consider the proportion ratio of one SRAM and seven eDRAM cells in the memory to achieve area reduction using mixed CMOS cell memory. In addition, we capitalize on the characteristics of deep neural network (DNN) data representation and integrate asymmetric eDRAM cells to lower energy consumption. To validate our proposed MCAIMem solution, we conduct extensive simulations and benchmarking against traditional SRAM. Our results demonstrate that the MCAIMem significantly outperforms these alternatives in terms of area and energy efficiency. Specifically, our MCAIMem can reduce the area by 48% and energy consumption by  $3.4\times $  compared with SRAM designs, without incurring any accuracy loss.</description></item><item><title>A Novel TriNet Architecture for Enhanced Analog IC Design Automation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10672521</link><description>Analog integrated circuit (IC) design and its automation pose significant challenges due to the time-consuming mathematical computations and complexity of circuit design. Though efforts have been made to automate the analog design flow, the current approach falls short in meeting the exact design requirements and plagued by inaccuracies, highlighting the necessity for a more robust approach capable of accurately predicting circuits. In addition, there is a need for an improved dataset collection technique to enhance the overall performance of the automation process. The power management unit (PMU) is a crucial block in any IC that requires the design of low-dropout regulator (LDO) for which amplifiers are fundamental blocks. This research harnesses the capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs) to automate essential amplifier blocks, such as the differential amplifier (DiffAmp) and two-stage operational amplifier (OpAmp). In addition, it proposes an automation framework for the higher level circuitry of the LDO. This article introduces a novel &#8220;TriNet&#8221; architecture designed for various parameters of amplifiers, including gain, bandwidth, and power facilitating precise predictions for DiffAmp and OpAmp, and presents a decoder architecture tailored for LDO. A notable aspect is the development of an efficient technique for acquiring larger datasets in a condensed timeframe. The presented methodologies demonstrate high accuracy rates, achieving 97.3% for DiffAmp and OpAmp circuits and 94.3% for LDO design.</description></item><item><title>A High-Speed Dynamic Element Matching Decoder With Integrated Background Calibration Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10616030</link><description>A dynamic element matching (DEM) decoder with integrated mismatch calibration control for high-speed current-steering digital-to-analog converters (CS-DACs) and CSDAC- based direct digital frequency synthesizers (DDFSs) is studied and presented. The DEM algorithm achieves very good averaging of mismatch-induced errors in the succeeding CS-DAC. It features a minimum element transition rate, therefore opimizing the power dissipation and ensuring minimal glitch energy at the output. Due to the chosen network-based architecture, with only a few modifications of the hardware, the decoder allows the integration of a comprehensive current source mismatch calibration that can be fully operated in the background and even in parallel to the regular DEM operation. A proof-ofconcept hardware implementation of the presented decoder was fabricated in a 22-nm FD-SOI CMOS process and characterized in a high-speed DDFS system with a sampling rate of 5 GHz. Measurements reveal a significant improvement in the spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) and signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) when the calibration and DEM are enabled. Compared to the state-of-the-art (SoA), the presented DDFS achieves one of the best figures of merit.</description></item><item><title>1.63 pJ/SOP Neuromorphic Processor With Integrated Partial Sum Routers for In-Network Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10570234</link><description>Neuromorphic computing is promising to achieve unprecedented energy efficiency by emulating the human brain&#8217;s mechanism. Conventional neuromorphic accelerators employ split-and-merge method to map spiking neural networks&#8217; inputs to surpass the fan-in capabilities of a single neuron core. However, this approach gives rise to the risk of accuracy compromise and extra core usage for the merging process. Moreover, it requires excessive data movement and clock cycles to aggregate spikes generated by partial sums instead of total sums obtained from different cores with substantial power and energy overhead. This work presents a novel approach to addressing the challenges imposed by the split-and-merge method. We propose an energy-efficient, reconfigurable neuromorphic processor that leverages several key techniques to mitigate the above issues. First, we introduce a partial sum router circuitry that enables in-network computing (INC), eliminating the need for extra merge cores. Second, we adopt software-defined Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) by leveraging predefined, efficient routing, eliminating power-hungry routing computation. At last, we incorporate fine-grained power gating and clock gating techniques for further power reduction. Experimental results from our test chip demonstrate the lossless mapping of the algorithm and exceptional energy efficiency, achieving an energy consumption of 1.63 pJ/SOP at 0.48 V. This energy efficiency represents a 22.4% improvement compared to the state-of-the-art results. Our proposed neuromorphic processor provides an efficient and flexible solution for neural network processing, mitigating the limitations of the traditional split-and-merge approach while delivering superior energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>VLSI Design of Light-Field Factorization for Dual-Layer Factored Display</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10568566</link><description>This article introduces a VLSI design for light-field factorization, aimed at enhancing immersive 3-D visual experiences for computational light-field factored displays. The main design challenges are intensive memory-access demands and high computational complexity. Accordingly, we first propose half-block-based factorization (HBBF) and sparse ray sampling (SRS) to reduce DRAM bandwidth by 99% and SRAM size by 74%. Then, we devise integer hybrid quantization (INTH) to cut down computational logic by 41%, leading to improvements in die area and power efficiency. Finally, we fabricated a processor chip that incorporates 75.1 kB of SRAM and 5.9M logic gates using 40-nm CMOS technology.

However, conventional polar codes are reliant solely on binary ( $2 \times 2$ ) kernels, which restricts their block length to being only powers of 2. In response, multi-kernel (MK) polar codes have been proposed as a viable solution to achieve increased flexibility in code length. This article proposes unrolled and pipelined architectures for encoding both systematic and nonsystematic MK polar codes, capable of high-throughput encoding of codes constructed with binary, ternary ( $3 \times 3$ ), or binary-ternary mixed kernels. Furthermore, two novel nonsystematic stage-folded encoders, designed to minimize resource usage, have been introduced for the encoding of pure-ternary and MK codes. The proposed MK encoders additionally provide the functionality of dynamic kernel assignment. The proposed architectures exhibit an unprecedented level of flexibility by supporting 83 different codes and offering various architectures that provide tradeoffs between throughput and resource consumption. The FPGA implementation results demonstrate that a partially pipelined polar encoder of size  $N=4096$  operating at a frequency of 270 MHz gives a throughput of 1080 Gb/s. In addition, a new compiler scripted in Python is introduced to automatically generate HDL modules for the desired encoders. By inserting the desired parameters, a designer can simply obtain all the necessary VHDL files for FPGA implementation.</description></item><item><title>A Second-Order Noise Shaping SAR ADC With Parallel Multiresidual Integrator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10660490</link><description>This brief proposes a parallel multiresidual (PMR) integrator to enhance the noise-shaping (NS) effect for successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The PMR employs passive integrators in parallel to simultaneously integrate the average result of the multiple sequential residual voltages. The proposed PMR technique provides an alternative scheme to enhance the NS rather than increasing the order of the integrator to suppress the instability and power. A prototype 7-bit second-order NS-SAR ADC is designed and simulated in a 130-nm CMOS process. PMR increases the effective number of bits (ENOBs) to 10.6 bit, which enhances the NS effect of 3.6 bit.

In this work, we evaluate 3-D stacking benefits on SENECA, a digital neuromorphic accelerator core, sweeping itson-chip memory capacity from 2 up to 32 Mb in both legacy planar and advanced nanosheet CMOS logic nodes. In a planar CMOS node (GF-22 nm), two-die memory-on-logic (MoL) partitioning enables  $8\times $  moreon-chip memory, and it boosts operating frequency by 7% with 26% less power than the 2-D. Moving to an advanced nanosheet technology (imec A10), multidie (up to 7 dies) MoL stacking enables a performance increase of up to 29% and power savings up to 31%.

It is implementable in various 128-bit modes, such as electronic code book (ECB), cipher block chaining (CBC), cipher feedback (CFB), output feedback (OFB), and counter (CTR), to facilitate parallel processing of data. The noninvasive nature of power analysis attacks (PAAs) to retrieve secret information off a physical device renders such hardware to be unsafe from the adversaries. Also, the assessment of the aforementioned modes for security remains obscured, which is undertaken by this work as a novel attempt. In addition, this work proposes a novel 64-bit version of CFB mode, which provides the highest security with respect to other modes and several unprotected AES designs.

The proposed CIM macro has the following features: 1) a sign-extension-less array multiplication circuit structure that eliminates the need for converting partial sums into 2&#8217;s complement, which removes the constraints related to handling specific symbol bits; 2) developing a circuit that avoids signed bit extension shift and accumulate, resulting in reduced area cost; and 3) integrating an adder structure that provides adjustable accuracy, thereby enhancing network adaptability as compared to traditional approximation techniques. A fabricated 28 nm 16-kb sign-extension-less DCIM was tested with the highest MAC speed with 5.6 ns (Signed 8 b IN&amp;amp;W 23 b Out) and achieved the best energy efficiency with 40.15 TOPS/W over a wide range of network adaptability.</description></item><item><title>A 256 &#215; 192 -Pixel Direct Time-of-Flight LiDAR Receiver With a Current-Integrating-Based AFE Supporting 240-m-Range Imaging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643155</link><description>This article presents a direct time-of-flight (DToF) LiDAR with a current-integrating-based analog frontend (AFE), performing long-range (LR) and high-quality imaging. A current-integrating-based transimpedance amplifier (CI-TIA) facilitates a direct current-to-pulse conversion, which not only achieves superior transimpedance gain and noise performance but also adaptively compensates the background-light-induced direct current to alleviate the dynamic range (DR) obstacle in the LR LiDARs. Benefiting from the pulse manner output of the CI-TIA, a pulse position and width converter (PPWC) utilizes lightweight counters to provide the time and intensity information simultaneously, while the latter compensates for the walk error in time intrinsically. Furthermore, the intensity is used to adapt the accumulation window size to improve the imaging quality under high intensity. The prototype LiDAR receiver is fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, which achieves a consistent distance error of &lt;1 cm and precision of &lt;0.09% for up to 240-m measurements. It demonstrates a  $256{\times } 192$ -pixel resolution imaging at 30 frames per second (fps) with the assistance of a scanning system.</description></item><item><title>A Bio-Impedance Readout IC With Complex-Domain Noise-Correlated Baseline Cancellation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10681504</link><description>This article presents a bio-impedance (bioZ) readout IC featuring a complex-domain noise-correlated baseline cancellation to overcome the limitation of the conventional baseline cancellation with the real-domain noise correlation. The proposed technique is especially beneficial in cases with significant phase shifts between the excitation current from the current generator (CG) and the input voltage signal produced across the bioZ, through which the CG current flows. This technique employs a tunable reference impedance (TRI) and adaptively adjusts it to match the bioZ in both magnitude and phase, thereby achieving a complex-domain correlation of CG noise. By flowing an identical CG current through both the TRI and bioZ, the noise voltages across the TRI and bioZ caused by the CG current become closely correlated with each other, even in the presence of substantial phase shifts, enabling effective CG noise removal after baseline subtraction. Furthermore, this work proposes a differential-difference current-balancing instrumentation amplifier (DD-CBIA) with quiet chopping for baseline subtraction, offering low power consumption, wide input range, and low input-dependent noise. Measurement results demonstrate significant enhancements in noise performance by a factor of 2.47 and 4.88 for the bioZs with phases of 30&#176; and 60&#176;, respectively, achieving a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 101.5 dB and a figure of merit (FoM) of 150.0 dB. Validation through human-subject experiments using two-electrode configurations on the chest and wrist further supports the effectiveness of the proposed bioZ readout IC.</description></item><item><title>A High Accuracy and Ultra-Energy-Efficient Zero-Shot-Retraining Seizure Detection Processor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10684596</link><description>Recently, wearable devices integrating seizure detection processors have been developed to detect seizures in real time for alerting, recording, or in-device treatment purposes. High accuracy and low energy consumption are paramount for seizure detection processors. Many existing seizure detection processors are able to achieve high accuracy when large amounts of seizure data from the test patient is available for the training, which requires the test patient to undergo time-consuming and costly hospitalization due to the low occurrence of seizure data and therefore is impractical. This work proposes a high-accuracy and ultra-energy-efficient zero-shot-retraining seizure detection processor that requires no seizure data from the test patient for retraining. Two novel techniques have been proposed to improve the accuracy and reduce energy consumption, including a hybrid-feature-driven adaptive processing architecture with on-chip learning for improving the accuracy against inter-patient variation and reduce the classification energy consumption and a learning-based adaptive channel selection technique to identify the redundant electroencephalogram (EEG) channels for further energy saving while maintaining high accuracy. The proposed seizure detection processor has been implemented and fabricated in 55-nm CMOS technology. It demonstrates high sensitivity (i.e., 100% event-based sensitivity) and specificity (i.e., 94%) with extremely low energy consumption (i.e.,  $0.07~\mu $ J/classification and  $0.1~\mu $ J/learning) while requiring no seizure data from the test patient for retraining, outperforming the state-of-the-art designs.</description></item><item><title>A Wireless, Multicolor Fluorescence Image Sensor Implant for Real-Time Monitoring in Cancer Therapy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10630875</link><description>Real-time monitoring of dynamic biological processes in the body is critical to understanding disease progression and treatment response. These data, for instance, can help address the lower than 50% response rates to cancer immunotherapy. However, current clinical imaging modalities lack the molecular contrast, resolution, and chronic usability for rapid and accurate response assessments. Here, we present a fully wireless image sensor featuring a  $2.5{\times }5$  mm2 CMOS integrated circuit for multicolor fluorescence imaging deep in tissue. The sensor operates wirelessly via ultrasound (US) at 5-cm depth in oil, harvesting energy with 221-mW/cm2 incident US power density (31% of FDA limits) and backscattering data at 13 kb/s with a bit error rate  $\lt 10{^{-6}}$ . In situ fluorescence excitation is provided by micro-laser diodes controlled with a programmable on-chip driver. An optical front-end combining a multi-bandpass interference filter and a fiber optic plate (FOP) provides &gt;6 OD excitation blocking and enables three-color imaging for detecting multiple cell types. A  $36{\times }40$  pixel array captures images with &lt;125- $\mu $  m resolution. We demonstrate wireless, dual-color fluorescence imaging of both effector and suppressor immune cells in ex vivo mouse tumor samples with and without immunotherapy. These results show promise for providing rapid insight into therapeutic response and resistance, guiding personalized medicine.</description></item><item><title>Omnidirectional Wireless Power Transfer for Millimetric Magnetoelectric Biomedical Implants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10714003</link><description>Miniature bioelectronic implants promise revolutionary therapies for cardiovascular and neurological disorders. Wireless power transfer (WPT) is a significant method for miniaturization, eliminating the need for bulky batteries in today&#8217;s devices. Despite successful demonstrations of millimetric battery-free implants in animal models, the robustness and efficiency of WPT are known to degrade significantly under misalignment incurred by body movements, respiration, heart beating, and limited control of implant orientation during surgery. This article presents an omnidirectional WPT platform for millimetric bioelectronic implants, employing the emerging magnetoelectric (ME) WPT modality, and &#8220;magnetic field steering&#8221; technique based on multiple transmitter (TX) coils. To accurately sense the weak coupling in a miniature implant and adaptively control the multicoil TX array in a closed loop, we develop an active echo (AE) scheme using a tiny coil on the implant. Our prototype comprises a fully integrated 14.2 mm3 implantable stimulator embedding a custom low-power system-on-chip (SoC) powered by an ME film, a TX with a custom three-channel AE RX chip, and a multicoil TX array with mutual inductance cancellation. The AE RX achieves &#8722;161 dBm/Hz input-referred noise with 64 dB gain tuning range to reliably sense the AE signal, and offers fast polarity detection for driver control. AE simultaneously enhances the robustness, efficiency, and charging range of ME WPT. Under 90&#176; rotation from the ideal position, our omnidirectional WPT system achieves  $6.8{ \times }$  higher power transfer efficiency (PTE) than a single-coil baseline. The tracking error of AE negligibly degrades the PTE by less than 2% from using ideal control.</description></item><item><title>A Scalable and Instantaneously Wideband RF Correlator Based on Margin Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10704783</link><description>Correlation is a fundamental operation in radar/ communication signal processing.

Color-center qubits enable a modular architecture that allows for the 3-D integration of photonics, cryo-CMOS control electronics, and qubits in the same package. However, performing quantum operations in a scalable manner requires large currents in the driving coils due to low coil-to-qubit coupling. Moreover, active calibration of the qubit Larmor frequency is required to compensate inhomogeneities of the bias magnetic field. To overcome these challenges, this work proposes both a cryo-CMOS alternating current (AC) controller consisting of a class-DE series-resonant driver and a DC current regulator (DC CR) that uses a triode-biased H-bridge for scalable low-power qubit operations. By experimentally validating the cryo-CMOS performance with a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color-center qubit, the AC controller can drive a Rabi oscillation up to 2.5 MHz with a supply draw of 6.5 mA, and the DC CR can tune the Larmor frequency by &#177;9 MHz while driving up to &#177;20 mA in the bias coil.  $T_{2}^{*}$  coherence times up to  $5.3~\mu $ s and single-qubit gate fidelities above 98% are demonstrated with the cryo-CMOS control using Ramsey experiments and gate set tomography (GST), respectively. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed cryo-CMOS chips and enable the development of a modular quantum processor based on color centers.</description></item><item><title>A 23-GHz TX/LNA Front-End Module for Inter-Satellite Links With 27.8% Peak Efficiency in the TX Path and 3.1-dB NF in the RX Path</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10538228</link><description>This article presents a 23-GHz transmitter/low-noise amplifier (TX/LNA) front-end module (FEM) in 130-nm SiGe BiCMOS for inter-satellite links (ISLs) in the system of orbiting low-frequency antenna array (OLFAR). The FEM consists of an LNA, a power amplifier (PA), a variable-gain amplifier (VGA), a phase shifter (PS), and a TX/receiver switch (T/R SW). By applying the combination of different techniques: 1) multi-function block design strategy; 2) current reuse and  ${\mathrm { g}}_{\mathrm { m}}$  boosting implemented by a triple-coil transformer in the LNA; 3) dual-LC-tank-based integrated T/R SW, a compact FEM is achieved, simultaneously with an advanced-state-of-the-art efficiency in the TX path and a competitive noise figure (NF) in the receiver (RX) path. In the TX path, it demonstrates a measured saturated output power ( $\mathrm {P}_{\mathrm {sat}}$ ) of 16.8 dBm, a peak TX efficiency of 27.8%, and a 34.1-dB gain.

The adoption of sub-terahertz (sub-THz) frequencies for such systems relieves the hardware requirements for the physical size and fractional bandwidth (BW). Phased/MIMO arrays, when a large 2-D aperture size is required, are facing great challenges related to high circuit complexities, electronic density, and computation power. This article presents a digitally controlled 265-GHz reflectarray that decouples the designs of active circuits and large passive antenna array. The array is constructed using stitched CMOS chips, fabricated on Intel 16 process, and each unit adopts 1-bit phase quantization and cross-polarization backscatter approaches. With a credit-card size ( $5.6 \times $  cm2), the reflectarray performs 1&#176;-wide pencil beamforming (~42-dBi directivity) and electric steering within &#177;60&#176; range in both azimuth and elevation directions. The reflectarray is also equipped with 780-Mb integrated under-antenna memory, which not only eliminates high-speed data communication during raster scan but also enables techniques such as time-dithering sidelobe reduction, and beam squint corrections. Pairing with a commercial sub-THz transceiver (TRX), this work also, for the first time, demonstrates high-angular-resolution, mechanical-movement-free terahertz (THz) imaging.</description></item><item><title>A ULP Long-Range Active-RF Tag With Automatically Calibrated Antenna-TRX Interface</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10526312</link><description>This article introduces an ultra-low-power (ULP) active-RF tag for long-range event-driven Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. The tag employs the following: 1) a complementary Class-B/-C voltage-controlled oscillator-power amplifier (VCO-PA) with an optimum-sized loop antenna and a co-designed transmit/receive (T/R) switch to maximize the efficiency of the transmitter (TX); 2) an antenna-transceiver (TRX) co-designed RF interface replacing the function of the off-chip matching network (MN) while enabling the frequency tunability and a 2-D wake-up scheme for the receiver (RX); and 3) a frequency-locked loop (FLL) plus injection locking calibration scheme for the TRX to guarantee both the frequency accuracy and tuning range.

To support fractional division operation, the divider is modulated by a Delta-Sigma modulator (DSM). A DTC that follows the divider is incorporated to compensate for the modulation noise and generate a low-deterministic-jitter output. In this work, a background DTC gain calibration is proposed to realize a high-performance FOD. This calibration features a replica-DTC-free technique to reduce chip area and power consumption. Furthermore, a two-step division architecture is adopted to relax the tradeoffs among calibration settling time, frequency resolution, and circuit design non-idealities. Fabricated in a 90-nm CMOS process, the proposed FOD supports an output frequency range of 0.625 to 200 MHz. This FOD achieves 300 fsrms integrated jitter and &#8722;65 dBc spur at 192-MHz output frequency.

To fulfill the high-throughput demand in D2D interfaces, a PAM-based crosstalk cancellation (XTC) technique capable of improving the channel density is proposed along with a doubled per-pin data rate using PAM-4 signaling. Remarkably, the proposed XTC technique only requires a single capacitor at the output node for crosstalk compensation, thereby minimizing bandwidth (BW) degradation by reducing parasitic components. The transmitters leverage a proposed thermometer-weighted driver architecture, characterized by its high energy efficiency and linearity, to facilitate PAM-4 signaling within the capacitively driven link. Additionally, a true-single-ended time-based decoding technique is proposed for the PAM-4 receiver to alleviate both hardware and design complexities.

Source-series terminated (SST) drivers are widely used in conventional FFE (C-FFE) TXs. However, linear resistors in C-FFE SST TXs occupy too much area and add significant parasitic capacitance, degrading power efficiency, and output bandwidth. To overcome these problems, we propose a new feed-forward equalization (FFE) architecture dubbed A-FFE that completely eliminates subtractions between FFE taps and improves the robustness to quantization errors of coefficients. These advantages of the proposed architecture allow to utilize area-and-power-efficient inverter drivers in FFE. An inverter-based four-tap A-FFE TX was designed and fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process. The TX achieved a data rate of 20 Gb/s/pin, an eye height of 55.1 mV, and an eye width of 0.44 UI with a 15-dB PCB trace, while consuming 1.18 pJ/b and achieving the worst eye sensitivity of 68%. The eye-opening was decreased only by 13.6%, when the most sensitive FFE coefficient was reduced by 20%. Because it uses area-efficient inverter drivers without resistors, the TX occupies only  $1149~{\mu }$ m2.</description></item><item><title>A 2.5-nA Area-Efficient Temperature-Independent 176-/82-ppm/&#176;C CMOS-Only Current Reference in 0.11- &#956; m Bulk and 22-nm FD-SOI</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10550946</link><description>Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications require nW-power current references that are robust to process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variations, to maintain the performance of IoT sensor nodes in a wide range of operating conditions. However, nA-range current references are rarely area-efficient due to the use of large gate-leakage transistors or resistors, which occupy a significant silicon area at this current level. In this article, we introduce a nA-range constant-with-temperature (CWT) current reference, relying on a self-cascode MOSFET (SCM) biased by a four-transistor ultra-low-power voltage reference through a single-transistor buffer. The proposed reference includes a temperature coefficient (TC) calibration mechanism to maintain performance across process corners. In addition, as the proposed design relies on the body effect, it has been fabricated and measured in 0.11- $\mu $ m bulk and 22-nm fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FD-SOI) to demonstrate feasibility in both technology types. On the one hand, the 0.11- $\mu $ m design consumes a power of 16.8 nW at 1.2 V and achieves a 2.3-nA current with a line sensitivity (LS) of 2.23%/V at  $25~{^{\circ } }$ C and a TC of 176 ppm/&#176;C at 1.2 V from  ${-} 40~{^{\circ } }$ C to  $85~{^{\circ } }$ C. On the other hand, the 22-nm design consumes a power of 16.3 nW at 1.5 V and achieves a 2.5-nA current with a 1.53%/V LS at  $25~{^{\circ } }$ C and an 82-ppm/&#176;C TC at 1.5 V from  ${-} 40~{^{\circ } }$ C to  $85~{^{\circ } }$ C. Thanks to their simple architecture, the proposed references achieve a silicon area of 0.0106 mm2 in  $0.11~{\mu }$ m and 0.0026 mm2 in 22 nm without compromising other figures of merit and are, thus, competitive with state-of-the-art CWT references operating in the same current range.</description></item><item><title>A 0.08%/V 32.3-ppm/&#176;C 36.6-kHz Unregulated Current-Reuse Ring Oscillator With VGS-Ratio-Based Compensation Using One-Type-Only Resistor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10508792</link><description>This article introduces a 36.6-kHz unregulated ring oscillator (RO) tailored for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, demonstrating robustness to variations in supply voltage and temperature. A temperature compensation scheme of gate&#8211;source voltage ratio is theoretically proven and shows that the potential to be applied in some CMOS technologies that lack resistors with complementary temperature coefficients (TCs). Combining PMOS-only delay cells along with a complementary-to-absolute-temperature (CTAT) current reference, the RO ensures stable frequencies within variation ranges of up to 2.4 V and 180 &#176;C, while exhibiting low process variations. In addition, a current-reuse technique is employed to mitigate the resistor area. Fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS technology, the RO occupies an area of 0.012 mm2, and nine samples are measured. The prototype achieves an energy efficiency of 2.74 pJ/cycle and exhibits a supply sensitivity of 0.08%/V ranging from 1.3 to 3.7 V without voltage regulators.

Nonetheless, the frequency mismatch ( ${\Delta } {F}$ ) between the injection frequency and the crystal&#8217;s resonance frequency restrains the injection efficiency and start-up improvement. This work presents an automatic phase-error correction (APEC) technique for automatically correcting the phase error incurred due to  ${\Delta } {F}$  up to  $10{^{4}}$  ppm and safeguarding the XO start-up performance. An inflection detector (ID) based on a dynamic comparator (DCMP) traces the crystal resonant signal&#8217;s peak points and selects the appropriate signals for injection. We fabricated the proposed fast start-up XO in a 40-nm CMOS process. It achieves a start-up time of  $17.5~{\mu }$ s with a 16-MHz crystal and a 1.0-V  ${V} {_{\text {DD}}}$ . Furthermore, the start-up time only varies by &#177;1.42% over a  ${\Delta } {F}$  of  ${\pm } 10{^{4}}$  ppm, and &#177;4.5% amid temperature variations (&#8722;40&#176;C to  $85~{^{\circ }}$ C), evincing the robustness of the proposed technique. The power consumption and phase noise in the steady state are  $84~{\mu }$ W and &#8722;139 dBc/Hz at 1-kHz offset, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A 125&#8211;600-MHz IF 75-dB DR Partially Time-Interleaved Bandpass DSM Based on Passive N-Path Filters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10520268</link><description>This work presents a sixth-order partially time-interleaved bandpass delta-sigma modulator (BP DSM) for direct intermediate-frequency (IF) digitization. There are three resonators, and each of them is built with a passive N-path filter; while two open-loop operational transconductance amplifiers (OTAs) are inserted in between to realize the loop filter. The partially time-interleaved implementation enables a wide IF tuning range from 125 to 600 MHz. Besides, the OTAs are free of bandwidth limitation by deploying their equivalent large output resistors as the input resistors of the load N-path filters. Therefore, the BP DSM is power-efficient without compromising its performance. As a validation on the design, a prototype is fabricated in a 65-nm general-purpose (GP) CMOS technology. For a fixed 2-MHz bandwidth, the prototype achieves over 70-dB signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) from 150- to 250-MHz IF; and it achieves over 60-dB SNDR from 125- to 550-MHz IF. The prototype achieves a peak SNDR of 72.0 dB and a maximal dynamic range (DR) of 75.1 dB at 150-MHz IF, while dissipating only 0.42 mW (including the clock generator) from a 1-V supply.

EQZ-LDO incurs a remarkably low 0.5% energy-delay-product (EDP) overhead by activating protective measures exclusively upon detecting an attack. EQZ-LDO can detect a resistance change induced by CPA attempts as small as  $1~{\Omega }$  across a wide temperature range of 0 &#176;C&#8211;90 &#176;C. Following detection, by leveraging the switched-capacitor-based equalizer, the DLDO automatically triggers protection to effectively equalize the current draw from the power supply, significantly attenuating the current signature, a major source of potential secret information leakage. The equalization requires only one more pair of switches than the baseline DLDO, incurring only a small area overhead. An EQZ-LDO-equipped advanced encryption standard (AES)-128 module in a 65-nm CMOS remains secure after at least 10 M-trace of CPA.

To implement speech-to-text conversion on energy-constrained edge devices, a hybrid algorithm is adopted in this work. A bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN), composed of the light gated recurrent units (LiGRUs), is included to achieve a high speech-to-text accuracy with fewer network parameters.

Developing energy-efficient, low-latency SLAM systems is essential due to resource constraints and real-time demands. Compute-in-memory (CIM) architectures have been proven to be efficient for matrix multiplications. However, applications for SLAM raise new challenges in memory access and computation aspects: the linear system solving (LS) requires row transformation and causes frequent CIM updates, while the backend optimization causes redundant memory access; back-end optimization dominates SLAM&#8217;s computation and requires high precision and high dynamic range. Thus, we propose SLAM-CIM, a visual SLAM backend processor for edge robotics. A dynamic-range-driven-skipping CIM macro is designed to realize energy-efficient floating point (FP)-multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations. A preconditional-conjugate-gradient-based in-memory linear solver (PILARS) is designed to achieve LS without additional row transformations. This reduces memory access by  $2.08{\times }$  and linear-system-solving latency by  $3.84{\times }$ . SLAM-CIM further minimizes CIM weight updates through incremental bundle adjustment (BA), increasing average CIM utilization by  $2.8{\times }$ . A silicon prototype is fabricated using 28-nm CMOS technology. The measurements show that SLAM-CIM achieves accurate and efficient SLAM operations with an average energy efficiency of 31.53 TFLOPS/W.</description></item><item><title>A 28-nm 18.7 TOPS/mm&#178; 89.4-to-234.6 TOPS/W 8b Single-Finger eDRAM Compute-in-Memory Macro With Bit-Wise Sparsity Aware and Kernel-Wise Weight Update/Refresh</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10505723</link><description>This article reports a high-density 3T1C single-finger (SF) embedded dynamic random access memory (eDRAM) compute-in-memory (CIM) macro.

To achieve sub-0.5V operation, the proposed BGR employs the reverse BGR based complementary-to-absolute-temperature (CTAT) voltage generator, which does not suffer from the settling error and thus reducing the biasing current for the BJT. The reduction in BJT biasing current can reduce the power consumption, thus relieving the burden on the  $2\times $  charge pump as well, in which the minimum supply voltage of the proposed BGR decreases down to 0.4 V.

Consequently, there has been a proliferation of alternative computing paradigms aimed at tackling this disparity. Approximate Computing (AxC) has emerged as a modern way of improving speed, area efficiency, and energy consumption in error-resilient applications such as image processing or machine learning. The trade-off for these enhancements is the loss in accuracy. From a technology point of view, memristors have garnered significant attention due to their low power consumption and inherent non-volatility that makes them suitable for In-Memory Computation (IMC). Another computing paradigm that has risen to tackle the aforementioned disparity between the demand growth and performance improvement. In this work, we leverage a memristive stateful in-memory logic, namely Material Implication (IMPLY). We investigate advanced adder topologies within the context of AxC, aiming to combine the strengths of both of these novel computing paradigms. We present two approximated algorithms for each IMPLY based adder topology. When embedded in an Ripple Carry Adder (RCA), they reduce the number of steps by  $6\%-54\%$  and the energy consumption by  $7\%-54\%$  compared to the corresponding exact full adders. We compare our work to State-of-the-Art (SoA) approximations at circuit-level, which improves the speed and energy efficiency by up to 72% and 34%, while lowering the Normalized Median Error Distance (NMED) by up to 81%. We evaluate our adders in four common image processing applications, for which we introduce two new test datasets as well. When applied to image processing, our proposed adders can reduce the number of steps by up to 60% and the energy consumption by up to 57%, while also improving the quality metrics over the SoA in most cases.</description></item><item><title>A Phase Interpolated Dual-Phase Adaptive On-Time Controlled Buck Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10597378</link><description>This paper introduces a dual-phase buck converter that utilizes a phase interpolator for interleaving, based on adaptive on-time control.

Traditionally, the CRC and FEC encoding circuits in JESD204C are implemented independently of each other, which consumes a significant amount of hardware resources. Therefore, a high logic density CRC and FEC logic sharing (CFLS) encoding circuit for JESD204C controller is proposed in this paper, and the logic density of the encoding circuit is improved by sharing the registers and common encoding factor (CEF). Meanwhile, a straightforward critical path delay (CPD) calculation method was proposed to assess whether the data transmission delay satisfies the requirements of CFLS circuits. This method is derived in conjunction with the manipulation of the common factor matrix, thus reducing computational complexity. The CFLS encoding circuit proposed in this paper is verified with an FPGA platform, and the results show that the circuit can realize CRC and FEC function with a 21.96% reduction in hardware resources, compared to the traditional methods. The area of the JESD204C controller with CFLS encoding circuits is 0.09 mm2, by using a 40-nm CMOS process, and the power consumption is 24.66 mW according to the post-layout simulation.</description></item><item><title>De-Correlation and De-Bias Post-Processing Circuits for True Random Number Generator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10595992</link><description>True random number generators (TRNGs) are commonly used in hardware security for secure authentication, data encryption, etc. The raw random numbers often exhibit defects. The most commonly observed defects are bias and correlations. Post processing techniques have been developed to address them. The von Neumann method addresses bias, but it requires input that is uncorrelated and has an identical distribution. On the other hand, the Markov chain can address correlation but introduce bias. In this work, we research the lightweight combination of two techniques. We verified that MKV2(QL4)/VN2 performs well for both Markov and non-Markov model bitstreams. MKV1(QL8)/VN8W is effective for the Markov model. The randomness is verified by NIST SP 800&#8211;22 and 800-90B, and ENT, respectively. Both of these circuits require only 16 bits of memory, which is 12 times smaller than in previous work. MKV1(QL8)/VN8W is implemented using 65-nm CMOS. A prototype chip demonstrates a minimum energy consumption of 0.149 pJ/bit at 0.45V. When applied to a latch-based TRNG, it can double the operation frequency thanks to the enhanced decorrelation. The total energy consumption is reduced by 21%.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Continuous Beam Angle Resolution for Next Generation Wireless Systems: A Multi-Stage Phase-Shifting Polyphase Filters Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10601326</link><description>Increasing user density and capacity in next-generation systems presents a need for fine beam angle resolution especially in the emerging upper mid-band  $7-24$  GHz frequency regime.

Generally, microwave sensors utilized in field measurement setups for dielectric sensing often face significant challenges, such as high costs, limited accuracy and resolution, and the potential need for extensive equipment. To address this, PIN diodes are incorporated into the structure, enabling tunable RPS to extend the capacity to measure phase variations across a broader range, leading to higher resolution while preserving the same compact form factor. Also, exciting the TDT-RPS sensor with a sine-wave signal instead of a pulse at a single frequency improves the accuracy since the Material Under Test (MUT) is dispersive. Moreover, two key components have been integrated into the RPS structure to estimate phase difference variations using the TDT technique: a power splitter and a compact commercial phase detector (AD8302). This integration minimizes the necessary measurement equipment in the testing setup. Consequently, the proposed TDT-RPS can be integrated into Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and IoT systems for in-situ scenarios, making it a promising solution for use in various fields such as biomedical, agriculture, and chemical industries.</description></item><item><title>An Open-Circuit Fault Diagnosis for Three-Phase PWM Rectifier Without Grid Voltage Sensor Based on Phase Angle Partition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10623173</link><description>In order to accurately locate the open-circuit fault of power tube for three-phase PWM rectifier under the grid-voltage sensorless control strategy, an open-circuit fault diagnosis algorithm based on phase angle partitions of the current and voltage is proposed. To improve dynamic response for the system, predictive current control is implemented. The real-time change rate of the grid-current phase angle is utilized to determine whether a fault occurs. Based on the zero value platform in the grid-side distortion current generated by open-circuit faults, the corresponding phase angles for the grid current and the grid voltage are partitioned to locate the fault tubes. In a grid voltage sensorless control system, the grid voltage information obtained by the voltage observer and phase-locked loop can be susceptible to distortion or interference. To enhance the accuracy of phase-locked angle, a double generalized second-order integrator is used. The proposed open-circuit fault detection method can realize rapid diagnosis and location for single and double power tubes under grid-voltage sensorless predictive current control. Finally, experimental results are presented to verify the feasibility of the diagnosis method.</description></item><item><title>Low-Voltage CMOS Capacitor-Less LDOs: Bulk-Driven Versus Gate-Driven Comparative Study</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638180</link><description>This paper explores the feasibility of a capacitor-less (CL) low-dropout (LDO) regulator to operate efficiently in a low-voltage environment. The CL-LDO scheme selected is based on a unity-gain feedback configuration around the error amplifier (EA), so that the inclusion of high-value on-chip resistors is avoided and different key parameters, such as the power supply rejection or the noise, are optimized. A comparative analysis has been carried out over the same LDO structure including a bulk-driven and a gate-driven EA, respectively.

Traditional event-based vision sensors (EVS) use predefined threshold voltage to generate output events, which could fluctuate according to the corner or temperature and increase the error event rates. In order to solve this problem, an adaptive threshold voltage generation circuit is proposed.

This scheme achieves fully differential switching by smartly sampling the single-ended input and pre-switching before the conversion phase, maintaining a constant DAC output common-mode voltage during conversion. As a result, it eliminates the impact of comparator dynamic offset voltage on SAR ADC precision. Additionally, this switching scheme does not require additional reference voltages like Vcm, which reduces system complexity and peripheral circuit power consumption. The prototype is fabricated using a 110 nm CMOS process and tested with a 1 V supply voltage and 200 kHz sampling rate.

The proposed intermediate resonator presents a tuned and high-Q response during power transmission, promoting high efficiency in the link. However, when the data transmission begins, it automatically adjusts its response to enable proper communication. Two different approaches for modifying the resonator response during data transmission are tested: 1) dynamically reducing the quality factor, and 2) dynamically detuning the resonator. The proposed resonator is designed, implemented, and applied to an actual commercial system to demonstrate its effectiveness. The selected proof-of-concept system is a low-frequency RFID link, widely used for cattle identification. Detuning the resonator, instead of reducing its quality factor, during data transmission was demonstrated to achieve greater reading distances. Measurements results show that the proposed resonator increases the RFID reading distance by up to  $\approx 300$  % (from 16 cm to 65 cm) compared to not using a resonator, and up to  $\approx 50$  % (from 43 cm to 65 cm) compared to using a regular resonator without the proposed dynamic adaptation. Hence, this brief validates the concept of employing batteryless self-adaptive resonators in inductive power links.</description></item><item><title>A 2-Lane Discrete Multitone Wireline Receiver Datapath With Far-End Crosstalk Cancellation on RFSoC Platform</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10551411</link><description>This brief presents a 2-lane discrete multitone (DMT) wireline receiver (RX) with a far-end crosstalk (FEXT) cancellation and its implementation on the ZCU111 RFSoC evaluation board for real-time functional verification. The RX datapath is implemented with the 64-parallel 128-tap multi-path delay-feedback (MDF) fast Fourier transform (FFT) to optimize resources and throughput. The multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) frequency-domain equalizer (FDE) compensates both channel insertion loss (IL) and FEXT based on coefficients computed from an on-chip pilot-assist channel estimation (CHEST). The platform includes a programmable logic (PL) for a DMT digital signal processor (DSP) running at 32 MHz, 2.048 GS/s data converters, and intersymbol interference (ISI)/FEXT board. This system enables the reflection of a realistic hardware impairment and real-time transceiver (TRX) operation with a quick bit error rate (BER) test. The measurement demonstrates that the MIMO DMT significantly improves a BER from 1.0E-2 to 5.8E-7 when the FEXT is canceled for a channel exhibiting 15 dB of IL and 10 dB of IL-to-crosstalk ratio (ICR) at Nyquist frequency.</description></item><item><title>A General Methodology and Reconfigurable Architecture for Calculating AB-Like Functions in the Complex Field</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10360289</link><description>We propose a general methodology and reconfigurable architecture for computing  $\boldsymbol {A^{B}}$ -like functions in the complex field.

Experimental results show that compared to the 4-bit multipliers based on pure LUT, pure logic and near-memory computing (NMC) circuits, the multiplier based on HNMC reduces up to 75% delay, 81% area and 80% power consumption; the 8-bit convolution engine based on HNMC increases throughput by 2x and reduces area up to 77% and power consumption up to 40% compared to the state-of-the-art NMC convolution engine.</description></item><item><title>HuNT: Exploiting Heterogeneous PIM Devices to Design a 3-D Manycore Architecture for DNN Training</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745791</link><description>Processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures have emerged as an attractive computing paradigm for accelerating deep neural network (DNN) training and inferencing. However, a plethora of PIM devices, e.g., resistive random-access memory, ferroelectric field-effect transistor, phase change memory, MRAM, static random-access memory, exists and each of these devices offers advantages and drawbacks in terms of power, latency, area, and nonidealities. A heterogeneous architecture that combines the benefits of multiple devices in a single platform can enable energy-efficient and high-performance DNN training and inference. 3-D integration enables the design of such a heterogeneous architecture where multiple planar tiers consisting of different PIM devices can be integrated into a single platform. In this work, we propose the HuNT framework, which hunts for (finds) an optimal DNN neural layer mapping, and planar tier configurations for a 3-D heterogeneous architecture. Overall, our experimental results demonstrate that the HuNT-enabled 3-D heterogeneous architecture achieves up to  $10 {\times }$  and  $3.5 {\times }$  improvement with respect to the homogeneous and existing heterogeneous PIM-based architectures, respectively, in terms of energy-efficiency (TOPS/W). Similarly, the proposed HuNT-enabled architecture outperforms existing homogeneous and heterogeneous architectures by up to  $8 {\times }$  and  $2.4\times $ , respectively, in terms of compute-efficiency (TOPS/mm2) without compromising the final DNN accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Image Processing via Memristive-Based Approximate In-Memory Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745792</link><description>Image processing algorithms continue to demand higher performance from computers. However, computer performance is not improving at the same rate as before. In response to the current challenges in enhancing computing performance, a wave of new technologies and computing paradigms is surfacing. Among these, memristors stand out as one of the most promising components due to their technological prospects and low power consumption. With efficient data storage capabilities and their ability to directly perform logical operations within the memory, they are well-suited for in-memory computation (IMC). Approximate computing emerges as another promising paradigm, offering improved performance metrics, notably speed. The tradeoff for this gain is the reduction of accuracy. In this article, we are using the stateful logic material implication (IMPLY) in the semi-serial topology and combine both the paradigms to further enhance the computational performance. We present three novel approximated adders that drastically improve speed and energy consumption with an normalized mean error distance (NMED) lower than 0.02 for most scenarios. We evaluated partially approximated Ripple carry adder (RCA) at the circuit-level and compared them to the State-of-the-Art (SoA). The proposed adders are applied in different image processing applications and the quality metrics are calculated. While maintaining acceptable quality, our approach achieves significant energy savings of 6%&#8211;38% and reduces the delay (number of computation cycles) by 5%&#8211;35%, demonstrating notable efficiency compared to exact calculations.</description></item><item><title>ARTEMIS: A Mixed Analog-Stochastic In-DRAM Accelerator for Transformer Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745808</link><description>Transformers have emerged as a powerful tool for natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision. Through the attention mechanism, these models have exhibited remarkable performance gains when compared to conventional approaches like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Nevertheless, transformers typically demand substantial execution time due to their extensive computations and large memory footprint. Processing in-memory (PIM) and near-memory computing (NMC) are promising solutions to accelerating transformers as they offer high-compute parallelism and memory bandwidth. However, designing PIM/NMC architectures to support the complex operations and massive amounts of data that need to be moved between layers in transformer neural networks remains a challenge. We propose ARTEMIS, a mixed analog-stochastic in-DRAM accelerator for transformer models. Through employing minimal changes to the conventional DRAM arrays, ARTEMIS efficiently alleviates the costs associated with transformer model execution by supporting stochastic computing for multiplications and temporal analog accumulations using a novel in-DRAM metal-on-metal capacitor. Our analysis indicates that ARTEMIS exhibits at least  $3.0\times $  speedup, and  $1.8\times $  lower energy compared to GPU, TPU, CPU, and state-of-the-art PIM transformer hardware accelerators.</description></item><item><title>Indoor&#8211;Outdoor Energy Management for Wearable IoT Devices With Conformal Prediction and Rollout</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745812</link><description>Internet of Things (IoT) devices have the potential to enable a wide range of applications, including smart health and agriculture. However, they are limited by their small battery capacities. Utilizing energy harvesting is a promising approach to augment the battery life of IoT devices. However, relying solely on harvested energy is insufficient due to the stochastic nature of ambient sources. Predicting and accounting for uncertainty in the energy harvest (EH) is critical for optimal energy management (EM) in wearable IoT devices. This article proposes a two-step uncertainty-aware EH prediction and management framework for wearable IoT devices. First, the framework employs an energy-efficient conformal prediction (CP) method to predict future EH and construct prediction intervals. Contrasting to prior CP approaches, we propose constructing the prediction intervals using a combination of residuals from previous hours and days. Second, the framework proposes a near-optimal EM approach that utilizes a rollout algorithm. The rollout algorithm efficiently simulates various energy allocation trajectories as a function of predicted EH bounds. Using results from the rollout, the proposed approach constructs energy allocation bounds that maximize application utility (quality of service) with a high probability. Evaluations using real-world energy data from ARAS and Mannheim datasets show that the proposed CP for EH prediction provides 93% coverage probability with an average width of 9.5 J and 1.9 J, respectively. Moreover, EM using the rollout algorithm provides energy allocation decisions that are within 1.9&#8211;2.9 J of the optimal with minimal overhead.</description></item><item><title>Balancing Security and Efficiency: System-Informed Mitigation of Power-Based Covert Channels</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745832</link><description>As the digital landscape continues to evolve, the security of computing systems has become a critical concern. Power-based covert channels (e.g., thermal covert channel s (TCCs)), a form of communication that exploits the system resources to transmit information in a hidden or unintended manner, have been recently studied as an effective mechanism to leak information between malicious entities via the modulation of CPU power. To this end, dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) has been widely used as a countermeasure to mitigate TCCs by directly affecting the communication between the actors. Although this technique has proven effective in neutralizing such attacks, it introduces significant performance and energy penalties, that are particularly detrimental to energy-constrained embedded systems. In this article, we propose different system-informed countermeasures to power-based covert channels from the heuristic and machine learning (ML) domains. Our proposed techniques leverage task migration and DVFS to jointly mitigate the channels and maximize energy efficiency. Our extensive experimental evaluation on two commercial platforms: 1) the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 and 2) Jetson Orin shows that our approach significantly improves the overall energy efficiency of the system compared to the state-of-the-art solution while nullifying the attack at all times.</description></item><item><title>FDPUF: Frequency-Domain PUF for Robust Authentication of Edge Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745826</link><description>Counterfeiting, overproduction, and cloning of integrated circuits (ICs) and associated hardware have emerged as major security concerns in the modern globalized microelectronics supply chain. One way to combat these issues effectively is to deploy hardware authentication techniques that utilize physical unclonable functions (PUFs). PUFs utilize intrinsic variations in hardware that occur during the manufacturing and fabrication process to generate device-specific fingerprints or immutable signatures that cannot be replicated by counterfeits and clones. However, unavoidable factors like environmental noise and harmonics can significantly deteriorate the quality of the PUF signature. Besides, conventional PUF solutions are generally not amenable to in-field authentication of hardware, which has emerged as a critical need for Internet of Things (IoT) edge devices to detect physical attacks on them. In this article, we introduce frequency-domain PUF or FDPUF, a novel PUF that analyzes time-domain current waveforms in the frequency domain to create high-quality authentication signatures that are suitable for in-field authentication. FDPUF decomposes electrical signals into their spectral coefficients, filters out unnecessary low-energy components, reconstructs the waveforms, and generates high-quality digital fingerprints for device authentication purposes. Compared to the existing authentication mechanisms, the higher quality of the signatures through the frequency-domain analysis makes the proposed FDPUF more suitable for protecting the integrity of the edge computing hardware. We perform experimental measurements on FPGA and analyze FDPUF properties using the National Institute of Standards and Technology test suite to demonstrate that the FDPUF provides better uniqueness and robustness than its time-domain counterpart while being attractive for in-field authentication.</description></item><item><title>HMC-FHE: A Heterogeneous Near Data Processing Framework for Homomorphic Encryption</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745817</link><description>Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) offers a promising solution to ensure data privacy by enabling computations directly on encrypted data. However, its notorious performance degradation severely limits the practical application, due to the explosion of both the ciphertext volume and computation. In this article, leveraging the diversity of computing power and memory bandwidth requirements of FHE operations, we present HMC-FHE, a robust acceleration framework that combines both GPU and hybrid memory cube (HMC) processing engines to accelerate FHE applications cooperatively. HMC-FHE incorporates four key hardware/software co-design techniques: 1) a fine-grained kernel offloading mechanism to efficiently offload FHE operations to relevant processing engines; 2) a ciphertext partitioning scheme to minimize data transfer across decentralized HMC processing engines; 3) an FHE operation pipeline scheme to facilitate pipelined execution between GPU and HMC engines; and 4) a kernel tuning scheme to guarantee the parallelism of GPU and HMC engines. We demonstrate that the GPU-HMC architecture with proper resource management serves as a promising acceleration scheme for memory-intensive FHE operations. Compared with the state-of-the-art GPU-based acceleration scheme, the proposed framework achieves up to  $2.65\times $  performance gains and reduces  $1.81\times $  energy consumption with the same peak computation capacity.</description></item><item><title>iFKVS: Lightweight Key-Value Store for Flash-Based Intermittently Computing Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745833</link><description>Energy harvesting enables long-running sensing applications on tiny Internet of Things (IoT) devices without a battery installed. To overcome the intermittency of ambient energy sources, system software creates intermittent computation using checkpoints. While the scope of intermittent computation is quickly expanding, there is a strong demand for data storage and local data processing in such IoT devices. When considering data storage options, flash memory is more compelling than other types of nonvolatile memory due to its affordability and availability. We introduce iFKVS, a flash-based key-value store for multisensor IoT devices. In this study, we aim at supporting efficient key-value operations while guaranteeing the correctness of program execution across power interruptions. For indexing of multidimensional sensor data, we propose a quadtree-based structure for the minimization of extra writes from splitting and rebalancing; for checkpointing in flash storage, we propose a rollback-based algorithm that exploits the capabilities of byte-level writing and one-way bit flipping of flash memory. Experimental results based on a real energy-driven testbed demonstrate that with the same index structure design, our rollback-based approach obtains a significant reduction of 45% and 84% in the total execution time compared with checkpointing using write-ahead logging (WAL) and copying on write (COW), respectively.</description></item><item><title>MII: A Multifaceted Framework for Intermittence-Aware Inference and Scheduling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745805</link><description>The concurrent execution of deep neural networks (DNNs) inference tasks on the intermittently-powered batteryless devices (IPDs) has recently garnered much attention due to its potential in a broad range of smart sensing applications. While the checkpointing mechanisms (CMs) provided by the state-of-the-art make this possible, scheduling inference tasks on IPDs is still a complex problem due to significant performance variations across the DNN layers and CM choices. This complexity is further accentuated by dynamic environmental conditions and inherent resource constraints of IPDs. To tackle these challenges, we present MII, a framework designed for the intermittence-aware inference and scheduling on IPDs. MII formulates the shutdown and live time functions of an IPD from profiling the data, which our offline intermittence-aware search scheme uses to find the optimal layer-wise CMs for each task. At runtime, MII enhances the job success rates by dynamically making scheduling decisions to mitigate the workload losses from the power interruptions and adjusting these CMs in response to the actual energy patterns. Our evaluation demonstrates the superiority of MII over the state-of-the-art. In controlled environments, MII achieves an average increase of 21% and 39% in successful jobs under the stable and dynamic energy patterns. In the real-world settings, MII achieves 33% and 24% more successful jobs indoors and outdoors.</description></item><item><title>Hardware and Software Co-Design for Optimized Decoding Schemes and Application Mapping in NVM Compute-in-Memory Architectures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745789</link><description>The computation-in nonvolatile memory (NVM-CiM) approach addresses the growing computational demands and the memory-wall problem faced by traditional processor-centric architectures. Computation-in-memory (CiM) capitalizes on the parallel nature of memory arrays enabling effective computation through multirow memristor reading and sensing. In this context, the conventional design of memory decoders needs to be accordingly modified for efficient multirow activation and parallel data processing. This article presents the design and optimization of address decoders for NVM-CiM system architectures, employing a cross-layer co-optimization approach that integrates circuit and architecture design with application requirements. Our methodology starts at the circuit level, examining various decoder designs, including cascaded, hierarchical, latched, and hybrid models. An in-depth application-level characterization follows, utilizing an extended NVM-CiM-capable gem5 simulator to assess the impact of these decoders on the mapping of CiM-friendly applications and the resulting system performance, particularly in facilitating rapid and efficient activation of multirow memory configurations. This holistic analysis allows us to identify the bottlenecks and requirements from the application side and adjust the design of the decoder accordingly. Our analysis reveals that Hybrid Decoders significantly decrease latency and power consumption compared to other decoder designs within NVM-CiM systems. This highlights the crucial role of the decoder&#8217;s row selection flexibility, reducing additional system-level data movement even at the expense of its performance, can substantially improve the overall efficiency of NVM-CiM systems.</description></item><item><title>EMI: Energy Management Meets Imputation in Wearable IoT Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745818</link><description>Wearable and Internet of Things (IoT) devices are becoming popular in several applications, such as health monitoring, wide area sensing, and digital agriculture. These devices are energy-constrained due to limited battery capacities. As such, IoT devices harvest energy from the environment and manage it to prolong operation of the system. Stochastic nature of ambient energy, coupled with small battery sizes may lead to insufficient energy for obtaining data from all sensors. As a result, sensors either have to be duty cycled or subsampled to meet the energy budget. However, machine learning (ML) models for these applications are typically trained with the assumption that data from all sensors are available, leading to loss in accuracy. To overcome this, we propose a novel approach that combines data imputation with energy management (EM). Data imputation aims to substitute missing data with appropriate values so that complete sensor data are available for application processing, while EM makes energy budget decisions on the devices. We use the energy budget to obtain complete data from as many sensors as possible and turn off other sensors instead of duty cycling all sensors. Then, we use a low-overhead imputation technique for unavailable sensors and use them in ML models. Evaluations with six diverse datasets show that the proposed EM with imputation approach achieves 25%&#8211;55% higher accuracy when compared to duty cycling or subsampling without using additional energy.</description></item><item><title>Search-in-Memory: Reliable, Versatile, and Efficient Data Matching in SSD&#8217;s NAND Flash Memory Chip for Data Indexing Acceleration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745821</link><description>To index the increasing volume of data, modern data indexes are typically stored on solid-state drives and cached in DRAM. However, searching such an index has resulted in significant I/O traffic due to limited access locality and inefficient cache utilization. At the heart of index searching is the operation of filtering through vast data spans to isolate a small, relevant subset, which involves basic equality tests rather than the complex arithmetic provided by modern CPUs. This article demonstrates the feasibility of performing data filtering directly within a NAND flash memory chip, transmitting only relevant search results rather than complete pages. Instead of adding complex circuits, we propose repurposing existing circuitry for efficient and accurate bitwise parallel matching. We demonstrate how different data structures can use our flexible SIMD command interface to offload index searches. This strategy not only frees up the CPU for more computationally demanding tasks, but it also optimizes DRAM usage for write buffering, significantly lowering energy consumption associated with I/O transmission between the CPU and DRAM. Extensive testing across a wide range of workloads reveals up to a  $9\times $  speedup in write-heavy workloads and up to 45% energy savings due to reduced read and write I/O. Furthermore, we achieve significant reductions in median and tail read latencies of up to 89% and 85%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>NOVELLA: Nonvolatile Last-Level Cache Bypass for Optimizing Off-Chip Memory Energy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745830</link><description>Contemporary multiprocessor systems-on-chips (MPSoCs) continue to confront energy-related challenges, primarily originating from off-chip data movements. Nonvolatile memories (NVMs) emerge as a promising solution with their high-storage density and low leakage, yet they suffer from slow and expensive write operations. Writebacks from higher-level caches and responses from off-chip memory create significant contention at the shared nonvolatile last-level cache (LLC), affecting system performance with increased queuing for critical reads. Previous research primarily addresses the performance issues by trying to mitigate contention through the bypassing of NVM writes. Nevertheless, off-chip memory energy, one of the most critical components of system energy, remains unaddressed by state-of-the-art bypass policies. While certain energy components, such as leakage and refresh, depend on system performance, performance-optimizing bypass policies may not ensure energy efficiency. Aggressive bypass decisions aimed only at performance enhancement could degrade cache reuse, potentially outweighing reductions in leakage and refresh energies with the increase in off-chip dynamic energy. While both performance and off-chip memory energy are influenced by both cache contention and reuse, the tradeoffs for achieving optimal performance versus optimal energy are different. We introduce nonvolatile last-level cache bypass for optimizing off-chip memory energy (NOVELLA), a novel bypass policy for the nonvolatile LLC, to optimize off-chip memory energy by exploiting tradeoffs between cache contention and reuse, achieving a balance across different components of the energy. Compared to a na&#239;ve no-bypass baseline, while state-of-the-art reuse-aware bypass solutions reduce off-chip memory energy consumption by up to 8%, and a contention- and reuse-aware bypass baseline by 12%, NOVELLA achieves significant energy savings of 21% across diverse SPEC workloads.</description></item><item><title>NDPGNN: A Near-Data Processing Architecture for GNN Training and Inference Acceleration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745796</link><description>Graph neural networks (GNNs) require a large number of fine-grained memory accesses, which results in inefficient use of bandwidth resources.

NDPGNN provides different operating modes to meet the acceleration needs of various GNN frameworks while ensuring the configurability and scalability of the system. NDPGNN takes advantage of data locality characteristics to repeatedly distribute and utilize data, thereby reducing memory access requirements, and further improving memory access efficiency by combining a subgraph sparse node scheduling strategy with intermediate result reuse. We use data packaging to provide a higher effective data ratio for long-distance data transmission, thereby improving the utilization of the system&#8217;s limited bandwidth resources. Compared with the previous method, NDPGNN brings 5.68 times improvement in system performance while reducing energy consumption overhead by 8.49 times.</description></item><item><title>Deeploy: Enabling Energy-Efficient Deployment of Small Language Models on Heterogeneous Microcontrollers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745806</link><description>With the rise of embodied foundation models (EFMs), most notably small language models (SLMs), adapting Transformers for the edge applications has become a very active field of research. However, achieving the end-to-end deployment of SLMs on the microcontroller (MCU)-class chips without high-bandwidth off-chip main memory access is still an open challenge. In this article, we demonstrate high efficiency end-to-end SLM deployment on a multicore RISC-V (RV32) MCU augmented with ML instruction extensions and a hardware neural processing unit (NPU). To automate the exploration of the constrained, multidimensional memory versus computation tradeoffs involved in the aggressive SLM deployment on the heterogeneous (multicore+NPU) resources, we introduce Deeploy, a novel deep neural network (DNN) compiler, which generates highly optimized C code requiring minimal runtime support. We demonstrate that Deeploy generates the end-to-end code for executing SLMs, fully exploiting the RV32 cores&#8217; instruction extensions and the NPU. We achieve leading-edge energy and throughput of  $490 \; \mu $ J per token, at 340 token per second for an SLM trained on the TinyStories dataset, running for the first time on an MCU-class device without the external memory.</description></item><item><title>SENTINEL: Securing Indoor Localization Against Adversarial Attacks With Capsule Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745762</link><description>With the increasing demand for edge device-powered location-based services in indoor environments, Wi-Fi received signal strength (RSS) fingerprinting has become popular, given the unavailability of GPS indoors. However, achieving robust and efficient indoor localization faces several challenges, due to RSS fluctuations from dynamic changes in indoor environments and heterogeneity of edge devices, leading to diminished localization accuracy. While advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in mitigating these phenomena, it remains an open problem. Additionally, emerging threats from adversarial attacks on ML-enhanced indoor localization systems, especially those introduced by malicious or rogue access points (APs), can deceive ML models to further increase localization errors. To address these challenges, we present SENTINEL, a novel embedded ML framework utilizing modified capsule neural networks to bolster the resilience of indoor localization solutions against adversarial attacks, device heterogeneity, and dynamic RSS fluctuations. We also introduce RSSRogueLoc, a novel dataset capturing the effects of rogue APs from several real-world indoor environments.

This work proposes a region of interest (ROI)-driven method, which focuses on the promising ROIs to reduce the over-exploration on the huge design space and improve the optimization efficiency. A tree structure based on self-organizing map (SOM) networks is proposed to partition the design space into ROIs. To reduce the high dimensionality of design space, a variable selection technique based on a sensitivity matrix is developed to prune unimportant design parameters and efficiently hit the optimum inside the ROIs. Moreover, an asynchronous parallel strategy is employed to further save the time taken by simulations. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, achieving improvements of up to 43.82% in performance, 33.20% in power consumption, and 11.41% in area compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description></item><item><title>Runtime Monitoring of ML-Based Scheduling Algorithms Toward Robust Domain-Specific SoCs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745816</link><description>Machine learning (ML) algorithms are being rapidly adopted to perform dynamic resource management tasks in heterogeneous system on chips. For example, ML-based task schedulers can make quick, high-quality decisions at runtime. Like any ML model, these offline-trained policies depend critically on the representative power of the training data. Hence, their performance may diminish or even catastrophically fail under unknown workloads, especially new applications. This article proposes a novel framework to continuously monitor the system to detect unforeseen scenarios using a gradient-based generalization metric called coherence. The proposed framework accurately determines whether the current policy generalizes to new inputs. If not, it incrementally trains the ML scheduler to ensure the robustness of the task-scheduling decisions. The proposed framework is evaluated thoroughly with a domain-specific SoC and six real-world applications. It can detect whether the trained scheduler generalizes to the current workload with 88.75%&#8211;98.39% accuracy. Furthermore, it enables  $1.1\times -14\times $  faster execution time when the scheduler is incrementally trained. Finally, overhead analysis performed on an Nvidia Jetson Xavier NX board shows that the proposed framework can run as a real-time background task.</description></item><item><title>Near-Free Lifetime Extension for 3-D nand Flash via Opportunistic Self-Healing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745809</link><description>3-D nand flash memories are the dominant storage media in modern data centers due to their high performance, large storage capacity, and low-power consumption. However, the lifetime of flash memory has decreased as technology scaling advances. Recent work has revealed that the number of achievable program/erase (P/E) cycles of flash blocks is related to the dwell time (DT) between two adjacent erase operations. A longer DT can lead to higher-achievable P/E cycles and, therefore, a longer lifetime for flash memories. This article found that the achievable P/E cycles would increase when flash blocks endure uneven DT distribution. Based on this observation, this article presents an opportunistic self-healing method to extend the lifetime of flash memory. By maintaining two groups with unequal block counts, namely, Active Group and Healing Group, the proposed method creates an imbalance in erase operation distribution. The Active Group undergoes more frequent erase operations, resulting in shorter DT, while the Healing Group experiences longer DT. Periodically, the roles of the two groups are switched based on the Active Group&#8217;s partitioning ratio. This role switching ensures that each block experiences both short and long DT periods, leading to an uneven DT distribution that magnifies the self-healing effect. The evaluation shows that the proposed method can improve the flash lifetime by 19.3% and 13.2% on average with near-free overheads, compared with the baseline and the related work, respectively.</description></item><item><title>ECG: Augmenting Embedded Operating System Fuzzing via LLM-Based Corpus Generation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745813</link><description>Embedded operating systems (Embedded OSs) power much of our critical infrastructure but are, in general, much less tested for bugs than general-purpose operating systems. Fuzzing Embedded OSs encounter significant roadblocks due to much less documented specifications, an inherent ineffectiveness in generating high-quality payloads. In this article, we propose ECG, an Embedded OS fuzzer empowered by large language models (LLMs) to sufficiently mitigate the aforementioned issues. ECG approaches fuzzing Embedded OS by automatically generating input specifications based on readily available source code and documentation, instrumenting and intercepting execution behavior for directional guidance information, and generating inputs with payloads according to the pregenerated input specifications and directional hints provided from previous runs. These methods are empowered by using an interactive refinement method to extract the most from LLMs while using established parsing checkers to validate the outputs. Our evaluation results demonstrate that ECG uncovered 32 new vulnerabilities across three popular open-source Embedded OS (RT-Linux, RaspiOS, and OpenWrt) and detected ten bugs in a commercial Embedded OS running on an actual device. Moreover, compared to Syzkaller, Moonshine, KernelGPT, Rtkaller, and DRLF, ECG has achieved additional kernel code coverage improvements of 23.20%, 19.46%, 10.96%, 15.47%, and 11.05%, respectively, with an overall average improvement of 16.02%. These results underscore ECG&#8217;s enhanced capability in uncovering vulnerabilities, thus contributing to the overall robustness and security of the Embedded OS.</description></item><item><title>BERN-NN-IBF: Enhancing Neural Network Bound Propagation Through Implicit Bernstein Form and Optimized Tensor Operations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745795</link><description>Neural networks have emerged as powerful tools across various domains, exhibiting remarkable empirical performance that motivated their widespread adoption in safety-critical applications, which, in turn, necessitates rigorous formal verification techniques to ensure their reliability and robustness. Tight bound propagation plays a crucial role in the formal verification process by providing precise bounds that can be used to formulate and verify properties, such as safety, robustness, and fairness. While state-of-the-art tools use linear and convex approximations to compute upper/lower bounds for each neuron&#8217;s outputs, recent advances have shown that nonlinear approximations based on Bernstein polynomials lead to tighter bounds but suffer from scalability issues. To that end, this article introduces BERN-NN-IBF, a significant enhancement of the Bernstein-polynomial-based bound propagation algorithms. BERN-NN-IBF offers three main contributions: 1) a memory-efficient encoding of Bernstein polynomials to scale the bound propagation algorithms; 2) optimized tensor operations for the new polynomial encoding to maintain the integrity of the bounds while enhancing computational efficiency; and 3) tighter under-approximations of the ReLU activation function using quadratic polynomials tailored to minimize approximation errors. Through comprehensive testing, we demonstrate that BERN-NN-IBF achieves tighter bounds and higher computational efficiency compared to the original BERN-NN and state-of-the-art methods, including linear and convex programming used within the winner of the VNN-COMPETITION.</description></item></channel></rss>
