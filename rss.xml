Such a complexity challenges conventional magnetic core loss modeling methods, which are often prone to serious errors or only applicable to certain types of excitation waveforms. This article presents History-Dependent Prandtl-Ishlinskii Neural Network (HDPI-NN) for accurate quasi-static core loss prediction under arbitrary excitations. The high modeling accuracy and generality of HDPI-NN, is achieved by accounting for a more complete set of magnetization mechanism (i.e., domain wall motion, domain rotation, and memory effect) of magnetic materials, with model parameters determined by a specialized neural network. Quasi-static magnetic loss measurements for silicon steel B35A270 and ferrite N87 were acquired to support model training. The reliability of the proposed model has been confirmed through rigorous verification and comparative experiments. The results show that the proposed HDPI-NN model, even when trained only with 200+ data containing symmetric and low-frequency harmonics, is able to accurately predict the hysteresis behavior of the magnetic material excited under dc bias and/or higher frequency harmonic conditions.</description></item><item><title>Thin-Film Encapsulation Solution for High-Temperature SiC Power Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10917008</link><description>Wide bandgap semiconductors like silicon carbide (SiC) are capable to operate at temperature above 250 &#176;C. However, current encapsulations cannot work at temperature above 175 &#176;C, making high-temperature (&#8805;250 &#176;C) packaging of SiC devices still a challenge. This article introduces an innovative high-temperature packaging scheme for SiC power devices, utilizing a multilayered Parylene HT/Al2O3 composite film (MPACF). By implementing a cross-stacked organic Parylene HT and inorganic Al2O3 multilayer structure, the pathway for external moisture and oxygen to reach the SiC chips at elevated temperatures is blocked, reducing the risk of moisture/oxygen contact and circumventing the thermal oxidation process associated with traditional organic packaging materials. After further modifying the interface between the encapsulation material and the substrate with a silane coupling agent, the adhesion strength has been significantly enhanced. The MPACF ensures a high operational temperature and a low coefficient of thermal expansion, effectively safeguarding the SiC devices in the hashed condition. Reliability tests including 1500 cycles of thermal shock ranging from &#8722;55 &#176;C to 250 &#176;C and 500 h high-temperature aging at 250 &#176;C have been carried on the encapsulated SiC devices, the adhesion strength of MPACF is well preserved at 5B and the devices exhibited outstanding static characteristics and switching performance.</description></item><item><title>A Constant Switching Frequency Real-Time Digital Control for ZVS Four-Switch-Buck-Boost Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916573</link><description>In this article, a constant switching frequency real-time digital control scheme is proposed for the four-switch buck-boost converter. With this control scheme, all the power switches can realize zero-voltage-switching, and the ripple and root-mean-square value of the inductor current can be minimized in the whole voltage and load ranges. Since all the control variables in any operation mode are obtained in real-time with one closed-loop PI controller and simple calculations, the inductor current in each switching cycle is optimized, and smooth operation mode transition and high dynamic response in the step change of load or input voltage is achieved. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified with a 300 W prototype.</description></item><item><title>Multifrequency Resonant Compensated Wireless Power Transfer SRM Drive System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891195</link><description>In this article, a multifrequency resonant compensated wireless power transfer (WPT) switched reluctance motor (SRM) with zero voltage switching (ZVS) capability is proposed. The system utilizes dual decoupled resonant tanks on the transmitting side and hybrid compensation on the receiving side to achieve multifrequency resonant WPT. In addition, the operating frequencies of the primary inverter are regulated to drive the corresponding SRM phases. The implementation of this method mainly consists of the following steps: First, the number and value of resonant frequencies were optimized to construct multiple power channels, thereby avoiding unexpected energy transfer between the main resonant circuits and overcurrent of the transmitter, and reducing cross-interference between channels. Then, the transmitting coils are overlapped to avoid internal magnetic connections, while the position of the receiving coils is adjusted to realize asymmetric coupling, thereby achieving current equalization in the SRM windings. Moreover, the optimized design of multifrequency resonant compensation networks is developed to reduce the system sensitivity to inductance mismatching and achieve the ZVS of the inverter with the minimized input impedance angle. After that, alternating excitation of single or dual phases can be achieved via a hybrid resonant excitation strategy. Finally, experiments were implemented in a 6/4 SRM-based test-bed, which verified the feasibility of the proposed system.</description></item><item><title>Charging Strategy of Electrolytic Capacitorless Integrated OBC for Electric Vehicles With High-Frequency Voltage Pulses in Intermediate Link</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10902105</link><description>This article proposes a high-frequency voltage-pulse intermediate-link based charging method for the integrated onboard charger (OBC) of the electric vehicle, which can operate at bidirectional charging mode and electric traction mode without electrolytic capacitor. The integrated OBC has a two-stage configuration, consisting of a dual active bridge (DAB) dc&#8211;dc converter and a three-phase four-leg (TPFL) dc&#8211;ac converter. To improve the reliability and power density of the integrated OBC, an auxiliary circuit with a 10 &#956;F film capacitor is employed to replace the large electrolytic capacitor in the intermediate link between DAB and TPFL converters. Different from previous charging methods based on boosting operation and extended phase-shift operation for this electrolytic capacitorless OBC, the proposed method can generate the high-frequency voltage pulses in the intermediate link. Thus, most of the power devices can realize the zero voltage switching, the efficiency of the system is improved and the current peaks of DAB converter can be reduced. In addition, the charging currents with small harmonic components and high power factor can be maintained for the proposed charging method. Both simulation and experiments have been presented to verify validity of the proposed charging scheme for the integrated OBC.</description></item><item><title>An Enhanced Grid-Tied Off-Board Electric Vehicle Charger With Improved Power Quality Using Unified Control Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10904272</link><description>This article introduces a multifunctional electric vehicle charger (EVC) equipped with innovative control methodologies. In the proposed configuration, the grid-side converter (GSC) is equipped with an adaptive model predictive direct power control (AMP-DPC) system and dual active bridge dc&#8211;dc bidirectional converter controlled by modified direct power control (MDPC). These control strategies are designed to improve the power quality (PQ) of power grid, simultaneously ensuring efficient electric vehicle (EV) charging. The AMP-DPC approach utilizes a second-order generalized integrator (SOGI) to generate synchronization templates specifically tailored for single-phase systems. This control framework optimizes the switching sequence by minimizing a cost function, and crucially, it operates without dependency on a weighting factor, thus adapting seamlessly to various modulation scenarios without additional configuration. The study explores the interplay between instantaneous power and inductance imbalance on the ac side, observing that inductance mismatch impacts reactive power. A quantitative formulation for reactive power due to inductance deviation is experimentally validated, with an estimation technique proposed to mitigate its effects. A comprehensive stability analysis of the system has been performed here to further check the robustness of the EVC. Designed for unity power factor (UPF) in both grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) operations, the EVC maintains low harmonic distortion during charging and discharging mode. Vehicle-to-load (V2L) mode provides a reliable UPS for home ac loads during power outages. Experimental validation on a 0.5 kW prototype confirms the effectiveness of the control system in meeting IEEE 519 standards.</description></item><item><title>Series Thyristor Branches-Based Protection for Hybrid MMCs Against Valve-Side Single-Phase-to-Ground Faults in Bipolar HVDC Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10906540</link><description>The valve-side single-phase-to-ground (SPG) fault is one of the key challenges for hybrid modular multilevel converter (HMMC)-based bipolar high voltage direct current systems. In this article, the valve-side SPG fault characteristics of HMMCs are analyzed in detail, revealing that not only the submodules (SMs) in upper arms are severely overcharged, but also the full-bridge SMs in lower arms suffer unbearable overvoltage, which may destroy the devices. A series thyristor branches-based protection strategy is proposed in this article, which can handle the faults with the advantages of low SM capacitor overvoltage, low semiconductor cost, low ac-side overcurrent, and no arm overcurrent. Electromagnetic transient simulation studies using PSCAD/EMTDC tool and experimental studies with a laboratory scaled hardware prototype are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Sliding Mode Observer-Based Robust Switch Fault Diagnosis of Bidirectional Interleaved Converters for Energy Storage System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10908094</link><description>Reliable operation of the dc&#8211;dc power converter interfaced with the energy storage system is vital for many mission-critical applications, where a reliable fault diagnosis is essential. In this article, a robust switch open-circuit fault diagnosis method based on sliding mode observer is proposed and then applied to a bidirectional interleaved buck/boost converter for the energy storage system. It uses the sliding mode observer to generate the residual, which is then sent to the evaluation module to make the fault decisions. Thanks to the robustness of the sliding mode control algorithm, the generated residual decouples the uncertainties and disturbances with the switch faults. Therefore, it shows strong immunity to the circuit parameter uncertainties and load disturbances. Furthermore, as the diagnosis variables, namely, the inductor currents, are within the closed-loop control system, the extra sensors are not needed. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed fault diagnosis method have been demonstrated by both the simulation and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Aging and Lifetime of Power Module Packaging Insulation Due to Partial Discharge Under High dV/dt Square Wave Voltage and High Temperature</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10908700</link><description>The application of wide bandgap semiconductors poses challenges to the packaging reliability of power modules under high dV/dt square wave voltage and high temperatures. The partial discharge (PD) occurring in the encapsulant is one of the main causes resulting in packaging insulation aging and failure. However, limited research focuses on the effects of temperature and square wave parameters on packaging insulation aging principle and the exact mechanisms remain largely unknown. To address that, this article focuses on the aging process of power module packaging insulation due to PD under high dV/dt square wave and high-temperature coupling stresses. The specially designed down-mixing PD detection system is applied to extract PD signals during aging. The experimental results indicate that the magnitude of PD shows a fluctuating growth trend during aging, and PD activity reaches severest before breakdown. As the temperature rises, the lifetime of the power module packaging insulation decreases, accompanied by an increase in the magnitude and pulse repetition rate of PDs. The longer rise time and lower voltage frequency of the square wave usually lead to longer lifetimes. The effects of temperature, rise time, and voltage frequency on PD behaviors are analyzed based on the discharge mechanism and finite element electric field simulation. Moreover, the total accumulation damage of PD during aging is primarily correlated with temperature, and based on that, the lifetime estimation model of power module packaging insulation considering temperature and PD aging factors is proposed for the first time, which provides the reference for the condition evaluation of the power module.</description></item><item><title>Reliability Improved Discontinuous Pulse Width Modulation for NPC Inverters Operated at High Modulation Index</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909586</link><description>In a three-level neutral point clamped (NPC) inverter, the power devices and dc-link capacitors are considered the most reliability-critical components, and their wear-out failure is primarily caused by thermal loading resulting from power losses. It has been found in a previous study that a discontinuous pulse width modulation (DPWM) reduces the power loss and improves the reliability of power devices. However, it reduces the reliability of the dc-link capacitors, and thus the reliability of the NPC inverter. This article proposes a DPWM method called reliability improved DPWM (RI-DPWM) to improve the reliability of the NPC inverter by reducing the thermal loadings of both the power devices and dc-link capacitors while keeping the advantage of the conventional DPWM, reducing the power loss without additional deterioration in output current total harmonic distortion compared with conventional DPWM. The proposed RI-DPWM method is a good alternative to the conventional DPWM to improve the efficiency and reliability of the NPC inverter operated at high modulation index which is greater than or equal to 0.898 with a power factor of 1 or close to 1. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through simulations and experiments.</description></item><item><title>Quantitative Characteristics of the Rotary Machinery Fault Signatures in Induction Motor Stator Current: Modeling and Evaluation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10921733</link><description>Induction motor drivetrains are commonly utilized as the power unit of various industrial equipment. By taking the induction motor itself as a built-in sensor and analyzing the stator current, noncontact health condition monitoring of the rotary machinery in the drivetrain can be realized. Reported works on this topic have qualitatively validated the effectiveness of such technique, yet its applicable boundary has not been quantitatively elaborated. This article analytically models the strength of the rotary machinery fault signatures in stator current based on electromechanical coupling. The correctness of the proposed quantitative model and its nonlinear characteristics are numerically validated via finite-element simulations. Experiments under impulsive load torque oscillation and gear wear degradation further quantitatively evaluate the applicable boundary of the stator-current-based fault detection in real-world applications. The proposed analytical model and the revealed quantitative characteristics can help optimize the utilization of induction motor stator current analysis in the predictive maintenance of induction motor drivetrain.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Open-Circuit Fault Detection and Localization Method for the CLLC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10915541</link><description>This article proposes a novel method for open-circuit fault detection and localization (OCFDL) in CLLC converters, which is characterized by high speed and independence from output load. The precise location of the open-circuit fault (OCF) is rapidly identified using voltage waveforms across the terminals of the resonance tank capacitor. After fault detection (FD), the converter employs a backup leg to address the issue and ensure uninterrupted power transmission. Compared to existing OCFDL methods, the proposed approach offers lower complexity, reduced implementation costs, and load independence. Experimental validation using a laboratory prototype demonstrates the theoretical advantages of the method in terms of speed, robustness, and effectiveness. Experimental results confirm the proposed method's ability to accurately detect and localize faults within 25 $\mu \text{s}$ and replace the faulty switch, ensuring reliable operation.</description></item><item><title>Thermal Balance Oriented Model Predictive Control for 100 kHz Large-Signal Parallel Inverters With Optimized Pulse Patterns</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10918712</link><description>In sound navigation and ranging, the parallel inverters are required to drive electroacoustic transducers to emit 100 kHz acoustic waves. Optimized pulse patterns (OPPs) can achieve the wide bandwidth of the parallel inverters with high switching frequency utilization. However, the junction temperatures of parallel inverters by using OPPs are imbalanced at a low carrier ratio. The inductance mismatches exacerbate the reliability issue. Therefore, this article proposes a thermal balance oriented model predictive control (TBOMPC) for 100 kHz Large-Signal Parallel Inverters with OPPs. First, the principle and the reliability of OPPs are analyzed. Then, the mathematical model is constructed for the inductance parameters. The initial switching states of TBOMPC are designed to identify the inductance parameters. The proposed TBOMPC takes account of the inductance mismatches and redistributes the switching states of OPPs, which can effectively balance the junction temperatures of power devices at a low carrier ratio. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the experimental results. The maximum junction temperature differences of TBOMPC are less than 1.5&#176;C under inductance mismatches.</description></item><item><title>Feature Enhancement and Extraction Method of Parallel Arc Fault in Three-Phase Motor and Frequency Converter Load Circuit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10919210</link><description>The parallel arc fault is one of the most important causes of electrical fire. However, there is no effective detection method for parallel arc fault. To solve this problem, a fault feature enhancement method based on energy transformation and reconstruction of modal components and a fault feature extraction method based on non-negative matrix factorization were proposed. First, the parallel arc fault experiments under different load current and current-limiting resistor conditions were carried out in the three-phase motor and frequency converter load circuit. Second, the current signal was decomposed into k modal components by using adaptive empirical wavelet transform, and the energy transformation and reconstruction of each modal component were performed in turn to enhance the fault features. Third, the parallel arc fault features were extracted from the enhancement signals by using two-stage non-negative matrix factorization dimension reduction. Finally, the performance of the fault feature enhancement and extraction method was tested by using the identification model established with a least squares support vector machine. The results indicated that the proposed method can effectively enhance and extract the parallel arc fault features from the current signals, and the detection accuracy of the parallel arc fault can reach more than 95%.</description></item><item><title>Power Management of Hybrid Flywheel-Battery Energy Storage Systems Considering the State of Charge and Power Ramp Rate</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10904163</link><description>A flywheel and lithium-ion battery's complementary power and energy characteristics offer grid services with an enhanced power response, energy capacity, and cycling capability with a prolonged system lifetime. Real-time power management and considering storage components' state of charge (SoC) and ramp rate are crucial for optimizing performance. However, there is a need for further improvements in SoC correction techniques and rigorous, realistic testing to ensure accurate and efficient management strategies. This article proposes a Moving Average (MA) and fuzzy logic-based power management for a Hybrid Flywheel and battery energy storage system that optimally share the power among the two technologies, considering the flywheel's SoC and the battery's ramp rate as the most concerning variable of each technology. The system minimizes SoC and ramp rate imbalances by integrating MAs for dynamic energy demand adjustments and fuzzy logic controllers for efficient power redistribution. A power Hardware-in-the-Loop experimental validation utilizing a 120 kW, 7.2 kWh flywheel-based energy storage system coupled with a simulated battery demonstrates improved SoC correction and ramp rate management performance.</description></item><item><title>Robust Coordination Control Strategy for Large-Scale Alkaline Water Electrolyzers Driven by Renewable Energy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10906548</link><description>The multiparalleled alkaline water electrolyzers (AWE) system driven by renewable energy has received increasing attention from researchers. However, time-varying renewable energy sources can affect AWEs&#8217; temperatures, and thus change their capacity. Under this condition, if the constant droop control coefficient is still adopted, it is prone to result in inaccurate power sharing. Furthermore, the changes in AWE's parameters can worsen the control performance of the traditional PI controller. Unfortunately, these are seldom considered in AWE control system design in the existing literature. Thus, there is an urgent need to conduct an in-depth investigation into the AWE system control strategy under the temperature fluctuation condition. In this article, a droop coefficient adjustment and self-tuning fuzzy PI controller (STFPIC)&#8211;based adaptive droop control strategy is proposed. Unlike the conventional droop control where the droop coefficients are fixed, the droop coefficients here are adjusted according to the AWE temperature measured in real time. The core of the STFPIC is the fuzzy domain which is modified according to the AWE temperature. Finally, based on an electrolysis hydrogen experimental platform, which includes the AWEs and the proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified. The experimental results show that the proposed control strategy can not only promote accurate power distribution and improve the dynamic performance of AWEs but also have a positive impact on PEM electrolyzers.</description></item><item><title>Global Flexible Power Control of Photovoltaic Systems Under Partial Shading Conditions Based on Direct Multipeak P-V Curve-Fitting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10908082</link><description>Accurately and flexibly tracking the operating point of photovoltaic (PV) system under partial shading condition (PSC) is challenging due to the multipeak feature of power-voltage (P-V) curve, especially with the aim of flexible power control (FPC). This article proposes a global FPC (GFPC) method based on a direct multipeak curve-fitting of PV system under PSC. First, an optimized search skip and judgment&#8211;global maximum power point tracking (GMPPT) method is applied to accurately and quickly track the maximum power point. During the GMPPT process, the key points on the P-V curve, e.g., local MPPs and stationary points, are recorded, which are then applied for direct fitting of the multipeak P-V curve. Subsequently, a pseudomonotonic P-V curve is developed as a reference for locating the flexible power point according to the GFPC demands. The directly obtained pseudomonoatomic P-V curve enables fast and flexible power adjustments without redundant perturbation and tracking processes. The results of simulations on MATLAB/Simulink and experiments on StarSim platform demonstrate that the proposed GFPC method can quickly and accurately adjust the PV power adapting to flexible control demands and grid support requirements. Then, the flexibility and adaptability of PV systems as well as the stability of power grid are enhanced.</description></item><item><title>Interaction Large-Signal Stability Analysis of M3C and GFM/GFL Hybrid Control Strategies Converters Based on the Novel Fuzzy Tensor Space Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10908062</link><description>This article proposes a novel fuzzy tensor space method to analyze the interaction large-signal stability of modular multilevel matrix converter and grid-forming/following (GFM/GFL) hybrid control strategy converters. By addressing the challenges of high-order, strong nonlinearity, and multi-frequency coupling in the system's dynamic model, the complexity is reduced from exponential to constant levels using sector nonlinearity theory. It is achieved by optimizing the original membership function set into a linearly independent fuzzy tensor basis. In addition, leveraging the physical significance of the fuzzy tensor space reduces the mapping area for solving the Lyapunov functional problem, effectively lowering the conservatism. Furthermore, the stability analysis results obtained from this method offer a better balance of complexity and accuracy compared to traditional TS fuzzy theory. Based on the improved method, the complex coupling stability mechanism caused by the interaction of multiple power electronic devices and control strategies can be analyzed quickly and accurately. In particular, these results are used to study the impact of different configurations of GFM/GFL converters under various disturbance conditions, as well as the interaction stability mechanism of different configuration ratios combined with grid strength. Finally, the validity of these results is confirmed through theoretical and experimental verification.</description></item><item><title>Advancements in Photovoltaic Electrolysis for Green Hydrogen Production: A Comprehensive Review and Comparative Analysis of Modeling Approaches</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10912764</link><description>Green hydrogen is one of the most promising choices among hydrogen production methods due to its zero-emission, environmentally friendly, and sustainable characteristics.

However, how to achieve fast while reliable start-up respecting the permissible current limit remains challenging. In this work, we propose a simple and effective start-up strategy for 3p-DAB converters. First, by simply manipulating the switching positions, the initial dc-bias current is successfully eliminated. Then, the process of fast start-up under current limits is formulated as an inequality-constrained problem, for which we solve the closed-form analytical expression. This expression is then segmented via a newly proposed coordination transform, to bridge the control parameters and system states. With a simple segmental comparison, the global optimal phase-shift ratio and duty cycle to assign to the converters are obtained. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposal and demonstrate its considerable improvements over the state-of-the-art techniques.</description></item><item><title>Independent Charging Control Method for Dual-Channel Electric-Drive-Reutilized Onboard Charger</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10924315</link><description>The dual-channel electric drives feature a highly modular design, which significantly enhances fault tolerance and reliability of electric vehicles. The dual-channel electric-drive-reutilized onboard chargers (EDROCs) not only inherit several advantages from dual-channel electric drives, but also have benefits in terms of cost, weight, and power density. However, the charging powers of the two batteries are closely related to each other, posing a challenge for charging both batteries at the same time with the optimal charging powers. In this article, an independent charging control method is proposed for the dual-channel EDROC integrated asymmetric six-phase permanent magnet synchronous machine, which is applicable to both balanced and unbalanced battery voltage states. Under two fundamental charging requirements, namely grid current balance and zero average charging torque, the dual-channel winding current expressions which are solely associated with the ratio between the amplitudes of dual-channel winding currents are first derived. Then, the relationship between the ratio and dual-channel charging powers is deduced to realize the independent charging control of two channels. Thereafter, the independent charging control method of the studied dual-channel EDROC is designed. Ultimately, the experimental results based on a preliminary test setup validate the proposed independent charging control method.</description></item><item><title>Reference-Frame Selection on Impedance Modeling of VSCs With Fundamental Frequency Dynamics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10919010</link><description>The fundamental frequency of ac power-electronic-based power systems may deviate from its nominal value, and it is highly affected by converter control dynamics. To capture the dynamics of fundamental frequency, two impedance modeling methods for voltage-source converters (VSCs) are reported, with respect to the selection of system reference frame. The first method is to model VSCs in a reference frame with the nominal frequency, while the second method models VSCs in a reference frame with varying fundamental frequency, and hence, the fundamental frequency is represented as an additional terminal variable in the impedance model. This article mathematically proves that the two impedance models are essentially equivalent, provided that the frequency dynamics is accounted in the modeling of control delay and power stage of VSCs in the second method. This equivalence is demonstrated for both grid-following (GFL) and grid-forming (GFM) VSCs. Stability predictions based on two methods are further compared based on an interconnected GFM and GFL VSC system. The results are also found to be identical. Finally, experiments validate the correctness of the theoretical analysis.</description></item><item><title>Laminated Hybrid Metamaterial Block for Enhanced Efficiency and SNR in Simultaneous Wireless Power and Signal Transmission System With Dual-Sided LCCL Compensation Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916725</link><description>Current simultaneous wireless power and signal transmission (SWPST) systems have a rather limited transmission distance because the power transmission efficiency (PTE) and signal transmission gain (STG) decrease rapidly with increasing distance. To address this issue, a novel miniaturized hybrid metamaterial block (HMB) with negative and near-zero permeability is designed based on two types of compact metamaterial stacks. Depending on the magnetic field boundary conditions, the magnetic fields for transmitting power and signal can be more confined between the coupling coils, thus enhancing the PTE and STG. An optimization design method for miniaturizing the metamaterials stacks is presented, achieving enhanced Q factors at low resonant frequencies. Furthermore, a resonant hybridization analysis method is proposed to achieve the target resonant frequencies of the metamaterial stacks and the miniaturization of the overall HMB. Finally, an SWPST prototype with dual-sided LCCL compensation networks is built, demonstrating a 16.3% improvement in the PTE and 11.8-dB enhancement in the STG at a 14-cm distance. The enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from &#8722;6 to 2.2 dB enables data flowing at a 400-kb/s rate to be recovered. These results show that the proposed HMB can simultaneously improve the PTE and SNR over a longer transmission distance.</description></item><item><title>Extended Hybrid Modulation for Multistage Constant-Current Wireless EV Charging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10919198</link><description>This article presents an extended hybrid modulation (EHM) technique to achieve multistage constant-current (MSCC) charging of electric vehicles using wireless power transfer (WPT) technology. Although most research focuses on constant-current constant-voltage charging, MSCC charging offers key advantages, such as lower temperature rise, decreased charging time, and prolonged battery lifespan. However, the existing phase-shift-modulation (PSM) method encounters substantial circulating reactive power and significant efficiency drops in MSCC charging. To overcome this, an EHM strategy is proposed to expand the modulation range of PSM. By applying EHM to both the inverter and active rectifier, the proposed method provides up to 16 operating modes to facilitate multiple CC outputs. Furthermore, an optimal mode trajectory, specifically designed for the MSCC charging, is developed. By implementing this trajectory across different charging stages, zero-voltage-switching is achieved for all power switches, and the overall power loss of the system is minimized. Finally, a WPT prototype was developed to validate the proposed approach. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively enables the MSCC charging while notably enhancing transmission efficiency, achieving dc-to-dc efficiencies between 92.45% and 95.67% across a power range of 231 to 3.015 kW.</description></item><item><title>A Wireless Permanent-Magnet Brushless DC Motor Using Contactless Feedback and Autonomous Commutation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10892041</link><description>This article proposes and implements a wireless permanent-magnet brushless DC (PM-BLDC) motor, which realizes precise closed-loop speed control and autonomous commutation by offering rotor position feedback in a contactless approach. To reduce the system complexity, a three-phase four-switch (TPFS) inverter is newly used to control the wireless motor. Incorporated with two orthogonal bipolar coils, the high-order compensation network provides four decoupled current paths to control the four self-drive switches in the TPFS inverter. By changing the frequency of the wireless power transfer, the motor phases can be properly energized to ensure a smooth operation in both directions without any microcontrollers at the secondary side. To equalize the motor current transmitted under different frequencies across a wide speed range, sigma-delta modulated pulse frequency modulation is adopted together with pulsewidth modulation, which also achieves higher efficiency and fewer effects from unexpected harmonics. The feasibility of the proposed design is validated by prototyping and testing a 4000-rpm 134-W PM-BLDC motor platform. Experimentations verify that the proposed wireless PM-BLDC motor achieves reliable commutation and precise speed tracking against load variations using contactless feedback.</description></item><item><title>Recticoil for Efficient Compact Inductive Power Transfer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10892006</link><description>The MHz inductive power transfer (IPT) system has broad application prospects due to its high safety, longer transmission distance, and better tolerance for misalignment. However, the increase in frequency will lead to an increased loss of lumped components, such as inductors and capacitors, in peripheral circuits, thereby reducing efficiency. This is currently the bottleneck problem encountered by MHz IPT. To address this key challenge, researchers have tried to remove the lumped components in the peripheral circuit while ensuring the functions of the IPT system. One successful and beneficial attempt is the self-resonant coil, which replaces traditional lumped resonant capacitors with distributed capacitors formed by coil turn-to-turn capacitance, ensuring compensation for leakage inductance and eliminating reactive power. This innovative integration makes efficiency and integration greatly improved. In this article, the novel coil named Recticoil, on which the rectification function is integrated further, is proposed for efficient compact IPT. Recticoil can directly output dc power without additional compensation and rectification circuits. By analyzing a toroidal coil where two separate conductors generate a voltage differential, and incorporating two diodes, resulting in a dc output. Subsequently, the self-resonant coil replaces the toroidal coil to form Recticoil, and the equivalent circuits of Recticoil are given and analyzed. In addition, the analysis and test method of rectification efficiency is given. The experimental results show that the Recticoil achieves a rectification efficiency as high as 97.25% at 6.78 MHz, outperforming both the bridge rectifier and the Class E rectifier. Additionally, the compact construction of Recticoil eliminates the volume of traditional rectifiers.

Connecting an equivalent sensor inductor in the primary resonant tank, the voltage transient values caused by the rising and falling edges of the inverter output voltage and the rectifier input voltage are relevant to the mutual inductance and load voltage. By detecting the voltage transient amplitudes, the mutual inductance and load voltage can be identified directly for the strong coupling case. For the weak coupling case, the current amplitude in the primary resonant tank is further utilized to handle the sensitivity problem. Sensitivity analysis shows that the proposed method can also perform satisfactorily even when the system parameters have some errors. Finally, experiment results verify the effectiveness of the method.</description></item><item><title>A Repeater-Based Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer System With Controllable Detuning Rate for a Constant Output Profile</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10897908</link><description>The dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) system is an ideal solution for electric vehicles as it can maintain the power supply and reduce the battery volume. However, its adoption in electric vehicle charging has been limited due to the high installation costs, low charging efficiency, and significant power fluctuations. To address these issues, a repeater-based DWPT system with a controllable detuning rate method is proposed to achieve constant output power during movement. The switch-controlled capacitor is introduced in the repeater coil to adjust its detuning rate dynamically. Based on the relationship between the output power and the mutual inductances among the active, repeater, and receiver coils, the detuning rate is controlled to reduce power fluctuations. Moreover, increasing the detuning rate under no-load conditions reduces the losses in the repeater coil. A down-sized experimental prototype of the proposed DWPT system was built, and the experimental results show that it can maintain output power with fluctuations of less than 4.8% and an efficiency of approximately 85% throughout the dynamic process. Furthermore, constant power output is maintained even when the mutual inductance between the repeater coil and the active coil varies by up to 25%.</description></item><item><title>Unilateral Compensation for Compact and Lightweight IPT Converters With Near Unity Power Factor and Load-Independent Constant Output</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10900477</link><description>In many application scenarios, inductive power transfer (IPT) converters are expected to be compact and lightweight, especially in the charging device side. The unilateral compensation is an effective solution to eliminate the bulky passive inductors and capacitors. However, most existing unilateral compensation topologies in IPT converters cannot achieve multiple design objectives simultaneously, such as unity power factor (UPF), load-independent constant output, soft switching, and so on. This article starts from a generalized transformer model and proposes the design principle for unilateral compensation networks in terms of flexible constant-voltage or constant-current output while combating the parameter constraint of the given loosely coupled transformer. In addition, the near UPF and soft switching can be simultaneously achieved to improve the transfer efficiency. Based on the design principle, a family of unilateral compensation topologies is proposed and the design process is detailed. Finally, a 100-W prototype of CLC-N(none) compensated IPT converter is built to verify the design.</description></item><item><title>A Compact Underwater WPT System With Load-Independent Current Output Characteristic Under Wide Range of Coupling Coefficient</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10902447</link><description>Wireless power transfer (WPT) technology provides an effective solution to the power supply of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). However, the misalignments and rotation often occur between the docking station and AUV, which would result in a fluctuation to system's output characteristics. To maintain constant current output with unreliable communication under seawater environment is a barrier. Aiming at this problem, this article presented an LCC-N WPT system with fewer compensation devices on the receiver side, which is immensely suitable for reducing the weight and volume of the AUV. Meanwhile, based on the switch-controlled capacitance (SCC) technology and frequency modulation at the transmitter side, the mentioned WPT system could stabilize the output current while the coupling coefficient k and load resistance $R_{L}$ undergo a wide range variation. The determination method of system parameters, including operation frequency, capacitance value of SCC and compensation inductance under various misalignment conditions was detailed derived. Besides, the zero phase angle characteristic could be achieved during the whole process. The experimental results indicate that while the coupling coefficient varies from 0.3 to 0.54, the fluctuation of output current for the proposed WPT system is less than 4.47% and the power transfer efficiency could be maintained above 87%, and the maximum efficiency can reach 92.8%.

Traditional two-phase systems not only feature numerous magnetic cores and windings, but also have shortcomings in power loss and power density. Due to the use of a dual full bridge inverter, its number and control of switching devices are also complex. A high power density and low loss DWPT two-phase rail with II-type ferrite magnetic tooth and interval lap winding is proposed to improve power loss and power density. A circuit topology and control method with a three-leg inverter is used to simplify the system.

However, the VF regulation process in WPT systems is characterized by strong nonlinearity and is highly sensitive to variations in the inverter driving frequency. In addition, increasing transfer distances exacerbate these nonlinearities due to changing mutual inductances. Consequently, traditional approaches to VF regulation are constrained by a limited operating range, which impedes the application of WPT technology in scenarios involving varying distances. To address these challenges and enhance the system's adaptability to different power transmission distances while managing multiparametric uncertainties in WPT systems, this article develops a data-driven model-free adaptive control (MFAC) method. Initially, an online modeling approach utilizing dynamic linearization is proposed to characterize the VF regulation process using solely system input&#8211;output data. Subsequently, a switched control strategy based on the estimated data model is devised to calculate the optimal operating frequency for the WPT system. Finally, a prototype with maximum output of 3.88 kW is constructed to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. The results indicate that the data-driven control system exhibits a robust dynamic response and strong resilience across varying transfer distances ranging from 5 to 65 cm, corresponding to a distance&#8211;diameter ratio of 0.125&#8211;1.625.</description></item><item><title>A Staggered Bipolar Magnetic Coupler for Dynamic Wireless Charging System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10906549</link><description>Dynamic wireless charging provides a novel solution for extending the range of electric vehicles, but requires stable power transmission to maintain reliability. To reduce dynamic driving power fluctuations, this article proposes a design for staggered bipolar (SBP) transmitter track with a corresponding X-type receiver for electric vehicles.

When paired with the X-type receiver, only a uniphase receiver is sufficient to achieve smooth traveling power output across full lateral misalignment range and track module spacing up to 50% of one transmitter length, without requiring additional auxiliary coils or circuitry. A 3.3 kW dynamic prototype was built based on the designed magnetic coupler and circuit parameters. Experimental results show that, without increasing width, by adjusting the pole shoe positions, the X-type receiver can adapt to SBP track module spacing of up to 125 mm, with output voltage fluctuation kept below 2.83% during aligned motion, and dc/dc efficiency reaches 91.04%.</description></item><item><title>Highly Integrated Hybrid Inductive and Capacitive Power Transfer System With Asymmetrical Printed-Circuit-Board-Based Self-Resonator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909419</link><description>This article presents a highly integrated and compact hybrid wireless power transfer (WPT) system with asymmetrical printed-circuit-board (PCB) based self-resonators.

The control architecture of MTP-PMSM can be categorized into a centralized and distributed structure depending on the number of controllers used. The distributed control architecture proves increasingly advantageous as the number of phases in MTP-PMSM increases, owing to its modular configuration. However, minor differences in crystal oscillator frequencies among controllers may lead to pulse width modulation (PWM) carrier phase desynchronization, resulting in increased current harmonics. Conventional methods for synchronizing carrier phases in controllers rely on hardware communication systems, which not only increase the complexity of the controller, but also degrade the reliability of system. In response, our article proposes a carrier phase self-synchronization method devoid of hardware synchronization devices. The proposed method utilizes the amplitude difference between upper and lower sideband harmonic currents sampled by distributed controllers for synchronization. This carrier self-synchronization method was validated through experimentation with the dual three-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor (DTP-PMSM).</description></item><item><title>A Notch Control Strategy of Energy Storage Converter for Suppressing Grid Harmonics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10738211</link><description>Harmonic currents introduced by nonlinear loads are prone to cause grid current distortion.

The derivation and analysis are extended to single-loop grid-forming control, current control, and multiple-loop control. Correctness of the impedance model and oscillation frequency estimation is verified through impedance measurement and hardware-in-the-loop test.</description></item><item><title>Multimode Drive and Control for Double-Stator Switched Reluctance Motor by a Three-Switch Symmetrical Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10740499</link><description>In this article, a multimode drive and control scheme is proposed to enhance the operation performance of double-stator switched reluctance motor (DSSRM) based on a new three-switch symmetrical converter (TSSC).

However, because of the high inductor peak current of a boost PFC converter, large-sized inductors and output electrolytic capacitors are employed. Consequently, the power density of the SMPS decreases, while the associated cost increases. This article presents a novel control method to minimize the inductor peak current in the widely used boost critical conduction mode PFC converters. The proposed scheme employs constant on-time control to satisfy the harmonic standard as well as peak current mode control to reduce the inductor current, thereby shaping the inductor current into a trapezoidal form. Thus, the proposed method reduces the size of the inductor and output electrolytic capacitors while satisfying the harmonic standards. The detailed analysis and comprehensive design procedures for the proposed method are presented.

Increased level of conducted EMI is side effect associated with shorter rise and fall times of the voltage slopes resulting from SiC and GaN transistors&#8217; utilization. In this article the specific electromagnetic compatibility issue concerning an influence of EMI generated by SiC and GaN based converters on power line communication (PLC) reliability has been investigated. In the case of PLC communication, particularly serious problems with communication reliability, caused by conducted EMI introduced by converters could be expected, because PLC communication uses the power grid as the transmission medium.

These merits, which have not yet been described, are, in the authors&#8217; opinion, interesting both in cognitive and practical aspects.</description></item><item><title>LCC-Resonant-Type Current-Fed-Out Three-Port DC&#8211;DC Converter for PV Electrolytic Hydrogen Production Integrated With Energy Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10739865</link><description>The three-port dc&#8211;dc converter is an attractive solution in off-grid PV hydrogen production systems for the integration of the photovoltaic cells, energy storage and electrolyzer due to simple structure, low cost, and high-power density.

Conventional FS-MPC suffers from the time-consuming process of weighting factor selection, which significantly impacts control performance. Another ongoing challenge of FS-MPC is its dependence on the prediction model for desirable control performance. To overcome the above issues, we propose to apply reinforcement learning (RL) to FS-MPC for power converters. The RL algorithm is first employed for the automatic weighting factor design of the FS-MPC, aiming to minimize the total harmonic distortion (THD) or reduce the average switching frequency. Furthermore, by formulating the incentive for the RL agent with the cost function of the predictive algorithm, the agent learns autonomously to find the optimal switching policy for the power converter by imitating the predictive controller without prior knowledge of the system model.

The ac current of the current-controlled converter is distributed by the dc&#8211;dc converter, which will affect the precision of load current control. This article proposed a novel direct load current control strategy in the ac current-controlled converter, which can provide a high-precision ac current to the load. The added inductor in the output side of the dc&#8211;dc converter can effectively reduce the distribution of the ac current. The influence and the design consideration of the added inductor on the output impedance of the dc&#8211;dc converter and the current control loop of the ac current-controlled converter are analyzed. Based on the model of the proposed control method, the comparison is made between the proposed control method and the traditional control method, and the proposed control method has higher control precision. The proposed control strategy is more suitable for situations of parallel connection between a voltage-controlled converter and a current-controlled converter.</description></item><item><title>Exact-Feedback-Linearization-Based Adaptive Second-Order Sliding Mode Control Design for DC&#8211;DC Boost Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10740387</link><description>The voltage regulation system of a boost converter operating in continuous conduction mode is a typical nonminimum phase system, posing significant challenges for the corresponding controller design. In&#160;this article, we employ the exact feedback linearization technique to effectively mitigate the complexities arising from the nonminimum phase characteristic. To address the voltage regulation challenge inherent to the boost converter with various disturbances, we propose an adaptive second-order sliding mode (SOSM) controller formulated within the Lyapunov framework. By dynamically modulating the control gain, the proposed controller circumvents the overestimation issue typical in other SOSM approaches, thereby diminishing chattering induced by excessive gain. In&#160;addition, unlike conventional adaptive SOSM methods, the proposed controller requires merely the disturbances to be bounded, without the need for the derivatives of these disturbances to be bounded. On this basis, the proposed controller ensures finite-time stability of the closed-loop system and concurrently enhances its transient response and robustness. Finally, comparative hardware experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed controller.</description></item><item><title>A Three-Channel M-Ary Simultaneous Wireless Power and Data Transfer System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745171</link><description>To improve the communication speed and reliability of the transmitter and receiver of the wireless power transfer system, this article proposes a three-channel M-ary frequency shift keying simultaneous wireless power and data transfer system (SWPDT). The SWPDT system adopts a high-frequency carrier series injection method to ensure the independence of the power channel and information channel. By utilizing the characteristic of high-order circuits with multiple resonant points, three information channels have been constructed, which can achieve serial and parallel data encoding to improve the transfer capacity and reliability of information channels. The transmission characteristics and mutual interference of power and information channels are analyzed and center frequencies of the three information channels are determined in this article. The results show that the center frequency of the information channels is almost not affected by the mutual inductance of the power coupler coils. Finally, a 1 kW SWPDT prototype with 1.8 Mbps half-duplex communication is presented to demonstrate the proposed system.</description></item><item><title>A 116.4 mg Wireless Ultra-Lightweight Microstimulator for Cyborg Bees</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10738206</link><description>Cyborg insects are considered to be viable substitutes for micro air vehicles (MAVs) with the wireless electric microstimulator. The design of a wireless stimulator with lightweight, small-size, and low-power that can be comfortably carried by insects in free motion has proved critically challenging. Here, a novel wireless microstimulator with an ultra-lightweight of 116.4 mg and a compact size of 121.8 mm${}^{\rm 3}$ is reported. It combines semiactive radio frequency identification (RFID) technology and millimeter-scale miniaturized antenna with heterogeneous integration process, thus meeting the stringent requirements of cyborg bees. The semiactive RFID technique uses radio-frequency energy harvesting to supply the power of wireless communication and then greatly reduce the energy requirement of the battery. To satisfy the radio-frequency energy harvesting requirement and realize conjugate matching of semiactive RFID chip and antenna at the same time, a millimeter-scale miniaturized antenna with compact spiral-structure is designed. A high-flexible heterogeneous integration process that combines the MCU die, antenna, and RFID chip together in the same ultra-thin substrate is proposed to solve the integration density limitation problem of the microsystem. Compared with the lightest reported microstimulator of cyborg insects, the weight reduced by almost 60%. The behavior control experiments are established to verify the control functionalities of this wireless stimulator. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed wireless ultra-lightweight microstimulator is capable of outputting stimulus waveforms into the bee's brain, and controlling the crawling deflection of cyborg bees.</description></item><item><title>Easy Transfer Learning-Based Model-Data-Hybrid-Driven Fault Detection for Battery Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10740486</link><description>In this letter, a hybrid method of fault detection using data and models, based on easy knowledge transfer learning, is proposed.

However, such limitation compromises their fault current contribution to power systems. This letter proposes an arm current-based adaptive limiter for modular multilevel converters (MMCs), considering the impact of dc circulating current. The&#160;magnitude limit for MMC output current adaptively changes with the voltage at the point of common coupling, to make full use of the current ratings of power semiconductors under both balanced and unbalanced grid conditions. The&#160;proposed limiter allows for additional reactive current output during voltage sags and enhances the short-circuit capacity of the MMC. All these capabilities are quantified and validated with experimental results of the low-voltage ride-through performance of a grid connected grid-forming MMC system.</description></item><item><title>Day-Ahead Solar Power Forecasting Using LightGBM and Self-Attention Based Encoder-Decoder Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10736564</link><description>The burgeoning trend of integrating renewable energy harvesters into the grid introduces critical issues for its reliability and stability. These issues arise from the stochastic and intermittent nature of renewable energy sources. Data-driven forecasting tools are indispensable in mitigating these challenges with their rugged performance. However, tools relying solely on data-driven methods often underperform when an adequate amount of recorded data is unattainable. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a novel day-ahead hybrid forecasting framework for photovoltaic applications. This framework integrates a physics-based model with Machine Learning (ML) techniques, enhancing prediction reliability in environments with scarce data. Additionally, an innovative ML pipeline is introduced for data-abundant environments. The proposed ML tool comprises two branches: a set of regressors, each tailored for specific weather conditions, and a self-attention-based encoder-decoder network. By fusing the outputs from these branches through a meta-learner, the tool achieves predictions of higher quality, as evidenced by its superior performance over benchmark models in an investigated test dataset.</description></item><item><title>Brain-Inspired Collaborative Automatic Generation Control With Large-Scale Electric Vehicles Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10738205</link><description>Distributed energy sources, loads and storage equipment have intermittent and highly random characteristics, which can cause significant frequency fluctuations when they are integrated into a distributed power grid. The current multi-agent cooperative neural networks based algorithms in the distributed power grid would suffer from catastrophic forgetting issues, which might be difficult in achieving optimal control under strong random disturbances. Hence, this paper proposes a proximal brain-inspired policy optimization (PBPO) algorithm with an orthogonal weight modification method in the weight update of the policy networks. Thus the policy network can have the brain-inspired contextual awareness capability. It can obtain faster convergence to the optimal solution of the multi-area cooperative control, mitigating heavy frequency fluctuations caused by serious random disturbances in the grid. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated via the simulation experiments on the two load frequency control models of the energy integration of large-scale electric vehicles in the grid. The proposed PBPO algorithm outperforms various reinforcement learning algorithms with faster convergence, higher frequency stability and better control performance.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Factor-Coupled, Ahead-of-Time Aggregation of Power Flexibility Under Forecast Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10738509</link><description>The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) is significantly reshaping the role of distribution systems under active energy management. To aggregate the active-reactive power flexibility of DERs dispersed at the feeder and provide capacity support to the transmission system, it is essential to efficiently identify feasible substation power injection trajectories. This paper introduces a novel ahead-of-time flexibility characterization method to address it. First, a polyhedral non-feeder-level power flexibility region (PFR) is constructed, accounting for various time-dependent, power-coupled, and forecast error uncertainties. Then, a polyhedral feeder-level PFR is analytically derived through a coordinate transformation, which can reveal the uncertainty propagation path, i.e., how uncertainty applies to the feeder-level PFR. To facilitate the high-level application, a tractable chance-constrained Chebyshev centering optimization model is further developed to find a ball-shaped inner approximation of the feeder-level PFR. Finally, the proposed method is validated on a modified IEEE 123-bus test system. Both theoretical and experimental results show that, with appropriate robustness parameter settings, the proposed method can make the approximated PFR less conservative with abundant robustness against forecast error uncertainty.</description></item><item><title>Research on Water Hammer Effect and Cooperative Frequency Regulation Technology of PV-HBESS Compensated Hydroturbine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10740062</link><description>The water hammer effect in a hydroturbine and improper setting of the PID parameters of a governor can cause a hydropower unit to provide negative damping to the corresponding hydro power generation system, affecting its frequency. Therefore, a collaborative control method using photovoltaic (PV) and hybrid battery energy storage system (HBESS) is proposed to compensate the water hammer effect. First, models for hydropower, PV, and HBESS are established. Second, a coordinated control strategy for HBESS and the PV system is presented, where the PV system employs a variable load reduction frequency regulation strategy based on power output and frequency deviation changes. The HBESS follows the state of charge, frequency change rate, and frequency deviation changes, with the supercapacitors utilizing virtual inertia control and lead-carbon batteries employing droop control to rapidly respond to the water hammer effect. Last, a control strategy based on model predictive control (MPC) optimized with a whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is proposed to manage the hydropower unit parameters and the coordinated hybrid battery energy storage system to mitigate the water hammer effect. The MPC-WOA can rapidly identify the optimal PID parameters for the hydropower unit. The proposed strategy effectively suppresses fluctuations in turbine mechanical power and system frequency. Real-time simulation on the RTLAB platform validates that the proposed control method improves system frequency adjustment time by 45.40% compared to systems without compensation and reduces power feedback fluctuations by 87.22%, significantly enhancing frequency stability against the water hammer effect.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Wind Power Prediction Based on Wind2vec-BERT Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745561</link><description>In the era of new energy development, the requirements for all aspects of short-term wind power forecasting tasks are increasing day by day. However, the power condition of wind farms is naturally stochastic and variable as it is affected by multiple factors. Current neural network approaches focus only on the propagation of unidirectional attention and ignore the interaction of input variables. To further improve the accuracy of wind power prediction, this paper explores the application of the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) algorithm in wind power prediction. At the same time, GARCH series models are used for analysis and optimization after the prediction results are obtained to address the challenges posed by the inherent variability of wind. Meanwhile, Wind2vec, a new variable embedding method for wind power forecasting tasks, is proposed which can more efficiently fit the relationship between time series forecasting variables. The parameters are subsequently fine-tuned for the backbone layer of the BERT using the Adaptive Computation Time (ACT) method to make it more adaptive to the inputs of the power sequences of the power system. By BERT's bidirectional attention mechanism and transformer architecture, and refining it for the input layer, we aim to enhance the accuracy of wind power forecasts by capturing nuanced temporal dependencies within historical wind data. Using China Southern Power Grid real datasets demonstrates the effectiveness and correctness of the BERT-GARCH-M-based model in outperforming traditional forecasting methods. This research not only shows the adaptability of BERT to wind power prediction but also contributes to advancing the precision and reliability of renewable energy forecasts, paving the way for more sustainable energy utilization in the evolving landscape of new energy paradigms.</description></item><item><title>Cooperative Control for DFIG-Based Wind Turbine Generation System Covering All Operating Regions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745778</link><description>This paper addresses the multiple control problems over the whole wind speed range for the wind turbine generation system (WTGS), including the safety constraints on the rotational speed and the mechanical power, and the maximum power point tracking, by proposing a novel estimator-based cooperative control scheme for doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) and wind turbine. Firstly, we develop a global estimator to obtain precisely the unmeasurable shift-area turbine speed, which is effective for all wind speed zones and is employed to support the decision-making of the actual operating region and the desired reference signals. Secondly, based on this, a nonlinear adaptive DFIG controller and a pitch angle controller are designed to track the reference point, which ensures the completeness of the control tasks of the corresponding identified operating region. Thirdly, we apply the universal barrier Lyapunov function to the control synthesis of DFIG to impose the physical security constraints with any adjustable safety margin on WTGS. The superiority of the proposed framework is evaluated comparatively on the detailed WTGS model using multiple Monte Carlo simulations with three kinds of stochastic wind speed processes.</description></item><item><title>Pitch Control Scheme Considering Entire Dynamics and Full-Load Region in PMSG-Based Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10747229</link><description>Large-scale wind turbines (WTs) are built with light-strength materials, which would otherwise cost more than the economic benefits of power generation. Hence, these turbines with huge rotors and slender towers are more exposed to external forces such as gust winds and the wake effect during their operational lifetime. This paper strives to establish a bridge between the design principles of the pitch control system (PCS) and the inherent dynamics of the drivetrain, blades, and tower in a grid-tied 5MW PMSG-based WT. Based on this purpose, the dynamic representation of the PCS is described in more detail, then the pitch controller is designed based on the complete dynamic model of the WT using a gain-scheduled PI controller to be capable of providing desirable dynamical performance throughout the pitch actuation region. The parameters of the proposed controller are calculated according to the current operating point of the WT with the aim of ensuring the acceptable stability margin and reducing the WT loading as much as possible. The controller design process is accomplished by analyzing the linearized dynamic model of the PCS under various scenarios using responses resulting from the frequency domain, polar coordinate, and modal analysis. Finally, nonlinear simulations illustrate that the intended pitch controller has a superior response over the traditional PI controllers.</description></item><item><title>A Robust Photovoltaic Power Forecasting Method Based on Multimodal Learning Using Satellite Images and Time Series</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10747271</link><description>Ultra-short-term photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting holds significant importance in enhancing grid stability. Most PV power forecasting methods based on satellite images rely on pixel-level predictions, which are inefficient and redundant. Meanwhile, current deep-learning approaches struggle to establish correlations between large-scale cloud features and PV generation patterns. In this paper, an end-to-end model based on multimodal learning is proposed for directly obtaining multi-step PV power forecasts from satellite images and time series. To capture cloud dynamics and features within the region of interest (RoI), ConvLSTM-RICNN is utilized to encode satellite images. To mitigate the impact of noise and missing data in PV power, a robust fusion approach named DCCA-LF is introduced. This approach integrates deep canonical correlation analysis (DCCA) into late fusion (LF) to strengthen cross-modal feature alignment. The proposed model is verified using publicly available data from BP Solar in Alice Springs and Himawari-8, from January 1, 2020, to October 8, 2022. Comparison with current state-of-the-art research shows that the suggested model achieves the best RMSE and MAE with minimal complexity across all cloud conditions. Moreover, the proposed approach is robust to noise and missing data.</description></item><item><title>System Strength Constrained Grid-Forming Energy Storage Planning in Renewable Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10747388</link><description>With more inverter-based renewable energy resources replacing synchronous generators, the system strength of modern power networks significantly decreases, which may induce small-signal stability (SS) issues. It is commonly acknowledged that grid-forming (GFM) converter-based energy storage systems (ESSs) enjoy the merits of flexibility and effectiveness in enhancing system strength, but how to simultaneously consider the economic efficiency and system-strength support capability in the planning stage remains unexplored. To bridge the research gap, this paper develops a system strength constrained optimal planning approach of GFM ESSs to achieve a desired level of SS margin. To this end, the influence of GFM ESS power capacities and locations on the system strength is firstly quantified based on the framework of generalized short-circuit ratio. On this basis, system strength constrained optimal placement and sizing of GFM ESSs is formulated into optimization problems with eigenvalue constraints. Two practical scenarios with and without a limit on the number of selected sites are considered. Finally, quadratic support function based iterative optimization approaches are developed to address the planning problems. Case studies in the modified IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus systems validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches under different scenarios by comparing with two other benchmarks.</description></item><item><title>Machine Learning-Accelerated Method for Real-Time Optimization of Micro Energy-Water-Hydrogen Nexus</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752353</link><description>This paper explores the micro Energy-Water- Hydrogen (m-EWH) nexus, an engineering system designed to reduce carbon emissions in the power sector. The m-EWH nexus leverages renewable energy sources (RES) to produce hydrogen via electrolysis, which is then combined with carbon captured from fossil fuel power plants to mitigate emissions. To address the uncertainty challenges posed by RES, this paper proposes a real-time decision-making framework for the m-EWH nexus, which requires the rapid solution of large-scale mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) problems. To this end, we develop a machine learning-accelerated solution method for real-time optimization (MARO), comprising three key modules: (1) an active constraint and integer variable prediction module that rapidly solves MICP problems using historical optimization data; (2) an optimal strategy selection module based on feasibility ranking to ensure solution feasibility; and (3) a feature space extension and refinement module to improve solution accuracy by generating new features and refining existing ones. The effectiveness of the MARO method is validated through two case studies of the m-EWH nexus, demonstrating its capability to swiftly and accurately solve MICP problems for this complex system.</description></item><item><title>Virtuality-Reality Combination Control for Wind Farm Maximum Power Generation With Wake Model Dynamic Calibration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752354</link><description>Due to the time delay characteristic of wake effect, the future state information of downstream wind turbines (WTs) is required for wind farm (WF) dynamic optimization but cannot be directly measured. To address the issue, this study proposes a novel virtuality-reality combination control scheme for WF dynamic maximum power generation control (DMPGC). The wind speed in VWF is calculated by wake model without time delay, thus the future state information corresponding to the current freestream wind speed of RWF can be obtained in advance. To ensure consistency of state information between RWF and VWF, meanwhile to enhance the precision of WF optimization model, a wake model dynamic calibration method is proposed to improve the prediction accuracy of wake wind speed. Thereafter, an active wake control strategy based on calibrated wake model is implemented to maximize the total power generation of VWF, and the optimal control commands are delay dispatched to RWF according to the wake delay time. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves calculation accuracy of wake model, increases total power generation and owns better fatigue load distribution of WF under different wind conditions.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Affine Arithmetic-Based Optimal Dispatch Method for Active Distribution Networks With Uncertainties of Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752418</link><description>Affine Arithmetic (AA) is an effective interval analysis method for addressing uncertainties in power systems. However, previous research on AA-based optimization problems has struggled to accurately capture the uncertainties associated with electric vehicles (EVs) and the cumulative impact of uncertainties on energy storage systems (ESSs). Moreover, the reformulated AA model presents a significant computational challenge due to the high number of variables and constraints. This study proposes an efficient AA-based economic dispatch (AAED) method for active distribution networks incorporating EVs and ESSs while accounting for uncertainties. Specifically, an EV charging load-interval (CLI) model is developed to effectively capture the randomness of plug-in/plug-out times and initial/target energy. A confidence level is defined to prevent excessive conservatism in the CLI model. An ESS model is also formulated within the AA domain to address the cumulative impact of persistent uncertainty, ensuring an accurate state of charge monitoring. To enhance the computational efficiency of the AAED model without sacrificing accuracy, a fast-solving strategy is introduced. This strategy involves eliminating many state variables and constraints and replacing them with derived analytical partial deviation formulations that map the relationship between state and decision variables. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model and method.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Fault Ride-Through Capability of DFIG-Based WECS Using Dynamic Reconfiguration Hybrid Interlinking Transformer Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752838</link><description>The abnormal grid voltages, such as sags, swells, and harmonics caused by grid faults, seriously threaten the safe operation of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind energy conversion system (WECS). To enhance the fault ride-through (FRT) capability of DFIG and improve the converter capacity utilization, this paper proposes a novel DFIG-based WECS using a dynamic reconfiguration hybrid interlinking transformer (DR-HIT) technique for performance improvement under grid faults. Multiple operating modes and flexible switching strategies were developed based on the analysis of the proposed topology and principles. The proposed DR-HIT approach smooths the DFIG &#8217;s output power fluctuations through the cooperative control of the multifunctional converter (MFC) and grid-side converter (GSC) in shunt mode when the grid voltage is stable. Upon the occurrence of a grid voltage fault, the DR-HIT flexibly switches from shunt mode to series mode, maintaining the terminal voltage at a constant value. Additionally, once grid voltage recovers, the DR-HIT reverts flexibly to its shunt mode. Finally, simulations and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve accurate control of the system and flexible switching between different modes.</description></item><item><title>Cooperative Strategies for Frequency Control of Wind Turbines to Mitigate Secondary Frequency Dip: Coefficient Allocation and Exit Techniques</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752840</link><description>With the increasing integration of wind power into the power system, the incorporation of wind turbines into the grid's primary frequency regulation through inertia and droop control has been proven effective. However, a phenomenon known as secondary frequency dip (SFD) occurs when wind generators exit frequency regulation to restore the turbines&#8217; speeds. This paper introduces a cooperative approach to mitigate SFD. Initially, a system frequency response model is established, incorporating the combined effects of synchronous generators and wind turbines. Subsequently, a model to forecast the rotational speed of each wind turbine in response to load changes is developed. Based on these models, the droop and inertia coefficients of different turbines in a wind farm are optimized to minimize overall wind energy loss during frequency regulation, thereby alleviating SFD, while ensuring the rotational speed remains within a safe range. Additionally, a smooth transition strategy based on a low-pass filter is proposed to prevent an abrupt decrease in active power as turbines exit frequency regulation. Finally, to prevent a simultaneous drop in active power among a large number of wind turbines, a sequential exit strategy from frequency regulation is proposed. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in mitigating SFD.</description></item><item><title>Frequency and Voltage Disturbances Ride-Through Control Strategy for PV Power Plants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10755119</link><description>Large-scale photovoltaic power plants (PVPP) are being rapidly integrated to power systems worldwide. However, large penetration of PVPP will affect the frequency and voltage stabilities, especially for a weak power grid during individual and simultaneous disturbances. This paper introduces an adaptive control strategy for PVPP to accurately comply with grid code requirements and achieve fast frequency support (FFS) and enhanced low voltage ride-through (LVRT) performance during simultaneous disturbances events (SDE). The proposed control strategy relies on the support priority scheme for the grid frequency and voltage based on real-time measurements. An adaptive active power ramp rate (AAPRR) function imposed on the active power control loop of the PVPP is used to realize the simultaneous frequency and voltage support. Moreover, the voltage support is enhanced using a voltage regulation scheme that supports the voltage recovery post-fault without exceeding the PVPP inverter power headroom. The proposed control strategy demonstrates superior performance in enhancing the transient voltage and frequency responses when the power grid is subjected to consecutive and simultaneous disturbance events. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified using the OPAL-RT real-time simulator test bench.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Approach to Determine and Maintain Area-Wise Minimum Inertia in Renewable Energy Dominated Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10758198</link><description>The rapid displacement of synchronous generators by increased penetration of inverter-based resources (IBR) in power system areas that are potentially rich in renewable energy can lead to spatial non-uniform distribution of synchronous inertia. Consequently, even if the overall minimum inertia (MI) of the system is maintained, certain areas may experience stability issues, which would breach grid-code limits for the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) following a contingency. Given this context, a method to determine the MI that is specific to individual areas is introduced. Additionally, a method for redistributing surplus inertia from high-inertia areas to low inertia areas is introduced by reducing electrical distance between the nodes. This approach utilizes green corridors, which are additional transmission lines that are established to evacuate surplus renewable power to the areas with higher demand and fossil-fueled-based generation, as pathways to transfer inertia. Furthermore, a machine-learning-assisted technique to compensate for shortfall in area-wise MI by placing new synchronous inertia compensators is proposed. Using this method, system operators can identify the location and size of synchronous or virtual inertia that may be required. The amount of additionally required inertia is quantified by the size of synchronous inertia compensators, to uphold area-specific RoCoF in renewable energy-integrated power systems. The proposed methodology is tested and validated in the modified IEEE-39 bus system.</description></item><item><title>Dual-Stage MPC-Based AGC for Wind Farm Considering Aerodynamic Interactions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10757357</link><description>The wind farms are encouraged to provide Automatic Generation Control (AGC) services for the power grid. However, the complex aerodynamic interactions between turbines complicate the control of wind farms for AGC service. To address this issue, this paper proposes an explicit wind speed prediction model of each wind turbine based on the control actions of thrust coefficient (mainly realized by adjusting pitch angle) and yaw angle. Its accuracy is validated by numerical experiment based on Navier-Stokes equations. Since the adjustments of the thrust coefficients and yaw angles involve significantly different time scales, a dual-stage model predictive control (MPC) is proposed to coordinate them. It uses the proposed explicit wind speed prediction model as a surrogate for the wind speed of each turbine. In the first stage, it optimizes yaw angle reference based on whether or not the available wind farm power is sufficient at the predicted moments. In the second stage, it controls both thrust coefficient and yaw angle of each turbine, in order to track the AGC power signal and align the yaw angles with those determined in the first stage. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the dual-stage MPC for AGC power tracking of wind farm.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Control Strategy for Enhancing System Stability in Weak Grids by Mitigating Additional Disturbance Components from PLL</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10758341</link><description>Wind and photovoltaic power plants connected to weak grids can bring stability problems. The grid-connected inverter is an important connection port between the renewable energy and the grid. Some studies have indicated that the phase-locked loop (PLL) controller of the inverter can play a significant role in causing stability issues in weak grids. In this paper, a small-signal model of a phase-locked loop with complex variables is established. Then, the influence of phase-locked loop on system stability is analyzed. It is found that the presence of the PLL introduces additional disturbance components into the inverter control loop, resulting in a decrease in system stability. To mitigate the influence, a control strategy is proposed that involves injecting opposite disturbance components into the control loop to counteract the additional disturbance components. The proposed control strategy effectively improves the system stability. In addition, when compared to existing methods for enhancing stability, such as reducing the bandwidth of the PLL, the proposed method demonstrates a good dynamic response. The simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Contribution of PV Generation With Embedded Battery Storage to Capacity Adequacy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10766632</link><description>This paper proposes a real-time redispatch method for including PV-plus-battery plants in resource adequacy assessment (RAA) studies. The method offers the possibility to represent the market operation of the assets, while at the same time considering their response to reliability events, unlike existing methods in the literature that manage such assets in a single-dimensional manner, driven solely by adequacy contribution considerations or entirely ignoring this capability. In the proposed method, while the plant is initially dispatched in a market-oriented manner, i.e., with the objective of maximizing market revenues, its actual operation is adapted to meet system needs when reliability events take place. The method is incorporated into a Monte Carlo (MC) based RAA model in a computationally efficient manner, relying on a deterministic implementation of redispatching that does not impact significantly the computational burden of the RAA model, thus enabling the execution of multiple MC samples to achieve a high stochastic process accuracy. A merit order algorithm is also embedded into the RAA model to evaluate the PV-plus-battery market revenues. The model developed allows a refined calculation of the capacity value (CV) of such assets for different plant configurations and inverter loading ratios, while the upper and lower CV bounds are approximated via application of the adequacy- and market-oriented approaches available in the literature. Results show that the embedded storage energy capacity is crucial for the CV afforded by the assets, while any decrease in the inverter capacity does not significantly impact the CV value. Further, the CV of storage embedded in tightly coupled PV-plus-battery plants, where batteries are exclusively charged by the plant's own PV generation, is generally lower than the value of similar stand-alone storages operating without any charging constraints.</description></item><item><title>Adversarial Constraint Learning for Robust Dispatch of Distributed Energy Resources in Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10766908</link><description>The variability of renewables and power demands poses significant challenges for the dispatch of distributed energy resources (DERs) in distribution networks, as they often introduce uncertainties that may lead to power flow constraint violations. Robust optimization (RO) is a powerful tool for managing the operational risks caused by these uncertainties. However, solving robust DER dispatch problems is nontrivial since the non-convex AC power flow constraints prevent the use of strong duality to find deterministic counterparts. To this end, this paper proposes adversarial constraint learning that can provide linear surrogates for robust dispatch problems. This method begins by designing a gradient-based adversarial attack process to identify the worst-case constraint violations. A &#8220;teacher&#8221; model is trained in advance to enable rapid gradient calculations during this attack process. Under the teacher's supervision, two &#8220;student&#8221; models are then trained to predict the worst-case violation from candidate dispatch decisions and nominal operating conditions (i.e., renewable generation and power demands). These student models are further reformulated into equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) forms and serve as computationally efficient surrogates for the original robust dispatch problems. Simulations across various operating conditions and test systems demonstrate that our method can achieve desirable feasibility, low suboptimality, and high online computational efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Online Stream-Driven Energy Management in Microgrids Using Recurrent Neural Networks and SustainaBoost Augmentation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10768873</link><description>In recent years, the operation of microgrids (MG) has faced increasing challenges due to the growing penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) and the integration of electric vehicles (EVs), which introduce significant uncertainties in power supply and demand dynamics. In response, neural network-based approaches emerge as promising solutions, adept at handling vast databases and learning diverse patterns for real-time decision-making. This paper proposes an online stream-driven energy management strategy for efficient grid-connected MG power management and cost minimization. The strategy considers the presence of EVs and RES, while also addressing the impact of noisy data. The strategy incorporates a recurrent neural network (RNN) to learn from time-series data and make real-time decisions. Additionally, an augmentation technique called SustainaBoost (SB) is introduced, designed to boost system sustainability and enhance the training quality of neural networks. The proposed RNN achieves 98.7% optimality in minimizing the operational costs of the MG on the test dataset.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Bilevel Optimization Model for Distribution Network With Demand Response Under Uncertain Renewables Using Wasserstein Metrics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10771664</link><description>We consider a distribution network integrating demand response (DR) participants in the presence of uncertain renewable suppliers and outdoor temperatures. A bilevel optimization model is proposed to capture the intricate dynamics between price-incentivized DR participants and distribution system operations, including energy procurement and active/reactive power flows. The model is formulated as a distributional robust bilevel optimization using Wasserstein metrics. We show favorable data-driven properties including out-of-sample guarantee and asymptotic consistency. Furthermore, we present a tractable mixed-integer linear programming reformulation and characterize the worst-case distribution. Computational experiments are conducted on a modified 33-bus system. Our findings underscore the efficacy of the pricing strategies derived from the proposed bilevel optimization model. These strategies not only effectively manage DR participants' behavior but also bring equity considerations among households with various characteristics to light. The results contribute to a deeper understanding of the interplay between distribution system operators and DR participants.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Objective Performance Enhancement of Offshore Wind Turbines Through Planning Controller Parameter: A &#8216;Plan-Control&#8217; Hierarchical Controller</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10772167</link><description>Large-scale offshore wind turbines (OWTs) are manufactured with pronounced flexible structures and operated in complex wind-wave coupled environment, thereby imposing high demands on the controller performance. Existing advanced control strategies have altered the architecture of industry-standard controller, hindering their application in industrial projects. This study aims to propose a novel &#8216;Plan-Control&#8217; Hierarchical Controller (PCHC) for OWTs, with the inner &#8216;Control&#8217; loop utilizing an industry-standard controller and the outer &#8216;Plan&#8217; loop integrating a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC)-based planner. For the inner loop, the controller provides reference signals of generator torque and blade pitch to actuators of OWTs, with controller parameters, optimal constant in torque control and proportional-integral (PI) gains in pitch control, being transferred from the planner. For the outer loop, an NMPC-based planner determines controller parameters by solving multi-objective optimization formulations with variable prediction horizons. Interestingly, NMPC-based planner does not operate as often as controller in PCHC, but compensates for the residual error, arising from the mismatch of state-space model in the multi-step prediction process, by Gaussian Process regression. A cost function is jointly formulated to suppress mechanical power and rotor speed fluctuations, reduce structural loads, and restrict actuators' actions, with weighting factors tuned online and robustly. Finally, the multi-objective performance enhancement of the PCHC in power and speed stability, and structural load mitigations is demonstrated utilizing aero-hydro-servo-elasto-soil simulations with actual wind-wave environmental conditions. The PCHC maintains the architecture of the industrial-standard controller, thus smoothing the way for its implementation in industrial projects of OWTs.</description></item><item><title>Internal Energy Distribution Control Based Fault Ride-Through and Postfault Recovery Strategy for Offshore Wind Farms Connected to DR-MMC HVDC Under Onshore AC Grid Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10772121</link><description>Offshore wind farms (OWF) connected to diode rectifier (DR) and modular multilevel converter (MMC)-based HVDC confront challenges of surplus power induced by onshore AC faults. This paper proposes an internal energy distribution control (IEDC) strategy, which utilizes the rotor kinetic energy (KE) of wind turbines (WT) and the capacitor energy of MMC submodules to achieve fault ride-through (FRT) and postfault recovery (PFR). Firstly, the mechanism of OWF is analyzed, and an onshore AC fault detection method based on local measurements is proposed. Then, a two-stage FRT control strategy is proposed. Three preset power reduction and energy absorption curves are designed to utilize the internal energy to actively absorb excess power, and flexibly distribute surplus power to KE and MMC energy. An additional pitch angle control (APAC) is devised, which can reduce captured wind power and eliminate surplus power when the internal energy reaches its maximum value. Thirdly, a two-stage PFR control strategy is proposed. The preset power and energy recovery curves are designed to achieve fast active power recovery and release of stored excess internal energy after fault clearance. Case studies are performed on 2-terminal and 4-terminal test systems to validate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Area-Multi-Stage Based Self-Healing Distribution Network Planning and Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10787104</link><description>Extreme events such as earthquakes, floods, or wars could cause severe grid faults and large-scale outages in the distribution network. The active islanding technology can be used for self-healing of multiple outage areas with distributed resources, smart distribution facilities, and advanced controlling methods. The facilities related to the self-healing consist of relays, switches, distributed resources, and power electronics based soft open points (SOPs). However, the self-healing effect depends on not only the location, capability, and function of these facilities, but also the recovery process should be comprehensively considered and coordinated since the multi-stage recovery strategies are deeply coupled. These recovery stages usually consist of the relaying process, grid partition with smart switches (SSWs), resupply by distributed resources, and interconnection with SOPs. For the first time, this paper proposes a multi-area-multi-stage (MAMS) self-healing recovery area (RA) planning-operation collaborative approach considering the recovery sequence. First, the multiple self-healing stages of flexible RAs are defined and introduced. Second, the time-variant topological and operational constraints are proposed to represent the coupling relationships at different stages. Finally, the hybrid controllable load deployment strategy is used to compensate for the limited resource capacity in RA restoration. The effectiveness of the proposed collaborative model is verified by illustrative case studies.</description></item><item><title>Tube-Based Linear Parameter-Varying Model Predictive Control for Wind Energy Conversion Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10787116</link><description>Maximum power extraction and transfer from wind energy conversion systems (WECS) to the power grid depends on a high-performance control system. This paper proposes a robust tube-based linear parameter-varying (LPV) model predictive controller (MPC) for rotor speed and stator's active and reactive power control of a Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) based WECS. The turbine dynamics and the DFIG is modeled as a single LPV system, which enables the model transformation into an equivalent linear time-invariant (LTI) system to avoid online updates of the prediction matrix. Based on the LTI representation, a tube-based LPV MPC (TLPVMPC) is developed, consisting of a tracking nominal MPC with tightened constraint sets and a disturbance controller. In the proposed method, the disturbance upper bound is estimated by Kalman filtering, which provides less conservative performance. The proposed controller is compared to sliding mode control (SMC), LPVMPC and nonlinear MPC (NMPC) methods. Simulations are conducted under model uncertainties and partial faults in the DFIG control voltages. The results show the robust performance of the proposed controller in power extraction and reduction of mechanical stress build-up compared to the other control methods.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Voltage Control of Inverter-Based DG in Active Distribution Networks With Measurement-Strategy Mapping Matrix</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10795660</link><description>The high penetration of distributed generators (DGs) has exacerbated voltage violations in active distribution networks (ADNs). The sensitivity, as the law between nodal power injection and state variation, can be used to develop DG strategies. However, due to the nonlinearity, the accurate description and efficient application of sensitivity have become an important challenge in the establishment of DG control strategy. In this paper, an adaptive voltage control strategy for DGs is developed based on ADN sensitivity. First, the measurement-strategy mapping matrix is established to describe the complex time-varying sensitivity. The sensitivity between nodal voltage and reactive power is described as discrete matrix elements, which are generated based on the Koopman operator. Then, an adaptive voltage control model is built based on the measurement-strategy mapping matrix, in which the lifted linear decision rule (LLDR) is introduced to continue the discrete matrix elements as a couple of constraints. Efficient formulation of DG strategies is realized in a data-driven manner based on ADN sensitivity. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated using the IEEE 33-node system, practical 53-node system, and IEEE 123-node system. The proposed strategy can effectively cope with voltage problems while enhancing the adaptability to variations in practical operation.</description></item><item><title>Planning of Stationary-Mobile Integrated Battery Energy Storage Systems Under Severe Convective Weather</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10806563</link><description>Under extreme weather events represented by severe convective weather (SCW), the adaptability of power system and service restoration have become paramount. To this end, this paper presents a novel planning method of stationary-mobile integrated battery energy storage system (SMI-BESS) capable of spatial flexibility.

Considering the multitude of threats posed of SCW, such as extreme wind speed, lightning strikes, and hail, a comprehensive fragility model of the distribution network is established to quantify adverse impacts of the extreme event. Uncertainties in renewable energy generation and distribution network failures are characterized using two types of ambiguity sets. A two-stage adaptive distributionally robust optimization (2S-ADRO) model is developed to plan the SMI-BESS in detail, meeting the requirements of mobile energy storage. Finally, case studies are conducted using weather and grid data from some regions in China to validate the effectiveness of the proposed structure and method.</description></item><item><title>DC Collector System Layout Optimization for Offshore Wind Farm With SPP Topology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10804676</link><description>With the rapid development of global offshore wind power, the scale and capacity of offshore wind farms (OWF) are continuously expanding, making it crucial to enhance the overall economic efficiency of OWFs. However, previous studies on DC collector systems of OWFs mainly focus on the DC series-parallel (SP) topology, which escalates the overall costs. To optimize the collector system layout, this paper proposes a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) based framework for improving the overall economic efficiency by leveraging an advanced DC series-parallel-parallel (SPP) topology. In the proposed framework, a hierarchical open-loop multiple travelling salesman problem (HOMTSP) is utilized to model the SPP topology, decomposing the collector system layout optimization (CSLO) problem into sub-problems for resolution. Subsequently, a hierarchical double Q-learning (DQL) is employed to solve these sub-problems, with a topology-guided mechanism to refine the routing results and correct crossed cables by incorporating topological characteristics. Furthermore, this study acquires the GIS data and the connection scheme of wind turbines in a real OWF for the case study. Numerical results show the SPP-based framework significantly improves the economic efficiency compared to the DC SP topology and the AC double-sided ring topology.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Design for Switchable Grid-Following and Grid-Forming Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10811873</link><description>This paper presents the design of a novel grid-forming (GFM) control structure adapted from a typical grid-following (GFL) control structure with minimal edits, thereby enabling a switchable control structure for voltage sourced converters (VSCs) to operate in either GFL or GFM mode by simply switching a flag manually. The VSC is shown to be able to operate in the GFL control mode synchronizing to the main grid through a phase-locked-loop (PLL) and operate as a GFM controller with power-based synchronization for both grid-connected and islanded conditions. To guarantee smooth operation, the control schemes and the mode switching logic have been carefully designed and examined via a series of experiments. The experiment results show that the switchable control structure can fulfill the desired control and operation functions and enable smooth transition between control modes.</description></item><item><title>Intraday Wind Power Forecasting by Ensemble of Overlapping Historical Numerical Weather Predictions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10812675</link><description>The numerical weather prediction (NWP) is crucial to improve intraday wind power forecasting (WPF) accuracy. However, conventional WPF methods relied solely on a latest reported single NWP, overlooking hidden information from sequentially reported multiple historical NWPs that are partially overlapped over time. Additionally, it's challenging to tackle intraday WPF as it involves both ultra-short-term and short-term horizons with different characteristics. Therefore, a novel spatio-temporal representation learning network is proposed for intraday WPF by ensemble of overlapping historical NWPs. Initially, an integrated mask-reconstruction representation learning pretraining strategy is employed to extract hidden representations of historical wind power measurements and overlapping historical NWPs, providing contextual information for the subsequent intraday WPF task. Then, the output layer is trained and end-to-end fine-tuning of the entire network is conducted to adapt to the specific forecasting task. Moreover, a multi-task learning strategy based on hard parameter sharing is adopted to ensure balanced predictive accuracy across each of forecasted wind farms. Case study and detailed ablation tests based on 5 real-world wind farms demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the forecasting accuracy of most wind farms by leveraging spatio-temporal correlation, achieving the best average performance across all time horizons compared to the baseline models.</description></item><item><title>Event-Triggered H-Infinity Pitch Control for Floating Offshore Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10820839</link><description>The complex wind and wave environment can lead to increased external disturbances and power fluctuations of floating offshore wind turbines, posing a significant challenge to their stable operation. To cope with this issue, this paper formulates an event-triggered H-infinity pitch control strategy for floating offshore wind turbines. Firstly, a linear parameter varying model of floating offshore wind turbines is proposed, utilizing the dynamic characteristics of subsystems while considering the combined external disturbances from wind and wave. Then, the event-triggered control strategy is introduced into the H-infinity pitch control of floating offshore wind turbines. Based on this, a criterion for the asymptotic stability and H-infinity norm boundedness of floating offshore wind turbines is derived. Furthermore, an algorithm is presented for designing feedback gain matrices of the event-triggered H-infinity pitch control, which can effectively reduce the update frequency of the controller. Finally, a simulation is conducted on the IEA 15 MW Reference Wind Turbine by integrating OpenFAST with MATLAB/Simulink. The simulation results provide a comparative analysis of the event-triggered H-infinity pitch control strategy and the continuous-time pitch control strategy, demonstrating the superiority of the method proposed in this paper.</description></item><item><title>Frequency Constrained Dispatch With Energy Reserve and Virtual Inertia From Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10840325</link><description>With the increasing penetration of wind power and gradual retirement of conventional generating units (CGUs), wind turbines (WTs) become promising resources to provide steady-state energy reserve (ER) and frequency support for the grid to facilitate supply-demand balance and frequency security. In this regard, a novel frequency constrained dispatch framework with ER and virtual inertia from WTs is proposed. Firstly, this paper establishes the WT model with both ER and virtual inertia, whose energy sources are WT's deloading and rotor kinetic energy, respectively. Secondly, the system frequency response and CGUs' power response are derived while considering WTs exiting inertia response at frequency nadir. Then, this paper develops a stochastic-optimization-based frequency constrained dispatch model, where both WTs' frequency regulation parameters and rotor speeds are decision variables, so that the coupling between WT's mechanical and electrical parts and the coupling between system's transient dynamics and steady-state operation can be fully reflected. Finally, convex hull relaxation, convex hull approximation and deep neural networks are used to transform the original nonlinear model into a mixed-integer second-order cone programming model. Case studies on the 118-bus system verify the effectiveness of the proposed models and methods.</description></item><item><title>Secondary Frequency Regulation From Aggregated Distributed Photovoltaics: A Dynamic Flexibility Aggregation Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10840304</link><description>To fully utilize the potential of massive small-scale distributed photovoltaics (DPVs) for secondary frequency regulation (SFR), this article introduces a hierarchical coordination framework that incorporates the dynamic response characteristic (DRC) of DPV to automatic generation control (AGC) signals, thereby reflecting the dynamic flexibility of the aggregated DPVs (ADPVs). First, a reserved power feasible range is derived for scheduling the power reserve control (PRC) scheme considering the uncertainty in PV generation and the de-loaded margin base constraint. Second, a two-stage multi-cluster DRC aggregation method that considers the impact of the PRC scheme is developed to describe the equivalent DRC of the ADPVs. Last, the article constructs an integrated cost function (ICF) that reveals the interdependencies between SFR capacity, equivalent DRC and regulation cost, which enables the decoupled scheduling of the SFR indices and the PRC scheme. An event-triggered duty factor reassignment mechanism is further proposed to improve the reliability of SFR service deployment in case of unexpected events. Simulation results indicate that the framework is an efficient approach for quantifying, trading and realizing the dynamic flexibility of the ADPVs.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Scheduling and Commercial Testbed-Based Verification of Integrated PV-ESS Systems Considering Settlement Rules in South Korea</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10842237</link><description>This article proposes an optimal scheduling algorithm for an integrated PV-ESS system to maximize the overall revenue from both system marginal price (SMP) and renewable energy certificate (REC), considering detailed settlement rules in South Korea.

This paper presents a multi-objective bi-level LVRT control strategy for the two-stage PV grid-connected system to maximize the positive and negative sequence voltage support capability while ensuring safe operation under asymmetrical faults. The AC level controls the grid side inverter, while the DC level regulates the boost converter. The grid voltage support control strategy is implemented at the AC level to support the positive and negative sequence voltage of the point of common coupling. Considering there is an inherent contradiction between grid voltage support with the overcurrent of inverter and DC voltage oscillation, the current references are automatically adjusted to facilitate the maximum positive and negative voltage support while limiting the overcurrent and oscillation of DC-link voltage. Based on the power reference shared from the AC level, the DC level regulates the boost converter to stabilize the DC-link voltage speedily by utilizing the compensation current. Finally, simulations and experiments demonstrate the voltage support capability and fast dynamic response characteristics of DC-link voltage in different scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Two-Stage Planning for Smart Buildings With Flexible Heating Load Considering Climate Change Induced Heat Waves</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856233</link><description>Building energy planning is significantly challenged by climate change, particularly the increasing frequency of heat waves impacting heating and cooling demands. Current planning methodologies neglect the impacts of heat waves on energy consumption and do not accurately model the temperature-dependent performance of heat pumps (HPs). This paper addresses the critical issue of designing energy-efficient and climate-resilient buildings through optimal resource configuration under uncertain weather conditions. A two-stage stochastic optimization model for building energy system planning is proposed. In the first stage, the capacities of energy resources are optimized; in the second stage, operational strategies under various weather scenarios are determined. A novel long-term load forecasting method using morphing techniques is developed to generate scenario trees accounting for both normal conditions and heat waves, capturing the impact of climate change on energy demand. Additionally, a temperature-dependent HP model with finite partial output levels is introduced, improving upon existing fixed coefficient of performance models to reflect practical operational characteristics. Simulation results on a real educational building in Stockholm demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, showing an 8.33% reduction in heating capacity requirements and a 62.14% decrease in solution time, enhancing both resilience and computational efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive and Decentralized Control Strategy to Support Coordination of Multiple DC Microgrids Considering Transmission Line Impedance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856845</link><description>Multiple DC Microgrids (MGs) can be interconnected by interlinking converters (ICs) to support each other through coordinated control strategies. However, the nonnegligible transmission line resistance results in inaccuracies in decentralized coordination at steady state. To address this issue, an adaptive and decentralized control strategy is proposed to eliminate the impact of transmission line resistance and facilitate accurate power sharing among the DC MGs. The proposed strategy injects a perturbance to estimate the transmission line resistance based on the IC signals sampled before and after the perturbance, obviating the need for additional measuring devices on the transmission line. With the estimated results, the proposed strategy compensates for the transmission line resistance through virtual resistance, achieving accurate power sharing among the DC MGs under coordinated control. The compensation and coordination operations rely on the local signals from the IC, ensuring this power coordination in a decentralized manner. Furthermore, the estimation and compensation algorithm is decoupled at each IC port, allowing the easy extension of the proposed strategy. This paper discusses the application of the proposed strategy in three scenarios: two interconnected DC MGs, and several DC MGs interconnected via a multiport IC or multiple ICs. Using the example of two DC MGs with line impedance considered, the system stability is analyzed based on a small-signal model. Lastly, the feasibility of the proposed strategy in these scenarios is validated by the simulation and hardware-in-loop tests.</description></item><item><title>Mode Switching-Induced Instability of Multi-Source Feed DC Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10943241</link><description>In DC microgrids (DCMGs), DC-bus signaling based control strategy is extensively used for power management, where mode switching plays a crucial role in achieving multi-source coordination. However, few studies have noticed the impact of mode switching and switching strategies on system voltage stability. To fill this gap, this paper aims to provide a general analysis framework for mode switching-induced instability in multi-source DCMGs. First, manifold theory is employed to analyze the stability of the DCMG switched system. Subsequently, the instability mechanism and its physical interpretation are explored. The positive feedback activated by the decreasing DC bus voltage during the switching process leads to instability. Switching strategy may inadvertently contribute to this instability. To improve stability, a novel control method based on mode scheduling is proposed, by adjusting switching strategy and thereby correcting the system trajectory. Finally, both real-time simulations and experimental tests on a DCMG system verify the correctness and effectiveness of theoretical analysis results.</description></item><item><title>Distribution System Blackstart and Restoration Using DERs and Dynamically Formed Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10858306</link><description>Extreme weather events have led to long-duration outages in the distribution system (DS), necessitating novel approaches to blackstart and restore the system. Existing blackstart solutions utilize blackstart units to establish multiple microgrids (MGs), sequentially energize non-blackstart units, and restore loads. However, these approaches often result in isolated MGs. In DERs-aided blackstart, the continuous operation of these MGs is limited by the finite energy capacity of commonly used blackstart units like battery energy storage (BES)-based grid-forming inverters (GFMIs). To address this issue, this article proposes a holistic blackstart and restoration framework that incorporates synchronization between dynamic MGs and the entire DS with the transmission grid (TG). To support synchronization, we leveraged virtual synchronous generator-based control for GFMIs to estimate their frequency response to load pick-up events using only initial/final quasi-steady-state points. Subsequently, a synchronization switching condition is developed to model synchronizing switches, aligning them seamlessly with a linearized branch flow problem. Finally, we designed a bottom-up blackstart and restoration framework that considers the switching structure of the DS, energizing/synchronizing switches, DERs with grid-following inverters, and BES-based GFMIs with frequency security constraints. The proposed framework is validated in IEEE-123-bus system, considering cases with two and four GFMIs under various TG recovery instants.</description></item><item><title>Sensitivity-Based Heterogeneous Ordered Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Volt-Var Control in Active Distribution Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10879343</link><description>As power grids expand, maintaining stable voltage and minimizing losses become increasingly crucial. Meanwhile, the widespread use of heterogeneous devices in modern distribution systems necessitates effective multi-device coordination. This issue is exacerbated by the integration of intermittent renewable sources (e.g., solar and wind), which introduce voltage fluctuations. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel Sensitivity-based Heterogeneous Ordered Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (SHOM) method for Volt-Var Control (VVC) in Active Distribution Networks (ADNs). By leveraging voltage-reactive sensitivity to explicitly guide sequential policy updates, SHOM ensures a monotonic improvement in control strategies under heterogeneous, networked constraints. Experimental results on IEEE test feeders demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior voltage regulation and lower power losses compared to existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Deep Learning and Projection Neural Network With Finite-Time Convergence for Energy Management of Multi-Energy System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856887</link><description>In this paper, an approach based on projection neural network (PNN), sliding mode control technique, and deep learning is proposed to solve the energy management problem of multi-energy systems (MES) containing dynamic parameters. First, the sliding mode technique is introduced in the PNN to design a finite-time PNN (FTPNN). The stability and finite-time convergence of the proposed FTPNN are proved by the Lyapunov method and the setting time bound is given. Then, the deep FTPNN (DFTPNN) is designed by combining deep learning with the proposed FTPNN. The dynamic parameters in the MES that change over time are used as input variables for the DFTPNN, allowing the trained DFTPNN to respond immediately to changes in the dynamic parameters and to predict the solutions of the FTPNN with different parameters directly. Simulation experiments show that FTPNN has faster convergence compared to PNN. DFTPNN significantly reduces the computation time compared to FTPNN. DFTPNN provides predicted solutions to FTPNN. Since DFTPNN can respond immediately to changes in dynamic parameters and directly provide energy management strategies under different parameters, it can adapt to changing environments and promote the economic and stable operation of MES.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Enhanced Safe Reinforcement Learning for the Dispatch of a Local Energy Community</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10887028</link><description>Local Energy Community (LEC) has emerged as a viable community-focus framework to enhance local reliability and energy efficiency by integrating different energy sectors and managing local distributed energy resources (DERs). However, the difficulties associated with handling model complexity, along with privacy concerns arising from interactions between energy operators within the LEC, pose challenges for traditional algorithms in achieving coordinated dispatch. To this end, we develop a novel privacy-enhanced, safe, coordinated dispatch framework that integrates reinforcement learning (RL), the perturbation module, and the safety module. The private states of each energy sector within the LEC are concealed by the independent perturbation module before sharing. A central RL agent is then trained on the concealed state space to learn the optimal policy for coordinated dispatch under the complex and uncertain environment. Furthermore, dispatch actions are evaluated and refined by the safety module before the operators execute them. In this way, we can obtain an optimal policy without disclosing any sector&#8217;s private state while ensuring the safe operation of the LEC. Extensive experiments are carried out to validate the superior performance and scalability of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Industrial Energy Management and Production Decision Making via Lyapunov-Guided Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10934097</link><description>Energy-intensive industries have to reduce fossil fuel consumption while scheduling production for cost efficiency. It poses the question that how to coordinate renewable energy generation, storage, heat recovery and energy cascade utilization in real time to deal with the low energy efficiency and continuous production problems existing in complex dynamic coupled process production. This question is further complicated while facing difficulties in collaborative modeling and online control by the underlying stochastic process without accurate statistic knowledge. To characterize the above issues, a non-convex operation optimization problem is formulated for coupling production and energy joint scheduling. To obtain a simple online solution with provable performance, a method by combining Lyapunov optimization and actor-critic deep reinforcement learning is proposed. The former is used to decouple the original problem into small-size non-convex subproblems for each time slot and guarantee the long-term constraints. The latter aims at the non-convex part by using model information of the former to obtain accurate evaluations of production actions for fast convergence and high robustness with low computational complexity. The simulation shows that the proposed method can achieve the online optimal benefit while ensuring production tasks and system stability with high scalability.</description></item><item><title>A Statistical-Based Approach for Decentralized Demand Response Toward Primary Frequency Support: A Case Study of Large-Scale 5G Base Stations With Adaptive Droop Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856199</link><description>Due to the rapidity required for primary frequency control (PFC), the decentralized responses of distributed energy resources (DERs) are often uncoordinated and cannot be aggregated into a desired outcome. This paper proposes a novel approach to consolidate the decentralized responses of ON/OFF DERs as an organized droop control. For a DER population, a dynamic response threshold can be calculated based on its statistical distribution, enabling DERs to autonomously respond to PFC according to local states. The aggregation of their responses can align with any preset droop curve (linear or non-linear). The approach is demonstrated by a novel DER, 5G base stations (gNBs) and their backup energy storage systems (BESSs), marking the first attempt of gNBs for PFC support, to the authors&#8217; knowledge. In this regard, gNB dormancy model, based on user equipment (UE) access, and dynamic BESS response model, derived from experimental data, are developed. An adaptive droop control scheme is designed to enable gNBs within multiple radio access networks (RANs) to provide differentiated responses based on disturbances degree and RANs busyness level. Simulations based on real device data show that the proposed approach enables decentralized gNBs to perform accurate response, providing PFC support without affecting communication network operation.</description></item><item><title>Two-Timescale Online Optimization of Behind-the-Meter Battery Storage for Stacked Revenue by Providing Multi-Services</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10886993</link><description>Behind-the-meter (BTM) battery energy storage systems (BESS) are becoming increasingly important in the power system with the proliferation of intermittent distributed renewable energy sources. Stacked revenue can be achieved by providing multi-services to the power grid, justifying the substantial upfront cost of BTM BESS and promoting their future adoption. This paper focuses on optimizing the operation strategy of BTM BESS to maximize the time average stacked revenue obtained from multiple service markets, including energy arbitrage, frequency regulation, photovoltaic (PV) power smoothing and reactive power compensation. Challenges arise from the coupling of operation decisions both among multiple services and over the temporal dimension, considering the different decision timescales of service markets as well as the battery dynamics. The uncertainty of stochastic parameters further complicates the optimization process. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel two timescale online optimization scheme based on the Lyapunov optimization framework. The uncertainties are tackled by making decisions online, and the computation complexity is highly relieved by relaxing the temporal coupling with a drift-plus-penalty technique. Theoretic analyses are conducted to prove that the solution of this relaxed online decision problem is always feasible for the original one, and it can achieve near-optimum with a constant optimality gap. Extensive simulations utilizing the energy and frequency regulation data from the real market validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>Occupant-Centric Demand Response for Thermostatically-Controlled Home Loads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10879280</link><description>Efficiently managing energy usage to balance supply and demand on the electric grid is crucial, especially with the widespread deployment of distributed variable renewable electricity generation. This paper introduces two duty-cycle control methods for heating systems, adjusting thermostat setpoints to limit and shift electricity demand. The control approaches employ innovative techniques, such as adaptive duty cycling, to prioritize household thermal comfort while reducing peak demand. These control methods can respond to signals from the electric grid, including demand targets and time-of-use tariffs, and were tested physically on an electric furnace and heat pump in a test home during winter conditions in 2021 and 2022. The results are given as average demand reductions and energy use impacts with respect to the average indoor-outdoor temperature difference during the control period. For heat pumps, demand limiting control reduced power by 18.5% and 23.3% for indoor-outdoor temperature differences of 30&#176;F and 40&#176;F. Preheating-based demand shifting achieved reductions of 34.8% and 33.2% for the same temperature differences. Electric furnace tests showed demand reductions of 33.8% and 25.3% for demand limiting, and 56.1% and 45.7% for preheating-based demand shifting. These findings highlight the potential for innovative control methods to enhance grid efficiency and reduce energy consumption.</description></item><item><title>A &#8220;Smart Model-Then-Control&#8221; Strategy for the Scheduling of Thermostatically Controlled Loads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891668</link><description>Model predictive control (MPC) has been widely adopted for indoor temperature control and building energy management. There are two steps in traditional MPC: 1) modeling thermal dynamics as the state space function to represent the temperature variation influenced by thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs); 2) formulating an optimization problem for optimal scheduling of TCLs within the control horizon. However, such a &#8220;model-then-control&#8221; strategy could result in biased control because of the unaligned modeling error and control cost, i.e., minimization of model errors may not necessarily lead to minimal costs against actual thermal dynamics in buildings. To tackle this problem, we advocate for a &#8220;smart model-then-control&#8221; (SMC) strategy that incorporates thermal dynamics modeling into the temperature control task. In particular, instead of using mean squared errors (MSE), we adopt the control objective as the task-specific loss function to guide the model training. We further formulate an Input Convex Neural Network (ICNN)-based surrogate loss function, which is differentiable and convex for effective training. In this way, the objectives of both model training and temperature control in MPC are well-aligned to obtain cost-effective decisions. We validate the performance of the SMC strategy in single-zone and multi-zone buildings. The simulation results show that it can reduce control costs by 5.97% and 2.10% respectively when compared with traditional MPC.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive MARL Large Model for Dispatch Strategy Generation in Logistics-Energy Spatiotemporal Coordination of Container Seaports</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10915539</link><description>Logistics-energy coordination significantly enhances energy efficiency in electrified seaports. However, daily changes in environment data necessitate the re-implementation of optimization procedures, causing huge computational burdens. This paper proposes an adaptive multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) large model for logistics-energy spatiotemporal coordination of container seaports. The well-trained large model can directly generate optimal policy for each operating day from environment data without re-solving. To achieve this, a comprehensive logistics-energy coordination model is first established considering the spatial and temporal constraints of all-electric ships (AESs), quay cranes (QCs), auto guided vehicles (AGVs), and the seaport power distribution network (SPDN). The model is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Then a MARL large model is developed, involving a hypernetwork mapping environment data to optimal policy, and special structures for both hypernetwork and agent policy networks to adapt to any number of daily arrival AESs. Additionally, a cascading action modification layer is designed to ensure correct action outputs within complex spatiotemporal constraints. A tailored training method with two acceleration strategies are developed for the large model. Case studies illustrate that the large model after training can automatically generate optimal policies with little to no fine-tuning, outperforming existing methods that require extensive solution time.</description></item><item><title>Harmonic Stability Analysis of Microgrids With Converter-Interfaced Distributed Energy Resources, Part I: Modeling and Theoretical Foundations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854521</link><description>This paper proposes a method for the Harmonic Stability Assessment (HSA) of power systems with a high share of Converter-Interfaced Distributed Energy Resources (CIDERs). To this end, the Harmonic State-Space (HSS) model of a generic power system is formulated by combining the HSS models of the resources and the grid in closed-loop configuration. The HSS model of the resources is obtained from the Linear Time-Periodic (LTP) models of the CIDER components transformed to frequency domain using Fourier theory and Toeplitz matrices. Notably, the HSS of a CIDER is capable of representing the coupling between harmonic frequencies in detail. The HSS model of the grid is derived from the dynamic equations of the individual branch and shunt elements. The system matrix of the HSS models on power-system or resource level is employed for eigenvalue analysis in the context of HSA. A sensitivity analysis of the eigenvalue loci w.r.t. changes in model parameters, and a classification of eigenvalues into control-design variant, control-design invariant, and design invariant eigenvalues is proposed. A case of harmonic instability is identified by the HSA and validated via Time-Domain Simulations (TDS) in Simulink.</description></item><item><title>Harmonic Stability Analysis of Microgrids With Converter-Interfaced Distributed Energy Resources, Part II: Case Studies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854578</link><description>In Part I of this paper a method for the Harmonic Stability Assessment (HSA) of power systems with a high share of Converter-Interfaced Distributed Energy Resources (CIDERs) was proposed. Specifically, the Harmonic State-Space (HSS) model of a generic power system is derived through combination of the components&#8217; HSS models. The HSS models of CIDERs and grid are based on Linear Time-Periodic (LTP) models, capable of representing the coupling between different harmonics. In Part II, the HSA of a grid-forming, and two grid-following CIDERs (i.e., ex- and including the DC-side modelling) is performed. More precisely, the classification of the eigenvalues, the impact of the maximum harmonic order on the locations of the eigenvalues, and the sensitivity curves of the eigenvalues w.r.t. to control parameters are provided. These analyses allow to study the physical meaning and origin of the CIDERs&#8217; eigenvalues. Additionally, the HSA is performed for a representative example system derived from the CIGR&#200; low-voltage benchmark system. A case of harmonic instability is identified through the system eigenvalues, and validated with Time-Domain Simulations (TDS) in Simulink. It is demonstrated that, as opposed to stability analyses based on Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) models, the HSA is suitable for the detection of harmonic instability.</description></item><item><title>AC and DC Interaction Analysis and Transient Control Strategy for Soft Open Points in Unbalanced Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856184</link><description>Soft open points (SOPs) can play a key role in hybrid AC/DC distribution networks (DNs) due to their flexible power control ability. However, the sequence-domain behavior of SOPs in unbalanced DNs cannot be ignored from the perspective of system stability and safety. Therefore, this paper first investigates the interaction between AC and DC components in unbalanced DNs by considering SOPs with the typical  $V_{dc}$ /Q and P/Q control strategies in medium-voltage DNs. The analytical results indicate  $2^{\mathrm { nd}}$  frequency oscillations in q-axis voltage, power, and DC voltage are present in unbalanced DNs. This deteriorates the transient dynamics and synchronization of SOPs and may result in the disconnection of loads and resources. To address this, a robust sequence-decomposed control strategy is proposed for SOP. To ride through unbalanced DNs, an adaptive virtual impedance-based control is activated in the positive sequence to improve restoration capability, while the negative-sequence currents are suppressed by the inner control. The DC synchronization loop is implemented by using the transferred DC power and internal energy for frequency stability enhancement. The case studies in a 40-node medium-voltage DN indicate that the proposed control enables SOPs to ride through both unbalanced load and unbalanced fault conditions in a short transient time.</description></item><item><title>Accelerated Dynamic Event-Triggered Algorithm for Online Power System Optimization by Using Powerball Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10876194</link><description>Nowadays, online optimization for power systems has gained increasing attention due to many time-varying scenarios in practical applications. This paper proposes a novel feedback-based online algorithm for power system optimization problems by combining the powerball technique and a dynamic event-triggered mechanism, aiming to achieving a faster convergence rate and high communication efficiency simultaneously. In particular, a measurement-based prima-dual approach is utilized to solve the considered time-varying optimization problem. Taking the constrained resource issue, a more flexible triggering condition with a dynamic threshold is designed for dual variables to reduce communication burden. By further employing the powerball strategy, the primal-dual iteration is modified with an improved convergence rate. Finally, numerical experiments on test systems are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed online algorithm. It is shown that the proposed approach has superior convergence property especially in the initial process. Meanwhile, a better trade-off between the satisfactory system performance and communication resources consumption can be achieved.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Time Scale Frequency Regulation Control of Virtual Power Plant Based on Fuzzy Sets</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884854</link><description>With the continuous development of the power system, in the face of the frequency deviation caused by the randomness and volatility of renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic and wind power, considering the use of air conditioning, electric vehicle charging piles, and energy storage to form a distributed resource cluster that takes into account economy and efficiency to participate in frequency regulation auxiliary services to reduce frequency deviation. In the process of a virtual power plant (VPP) participating in frequency regulation auxiliary service, a multi-time scale frequency regulation control strategy of VPP is proposed, which can cope with frequency deviation on different time scales. By establishing a three-stage frequency regulation process, the collaborative optimization of distributed resources is realized. The priority principle is adopted to prioritize the scheduling of higher-value resources to participate in frequency regulation, which helps to allocate resources. In the process of tertiary frequency regulation, the fuzzy sets are used to optimize the frequency regulation strategy of energy storage, which reduces the switching times of energy storage and improves the stability of frequency regulation. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the feasibility of distributed resources participating in frequency regulation are verified by a case.</description></item><item><title>Model-Based Safe Reinforcement Learning for Active Distribution Network Scheduling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10930731</link><description>Data-driven methods, especially reinforcement learning (RL), are adept at addressing uncertainties but are poor at ensuring safety, which is a critical requirement in active distribution networks (DNs). To address the problem of active DN scheduling and to overcome RL&#8217; most critical drawback&#8212;security risk, this paper proposes a model-based safe RL framework that embeds a model-based safety module (MBSM) in the RL&#8217;s loop. The proposed framework can guarantee that the agent&#8217;s actions (real/reactive power outputs of controllable distributed energy resources (DERs)) strictly satisfy the DN&#8217;s operational security constraints. It does not rely on any expert knowledge and is suitable for application in large-scale systems. Comparative studies against existing Safe RL (SRL) and classic optimization methods verify that the proposed method achieves the best performance in terms of DERs operating cost and renewable energy consumption while strictly satisfying the DN&#8217;s operational security constraints.</description></item><item><title>Leveraging Time-Causal State Variable Aggregation for Real-Time Schedule of Massive Air Conditioners</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909698</link><description>Air conditioner (AC) loads offer promising flexibility for active distribution networks to manage uncertainties, such as those in renewable energy generation, electricity prices, and load demand. However, real-time scheduling of ACs is challenging due to their massive temporal coupling constraints and time-causal uncertainties. To address this, a novel time-causal aggregation-based approximate dynamic programming (TCA-ADP) algorithm is proposed for efficient scheduling. The time-causality requirements for aggregating state variables are first analyzed to align with the real-time sequential decision-making process. Subsequently, an enhanced aggregation model is developed to ensure both high accuracy and adherence to time causality. The aggregation process is further reformulated as a linear program to optimize aggregation parameters and enable tractable computation. Accordingly, the TCA-ADP leverages aggregated state variables to approximate the value function as a new way, balancing computational efficiency and economy against the large value function space of massive ACs. By training the value function offline using historical data, the TCA-ADP efficiently achieves near-optimal real-time scheduling of massive ACs through parallel and closed-form disaggregation. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the TCA-ADP, highlighting its aggregation accuracy, uncertainty handling, and the trade-off between economy and tractability.</description></item><item><title>Model-Free Aggregation for Virtual Power Plants Using Input Convex Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916791</link><description>The virtual power plant (VPP) has been advocated as a promising way to aggregate massive distributed energy resources (DERs) in a distribution system (DS) for their participation in transmission-level operations. This requires identifying the feasible set of VPP power transfers fulfilling DS operational constraints. The identification task is completed using the existing methods by relying on constraint parameters (e.g., line impedance). However, the constraint parameters in a DS may be inaccurate and even missing in practice. Consequently, this paper develops a model-free aggregation method for VPPs. The proposed method first develops an input convex neural network (ICNN)-based surrogate for the feasible set of VPP power transfers. Our ICNN-based surrogate can be determined in a model-free manner by historical data. Furthermore, it is proven by leveraging the convexity and epigraph relaxation of an ICNN that our ICNN-based surrogate can be reformulated as a linear programming model without binary variables. This allows efficiently embedding our ICNN-based surrogate in transmission-level operations so that numerous VPPs can be efficiently coordinated at the transmission level. The proposed method is verified by numerical experiments in the IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 136-bus test systems.</description></item><item><title>Anomaly Identification of Synchronized Voltage Waveform for Situational Awareness of Low Inertia Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10918789</link><description>Inverter-based resources (IBRs) such as photovoltaics (PVs), wind turbines, and battery energy storage systems (BESSs) are widely deployed in low-carbon power systems. However, these resources typically do not provide the inertia needed for grid stability, resulting in a low-inertia power system. IBRs and lack of inertia have been known to cause anomalies such as waveform distortions and wideband oscillations in power systems due to the limited inertia level, leading to increased generation trips and load shedding. To achieve effective anomaly identification, this paper proposes a synchro-waveform-based algorithm utilizing real-time synchronized voltage waveform measurements from waveform measurement units (WMUs). In the proposed method, different physical characteristics, as well as statistical features, are extracted from synchronized voltage waveform measurements to filter anomalies. Then, the anomaly identification approach based on the random forest is developed and deployed into the FNET/GridEye system considering trade-offs among accuracy, computational burden, and deployment cost. Moreover, four WMUs are specially designed and deployed on Kauai Island to receive instantaneous synchronized voltage waveform measurements. To verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, different experiments are carried out with collected field test data. The result demonstrates that the performance of the proposed synchro-waveform-based anomaly categorization algorithm can accurately identify anomalies 95.35% of the time, which has comparable performance among benchmarking algorithms.</description></item><item><title>A Unified Model for Smart Meter Data Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10935756</link><description>Making adequate utilization of smart meter data is conducive to improving the energy efficiency of the power system from demand side, especially with booming artificial intelligence (AI) technology. However, most existing AI-based methods are highly incompatible to each other due to unique designs based on their respective tasks. Low compatibility will lead to duplicate modeling among similar tasks and skyrocketing implementation costs, which is not suitable for diverse and changing demand-side tasks. Although large language models provide a promising way to build the general-purpose models, they either need substantial resources for pre-training or case-by-case design for fine-tuning. Hence, there are practically rare task-generic models available for power systems. In this paper, we propose a novel unified model for smart meter data applications. Specifically, we first propose a unified model with mixture-of-expert layers to ensure sufficient model capacity in a cost-effective manner, which makes the training from scratch affordable. Then, we design an information bottleneck-based training scheme to facilitate the unified model to efficiently learn the generic knowledge. Moreover, we develop a general framework based on pre-training paradigm to formulate a uniform objective function and provide a consistent workflow for different tasks. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method are validated on public datasets, where the proposed unified model can be applied to load forecasting, data imputation as well as anomaly detection, and realizes comparable performance to state-of-the-art task-specific methods.</description></item><item><title>Implicit Enhanced Distributed Heavy-Ball Energy Management Strategy for Microgrids With Time-Varying Social Welfare and Delay</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10918786</link><description>Diverse energy sources and fluctuating energy demands highlight the criticality of microgrid energy management (MEM). This paper develops a general model of social welfare maximization in the presence of time-varying social welfare with quadratic transmission losses, which implies that the fitting coefficients of the transmission losses, cost function, and utility function may vary over time. A significant difference with existing works is the dependence of the problem&#8217;s optimal solution on time variation, making higher requirements on the algorithm&#8217;s performance, especially the convergence rate. To address these challenges, we extend the conventional heavy-ball method and propose a novel implicit enhanced distributed heavy-ball algorithm. The algorithm incorporates multiple heavy-ball terms to accelerate convergence. Notably, the second heavy-ball term is implicitly implemented via an acceleration term that contains historical information and consensus error. Furthermore, the algorithm obviates the necessity for the sharing of additional auxiliary variables, thereby reducing the communication overhead. We demonstrate that the algorithm converges asymptotically to the neighborhood of the time-varying optimal solution even with arbitrarily large but bounded communication delays. Finally, detailed case studies illustrate that the algorithm can improve the convergence rate by 15.02% over conventional method, followed by the validation of its scalability and the discussion of the negative impact of delay.</description></item><item><title>Network Topology Flexibility-Aware Robust Electricity Trading for Distribution System Survivability Enhancement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10922206</link><description>Extreme weather events significantly threaten power system security and market operations, causing either substantial load fluctuations or grid line failures. Current distribution-level electricity market mechanisms often prove inadequate during such events. Furthermore, limited research has explored electricity market mechanisms for improving distribution system survivability. To fill this gap, this study proposes a double-auction mechanism to facilitate distribution-level transactions of non-utility distributed energy resources through market incentives for proactive system resilience enhancement. This mechanism aims to utilize a market-driven approach to achieve the highest system survivability in disasters. This trading mechanism is divided into two stages to address the direct changes in the tradability caused by line failures: clearing and delivery. During market clearing, the DSO operates as an auctioneer to concurrently optimize social welfare and prior-event network topology. The pricing rule employs an enhanced Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism to ensure truthful bidding and incentive compatibility. During delivery, the DSO performs redispatch to mitigate economic losses and compensates for energy curtailments through established settlement protocols. This market-driven resilience enhancement method formulates a bi-level two-stage robust optimization problem, solved using a customized column-and-constraint generation algorithm. Modified IEEE 13-node and 123-node systems are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Cyber-Physical Interdependence for Power System Operation and Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10870120</link><description>This paper summarizes the technical endeavors undertaken by the Task Force (TF) on Cyber-Physical Interdependence for Power System Operation and Control.

Motivated by the model predictive control for energy storage, our end-to-end method incorporates the prior knowledge of the storage model and infers the hidden reward that incentivizes energy storage decisions. This is achieved through a dual-layer framework, combining a prediction layer with an optimization layer. We introduce the perturbation idea into the designed decision-focused loss function to ensure the differentiability over linear storage models, supported by a theoretical analysis of the perturbed loss function. We also develop a hybrid loss function for effective model training. We provide two challenging applications for our proposed framework: energy storage arbitrage, and energy storage behavior prediction. The numerical experiments on real price data demonstrate that our arbitrage approach achieves the highest profit against existing methods. The numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world energy storage data show that our approach achieves the best behavior prediction performance against existing benchmark methods, which shows the effectiveness of our method.</description></item><item><title>A Lightweight Framework for Measurement Causality Extraction and FDIA Localization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10925483</link><description>False Data Injection Attack (FDIA) has become a growing concern in modern cyber-physical power systems. Many learning-based approaches have utilized the statistical correlation patterns between measurements to facilitate the detection and localization of FDIA. However, these correlation patterns are susceptible to the distribution drift of measurement data, which can be induced by changes in system operating points or variations in attack strength, leading to degraded model performance. Causal inference serves as a promising solution to this problem, as it can embed the physical relationship between measurements as causal patterns that are robust against data distribution drifts. However, causal inference is also computationally demanding. To leverage its advantages and address the computational cost issue, this paper proposes a lightweight framework based on causal inference and Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to extract causal patterns between measurements and locate FDIAs. The proposed framework consists of two levels. The lower level uses an X-learner algorithm to estimate the causality strength between measurements and generate Measurement Causality Graphs (MCGs). The upper level then applies a GAT to identify the anomaly patterns in the MCGs. Since the extracted causality patterns are intrinsically related to the measurements, it is easier for the upper level model to identify the attacked nodes than the existing FDIA localization approaches. A physical neighbor masking strategy is implemented to cut down the computational cost of both levels. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on the IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus systems. Experimental results show that the causality-based FDIA localization mechanism provides a lightweight solution to interpretable measurement causality extraction and robust FDIA localization.</description></item><item><title>S3Former: A Deep Learning Approach to High Resolution Solar PV Profiling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10874220</link><description>As the negative impact of climate change escalates, the global necessity to transition to sustainable energy sources becomes increasingly evident. Renewable energies have emerged as a viable solution for users, with Photovoltaic (PV) technology being a favored choice for small installations due to its high reliability, competitive market and increasing efficiency. Accurate mapping of PV installations is crucial in improving grid management, facilitating the integration of renewable energy, encouraging active participation from prosumers, and optimizing the economic performance of decentralized energy markets. To meet this need, S3Former is introduced, which is designed to segment solar panels from aerial imagery and provide size and location information critical for analyzing the impact of such installations on the grid. Although computer vision has become a preferred choice for such implementations, solar panel identification is challenging due to factors such as time-varying weather conditions, different roof characteristics, Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) variations and lack of appropriate initialization weights for optimized training. To tackle these complexities, S3Former features a Masked Attention Mask Transformer incorporating a self-supervised learning pretrained backbone. Specifically, the model leverages low-level and high-level features extracted from the backbone and incorporates an instance query mechanism incorporated on the Transformer architecture to enhance the localization of solar PV installations. Moreover, a self-supervised learning (SSL) phase (pretext task) is introduced to fine-tune the initialization weights on the backbone of S3Former, leading to a noticeable improvement on the results. To rigorously evaluate the performance of S3Former, diverse datasets are utilized, including GGE (France), IGN (France), and USGS (California, USA), across different GSDs. Our extensive experiments consistently demonstrate that the proposed model either matches or surpasses state-of-the-art models (SOTA) and validate the benefit of using the SSL method to improve the segmentation architecture.

With the advent of advanced metering infrastructure, data-driven outage location methods have significantly advanced beyond traditional approaches that rely on manual inspections. However, existing methods still face critical challenges, like reliance on single-source data, limited ability to handle partially observable systems or difficulties with loop networks. To the best of our knowledge, no single approach has comprehensively addressed all of these challenges at once. To this end, this paper proposes a comprehensive multisource data fusion framework for outage locations via probabilistic graph networks. The framework consists of three key phases. First, a novel method for reconstituting distribution networks with loops is developed, transforming looped networks into multiple radial subnetworks that retain all outage causalities of the original network. Second, Bayesian network (BN) models are established for each subnetwork, integrating multiple data sources and network structures. Finally, a joint Gibbs sampling mechanism, featuring forward and backward information flow, is designed to merge data from separate BN models and maximize the utilization of limited evidence, ensuring accurate outage location identification. The framework was validated on two modified public test systems, and comparative studies confirmed its effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>Synchro-Waveform-Based Event Identification Using Multi-Task Time-Frequency Transform Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10907975</link><description>Influenced by the transient dynamics and reduced inertia characteristics of high-penetration renewable energy systems, power system events frequently exhibit distinct characteristics such as high-frequency components including wide-band oscillations and hyper-harmonics. This makes standard systems face challenges including significant latency and reduced accuracy due to limited data resolution. However, current methods face significant limitations, including insufficient pattern capture ability, low noise immunity, limited feature learning, and restricted localization capabilities, thereby hindering real-time performance. To tackle this issue, this paper proposed a novel synchro-waveform-based event identification approach via a Multi-task Time-frequency Transform Network (MTTNet). Initially, a Time-frequency Transform Block (TTB) is developed to extract both local and global information. The TTB leverages both Fourier and S-transforms to derive comprehensive time-frequency information from synchro-waveforms. Subsequently, a multi-task learning strategy is employed to identify the type and distinguish localization of events. Integrating the TTB and multi-task learning, the MTTNet is designed for synchro-waveform-based event identification, incorporating an adaptive weighting strategy and simplified computation for the S-transform. Two different datasets, comprising simulated and actual synchro-waveforms, are collected from the IEEE 123 bus system and a real-world high-penetration renewable energy system using a universal grid analyzer. Extensive experiments on various conditions are carried out. Results demonstrated that the MTTNet consistently surpasses both basic and advanced baselines, with maximum improvements of 13.24% and 9.86%, respectively, while reducing the calculation burden by 15-19 times to achieve real-time event identification.</description></item><item><title>Spike Talk: Genesis and Neural Coding Scheme Translations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909727</link><description>Although digitalization of future power grids offer several coordination incentives, the reliability and security of information and communication technologies (ICT) hinders its overall performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture Spike Talk via a unified representation of power and information as a means of data normalization using spikes for coordinated control of microgrids. This grid-edge technology allows each distributed energy resource (DER) to execute decentralized secondary control philosophy independently by interacting among each other using power flow along the tie-lines. Inspired from the field of computational neuroscience, Spike Talk basically builds on a fine-grained parallelism on the information transfer theory in our brains, particularly when neurons (modeled as DERs) transmit information (inferred from power streams measurable at each DER) through synapses (modeled as tie-lines). Not only does Spike Talk simplify and address the current bottlenecks of the cyber-physical architectural operation by dismissing the ICT layer, it provides intrinsic operational and cost-effective opportunities in terms of infrastructure development, computations and modeling. Hence, this paper provides a pedagogic illustration of the key concepts and design theories. Since we focus on coordinated control of microgrids in this paper, the signaling accuracy and system performance is studied for several neural coding schemes responsible for converting the real-valued local measurements into spikes.</description></item><item><title>A Trustworthy Cloud-Edge Collaboration Framework for Scheduling Distributed Energy Resources in Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10902127</link><description>Integration of distributed energy resources, such as photovoltaics, has expanded rapidly within power distribution networks in recent years.

Therefore, in order to divert EV loads from the grid, a grid-free EV battery charger is proposed in this article. The charger consists of a photovoltaic (PV) panel as a source with parallel sets of four-switch-buck-boost (FSBB) converters and Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. The main theme of the control method is to harvest maximum PV power while delivering energy to the battery with contemplating battery life extension. In order to fulfill these two control objectives, an accurate 4-point PV-MPPT combined with pulse current battery charging methods are employed. In a simulation study of the parallel configuration with a 250 W PV panel and two 48 V Li-ion batteries, the concurrent operation of converters (COC) and non-concurrent operation of converters (NOC) are examined. In the COC pulse charging, two batteries simultaneously receive half PV power, whilst in the NOC pulse charging, two batteries alternately receive full PV power. It has been established that the NOC delivers continuous PV power and charges both batteries at a faster rate than the COC. Further, the simulation analysis is illustrated with a 20 kW PV parking shed for workplace for charging ten e-cars' batteries possessing different initial SoCs in NOC. Finally, an experimental proof of the concept is validated through a laboratory-scale hardware design of a 250 W PV panel charging two 48 V Li-ion batteries.</description></item><item><title>Iterative Learning Cascade Trajectory Tracking Control for Quadrotor-UAVs With Finite-Frequency Disturbances</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10804660</link><description>Due to the under-actuated and strong coupling characteristics of the quadrotor system, the conventional trajectory tracking control methods always suffer from the low control precision, and the poor anti-disturbance capability. In this work, an iterative learning high-performance trajectory tracking control method is designed for quadrotors with finite-frequency uncertainties. The designed closed-loop flight control system includes the cascade connection of position and attitude loops. First, a cascade position loop, composed of the finite-frequency $H_\infty$ based PD-PID controllers, controls the translational dynamics of the quadrotor, and generates the desired attitudes for inner loops. Then, an iterative learning P-sliding mode controller is designed for inner loops to compensate for the repeatable tracking errors of the attitudes, and attenuate the sensor noises during the periodic flight maneuvers. By learning from previous iterations, the combination of SMC and PD-type learning terms yields a satisfactory inner-loop robust performance. The resulting algorithm requires little computational power and memory, and its convergence properties under measurement noise are shown. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach in comparison to cascade PID-PID control and cascade PID-SMC methods.</description></item><item><title>Vehicle-Assisted Data Sensing in Vehicle Edge Metaverse: A Game Theory Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10810728</link><description>Quality of metaverse service depends on massive sensing data from real world. In this paper, we propose a vehicle-assisted data sensing framework in Vehicle Edge Metaverse (VEM) from an economic perspective, which incentivizes vehicles to contribute sensing data to metaverse service and thus improves the driving experience for vehicle users. We divide the data sensing problem among multiple operators and multiple vehicles into two subproblems which are the many-to-one matching subproblem and the resource pricing and power selection subproblem. Then, the two subproblems are transformed into game problems which can be modeled as Coalition Formation game (CFG) and Stackelberg game (SG), respectively. Moreover, we prove that the CFG game is Nash-stable and converges, and we analyze the SG game based on backward induction and prove that the game has a unique Nash equilibrium. Based on theoretical analysis, we propose an algorithm to solve these games, which aims to achieve an outcome that satisfies all participants through their strategic interactions. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm exhibits good convergence and is able to improve the utilities of both vehicles and operators.</description></item><item><title>Cooperative Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Task Execution and Resource Allocation in Vehicular Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10810664</link><description>Computer vision plays a crucial role in enabling connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to observe and comprehend their surroundings. The computer vision tasks are typically based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, CNNs often require significant processing power. Techniques like early exiting and split computing enhance CNN task execution latency and adaptability to varying environmental conditions. Since the split computing introduces additional overhead for offloading of the task from the CAV to an edge servers, we incorporate multiple autoencoders within each split point to enhance the adaptability of splitting under varying environmental conditions. However, the autoencoders introduce an additional layer of complexity related to the selection of the optimal compression strategy alongside the splitting and exiting decisions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel approach based on the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm. This algorithm dynamically and jointly determines the most suitable exit point, split point, and autoencoder. Furthermore, the MADDPG-based approach considers other CAVs when selecting action, promoting cooperation among CAVs. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces latency up to 44.4% while maintaining at least comparable or even higher accuracy of the computed vision outcome compared to the state-of-the-art solutions.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Mode Coordinated Control Framework of Vehicular Hybrid Power System Based on Energy Storage System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10804653</link><description>The operational management of diesel power packs is crucial for their fuel consumption, stability, and dynamic response. Vehicular hybrid power systems (VHPSs) can enhance these vehicle attributes. This study introduces a coordinated control framework to optimize the operation of VHPSs' diesel power pack in different modes. The first mode focuses on optimizing fuel consumption and dynamic response during the starting process using a reverse starting control strategy. The second mode targets fuel consumption and system stability during travel, proposing a two-layer coordinated control (TLCC) strategy that combines energy management and speed control. Through hardware in the loop simulation, the reverse starting control strategy reduces fuel consumption by 21.7% and starting time by 37.1% compared to conventional methods. Additionally, the proposed TLCC strategy outperforms the conventional rule-based (RB) strategy, achieving fuel consumption savings of 60.5%, 26.8%, and 21.9% across the typical three vehicular stages.</description></item><item><title>Edge Users Spectrum Efficiency Maximization Using Spatially Aligned Carrier Aggregated NOMA in Dense Multi-Cell Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10794805</link><description>This article studies a novel spatially aligned carrier aggregated non-orthogonal multiple access (SACA-NOMA) scheme for spectrum distribution and fair power allocation among grouped users. The proposed SACA-NOMA scheme integrates NOMA, carrier aggregation (CA) and joint transmission coordinated multipoint (JT-CoMP). It uses spatial differentiation between multiple NOMA pairs to combat interference. The main objective of the scheme is to maximize the spectral efficiency and quality of service (QoS) of cell-edge users by grouping them with multiple NOMA pairs. NOMA on top of CA assisted JT-CoMP is a promising contender for next-generation cellular networks because it can address the issues of spectrum scarcity and edge-user QoS. Two challenges arise from this integration when NOMA pairs are grouped with cell-edge user. Among these include an increase in interference at cell-edge user and complexity of implementing successive interference cancellation. These challenges can be addressed by exploiting the additional spatial domain. Base stations can cooperate to achieve interference alignment at cell-edge users through zero-forcing pre-coding. Similarly, a grouping scheme is presented wherein number of users in NOMA based pairing never exceeds two on any spatial axis. To this end, we formulated a joint problem of spectrum allocation, power control and BS's admission control into proposed scheme, with an aim to enhance the spectral efficiency of edge users. A fair power allocation and admission control algorithm is developed to solve the mixed integer non-linear fractional problem. The obtained numerical results show that the proposed SACA-NOMA scheme offers the cell-edge users a significant performance gain of about 60% and 300% when compared to the multi-cell hybrid NOMA-OMA and single cell OMA schemes, respectively. The proposed scheme is also validated for a typical macro-cell in an urban environment.</description></item><item><title>Interference Suppression for Active RIS-Empowered Array Radar Using Joint Beamforming Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10806899</link><description>Limited by the number of antenna elements, conventional array radars usually have insufficient ability of signal-dependent interference suppression in harsh environments, even though transmit and receive beamformers are jointly designed. This article deploys an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to assist the receive array, which provides numerous extra degrees-of-freedom to suppress interferences and to enhance the beamforming gain of target echo simultaneously since the active RIS has the capability of adjusting and amplifying incident signals. Aiming to maximize the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), we jointly design the phase-only or power-limited transmit beamformer, receive beamformer, and active RIS reflection coefficients. We devise an alternating optimization-based algorithm to handle the resultant nonconvex-constrained fractional programming problem. Specifically, the phase-only transmit beamformer is determined by the Riemannian gradient descent (RGD)-based method while the power-limited one is given as a closed-form optimal solution, and the active RIS reflection coefficients are updated by the concave-convex procedure (CCCP)-based method. Moreover, we derive the convergence condition of the proposed algorithm based on the properties of RGD and CCCP. Numerical results reveal that the proposed active RIS-aided array radar significantly outperforms the passive RIS-aided and RIS-free ones in terms of output SINR.</description></item><item><title>$M$-Ary Spread Multiple Access and Its Applications in Uplink Cellular Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10806728</link><description>More effective multiple access techniques are required to fulfill the pressing demand of supporting a large number of connected devices in future mobile communications. This paper proposes an $M$-ary spread multiple access (MSMA) scheme, designed to provide a high overload ratio for uplink cellular communications. The MSMA scheme distinguishes users by employing codes with superposition constellations. Specifically, it utilizes $M$-ary code mapping scheme to map each user's data stream onto several subcarriers, thereby achieving a frequency diversity gain. The receiver decodes incoming signals using $M$-ary code demapping based on generalized sphere decoding (GSD), which effectively balances diversity gain and multi-user interference, leading to enhanced performance. Both analytical and simulation results confirm that the MSMA system yields a lower bit error rate (BER) than power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) with the same overload ratio. In addition, MSMA surpasses sparse code multiple access (SCMA) in terms of both BER and overload ratio when the same number of subcarriers are reused. Therefore, with the same number of subcarriers and the same BER requirement, MSMA can support more users than SCMA and PD-NOMA.</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid Framework of RIS-Assisted Robust Secure Transmission Design for Multibeam Satellite Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10810484</link><description>In this paper, we investigate the hybrid secure transmission strategy for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multibeam satellite communications. In particular, two scenarios are considered based on actual transmission conditions and information theory. One is that when RIS has proper signal links with the satellite, it operates as the signal-enhancing RIS (SER). Otherwise, RIS operates as the signal-jamming RIS (SJR). In detail, two scenarios are presented as follows. I) For the SER scenario, a secure optimization problem is established by jointly designing the satellite and RIS beamforming under the constraints of total transmit power and quality of service. When the imperfect channel state information (CSI) of the RIS-eavesdropper (Eve) is obtained, a robust algorithm is proposed, and the $\mathcal {S}$-procedure-based successive convex approximation as well as the alternating optimization (AO) method are adopted. The case without Eve's CSI is also studied, and the maximum ratio transmission-based scheme is adopted. II) For the SJR scenario, different algorithms of zero-forcing (ZF) and ZF-based AO algorithms are given to obtain the artificial noise beamforming when considering the imperfect CSI of RIS-Eve and the CSI of no Eve, respectively, and both avoid the self-interference with legitimate user. Then, an AO-based algorithm for satellite beamforming design is presented. Numerical simulations are performed to evaluate the proposed approaches, which show superior performance.</description></item><item><title>TD3 Algorithm-Based SWIPT With UAV-RIS Assistance for MIMO Communication</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10812045</link><description>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) provide several perquisites in inaccessible regions, yet the limited battery life of the UAV is a concern that needs to be addressed.

Nonetheless, users' mobility and ever-changing channel conditions pose a challenge in achieving an optimal wireless system. To tackle these issues, this study employs a twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3)-based algorithm to enhance the proposed SWIPT model while ensuring the QoS. Simulation results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed robust TD3-based SWIPT model with UAV-RIS assistance implemented in MIMO communication. The proposed model has demonstrated superior performance in comparison to existing solutions. The results show that the model achieves a 70% energy efficiency and improves the system's capacity by up to 56.3%.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Layer Reinforcement Learning Assisted Task Offloading in Satellite Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10794743</link><description>Satellite networks can overcome the general geographical constraints, such as deserts and oceans, and offer the universal connectivity worldwide.

At last, we use the SatEdgeSim simulator to verify the feasibility of our proposed algorithm and simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the satellite energy consumption and communication latency, and improve the task success rate compared to the existing strategies.</description></item><item><title>Energy Efficiency Optimization in Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Aided UAV Wireless Power Transfer Networks Using DRL</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10806777</link><description>Lower production costs have inspired studies on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for wireless communication. However, limited transmission power and size of the UAV make it challenging to use advanced communication models while meeting the growing need for high data rates and energy efficiency (EE). In this paper, we study an energy-efficient UAV network enhanced by an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), where the IRS is employed to improve the EE of ground user equipment (GUE). The goal is to maximize the average EE by jointly controlling the UAV's flying route, IRS phase steer, UAV transmission power, and power splitting (PS) ratio of the energy transfer technology. The formulated problem of maximizing the average EE is non-convex and thus challenging to be solved. To address this problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach. The modified reward function is implemented to enhance the efficiency of the DRL agent, which is formulated based on the expected signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) map. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DRL algorithm achieves lower energy consumption, higher data rate, and improved EE compared to the comparison algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Reinforcement Learning Based Environment-Aware V2I Anti-Jamming Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10806863</link><description>The performance of reinforcement learning (RL)-based anti-jamming communication schemes in vehicular networks deteriorates in high-density traffic area with complex building layouts due to the spatio-temporally varying jamming signal strength and interference levels. In this paper, we propose an RL-based environment-aware vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication scheme to choose the transmit power and frequency channel, which exploits environmental features such as building layouts and traffic density in the state formulation to indicate the future channel gains, interference levels and jamming signal strength. This scheme enhances the utility as a weighted sum of signal-to-interference-plus-noise rate, communication energy consumption, frequency-hopping costs, and a penalty factor for dissatisfying quality-of-service requirements to avoid choosing risky V2I communication policies. The movement trajectories of vehicles, parameter of vehicular channel model and environmental features are used to formulate the simulated V2I communication experiences for updating Q-values in each time slot to accelerate learning speed. A deep version is further proposed to extract features of radio propagation in the area with variable traffic density and complex building layouts, as well as to address the quantization errors of the jamming signal strength, channel gain and interference levels in the RL state formulation, thereby improving communication reliability and energy efficiency. Experimental results based on three vehicles driving in campus area show the performance gains of transmission latency and communication energy consumption compared with the benchmark against a smart jammer.</description></item><item><title>UAV-Aided Short-Packet Covert Data Collection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10804101</link><description>This correspondence investigates an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted short-packet covert data collection, where one UAV collects private information from multiple ground Internet of Things (IoT) devices and a ground warden detects if IoT devices are transmitting.

However, unlike traditional offline designs, online UAV trajectory designs in target tracking scenarios are non-trivial in concurrently satisfying the total propulsion energy consumption constraint and the initial-final location constraint due to the undetermined information. To address this issue, we propose a novel online UAV trajectory optimization approach for the weighted sum-predicted posterior Cram&#233;r-Rao bound (PCRB) minimization, which guarantees the feasibility of satisfying the two mentioned constraints. Specifically, our proposed approach designs the UAV trajectory by solving two subproblems: the candidate trajectory optimization problem and the energy-aware backup trajectory optimization problem. Then, we propose an algorithm converging to the global optimal solution to the candidate trajectory optimization problem based on Dinkelbach's transform and the Lasserre hierarchy. The energy-aware backup trajectory optimization problem is efficiently solved by the successive convex approximation method. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and its significant superiority to the existing approach and benchmark regarding sensing performance and energy utilization flexibility.</description></item><item><title>Capacity Optimization for 6G Cell-Free MIMO Systems Over Spatially Correlated Rayleigh Fading Channels</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10804875</link><description>This paper studies capacity optimization of 6G cell-free multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems over spatially correlated Rayleigh fading channels.

However, the transmission signal shows different characteristics as relative distance varying and the close-range attributes of IRS render existing performance analyses inapplicable. In this paper, a general channel model with a tractable boundary is characterized and the near- and far-field of IRS are distinguished by applying different power scaling laws (e.g. additive and multiplicative path loss) for transmission signal in the channel as well as utilizing Rayleigh distance to demarcate the fields, based on which we analyzed the performance of IRS-assisted networks. Specifically, the impact of IRS element size is modeled into the near- and far-field effects, which directly alters the near-field boundary and influences the receiving signal power of user equipment (UE). In addition, the conditional signal power distribution is characterized as a piecewise function based on the division of Rayleigh distance and the interference Laplace function is rederived accordingly. The numerical results analyze the impact of near- and far-field effects, as well as different IRS parameters, on coverage probability, which demonstrates the significant variation of network performance compared to the far-field assumption when system parameter changes.</description></item><item><title>SER Analysis of Cell-Free Massive MIMO System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10807143</link><description>This paper studies an uplink cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with imperfect channel state information and maximum-ratio combining detectors over Rayleigh fading channel.

Next, based on these analyses, the novel analytical expressions for the SER of different modulations are derived, which is verified by numerical results. Then, in order to enhance the SER performance of all users in different geographical locations, a geometric programming based power control (GPPC) algorithm is proposed. Finally, numerical results show that compared with four benchmark schemes of the full power algorithm, the fractional power control algorithm, the traditional max-min fairness power control algorithm, and the genetic algorithm, the proposed GPPC algorithm can effectively minimize the maximum SER among all users through collaborative control of the power control coefficient while ensuring lower computational complexity.</description></item><item><title>Transmit Beamforming Design for ISAC With Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10803090</link><description>This paper proposes a transmit beamforming strategy for the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems enabled by the novel stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) architecture, different from conventional single-layer reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) by cascading multiple transmissive metasurface layers, where the base station (BS) simultaneously performs downlink communication and radar target detection via fully passive wave domain beamforming, result in the significant reduction in hardware cost and power consumption. To ensure superior dual-function performance simultaneously, we design the multi-layer cascading beamformer by maximizing the sum rate of the users while optimally shaping the normalized beam pattern for detection. A dual-normalized differential gradient descent ($\text{D}^{3}$) algorithm is further proposed to solve the resulting non-convex multi-objective problem (MOP), where gradient differences and dual normalization are employed to ensure a flexible trade-off between communication and sensing objectives at the gradient level, providing finer control over the optimization process.

In this paper, we propose a progressive freezing (PF) criterion for the BP decoder of polar codes to avoid redundant computational complexity. First, we have demonstrated that an upper bound exists for the absolute value of each soft messages based on the update rule of the BP decoder. Then, we propose the PF criterion, in which the computation in subsequent iterations can be avoided once the absolute value of soft message reaches its upper bound. Simulation results indicate that the PF criterion can circumvent 22.56% of redundant computations and achieve a performance gain of 0.1 dB in low signal-to-noise ratio regions, which facilitates the application of polar codes in 6G high-throughput scenarios.</description></item><item><title>OCD-FL: A Novel Communication-Efficient Peer Selection-Based Decentralized Federated Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10804095</link><description>The conjunction of edge intelligence and the ever-growing Internet-of-Things (IoT) network heralds a new era of collaborative machine learning, with federated learning (FL) emerging as the most prominent paradigm. With the growing interest in these learning schemes, researchers started addressing some of their most fundamental limitations. Indeed, conventional FL with a central aggregator presents a single point of failure and a network bottleneck. To bypass this issue, decentralized FL where nodes collaborate in a peer-to-peer network has been proposed. Despite the latter's efficiency, communication costs and data heterogeneity remain key challenges in decentralized FL. In this context, we propose a novel scheme, called opportunistic communication-efficient decentralized federated learning, a.k.a., OCD-FL, consisting of a systematic FL peer selection for collaboration, aiming to achieve maximum FL knowledge gain while reducing energy consumption. Experimental results demonstrate the capability of OCD-FL to achieve similar or better performances than the fully collaborative FL, while significantly reducing consumed energy by at least 5% and up to 80%.</description></item><item><title>Composition Index Modulation for Physical Layer Security in NOMA Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10839621</link><description>In this paper, we propose employing the index modulation to improve the overall system performance and physical layer security in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks with an near untrusted user. In the proposed scheme, by virtue of dynamically shifting the antenna activation patterns and energy allocation patterns, an untrusted user located near the base station (BS) can only successfully decode its own information generated by modulated symbols, while the information encoded by antenna and energy combination indices intended for other trusted users located far away from the BS cannot be decoded. Additionally, the secrecy rate is derived to evaluate the performance of the proposed NOMA networks. Simulation results validate the proposed scheme and provide insights into the design for far trusted users to prevent eavesdropping launched by near untrusted users in NOMA networks.</description></item><item><title>Guard Ring Designs on Photovoltaic Energy Harvesting Silicon LSIs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10953864</link><description>This study explores strategies for safeguarding complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) field-effect-transistors (FETs) and PN-diode against bulk carrier contamination for energy harvesting applications. Energy harvesting processes can generate excessive carriers within the bulk region, which can penetrate the PMOS region from the p(P-Sub)/n(NWell) junction or nmosfet without triple-well. To address this problem, this study investigated the effectiveness of a guard ring structure in protecting cmosfets and PN-diode by recombining carriers in their vicinities. The formation of unpassivated metals around cmosfets serves as a catalyst for carrier elimination before they penetrate the NWell region of a pmosfet or the nmosfet itself, thereby improving the off states of both FETs. For a PN diode, the smaller off-current and lower threshold voltage obtained are advantageous for low-power consumption. However, such guard ring also degrades the performance of a photovoltaic (PV) cell by recombining the carriers needed by the cell to generate power. The experimental study of PV cells w/back-surface-field (BSF) and w/o BSF revealed that the former reduced the $V_{\text{OC}}$ of the cell with and that caution is required when forming a guard ring nearby the PV cell.</description></item><item><title>Improved Lead Halide Perovskite Films and Devices Using Hot-Flow-Assisted Annealing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10930950</link><description>Physical and chemical controlling of the lead halide perovskite films is crucial to minimize defects and improve overall performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. In this study, applying a hot flow of dry air on the surface of perovskite films during hot plate annealing is investigated. We found that this technique leads to a smooth texture and reduces the surface defects. A hot dry airflow of 15 L/min improves the power conversion efficiency from 13.56% to 15.31%, with approximately 4.3% and 10.4% enhancement of fill factor and short-circuit current density, respectively. However, increasing the rate of dry airflow leads to large voids, which is a critical concern for leakage current and performance degradation.</description></item><item><title>Power Rating of a Novel Micro-CPV Module Concept and Operational Influences</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10938951</link><description>Micro-concentrating photovoltaic (micro-CPV) technology has the potential to contribute to the energy transition, facilitating the shift toward more sustainable and renewable energy sources by combining minimal carbon footprint and energy demand with low levelized cost of electricity. Micro-CPV modules utilize direct normal irradiance to convert sunlight into electrical power, necessitating precise solar tracking. The performance of these modules is influenced by their alignment toward the sun and prevailing outdoor conditions during outdoor operation. The spectral conditions, along with the ambient temperature, irradiance, and wind speed, influence the current&#8211;voltage characteristics of multijunction solar cells and the optical behavior of the lens. We have developed a novel micro-CPV module concept, which is based on low-cost and high-throughput manufacturing processes. In this work, we present a prototype module in a 10 &#215; 6 array configuration (205-cm2 aperture area, submodule class). We discuss outdoor measurements recorded over one year and the influences of various outdoor conditions. In an IEC62670-3 power rating, efficiencies of 36.0 &#177; 0.4% and 33.0 &#177; 0.4% at concentrator standard test conditions and concentrator standard operating conditions, respectively, are determined. Highest efficiencies, about 0.4% higher than at standard conditions, were attained at a more red-rich spectrum, namely at a spectral matching ratio SMR12 of 0.94 &#177; 0.03. Using measurements at different temperatures, we show that the planoconvex silicone-on-glass primary lens has a negligible temperature dependence. Changes in the module performance over the course of one year are discussed. Despite employing commercially available low-cost components and high-throughput processes, no significant degradation was observed during the first year of operation.</description></item><item><title>Parameter Translation for Photovoltaic Single-Diode Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10893713</link><description>In this article, we recommend methods to translate parameters between the PVsyst and California Energy Commission (CEC) single-diode models. Translation adds flexibility to photovoltaic performance modeling by enabling the use of the CEC database with the PVsyst model and PVsyst Panneau Solaire files in the CEC model. We compare three approaches for translation and evaluate agreement between models using 21 unique modules of monocrystalline and polycrystalline silicon technologies and six climate datasets. The recommended approach yields the lowest normalized root-mean-square error for all module technologies, never exceeding 0.58% of rated power. Annual energy yields agree within 1.09% for all modules when using the optimization method. The recommended method will be proposed for inclusion in pvlib-python.</description></item><item><title>Photovoltaic Module Spectral Mismatch Losses Due to Cell-Level EQE Variation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10925465</link><description>Understanding the impact of variation in the solar spectrum on photovoltaic (PV) device output is critical for accurate and reliable PV performance modeling. While previous studies have examined these spectral effects extensively at the module level, this study examines the spectral impact at the cell level and how subsequent current mismatch can influence module-level output. Cell-level external quantum efficiency (EQE) data from 11 new commercial PV modules are analyzed. The module power output, as determined by the spectral mismatch factor of the module-limiting cell, is computed using the measured cell EQE data in conjunction with gridded meteorological and spectral irradiance data simulated at an approximately 20 $\mathbf{\mathrm{km}}$ resolution across the contiguous USA over one year. This study finds only a small variation in annualized module output of around 0.2% as a result of intramodule EQE variation. However, these losses exhibit significant seasonality, varying by up to around four times the annualized energy difference on a month-to-month basis. The seasonality of the energy loss has implications for subannual PV performance analysis applications such as capacity testing.</description></item><item><title>Hail Damage Investigation in Heterojunction Silicon Photovoltaic Modules: A Real-World Case Study</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10896611</link><description>Most photovoltaic (PV) modules are guaranteed for 25&#8211;30 years. However, severe climatic events, particularly hail, can lead premature damage. In this article, a residential PV system in Padova, Italy, was studied after exposure to a severe storm with hailstones up to 16 cm in diameter, which is more than two times larger than the standard size of test stones employed for module validation (7.5 cm, as per IEC 61215-2-2021). The goals are: 1) to demonstrate the relevance of hail testing beyond what currently required by the standards; 2) to demonstrate the presence of latent damage even in the absence of broken glass or of reduced performance; and 3) to discuss the associated risks. Forward bias electroluminescence (EL) and infrared (IR) radiation investigations were conducted in dark to minimize the impact of environmental influences. In the worst case, complete glass breakage results in solar cell fragmentation, which induces nonuniformity in current flow and thermal radiation, increasing losses, compromising electrical insulation, and requiring immediate replacement. In addition, dark and outdoor light current&#8211;voltage characteristics reveal significant decrease in output power, as well as increased leakage current. Remarkably, latent or invisible damage, detectable by reduced EL intensity and higher IR radiation, poses safety issues even in modules whose protective glass withstood the mechanical impact of hail. Modules with intact glass exhibit a decreased shunt resistance, with a negligible reduction in the output power with respect to a completely intact module. The results underline the necessity of inspecting the entire PV system following hailstorms, to detect any latent damages and promptly replace the damaged modules, even in the absence of glass breakage or reduction in the output power, to ensure long-term reliability.</description></item><item><title>Experimental and Simulated Performance Evaluation of Bifacial Photovoltaic Floating System With a Horizontal Single-Axial Tracker</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10944767</link><description>The rapid expansion of photovoltaics is driven by significant reduction in costs. However, given the surface requirements for photovoltaic development, utilizing water surfaces for floating photovoltaic (FPV) systems presents a promising solution. To enhance the cost-effectiveness of these systems, bifacial modules and tracking systems can be employed. While numerous experimental studies have evaluated the performance of fixed-configuration FPVs, floating tracking configurations remain underexplored. In addition, various simulation tools offer insights into different configurations, but their different assumptions often yield inconsistent results. This study focuses on the experimental evaluation of a horizontal axis tracking bifacial FPV (HT-bFPV) system. Over one year, the HT-bFPV system was monitored at the FPV test bed of &#8220;Enel Innovation Hub &amp; Lab&#8221; in Catania, Italy. The experimental results were compared with simulated outcomes using two software tools, to assess their precision in calculating the HT-bFPV performances. The results reveal that the module temperature of the HT-bFPV system is 3 &#176;C to 6 &#176;C lower than the temperatures calculated by System Advisor Model and Photovoltaic system software, respectively. The yearly reference yield of 2139 kWh/kW produced a final yield of 1801 kWh/kW. The yearly performance ratio of the HT-bFPV system was 0.86, which improved by 1.8% when adjusted for temperature. The simulation results closely matched the experimental data, validating the system's performance. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the HT-bFPV system can produce up to 13.3% more energy with more potential in sites with higher latitudes compared with a similar fixed system.</description></item><item><title>A Noniterative Method of Estimating Parameter Values for the PVsyst Version 6 Single-Diode Model From IEC 61853-1 Matrix Measurements</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10955246</link><description>Photovoltaic performance modeling accuracy depends heavily on the quality of the input parameters. When relying on generic PAN files and datasheets, the input parameters often fail to accurately capture the behavior of every module with the same model number. Therefore, there is a need for methods to generate more accurate input data. In this study, we present a method for determining parameter values for the PVsyst version 6 photovoltaic module performance model from performance test measurements following the IEC 61853-1:2011 standard. The method is intentionally noniterative to facilitate implementation and reproducibility. We apply the method to datasets from 15 modules of various photovoltaic technologies (SHJ, TOPCon, IBC, PERC, n-PERT, Al-BSF, and CdTe), reproducing the original maximum power measurements with root-mean-squared (RMS) accuracy within 0.5% in all cases. The method's accuracy is compared to that of two iterative methods.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Hosting Capacity Evaluation Method for Distributed PV Connected in Power System Based on Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Harmonic</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10904237</link><description>Methods for fully characterizing the harmonic injection amount of distributed photovoltaic grid connection and combining harmonic constraints with other constraints to accurately evaluate the hosting capacity of photovoltaic integration into distribution networks are of great significance as they ensure the safe and stable operation of distribution networks. Therefore, a novel hosting capacity evaluation method for distributed photovoltaics (PVs) connected in a power system based on the maximum likelihood estimation of harmonics (MLE) is proposed in this study. First, using the likelihood function from the MLE method, the harmonic parameters of distributed photovoltaic injections are optimally estimated, allowing for the accurate assessment of harmonic outputs during photovoltaic grid connections. Furthermore, a harmonic partitioning method is devised; it characterizes the connection degree between nodes in the grid-connected system, and it divides the distribution network into regions. The scenario number in the estimation of hosting capacities is effectively reduced. Finally, a comparison is carried out relative to the conventional hosting capacity. The assessment method proposed in this study considers the harmonic access in the actual distributed PV grid-connected system. An improved harmonic partitioning method is established based on the harmonic injection amount. The evaluation of PV hosting capacities in the region ensures accuracy and reduces calculation times. They provide references for the access capacity of the distribution network.</description></item><item><title>Exploiting Chiplet Integration Technology for Fast High-Capacity DRAM Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10843128</link><description>As the end of Moore&#8217;s law approaches, chiplet integration technology (or chiplet technology) has emerged to revolutionize future semiconductor chip design. Chiplet technology provides unique advantages over 3-D-stacking technology, including a more cost-efficient and thermal-friendly integration of heterogeneous technologies. Although chiplet technologies have already begun to be used by the latest commercial chips, they have not been explored for commodity dynamic random access memory (DRAM) design yet. Harnessing its advantages for DRAM for the first time, this article evaluates the feasibility of chiplet-based DRAM architecture, considering various physical and electrical constraints imposed by a standard chiplet interface [i.e., universal chiplet interconnect express (UCIe)]. We further explore the DIMM architectures that simplify module packaging and assembly, leading to reductions in total die size and overall costs. The comprehensive cross-level analysis (i.e., device, circuit, chip, and system levels) shows that chiplet-based DRAM reduces t_RCD + t_CAS, latency-critical DRAM timing parameters, by  $1.32\times $ &#8211; $1.39\times $ , at the same energy consumption. In addition, a  $1.39\times $ &#8211; $2.28\times $  improvement in t_RRD is obtained. The reduced DRAM timing parameters improve the overall system performance by up to 8.8%&#8211;24.7% (geomean 3.4%&#8211;8.4%) in real-life benchmarks. The chiplet-based heterogeneous integration achieves a  $1.27\times $  higher chip-level yield compared with the monolithic chip, along with up to 10% reduction in overall cost compared with traditional DIMMs at emerging process technologies.</description></item><item><title>A Model Splitting Approach to Improve Reliability and Accuracy for Alternate Test of Analog/Mixed-Signal Circuits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10874156</link><description>Machine learning-based alternate test of analog/mixed-signal integrated circuits (ICs) has been widely studied in the last decade, which has the benefits of simplifying test equipment and decreasing test costs. However, due to low reliability and accuracy, it is hard to adopt the alternate test technique in the industry. In this article, a model splitting approach (MDSP approach) is proposed to improve the reliability and accuracy of the alternate test. The machine learning-based estimation model is &#8220;split&#8221; into two models with &#8220;complementary&#8221; performance (a &#8220;positive&#8221; model and a &#8220;negative&#8221; model). The &#8220;positive&#8221; model generates estimations that are no smaller than label values, while the &#8220;negative&#8221; model outputs estimations that are no larger than label values. Estimations with excessive differences between two models are identified as suspected estimations with large errors and filtered out. The rest results of &#8220;complementary&#8221; models are averaged to generate the final estimations. By comparing estimations of two models, the estimations with large error are filtered out effectively, and the estimation accuracy is improved significantly by fusing the results of two estimators. The MDSP approach is investigated with data from the commercial analog-to-digital converter and operational amplifier (OP). Results demonstrated that the proposed approach can improve test reliability and accuracy significantly.</description></item><item><title>A Two-Stage CMOS Amplifier With High Degree of Stability for All Capacitive Loads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10873294</link><description>This article presents the conception, design, and realization of a fully differential two-stage CMOS amplifier, that is, unconditionally stable for any value of the capacitive load. This is simply achieved by sending a scaled replica of the output stage current to the amplifier virtual ground in order to create a left half-plane (LHP) zero in the loop gain that either cancels or tracks the output pole in all process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) conditions. Consequently, from a stability point of view, the amplifier behavior resembles that of a single-pole OTA. Starting from an existing two-stage gain-programmable amplifier, designed in a 0.18- $\mu $  m bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD) process that was able to drive only 10 pF without encountering into stability issues, a simple circuit has been added to extend the stability to any capacitive load value. An interesting and unusual method, based on the frequency behavior of the unloaded closed-loop amplifier output impedance, has been introduced to further verify the unconditional stability of this solution. Measurements show a high degree of stability in any load conditions. In the used 0.18- $\mu $  m BCD technology, silicon area and current consumption of the extra circuit are only 0.0004 mm2 and  $2~\mu $  A, respectively, with a 5-V power supply.</description></item><item><title>A Picowatt CMOS Voltage Reference Using Independent TC and Output Level Calibrations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10777853</link><description>We propose a low-power voltage reference that enables independent adjustment of temperature sensitivity and output level.

This article presents a complementary voltage-to-time converter (VTC) with an optimized voltage scaling circuit to address these issues. The complementary VTC utilizes both input-voltage-sourced and input-voltage-referenced delay lines. Although each delay line has inherent nonlinearities, the opposite signs of their respective voltage-to-time gains effectively reduce the overall nonlinearity. To further enhance performance, an optimized voltage scaling circuit is incorporated, refining nonlinearity and expanding the input voltage range. Experimental results using UMC 0.18- $\mu $ m technology demonstrate that the proposed circuit achieves excellent linearity, an extended nearly rail-to-rail input voltage range, and robustness against process variations. The VTC achieves a voltage-to-time gain of 13.27 ps/mV, signal to noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) of 32.4 dB, and maintains stable dynamic performance across the working frequency band.</description></item><item><title>All-Rounder: A Flexible AI Accelerator With Diverse Data Format Support and Morphable Structure for Multi-DNN Processing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10908423</link><description>Recognizing the explosive increase in the use of artificial intelligence (AI)-based applications, several industrial companies developed custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) (e.g., Google TPU, IBM RaPiD, and Intel NNP-I/NNP-T) and constructed a hyperscale cloud infrastructure with them. These ASICs perform operations of the inference or training process of AI models which are requested by users. Since the AI models have different data formats and types of operations, the ASICs need to support diverse data formats and various operation shapes. However, the previous ASIC solutions do not or less fulfill these requirements. To overcome these limitations, we first present an area-efficient multiplier, named all-in-one multiplier, which supports multiple bit-widths for both integer (INT) and floating-point (FP) data types. Then, we build a multiply-and-accumulation (MAC) array equipped with these multipliers with multiformat support. In addition, the MAC array can be partitioned into multiple blocks that can be flexibly fused to support various deep neural network (DNN) operation types. We evaluate the practical effectiveness of the proposed MAC array by making an accelerator out of it, named All-rounder. According to our evaluation, the proposed all-in-one multiplier occupies  $1.49\times $  smaller area compared to the baselines with dedicated multipliers for each data format. Then, we compare the performance and energy efficiency of the proposed All-rounder with three different accelerators showing consistent speedup and higher efficiency across various AI benchmarks from vision to large language model (LLM)-based language tasks.</description></item><item><title>An Area-Efficient VLSI Architecture for High-Throughput Computation of the 2-D DWT</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10855161</link><description>In this article, an area-efficient VLSI architecture scheme for high-throughput computation of the 2-D discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is proposed, effectively applied in the context of aircraft cargo hold scenes. The proposed architecture aims to reduce computation and storage resources while maintaining the DWT-IDWT reconstructed image quality for the 9/7 discrete wavelet. The hardware implementation formulae based on the flipping architecture have been modified to reduce RAM storage bit width. By transforming the coefficients of the formula into hardware-friendly values, the required multiplication operations are split into two stages of addition. On this basis, a pipelined architecture is constructed to set the critical path delay (CPD) of the architecture to be close to the delay of a single adder,  $T_{a}$ , thereby achieving a high throughput. Compared to existing architectures in the research field, the proposed single-level 2-D DWT architecture achieves resource savings on the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platform while ensuring good image reconstruction quality. The advantages of the multilevel 2-D DWT are even more pronounced. In the simulation results on the application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) platform, the proposed architecture reduces computation time by at least 35.54% while achieving a higher level of decomposition, decreases the area-delay product (ADP) by at least 25.41%, and saves a significant amount of energy per image (EPI). Furthermore, the proposed folded architecture achieves close to 100% hardware utilization efficiency (HUE) in multilevel 2-D DWT computations.</description></item><item><title>A Laddered-Inverter Nonoverlapping Clock Generator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10879152</link><description>This article presents a new and novel nonoverlapping clock (NOC) generator based on a laddered inverter (LI) circuit. Unlike conventional approaches, the proposed NOC combines the clock generation and pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) circuit into one integrated architecture, offering lower power consumption, smaller area, and a more robust solution. Furthermore, the proposed NOC offers an inherent guarantee of the nonoverlap (dead time) between the output signals thanks to the guaranteed monotonicity of the LI circuit, thus offering a layout-agnostic design. The proposed NOC can also offer dead-time reconfigurability with the help of multiplexers, allowing both calibration and fine-tuning of the dead times to meet specific requirements. We provide a comprehensive assessment of the proposed NOC through simulation and measurement results in 65-nm CMOS. Measured results show that the proposed NOC consumes  $1~\mu $ W at 5 MHz with a 1-V supply, achieving more than  $10\times $  lower power consumption and 25% smaller area compared to the conventional NOC circuit. The proposed NOC demonstrates the capability to generate waveforms with frequencies up to 3.5 GHz at a 1.2-V supply, as validated through simulations.</description></item><item><title>SRAM BL Predriven Write Operation With Row and Voltage Auto-Tracking Replica BL in Resistance-Dominated Technology Nodes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891962</link><description>In this article, we analyze the effect of the bitline (BL) predriven write operation in alleviating static random access memory (SRAM) writability degradation caused by BL resistance ( $R_{\text {BL}}$ ). In BL predriven write operation, BL is fully driven to the ground voltage regardless of  $R_{\text {BL}}$  and the cell is written by a strong instantaneous peak write current ( $I_{\text {write,peak}}$ ) between the cell and BL. The writability yield of BL predriven write operation in the resistance-dominated technology nodes can, thus, be significantly improved. In addition, the row and voltage auto-tracking replica BL (RVAT-RepBL) is proposed to generate BL predriven time ( $T_{\text {pre}}$ ) for BL predriven write operation. In the proposed RVAT-RepBL,  $T_{\text {pre}}$  is generated by automatically tracking the variation in the number of rows per BL,  $R_{\text {BL}}$ , and the supply voltage ( $V_{\text {DD}}$ ). In order to verify the effect of BL predriven write operation, the test chip was fabricated on 28-nm CMOS technology, and the poly resistor arrays were inserted to the cell array to reflect the interconnect resistance in the advanced technology nodes. BL predriven write operation has a higher writability yield and a wider operating  $V_{\text {DD}}$  than the conventional write operation. In addition, when the word line (WL) repeater is applied, the results of BL predriven write operation show that the writability yield of BL predriven write operation is further improved as  $I_{\text {write,peak}}$  increases with the improvement of WL rising slope.</description></item><item><title>FPGA Implementation of Staged Projection Refining Multiple Orthogonal Matching Pursuit Algorithm for Compressed Sensing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856711</link><description>Reconstruction algorithms are an integral part of compressed sensing (CS) theory, which can reliably reconstruct the original signal from the low-dimensional compressed signal. The orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm has been widely studied and extensively selected in hardware implementations. However, the low reconstruction success rate of the OMP algorithm under high sparsity conditions has led to the proposal and application of more reconstruction algorithms in hardware implementations. In this article, a staged projection refining multiple OMP (SPR-MOMP) algorithm is proposed based on the OMP algorithm. This algorithm improves the reconstruction accuracy by refining the support set using a staged backtracking strategy. It also employs a multiple-atom selection strategy for parallel expansion of the support set, ensuring reconstruction efficiency. The reconstruction simulation demonstrates that the SPR-MOMP algorithm achieves a higher reconstruction success rate than the OMP algorithm, with fewer iterations. A hardware architecture applying the SPR-MOMP algorithm is designed and implemented on a Virtex UltraScale+ field-programmable gate array (FPGA) with  $N =1024$ ,  $M =256$ , and  $K =36$ . The proposed architecture achieves a reconstruction signal-to-noise ratio (RSNR) of 44.27 dB, with 20-bit data width and 15-bit fractional width. The maximum clock frequency of the architecture is 200 MHz, enabling reconstruction within  $276.6~\mu $ s.

However, many of these applications have limited power resources. Also, the existing FPGAs are vulnerable to side-channel attacks (SCAs) such as correlation-based power analysis (CPA) attacks. Therefore, designing low-power, CPA-resistant, and secure-by-design FPGA is required. In this article, two low-power and CPA-resistant hybrid CMOS/magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) logic-in-memory-based configurable logic blocks (CLBs) have been proposed and compared to a state-of-the-art counterpart. The first proposed design is single output, and the second one is multioutput. The simulation results show that compared to the state-of-the-art secure CLB counterpart [secured CLB (sCLB) by Zooker et al. (2020)], the proposed CLB designs have 42% and 33% lower delay, 85% and 18% lower power consumption, and 86% and 63% fewer equivalent transistors. To implement one round of the PRESENT algorithm, the first and second designs have 85% and 77% fewer transistors, 42% and 33% lower delay, and 86% and 50% lower power consumption compared to their silicon-proven secure counterpart. Also, to implement convolution layers of binarized neural network (BNN), compared to this counterpart, the first and second proposed designs have 85% and 90% fewer equivalent transistors, 42% and 33% lower delay, and 86% and 79% lower power consumption. Also, the resiliency of the proposed designs against power analysis attacks has been investigated by exhaustive simulations and performing CPA attacks on PRESENT and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) SBOX.

This latch comprises eight 1P2N modules interlocked, with its output isolated by two levels of C-elements (CEs), achieving tolerance to TNU. The performance of the redundant-node reinforcement TNU tolerant latch (RNRTTL) was simulated and verified using CMOS 65 nm technology. The simulation results indicate that the RNRTTL circuit has a D-Q delay of 14.14 ps, static power consumption of  $4.03~\mu $ w, an area of  $32.87~\mu $ m2, and an area-static power-D&#8211;Q delay-product (APDP) of 1873, respectively. Compared to the triple-node upset tolerant latches TTLL, TNU-latch, TNURL, and HLTNURL reported in the current literature, the proposed latch demonstrates an average reduction of 219.9%, 164.9%, 150.7%, and 2464.8% in D-Q delay, static power consumption, area, and APDP, respectively, indicating that the RNRTTL latch has superior comprehensive performance; furthermore, a series of 2000 Monte Carlo (MC) simulations on the node group  $\langle $ Q, X0, X $8\rangle $  reveal that the proposed latch circuit possesses good stability, making it suitable for harsh radiation environments.</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid RO-TDL-Based On-Chip Voltage Monitor for FPGA Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10792939</link><description>In recent years, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have become critical computing resources, featuring higher levels of system integration and accelerated clocking speeds.

However, prior works of timing error prediction circuits have complicated the clock tree or introduced a substantial number of delay cells along data paths, resulting in a considerable increase in area overhead. This work introduces asynchronous timing error prediction circuit (ATEP), an ATEP that integrates timing error prediction technology with bundle-data asynchronous templates. The proposed circuit leverages delay lines in the request wire to generate the warning detection window (WDW) independent of clock signals, thereby reducing area overhead and streamlining the clock tree. In addition, we present an adaptive voltage and frequency scaling (AVFS) controller, which evaluates the likelihood of warnings or the quantity of warning paths based on path activation rates to determine when to cease adjustments. This strategy helps to identify the frequency closer to the point of first failure (PoFF). Furthermore, we propose a dynamic warning detector gating strategy to gate warning detectors based on the current environment, further decreasing power consumption. Implementing this circuit on an RISC-V processor, targeting 28-nm CMOS technology, yields up to a 56.8% performance improvement with only a 3.79% area cost and up to a 28.0% reduction in power consumption.</description></item><item><title>A Flying-Capacitor-Assisted Single-Mode Buck-Boost Converter for Battery-Powered Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10925486</link><description>A single-mode buck-boost converter that generates a 3.3-V power supply from a variable input voltage ( ${V} _{\mathbf {IN}}$ ) range of 2.7&#8211;4.2 V for mobile li-ion battery applications is presented. The proposed buck-boost converter employs a switched-capacitor-based buck-converter operation, in which the voltage switching operation is followed by an LC filter. This ensures continuous output current delivery and reduces conduction loss in the inductor. An efficient power-stage structure and its operation are introduced, wherein only one resistive component is connected in series with the inductor during all operation phases. The proposed buck-boost converter has been implemented in a 180-nm BCDMOS process and regulates an output voltage of 3.3 V from a  ${V} _{\mathbf {IN}}$  range of 2.7&#8211;4.2 V by single-mode step-up/down operation.

An adaptive-compensation buffer (ACB) dynamically regulates the operation of the pass transistors. Specifically, when the load current falls below 5 mA, only the smaller pass transistor is activated; otherwise, both pass transistors are engaged, thereby simultaneously mitigating the minimum load current requirement for FVF architecture and extending the load current ranging from 0 to 30 mA while maintaining stability without an external load capacitor. At 1.15-V supply voltage and 0-mA load current, the quiescent current is  $6~\mu $ A. The output voltage is 1.0 V with a dropout voltage of 0.15 V. Measurements show that with a load current stepping from 0 to 30 mA at an edge time of 100 ns, the output voltage undershoot is 0.2 V with a recovery time of 200 ns while achieving a load regulation of 0.23 mV/V. Our OCL-LDO is fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS with an active area of 0.031 mm2.</description></item><item><title>A 7.4&#8211;9.2-GHz Fractional-N Differential Sampling PLL Based on Phase-Domain and Voltage-Domain Hybrid Calibration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10765801</link><description>This brief proposes a 7.4&#8211;9.2-GHz low-noise fractional-N differential sampling phase-locked loop (DSPLL), which features doubled phase detector (PD) gain.

By adopting the NP-type cells, we can avoid the degradation of the generated output dc voltage due to parasitic long interconnection wire capacitance, deep N-well to P-substrate junction capacitance, and additional body effect. For comparison, we have implemented two RF-dc rectifiers in a 28-nm 1P11M CMOS process.

To address this, efficient ViTs have emerged, typically featuring convolution-transformer hybrid architectures to enhance both accuracy and hardware efficiency. While prior work has explored quantization for efficient ViTs to marry the hardware efficiency of efficient hybrid ViT architectures and quantization, it focuses on uniform quantization and overlooks the potential advantages of mixed quantization. Meanwhile, although several works have studied mixed quantization for standard ViTs, they are not directly applicable to hybrid ViTs due to their distinct algorithmic and hardware characteristics. To bridge this gap, we present M2-ViT to accelerate convolution-transformer hybrid efficient ViTs with two-level mixed quantization (M2Q). Specifically, we introduce a hardware-friendly M2Q strategy, characterized by both mixed quantization precision and mixed quantization schemes [uniform and power-of-two (PoT)], to exploit the architectural properties of efficient ViTs. We further build a dedicated accelerator with heterogeneous computing engines to transform algorithmic benefits into real hardware improvements. The experimental results validate our effectiveness, showcasing an average of 80% energy-delay product (EDP) saving with comparable quantization accuracy compared to the prior work.

To meet the requirements for low output power in the medical band as well as to reduce power consumption, a single-ended class-E power amplifier (PA) with a duty-cycle-controlled strategy is proposed. A fully integrated on-chip matching network is designed to satisfy the impedance matching criteria for the class-E PA. The issues of the 2nd-order and the 3rd-order harmonic suppression are resolved by a series resonator and a capacitor in parallel with a segmented transformer, respectively. In the RX, the on-chip transformer also serves as an input impedance matching network for the low-noise transconductance amplifier (LNTA), reducing the required transconductance through passive reverse voltage gain. The transformer is capable of suppressing noise. The structure of the matching network only requires one transformer and one inductor, thereby reducing the count of passive components. Additionally, it features an embedded transmitter/receiver (T/R) switch function without insertion loss. The proposed 8-port transformer makes the layout more flexible and compact. The TX consumes 2.27 mW at &#8722;10-dBm output power and 5.45 mW at 0 dBm. A 2nd-order harmonic distortion of &#8722;52.36 dBm and a 3rd-order harmonic distortion of &#8722;50.67 dBm are measured, respectively. The RX consumes 2.25 mW and achieves a sensitivity of &#8722;93 dBm.

By performing capacitive voltage sensing and inductive current sensing at the primary coil, the compact power detector eliminates the need for additional area-consuming passive components while still allowing the PA to maintain a single-ended antenna output. The control of magnetic coupling with the secondary coil is achieved by exploiting magnetic flux cancellation rather than increasing the physical distance between coils. The active mixer multiplying the voltage and current uses current bleeding technique that simultaneously suppresses the flicker noise and enhances linearity, leading to a state-of-art dynamic range. Without phase shifters or resistor termination, the overall power detector achieves intrinsic phase compensation by matching the delays between the voltage and current sensing paths.

A novel four-way Wilkinson combiner balun (WCB), realized by two coupled line impedance inverting baluns (ZIBs) and isolation (ISO) resistors ( $R_{\text {ISO}}$ s), is proposed. The design procedure of the proposed four-way WCB, specifically focused on reducing electrical length ( ${\theta }~{\lt }~45{^{\circ }}$ ) and extending bandwidth (BW) of coupled line ZIBs, is revealed in detail and their associated design parameters are subsequently obtained using the so-called graphical extraction method.

Series-stacking and floating gate techniques are adopted to increase the mixer switch linearity in the off and on states. Furthermore, impedance step-down matching networks (MNs) are used to reduce the voltage swing around the switch, which enhances the mixer linearity and reduces the required number of series-stacked devices within the switch. Power-efficient stacked drivers with inter-stack LO coupling are used to drive the switching units. This modified design allows the driver to generate rail-to-rail swing at higher frequencies while maintaining high efficiency and low power consumption at low frequencies.

To reject spillover from both TX-RX coupling and undesired reflections from radar assembly (such as bumper reflection), a spillover replication method based on frequency-delay translation through a single-sideband (SSB) modulator is introduced. To keep the RX performance immune from strong spillover, we propose an in-low-noise amplifier (LNA) common-mode voltage-domain canceller. It provides high isolation between the RX signal chain and cancellation path, minimizing noise figure (NF) degradation. Spillover is rejected in the input voltage domain before entering the critical LNA stage and inducing current, thereby preserving the linearity. Prototyped in 65-nm CMOS, the RX exhibits 5.7&#8211;7.2-dB NF and &#8722;11.4-dBm IP1 dB across 69&#8211;76.5-GHz range.

To overcome the structural limitations of conventional sub-terahertz (sub-THz) frequency synthesizers and concurrently achieve a low jitter and a large FTR, we designed a two-stage architecture, in which a 50-GHz band subsampling PLL (SSPLL) with a 3rd-harmonic (HM)-rich class-F voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) in the first stage interoperated with an HM-boosting frequency multiplier (FM) in the second stage. Designed with a 40-nm CMOS process, this D-band frequency synthesizer exhibited a wide FTR of 11.8%, i.e., 144&#8211;162 GHz. Due to its high-gain subsampling phase detector (PD), which can suppress in-band phase noise (PN), and its class-F VCO, which can achieve low out-of-band (OOB) PN, the proposed frequency synthesizer achieved the lowest rms jitter (i.e., 39 fsrms). Since the combination of the 3rd-HM-rich class-F VCO and the HM-boosting FM generated a D-band output signal in a power-efficient manner, this work also achieved the best jitter figure-of-merit (FOM) among the state-of-the-art W/D-band frequency synthesizers with an FTR more than 5%.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Core Series-Resonance CMOS Oscillator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10851422</link><description>Multi-core and series-resonance (SR) techniques have been proposed to achieve ultra-low phase noise (PN) performance.

Vector-interpolation phase shifters demonstrate wide bandwidth, low loss, and compact footprint, but may suffer from poor linearity, restrained by the need of high dynamic range variable gain amplifiers (VGAs). This article investigates the role of VGA impairments in a vector-interpolation phase shifter, with primary focus on the AM&#8211;AM and AM&#8211;PM distortions. Then, three common VGA structures are analyzed and compared, revealing a best candidate to optimize linearity. A single-ended input/output phase shifter is finally implemented in 55nm SiGe BiCMOS technology. The test chip allows experimental validation of the theoretical results by using the VGAs in different operating modes. It is also shown that, in a single-ended phase shifter, the common-mode current generated by the VGAs may compromise gain and linearity. Solutions to the problem are introduced in the design, including a novel current-mode balun that provides large (4:1) impedance transformation and high common-mode rejection with equal primary and secondary inductors. Experimental results prove wideband operation, from 130 to 175 GHz, with 3.5 dB gain. The phase shift is programmable in 10&#176; steps with rms phase and amplitude errors across frequency &lt; 5&#176; and &lt;0.8 dB, respectively. With the optimal VGA operation mode, the output power at 1 dB gain compression (OP1dB) is above 1.8 dBm with &lt;10&#176; AM&#8211;PM distortion. Experiments compare favorably against previous works in the same band and in similar technologies.</description></item><item><title>A Dual-Alternating-Slope Digital-to-Time Converter Leveraging Mismatch to Improve Delay Step Size</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10705095</link><description>This article introduces a dual-alternating-slope digital-to-time converter (DASDTC) topology that reduces the dependency of DTC delay on component values and power supply. A power-and area-efficient resolution extension method is proposed that benefits from mismatch upon applying a measurement-based code-mapping. Fabricated in GlobalFoundries 22-nm fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) process, the DTC obtains a fine-delay resolution of 0.3 ps in a 180-ps delay window. Combined with a counter-based coarse-delay steps, a wide delay range of 4 ns at an output frequency of 83.3 MHz is obtained. The measured integral non-linearity (INL) of the DTC is below 0.26 ps across four samples. The DTC showcases immunity to supply noise and a figure of merit (FoM) of 3.3 fJ/conversion which is competitive with the current state-of-the-art DTCs.</description></item><item><title>A 2 MHz Bandwidth TMR-Based Contactless Current Sensor With Ping-Pong Auto-Zeroing and SAR-Assisted Offset Calibration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10706592</link><description>This article presents a tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR)-based magnetic sensor for contactless current sensing. The TMR readout circuit utilizes a current-balancing instrumentation amplifier (CBIA) with ping-pong auto-zeroing (PPAZ), achieving an integrated magnetic noise of 206 nTrms in a wide bandwidth of 2 MHz. Compared with chopping amplifiers, an auto-zeroed CBIA provides a ripple-free output, not only extending the available bandwidth but also ensuring a system linearity of 0.24%. In the gain configuration of 42 dB, the input magnetic field range is &#177;0.08 mT, corresponding to a dynamic range (DR) of 58 dB. The maximum offset of the TMR sensor is reduced to 311 nT (ten samples) through an SAR-assisted offset calibration scheme. Moreover, after compensating the temperature coefficient (TC) of the TMR bias generator, the sensitivity drift of the TMR sensor is reduced by  $18{\times }$ . Overall, the proposed TMR sensor readout, including the sensor bias circuit, achieves a state-of-the-art power efficiency in terms of figure-of-merit (FoM) of 2.5 fW/Hz or 146 dB.

With seven power switches and two flying capacitors, the proposed 3FLBB converter produces the voltage of switching node between  $V_{\mathrm {IN}}$ /2,  $V_{\mathrm {IN}}$ , and  $3{V_{\mathrm {IN}}}$ /2, which supports buck, boost, and buck-boost modes, and with smooth mode changes. Here, one of the two flying capacitors is used to drive the inductor (L), while another one is used to ensure that  $V_{\mathrm {DS}}$  of each power switch is within 1/ $2{V_{\mathrm {IN}}}$  in all phases. Hence, the voltage stress of all the power switches is reduced to half- $V_{\mathrm {IN}}$ , and the normalized equivalent resistance and switching losses are greatly reduced by using two 1.8-V switches instead of two 5-V switches. Since the three modes all have buck-like operation, the average inductor current is reduced to always equal to the output current. Meanwhile, they all have continuous output current, similar complex pole pairs, and no right half-plane (RHP) zero, which enables fast load transient response. This design is implemented by only 1.8-V devices of a standard 0.18- $\mu $ m CMOS process, covering an input voltage range from 2.8 to 4.2 V. A 98.2% peak efficiency is measured at 2-MHz switching frequency with 2.2- $\mu $ H L, two 10- $\mu $ F flying capacitors, and one 10- $\mu $ F output capacitor. It can deliver an output current of 50&#8211;1000 mA at a 3.3-V regulated output voltage. Moreover, the measured results show that this design achieves a significant improvement on undershoot and overshoot voltage than the previous works.</description></item><item><title>A High-Efficiency 12/1-V Dual-Path Series-Capacitor Converter With Low V&#8901;A Metric and Full Duty Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10701036</link><description>This article presents a dual-path series-capacitor (DPSC) converter with a voltage range of  $9~{\sim }~16$ -V input to 1-V output.

The proposed DPSC converter enables inherent full duty cycle operation and reduced inductor current. The prototype converter demonstrates a measured peak efficiency of 94.5% with a maximum load capacity of 5 A. Besides, the proposed converter can be easily compatible with existing light-load schemes, which shows 89.2% at 0.1-A load for this design. The DPSC converter maintains high efficiency throughout the voltage conversion ratios (VCRs) and load ranges, outperforming prior state-of-the-art solutions.</description></item><item><title>A Single Li-Ion Battery Powered Buck Converter With &gt;90% Efficiency Over 10-&#956;A to 500-mA Loading Range by Utilizing Compensator-Based Built-In Mode Tracking Technology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10680426</link><description>An ultralow quiescent current dual-mode dc &#8211; dc buck converter is presented in this article to achieve high efficiency over a wide load range for Internet of Thing (IoT) applications. In medium and heavy load conditions, the valley-current mode (VCM) with adaptive on-time (AOT) is employed to guarantee loop stability and seamless transition between pulsewidth modulation (PWM) and pulse-frequency modulation (PFM). A hiccup mode (HM) is proposed to minimize the power consumption of control circuits in light load conditions. Based on the compensator in the VCM, a built-in mode tracking technology is proposed to achieve the predictable and seamless mode transition without load current sensing circuits.

The proposed driver and readout SoC operate as an RF signal generator and a spectrum analyzer, respectively, enabling the analysis of resonant frequency shifts corresponding to MP concentration. The driver SoC uses closed-loop power amplifier (PA) envelope regulation (CPA-ER) to maintain consistent output power against frequency shifts. The driver SoC exhibits an output power up to 0.23 dBm at 1.14 GHz and achieves a small output power variation of less than 4.9% between 1.1 and 1.15 GHz.

A super-pixel structure is proposed with diagonally arranged  $2 \times 2$  MONO and NIR sub-pixels. To enhance visible light sensitivity, large and small non-uniform micro-lenses are formed on the MONO and NIR sub-pixels, respectively. Each floating diffusion (FD) shared super-pixel is connected to an in-pixel analog-to-digital converter and two banks of 10-bit static random access memories (SRAMs) to enable the dual-channel GS operation. To achieve high dynamic range (DR) in the MONO channel, a triple-quantization (3Q) operation is performed. Furthermore, a single-channel digital-correlated double sampling (D-CDS) 3Q operation is implemented. The fabricated sensor achieved 6.2-mW low power consumption at 30 frames/s with dual-channel capture. The MONO channel achieved 124-dB DR in the 3Q operation and 60 dB for the NIR channel.

Traditional von Neumann computing architectures often incur high energy costs and prolonged computational latencies when tackling COPs. Recently, researchers have used continuous-time (CT) Ising machines as low-cost COP solvers due to their attractive solving speed. However, prior CT works suffer from inadequate coefficient precision, the lack of annealing mechanisms, and susceptibility to variations. In light of this, this work presents an in-eDRAM mixed-signal CT Ising machine featuring eDRAM-based compute-in-memory (CIM) architecture. It introduces a current-based multi-level interaction topology for updating spins and presents a CT annealing mechanism to access the ground energy landscape. To enhance its process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) robustness, the two-step current-programming technique is used to eliminate mismatches caused by PVT variations. The prototype chip with a  $32\times 33$  spin array is fabricated using a 65-nm CMOS process. Each spin occupies an area of 848  $\mu $ m2, including 20 3T1C current-programmed eDRAMs and eight 1T1C eDRAMs. Measurement results demonstrate that the proposed CT Ising machine has excellent PVT robustness, the lowest normalized spin area ( $13.6~\mu $ m2), and the highest coefficient level of 15.

To improve the energy efficiency of GPS signal acquisition, we present charge-domain computing for GPS signal acquisition (CCSA), a matched filter with CCSA. It employs a  $64 {\times } 64$  mixed-signal processing element (PE) array, a 2.8-b flash analog-to-digital converter (ADC), and a digital controller. Each PE handles the element-wise multiplication with a mixed-signal multiplier (MSMUL), which can perform the multiplication and digital-to-charge conversion simultaneously with a two-phase operation scheme. We develop the two-phase digital-to-charge mapping method for the MSMUL, where the digital multiplication result is converted into the charge difference stored in a capacitor between the charge reset phase and the charge evaluation phase. The charge-domain outputs of all MSMULs are dumped and redistributed on a global output wire for the accumulation operation. Compared to prior charge-domain works, the proposed design reduces the number of capacitors or additional voltage levels by half, thereby leading to better energy efficiency and lower circuit complexity. The 28-nm test chip achieves 114&#8211;394-TOPS/W energy efficiency across 0.34&#8211;0.9-V supply voltage, which is  $8.2{\times }$  higher than state-of-the-art at the same throughput.</description></item><item><title>A 44.3-mW 62.4-fps Hyperspectral Image Processor for Spectral Unmixing in MAV Remote Sensing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10682804</link><description>This article presents the first dedicated processor designed to support the complete spectral unmixing workflow for hyperspectral image (HSI) processing, including rank reduction, endmember extraction, and abundance estimation.

Transformers, in particular, demand higher precision compared to CNNs. Existing analog compute-in-memory (ACIM) solutions primarily cater to CNNs and struggle to achieve the high precision necessary for Transformers, despite their promise in addressing the memory bottleneck. To bridge this gap, we propose a capacitor-reconfigured CIM (CR-CIM) macro that introduces dual-mode operation, dynamically switching between high-precision and high-efficiency modes based on the active DNN layer. In the CNN mode, the CR-CIM employs bit-parallel computation and an 8-bit ADC to maximize power efficiency, exploiting the inherent error tolerance of CNNs. In contrast, for the Transformer mode, the CR-CIM switches to bit-serial computation and a 10-bit ADC to boost the compute signal-to-noise ratio (CSNR), ensuring the higher precision required by Transformers. This dual-mode functionality of the proposed CR-CIM is enabled by three key technologies: 1) a novel CR-CIM architecture and cell structure; 2) a resource-efficient multi-bit driver for bit-parallel computation; and 3) a software-analog co-design (SAC) strategy for enhanced Transformer computation. Our CR-CIM prototype is the first ACIM design to enable optimized operation for both Transformers and CNNs. CR-CIM achieves 45-dB signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR) and 31-dB CSNR (8-bit input and 8-bit weight bit-serial MAC) in the Transformer mode and a peak-power efficiency of 4094 TOPS/W (normalized to 1-bit  ${\times } 1$ -bit MAC) in the CNN mode.</description></item><item><title>A Fully Row/Column-Parallel MRAM in-Memory Computing Macro With Memory-Resistance Boosting and Weighted Multi-Column ADC Readout</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10801203</link><description>This work demonstrates a 256(row) ${\times } 512$ (col.) fully row/column-parallel in-memory computing (IMC) macro employing foundry MRAM in 22-nm FD-SOI CMOS.

Recently, biomedical applications of probabilistic computing such as Bayesian networks for disease diagnosis, DNA sequencing, etc. have attracted significant attention owing to their high energy-efficiency. Bayesian inference is widely used for decision making based on independent (often conflicting) sources of information/evidence. A cascaded chain or tree structure of asynchronous circuit elements known as Muller C-elements can effectively implement Bayesian inference. Such circuits utilize stochastic bit streams to encode input probabilities which enhances their robustness and fault-tolerance. However, the CMOS implementations of Muller C-element are bulky and energy hungry which restricts their widespread application in resource constrained IoT and mobile devices such as UAVs, robots, space rovers, etc. In this work, for the first time, we propose a compact and energy-efficient implementation of Muller C-element utilizing a single Ferroelectric FET and use it for cancer diagnosis task by performing Bayesian inference with high accuracy on Wisconsin data set. The proposed implementation exploits the unique drain-erase, program inhibit and drain-erase inhibit characteristics of FeFETs to yield the output as the polarization-state of the ferroelectric layer. Our extensive investigation utilizing an in-house developed experimentally calibrated compact model of FeFET reveals that the proposed C-element consumes (worst-case) energy of 4.1 fJ and an area  $0.07~\mu m^{2}$  and outperforms the prior implementations in terms of energy-efficiency and footprint while exhibiting a comparable delay. We also propose a novel read circuitry for realising a Bayesian inference engine by cascading a network of proposed FeFET-based C-elements for practical applications. Furthermore, for the first time, we analyze the impact of cross-correlation between the stochastic input bit streams on the accuracy of the C-element based Bayesian inference implementation.</description></item><item><title>A &#8220;2 + 1&#8221; Cores Triple-Mode Oscillator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10718325</link><description>This paper proposes a millimeter-wave (mmW) oscillator with &#8220; $2+1$ &#8221; cores and triple operation modes to realize an octave-tuning range. An auxiliary core, comprising a switch and a negative transconductance cell, is introduced to the regular dual-core oscillator to generate a third mode with enhanced effective Q. This auxiliary core not only broadens the tuning range without compromising phase noise or chip area but also avoids the risk of introducing mismatch into two regular cores like triple-core oscillators. The demand for low interconnect resistance is relieved because of the merits of less core mismatch and extra magnetic injection lock path. The behavior of the proposed oscillator in different modes is studied analytically.

To simplify the driving stages of power amplifiers and enable large-scale integration in millimeter-wave systems, a proposed gain-boosted technique is introduced. This technique enhances the conversion gain of the mixer without increasing power consumption or footprint, achieved through the synergistic combination of negative resistance compensation (NRC) and current-reuse techniques. Furthermore, a wideband balance compensation technique is utilized at the local oscillator (LO) input, and an active balun is implemented at the intermediate frequency (IF) input, replacing the conventional large-area passive balun. These innovations lead to a more compact high-gain mixer design while achieving high-speed performance. For validation, the proposed up-conversion mixer is fabricated in a 40-nm CMOS. It boasts a total area of 0.15 mm2 ( $0.033~\lambda ^{2}$ ), with a core area of 0.024 mm2 ( $0.0052~\lambda ^{2}$ ). It achieves a measured conversion gain of 4.1 dB at 136 GHz. The measured saturation power is &#8722;5 dBm, with a data transmission rate of 42 Gbps, while consuming a power consumption of 10.8 mW only. To the best of our knowledge, this design achieves the highest conversion gain among D-band up-conversion mixers in CMOS technology and represents the smallest footprint among up-conversion mixers integrated with balun in D-band.</description></item><item><title>A 50 Gb/s PAM-4 Transceiver With High-Swing Driver, Dual-Loop Analog Equalizer, and Integrator-Based Baud-Rate Linear CDR for Short-Reach Links</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10718355</link><description>This paper presents a 50 Gb/s four-level pulse amplitude modulation 4 (PAM-4) wireline transceiver that incorporates a high-swing PAM-4 driver in the transmitter (TX) and an integrator-based baud-rate linear clock and data recovery (IB-CDR) in the receiver (RX). The PAM-4 driver in the TX employs two types of non-return to zero (NRZ)-current mode logic (CML) drivers. The proposed architecture overcomes the inherent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) limitations of PAM-4 by generating signal amplitudes greater than the supply voltage (VDD). The RX features an IB-CDR that can determine the phase difference between the PAM-4 signal and the sampling clock using the sign and magnitude of the integrators. Consequently, because the IB-CDR can reduce the requirement for additional threshold voltages and samplers for CDR operation, the RX can achieve a competitive Figure-of-Merit with reduced hardware overhead. Moreover, a dual-loop analog equalizer (DAEQ) is introduced to mitigate inter-symbol interference between the TX and RX. In the DAEQ, one loop increases the peak gain, while another loop controls the system bandwidth. The proposed TX and RX were fabricated using a 28 nm CMOS technology and has a maximum data rate of 50 Gb/s. The prototype with a total area of 0.18 mm2 enables a bit error rate of  $10^{-11}$  at 15.3 dB attenuation and has a power efficiency of 3.28 pJ/bit.</description></item><item><title>VLSI Architecture Design for Compact Shortcut Denoising Autoencoder Neural Network of ECG Signal</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10857698</link><description>The Electrocardiogram (ECG) test detects and records cardiac-related electrical activity of the heart. The ECG test identifies and documents cardiac-related electrical activity in the heart. The use of ECG signals for cardiovascular disease nursing as a crucial component of preoperative evaluation is increasing. ECG signals need to denoise and display in a clear waveform due to the numerous noises. We have introduced Compact Shortcut Denoising Auto-encoder (CS-DAE) neural network, which reduces the noise from ECG signals. The Compact Shortcut approach compresses the features passed through the shortcut layers, which lowers the operation&#8217;s memory needs and improves the noise reduction impact. In addition, the encoder and decoder process the Pixel-Unshuffled and Pixel-Shuffled, which effectively mitigates the feature loss caused by down-sampling and up-sampling operations. As a result, the CS-DAE algorithm decreases the computation and required memory size while maintaining higher accuracy. We have used MITDB and NSTDB datasets for training and testing the proposed CS-DAE model, resulting in the average Percentage of Root Mean Square Difference (PRD) being 46.30% and the improvement of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNRimp) being 10.50. In addition, we have designed VLSI architect ure for the proposed CS-DAE neural network to accelerate low hardware cost and less computation. The TUL PYNQTM-Z2 development platform runs the Verilog code, which is used for VLSI architecture and has the lowest power consumption of 1.65W.</description></item><item><title>Eyelet: A Cross-Mesh NoC-Based Fine-Grained Sparse CNN Accelerator for Spatio-Temporal Parallel Computing Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10736682</link><description>Fine-grained sparse convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve a better trade-off between model accuracy and size than coarse-grained sparse CNNs. Due to irregular data structures and unbalanced computation loads, fine-grained sparse CNNs struggle to fully leverage the performance advantages of computation and storage on general-purpose edge hardware. However, existing custom sparse accelerators are designed from the perspective of emulating a balanced load by software or computational strategies, neglecting the exploration of the computing architecture&#8217;s adaptability and parallelism for fine-grained sparse models. To address these challenges, a cross-mesh NoC-based accelerator architecture is proposed. This architecture aligns with the irregular characteristics of fine-grained sparse CNN weights and enhances the spatio-temporal parallelism of fine-grained sparse CNNs. First, a sparse multiplier unit (SMU) array and an adder array are designed to enable parallel execution of convolution multiplication and accumulation operations. Then, element-wise unroll-based nonzero weight multiplication is mapped to the SMU array to provide more flexible spatial parallelism. A horizontal and vertical cross-mesh NoC is proposed for flexible dataflow scheduling between the SMU and adder arrays to further improve temporal parallelism. This architecture allows the multiplication and accumulation operations in convolution to be decoupled and pipelined with negligible latency. Finally, the proposed accelerator architecture is implemented on the ZU9EG platform. The experimental results show that the proposed accelerator achieves frame rates of 509.9, 249.3, 100.7, 48.4, and 168.9 frames per second (FPS) for AlexNet, VGG-16, ResNet-18, MobileNet-v2, and EfficientNet, respectively. Compared with related works, this accelerator achieves inference speed and energy efficiency improvements of  $1.1\times \sim 36.1\times $  and  $2.4\times \sim 13.4\times $ , respectively.</description></item><item><title>Spiketrum: An FPGA-Based Implementation of a Neuromorphic Cochlea</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854692</link><description>This paper presents a novel FPGA-based neuromorphic cochlea, leveraging the general-purpose spike-coding algorithm, Spiketrum. The focus of this study is on the development and characterization of this cochlea model, which excels in transforming audio vibrations into biologically realistic auditory spike trains. These spike trains are designed to withstand neural fluctuations and spike losses while accurately encapsulating the spatial and precise temporal characteristics of audio, along with the intensity of incoming vibrations. Noteworthy features include the ability to generate real-time spike trains with minimal information loss and the capacity to reconstruct original signals. This fine-tuning capability allows users to optimize spike rates, achieving an optimal balance between output quality and power consumption. Furthermore, the integration of a feedback system into Spiketrum enables selective amplification of specific features while attenuating others, facilitating adaptive power consumption based on application requirements. The hardware implementation supports both spike-based and non-spike-based processors, making it versatile for various computing systems. The cochlea&#8217;s ability to encode diverse sensory information, extending beyond sound waveforms, positions it as a promising sensory input for current and future spike-based intelligent computing systems, offering compact and real-time spike train generation.</description></item><item><title>GSLP-CIM: A 28-nm Globally Systolic and Locally Parallel CNN/Transformer Accelerator With Scalable and Reconfigurable eDRAM Compute-in-Memory Macro for Flexible Dataflow</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10758245</link><description>This article reports a globally systolic and locally parallel (GSLP) convolutional NN (CNN) and Transformer accelerator based on the scalable and reconfigurable (SR) embedded dynamic random-access memory (eDRAM) compute-in-memory (CIM) macro. It features: 1) a GSLP architecture employs systolic CIM macros with the reconfigurable inter-CIM network to support flexible dataflow, including weight stationary (WS), output stationary (OS), and Row stationary (RS); 2) an SR-CIM macro features reconfigurable weight/input/output memory ratio to maximize the related data reuse in different dataflow; 3) a high-density 3T eDRAM-CIM cell to further improve the density of the accelerator; 4) an area-efficient in-memory accumulator (IMA) to save the area and power overhead of the digital accumulation in each CIM macro.

However, there are two main challenges in this development model: 1) The end-to-end iteration cycle and cost of processor chip development are too high, and cannot flexibly respond to changes in chip fragmented design specifications. 2) Processor chip verification is less agile, and there is a lack of a full-chain processor agile design platform that can be easily ported to different development environments. To tackle both issues, we propose an object-oriented hardware agile design methodology, oriented by time, cost, and complexity, and have built the RIVL platform to support the agile development process for processors. RIVL integrates a highly automated design flow for processor RTL design, Integration, Verification, and Layout design to improve processor development efficiency. We achieved tape-out verification of more than 60 RISC-V processors through agile design methods, demonstrating the use and effectiveness of RIVL. We quantify the performance of CoreGen using CoreMark and demonstrate that CoreGen achieves industry-competitive performance.</description></item><item><title>FALSAx: An Integrated Framework for Accuracy and Logic Synthesis Estimation of Approximate Adders</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10807460</link><description>This work proposes an integrated framework for accuracy and logic synthesis (LS) estimation of approximate adders (FALSAx). It represents a versatile and robust framework designed to estimate the accuracy, power, and area of various approximate adders (AxAs) for any input width (W) and K bits of approximation using machine learning (ML) models. FALSAx facilitates performance predictions and optimization for different AxAs configurations through meticulously curated datasets and ML-driven analysis. The framework&#8217;s capability to automatically generate Pareto fronts from estimated values aids in identifying optimal trade-offs among crucial metrics, providing essential insights for circuit design and optimization. The FALSAx includes four internal frameworks: FrAQ, PILSE, and FELSE, which estimates dynamic power, total leakage power, and area, with frequency variations automatically, and the FALED dataset of the FALSAx. As a case study, this work analyzed 16 types of AxAs on FALSAx: AMA-V, AxPPA, COPY, TRUNC, ETA, LOA, HOERAA, LDCA, LZTA, HEAA, M-HEAA, HERLOA, M-HERLOA, HOAANED, OLOCA, and SETA. The rigorous analysis provided by FALSAx revealed that HERLOA, M-HERLOA, M-HEAA, and AxPPA demonstrated superior accuracy metrics such as SSIM, NCC, MAE, and MRE. Furthermore, power analysis showed that AxPPA exhibited the best power efficiency for lower approximation bits ( $K \leq 3$ ). At the same time, gate-free adders like COPY, TRUNC, AMA-V, LDCA, and LZTA were more power-efficient for higher approximation bits ( $K \gt 3$ ). Area estimations indicated that AxPPA maintained competitive efficiency for lower approximation bits ( $K \leq 5$ ), while TRUNC and LDCA were more efficient for higher bits ( $K \gt 5$ ).</description></item><item><title>Correct and Verify&#8212;CAV: Exploiting Binary Decision Diagrams to Enable Formal Verification of Approximate Adders With Correct Carry Bits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10790927</link><description>Approximate adders have received significant attention as they give benefits in power, performance, and area for error-resilient applications. Due to their ubiquitous use, formal verification of approximate adders has also gained traction. However, prior works on formal verification of approximate adders are limited to relaxed equivalence checking, i.e., checking whether the approximate adder designs have an error less than a specified threshold. This method has limitations, as multiple approximate adder designs can satisfy the relaxed equivalence checking criterion, which can cause more than expected deterioration in the output quality. The deterioration in output quality is larger in approximate adder designs that produce exact results for some regions of the input space but have the freedom to produce approximate results in other regions of the input space. In this paper, we propose a methodology called Correct and Verify (CAV), which exploits Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) to guarantee that the approximate adder with correct carry bits exactly matches its functional specification. Our idea takes advantage of the BDD structure in extracting the internal signals, particularly the carry signal from the golden reference exact adder. Afterward, a corrector circuit is generated from the functional specification and the extracted carry signal is used as input in the corrector circuit. The corrector circuit is used to generate the corrected adder from the approximate adder. The generated corrected adder can be compared against a formally verified golden reference exact adder. We show the efficacy of CAV over approximate Ripple Carry Adders (RCA) as well as approximate Parallel Prefix Adders (PPA). Lastly, we perform a qualitative analysis by introducing mutations in the designs to show the fault detection quality of the CAV methodology.</description></item><item><title>Universal Finite-Time Observer-Based ITSMC for Converter-Driven Motor Systems With Disturbances</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10683760</link><description>Considering the speed regulation problem of converter-driven motor systems (CDMS), a composite finite-time anti-disturbance control scheme is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the controller design process is mainly divided into two blocks according to block backstepping control techniques. Then, by constructing universal finite-time observers (UFTO), immeasurable system dynamics and multiple disturbances are estimated, simultaneously. Based on the estimated information, the integral terminal sliding mode control (ITSMC) strategies devised for the CDMS exhibit robust disturbance rejection capabilities. Compared with existing methods, the proposed composite control scheme is distinguished by its reliance solely on measured output, enhanced dynamic response speed, superior disturbance rejection capability, and a more streamlined controller design. Furthermore, a rigorous global finite-time stability analysis is presented for the closed-loop system. Finally, numerous experimental results are given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.</description></item><item><title>Finite-Time Sliding Mode Control for NPC Converters With Enhanced Disturbance Compensation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10736007</link><description>In this paper, a generalized proportional integral observer (GPIO)-based finite-time sliding mode control scheme is proposed to enhance the convergence rate and disturbance rejection capacity of the grid-connected three-level neutral-point-clamped (NPC) converter. Firstly, a generalized super-twisting algorithm (GSTA) is designed in the voltage regulation loop and the instantaneous power loop of the NPC converter. Compared with the conventional super-twisting algorithm (STA), this method provides a faster convergence speed while the system trajectories are far from the origin, which is applied to the NPC converter to improve its dynamic performance and robustness. Additionally, by introducing a generalized proportional integral observer (GPIO) combined with the GSTA in the voltage regulation loop, the unknown time-varying disturbances can be rejected effectively. The stability of the proposed control scheme is proved. Finally, a set of comparative experiments between the proposed controller and the classic STA-based method have been carried out based on a three-level NPC converter prototype, and the results confirmed the efficacy of the proposed control strategy.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive 56-Gb/s Duo-PAM4 Detector Using Reduced Branch Maximum Likelihood Sequence Detection in a 28-nm CMOS Wireline Receiver</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10683722</link><description>This paper describes an adaptive duo-binary four-level pulse amplitude modulation (Duo-PAM4) detector that significantly reduces the bit error rate (BER) of the conventional wireline transceivers under high insertion loss (IL) channels. The parallel maximum likelihood sequence detection (MLSD) combined with parallel feed-forward equalization (FFE) is proposed to generate, equalize, and detect Duo-PAM4 signals, thus reducing BER compared to conventional decision feedback equalizer (DFE) and slicers. The proposed reduced branch MLSD reduces power consumption compared to MLSD. An improved delay zero-forcing algorithm for Duo-PAM4 is proposed to achieve fast convergence of the FFE tap coefficients, reducing convergence time by up to 72.5% compared to conventional ZF algorithms for Duo-PAM4. Both the proposed and conventional detectors are implemented in a 28-nm CMOS process at 56 Gb/s and 38-dB insertion loss. The FFE+MLSD and FFE+RB-MLSD reduce the BER by two orders of magnitude compared to conventional FFE+DFE+slicer. The RB-MLSD reduces power consumption by 21.1% compared to conventional MLSD. The detector can be easily migrated to 112Gb/s or 224Gb/s transceivers.</description></item><item><title>A &#8722;79 dBm 7.56 nW 433 MHz Wake-Up Receiver With Interference Suppression for IoT Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10807458</link><description>In this paper, we present an ultra-low power wake-up receiver (WuRX) with effective interference suppression capability. A specific robust design has been implemented to address the common interference issues in the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency band. A mathematical expression is derived in this paper for the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) required by the comparator at which a envelope detector first (ED-first) WuRX can detect the wake-up message in the presence of interference. Aiming to meet the minimum SNR requirements, a quasi-direct coupling (QDC) baseband buffer scheme is proposed. Compared to the output SNR of traditional AC schemes, the QDC baseband buffer scheme achieves a 4.16 dB increase in output SNR under optimal conditions. To solve the problem where traditional comparator calibration schemes require recovery time after sudden disappearance of interference, the multipath signal detection (MPSD) scheme proposed in this paper can immediately detect information following the disappearance of interference, which improves detection efficiency. The WuRX is manufactured in 65nm LP process, consuming 7.56nW at a 0.4V power supply, with a sensitivity of &#8722;79dBm in the 433MHz ISM band. Under continuous wave (CW) interference, the receiver achieves a signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of &#8722;31dB at a frequency offset of 1MHz.</description></item><item><title>Power Losses Optimization of MMCs Based on Quantum Genetic Algorithm for HVdc Transmission Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10750512</link><description>Modular multilevel converters (MMCs) obtain widespread utilization in high-voltage direct current (HVdc) applications scenarios. The cost of power losses plays a significant part in MMC&#8217;s operating costs. Hence, this article proposes a quantum genetic algorithm-based power losses optimization control (QGA-PLOC). By comprehensively considering the power losses of the MMC, the quantum genetic algorithm determines the first-best value of the injected second circulating current magnitude and phase angle in the arm, as well as the optimal MMC power losses under given conditions.

However, in the presence of significant disturbance, the system would face the risk of transient instability like conventional power grid. As a recently developed control method, phase sequence exchange (PSE) can not only stabilize the system but also avoid additional reduction in system capacity and inertia. Nonetheless, PSE increases redundant power electronic devices into the grid. Therefore, this paper establishes a transient model for VSG-controlled isolated power grid initially. Based on this, a control method is proposed to realize the effect of PSE by reducing the power angle of VSG through power electronic control in the inverter, named as virtual phase sequence exchange (VPSE). This control method effectively avoids the need for external PSE devices while improving the transient stability. Furthermore, this paper investigates the VPSE technology through the extended equal area criterion (EEAC) and modern control theory, with results indicating that compared to PSE, VPSE has better transient control effects. Finally, the proposed scheme is verified by physical experiments on the real-time digital simulation platform (RTDS).</description></item><item><title>Small Signal Modeling of a Four-Level Flying Capacitor Multilevel Totem-Pole PFC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10790883</link><description>In this paper, the small signal model for a four-level flying capacitor multilevel (FCML) totem-pole PFC converter is presented. In contrast to conventional PFC converters, the state space equations for the FCML PFC converter in a complete switching cycle change over the line cycle. If the standard state space averaging technique is applied, it will only evaluate a single combination of state space equations corresponding to only one segment of the line cycle. Since the four-level FCML PFC converter consists of three different segments in one half-line cycle, this technique is not applicable to derive a comprehensive small signal model of the converter that is required for regulation and transient stability. Moreover, the effects of flying capacitors on the FCML PFC dynamics are nulled out using the average model due to their natural balancing capability. In this work, the Fourier analysis of time-interval modulated switched network is used to determine the closed form small-signal control to output frequency response and verify its accuracy with the experimental results. The dynamic characteristic of the FCML converter is also evaluated for the variations in the converter passive elements. Finally, a hardware prototype is designed, fabricated, and tested for ac input 120 Vac, 400-V dc output, and 1-kW power rating demonstrating peak efficiency of 98.48%, power factor 0.995 and THD of 4.26% to observe the system behavior under load step changes.</description></item><item><title>A Privacy-Preserving Federated Reinforcement Learning Method for Multiple Virtual Power Plants Scheduling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10736008</link><description>The application of federated learning in Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) addresses the data silo issue between VPPs and enhances their ability to cope with nonlinear and stochastic scheduling characteristics, which enables VPPs better accommodate distributed energy resources and flexible loads while participating in frequency regulation services. However, although existing federated learning methods strive to solve privacy protection issues, the plaintext transmission of gradients still exposes sensitive data to the threat of curious power control centers and external inference attacks. Therefore, a privacy-protected horizontal federated reinforcement learning approach for multi-VPP optimal scheduling is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a cost-based global optimization scheduling model for multiple VPPs is constructed, modeling the internal scheduling process of VPPs as a Markov decision process. Then, an improved secure horizontal federated multi-VPP collaborative training method is presented, and local models are trained using the Deep Transformer Q-Network algorithm, with local differential privacy and CKKS homomorphic encryption implemented to ensure privacy protection. Finally, a case study is conducted using frequency regulation ancillary service market data and the IEEE-39 bus system structure. Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms similar algorithms, achieving high levels of privacy protection and economic operation for VPPs.</description></item><item><title>Structure-Reconfigurable Wide Gain Series Resonant Converter for On-Board Charger</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10931150</link><description>In this article, a structure-reconfigurable series resonant DC-DC converter is proposed for a wide gain on-board charger application. The proposed converter consists of a dual-bridge structure on the primary side which can realize 0.5 to 1 voltage gain by using a reconfigurable half/full bridge structure, and a hybrid rectifier on the secondary side which can realize 1 to infinite voltage gain by replacing two diodes with active switches. Moreover, the proposed converter employs a control scheme based on fixed frequency PWM, with the operating frequency being identical to the series resonant frequency. Accordingly, magnetizing inductance of the transformer is independent of the converter gain characteristics, which simplifies the consideration of the resonance parameters design. In addition, soft switching can be realized during the entire charging process, and high efficiency can be achieved. To avoid the voltage spike and current impact in the transition between two operation modes, a unified switching modulation strategy is applied to achieve a smooth transition and improve the control stability. Finally, a 2.5 kW prototype with an output voltage range of 200V - 500 V is established and tested to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed converter.</description></item><item><title>Modeling, Analysis, and Design of Phase Synchronization Loop for BIPT System Considering Operating Point Parameters Variation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10705342</link><description>In bidirectional inductive power transfer (BIPT) systems, phase synchronization loop that keeps the secondary-side excitation voltage synchronized with the current is essential for stable power transmission. However, the characteristic of control object in the synchronization loop can vary due to the variation of the operating point parameters (OPPs), which can lead to loop instability. In this article, the transfer functions of the control object and the phase detector in the phase synchronization loop are derived. The influence of the variation of OPPs on the transfer function of the control object is analyzed. The transfer function is mainly affected by one zero that is sensitive to the OPPs and can shift into low-frequency region, while the other poles and zeros are at high frequencies and have less influence. The phase synchronization controller is designed considering the variation of OPPs to ensure the stability of the system in a wide range of OPPs. The sensitivity of the loop to the OPPs is analyzed. Frequency response results from simulation and experiment have verified the correctness of the model, and the stability of the loop. Steady-state and transient experiments prove the stable steady-state performance and fast transient response of the system.</description></item><item><title>An All-Digital Spread-Spectrum Clock Generator With Feedforward Gain Calibration for LPWAN Chirp Transmission System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10877936</link><description>In this brief, an all-digital spread-spectrum clock generator (AD-SSCG) is presented for low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) chirp spread spectrum application.

The reconfigurable capacitor digital-to-analog converter (CDAC) is designed to support 8/10/12-bit resolution modes. In order to mitigate the nonlinearity introduced by capacitor mismatch and suppress the transition glitch during the most significant bit trial in 10/12-bit modes, the Fast-Window-Switching (FWS) technique is proposed.

The introduction of an adjustable capacitor bank helps in regulating the parasitic capacitance generated by different operating modes in the HSTF. The 35&#8211;41 GHz TRX front-end is implemented in a 65 nm CMOS (1P9M) process. In the TX mode, the high saturated output power (Psat), 1-dB output compression point (OP1dB) and peak power added efficiency (PAE) are measured as 18.6 dBm, 17.7 dBm, and 25.8% at 38 GHz, respectively. The measured PAE at 6-dB and 9-dB power back-off (PBO) efficiency are 18.3% and 13.7%, resulting in efficiency enhancement ratios of 1.46 and 1.51 when compared with an ideal class-B PA. In the RX mode, the minimum noise figure (NF) is 4.8 dB at 38 GHz. The overall chip size of the TRX, including the three-stage PA/LNA and I/O pads, is approximately  $1.34\times 0.98$  mm2.</description></item><item><title>Single-Ended Back-Bias Voltage Generator Using One Pumping Capacitor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10887252</link><description>As the dynamic random-access memory technology advances, the size of storage capacitors has diminished. This trend has been accompanied by the challenge of reading cell data reliably from the storage capacitor. One of the most common approaches to solving this problem is preserving stored data by suppressing the sub-threshold leakage current in the access transistors with a negative body bias with a back-bias voltage (VBB) generator. This brief introduces a single-ended VBB generator using only one pumping capacitor. Conventional VBB generators with single-ended structures have a threshold voltage loss and unwanted charge-sharing at internal nodes and load outputs, causing performance degradation. The proposed circuit addresses these issues by employing a grounded gate inverter and an n-channel metal-oxide semiconductor transistor as a discharge transistor. This novel configuration can generate a negative voltage up to the supply voltage level with only one pumping capacitor with merits of power and size. Using the DBHitek  $0.18~\mu $ m process technology, the proposed circuit has the lowest power consumption, power-delay product, and better pumping efficiency compared to the conventional single-ended VBB generator circuits.</description></item><item><title>Cryogenic CMOS Active Mixer Employing Transformer-Based Current-Bleeding Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891724</link><description>This brief presents a cryogenic complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) active mixer designed to achieve low-noise and low-power characteristics at cryogenic temperatures.

However, these systems are highly sensitive to variations in the oxygen-excess ratio (OER), which directly impacts their efficiency and lifespan. Controlling the OER presents significant challenges due to the system&#8217;s inherent nonlinearities, model uncertainties, and susceptibility to external disturbances. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive dynamic surface control with a disturbance observer (ADSCDOB) method to mitigate adverse effects and enhance control accuracy. The disturbance observer is designed using a nonlinear approach to effectively estimate uncertainties and external disturbances. The ADSCDOB method integrates adaptive dynamic surface control technology, enabling robust control while overcoming the &#8220;explosion of complexity&#8221; problem typical of traditional backstepping methods. The stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously established through theoretical analysis. Simulations validate the effectiveness of the ADSCDOB method, demonstrating its rapid response, minimal error, and robust stability across various operating conditions.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Closed-Loop Reference Adaptive Learning Control for Parallel Mutual Inductance Circuits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10879297</link><description>Parallel mutual inductance circuits (PMICs) are fundamental components of levitation control systems in maglev transportation, which are controlled to regulate levitation gaps. Conventional levitation controllers are typically designed individually for these circuits, with the collaboration performance being overlooked, consequently leading to levitation failures. This brief proposes a distributed closed-loop reference iterative learning control for the collaboration issue of PMICs by leveraging the operation repetitiveness of maglev trains. Particularly, a novel closed-loop reference model is proposed to rectify the original trajectory by receiving feedback from these circuits, thereby promoting the transient response and accelerating the convergence speed. A new composite energy function (CEF) is established to facilitate convergence analysis, and the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is validated through simulation results.</description></item><item><title>Asynchronous Reduced-Order Filtering for Markov Jump Systems and its Application in PWM Circuits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10899864</link><description>This brief addresses the problem of asynchronous reduced-order filtering for Markov jump systems. The communication between the reduced-order filters and the systems is transmitted through the network. On the one hand, quantization is considered to save network resources; on the other hand, due to the measurement may not be perfect, the system information is a hidden component (i.e., it possesses inaccessibility), therefore reduced-order filters are designed by using the hidden Markov model. Then, the random stability of the plant is guaranteed by a set of conditions derived according to Lyapunov theory. Subsequently, the gains of the designed filters are obtained through decoupling. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach in this brief is confirmed by utilizing a pulse-width-modulation-driven boost converter.</description></item><item><title>Low-Cost Yet Effective Trojan Mitigation Techniques for Approximate Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10859259</link><description>Approximate Computing (AC) is a promising computing paradigm that provides efficiency and speed while maintaining acceptable accuracy in error-tolerant applications. However, most of the existing AC designs are prone to Hardware Trojan (HT) attacks. Moreover, the existing HT mitigation techniques have been designed for exact systems and due to the architectural differences in the approximate systems, these conventional mitigation techniques have limited efficacy when used in the context of AC. Therefore, this brief presents two novel methods, named Partial Comparison (PC) and Hybrid Comparison (HC), that effectively mitigate HTs in approximate systems while achieving a 30% and 55% improvement in the area and the power efficiency, compared to the existing state-of-the-art technique. PC focuses on LSBs while HC considers both LSBs and MSBs for HT masking. The effectiveness of proposed techniques is validated through a practical case study of image processing; three IPs with different HTs are successfully masked with a PSNR and SSIM of 33dB and 0.92 respectively. In conclusion, this research provides practical solution to enhance security and reliability of approximate systems with optimal performance benefits.</description></item><item><title>BeaCIM: A Digital Compute-in-Memory DNN Processor With Bi-Directional Exponent Alignment for FP8 Training</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10879560</link><description>Previous digital Compute-In-Memory (DCIM) exhibits limitations in Deep Neural Network (DNN) training with FP8, which is playing an increasingly important role in model training. Most of the previous DCIM purely align exponents to the maximum one when computing floating-point data. This method struggles to balance accuracy and energy efficiency when using FP8. In this brief, we propose BeaCIM, a DCIM processor with bi-directional exponent alignment. There are several contributions. First, we propose a new exponent alignment mechanism, which can dynamically adjust the shared exponent  $(E^{*})$  towards the numerical distribution center of exponents. Second, we use the Shift-on-Product (SOP) method to address the limitation of data bitwidth, and present  $E^{*}$  calculator based on the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). Finally, we performed RTL-level circuit implementation and evaluated BeaCIM using various datasets and models. Our experiments show the following results: (1) Compared with the standard hybrid FP8 training, our bi-directional exponent alignment FP8 training exhibits an average top-1 accuracy drop less than 0.75% across different models and datasets. (2) BeaCIM can achieve an energy efficiency of 31.5 TFLOPS/W at FP8, which is 2.6- $19.3\times $  better than state-of-the-art works.</description></item><item><title>A 1.46-pJ/bit, 149-KF&#178; RO TRNG Based on Reference-RO-Free Thresholding of Jitter Accumulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10892238</link><description>In this brief, a ring-oscillator-based true random number generator (RO-TRNG) is presented with an energy-efficient on-chip module for temporal thresholding of the accumulated jitter noise. The need of power-hungry reference ring oscillator (RO) for frequency collapse detection in previous implementation can be completely removed. In addition, by setting the RO-TRNG&#8217;s enable signal adaptively according to the output of the proposed jitter accumulation thresholding (JAT) module, the redundant oscillations in most cycles of the prior art can be fully eliminated, leading to significant energy saving per each TRNG bit. Based on a 65-nm 1.2 V standard CMOS process, the fabricated TRNG chips feature an ultra-compact silicon area of 149 K $F^{2}$ . Meanwhile, a high energy efficiency of 1.46 pJ/bit is achieved for the prototype chips operated under a supply voltage of 1.0 V and an overall throughput of 44.7 Mbps. High randomness of the fabricated TRNG chips is well validated by using both National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and autocorrelation function (ACF) test tools. Moreover, high Shannon entropy values over 0.999998 are observed for the TRNG chips operated under an industrial temperature range of &#8722;40&#176;C~125&#176;C and a supply voltage range of 1.0 V~1.4 V, showing excellent tolerance to the process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variations.</description></item><item><title>PIMSR: An Energy-Efficient Processing-in-Memory Accelerator for 60 FPS 4K Super-Resolution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10902411</link><description>Due to the huge computational load, CNN-based super-resolution solutions are hard to be deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. In this brief, we proposed a Processing-in-Memory based SR accelerator (PIMSR) that leverages direct simple memory access operations to supersede intensive multiply-add in convolution operators, thus fundamentally improving the energy efficiency. To address the storage explosion problem, we presented an index reparameterized strategy for shrinking the memory requirement of LUT-based PIMSR framework by  $19.58\times $ . Furthermore, an address remapping design is putted forward to solve the access conflict in overlap configuration, which greatly boosts the efficiency of memory access. The prototype validation on low-end XC7A200T FPGA indicates that our design yields a new record of energy efficiency up to 671.61 Mpixels/J, over  $5.36\times $  higher than existing deep learning based image processors, with extremely low hardware costs.</description></item><item><title>A Power Self-Sufficient Managed Energy Harvester With Dual-Source Synergistic Cold-Start Capability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10874147</link><description>This brief presents a power self-sufficient managed dual-source energy harvester that prioritizes the harvested energy for self-consumption and then transfers the surplus energy to the load or storage, thereby avoiding paying more than harvesting when the environmental energy is weak. The bipolar stacking structure employed enables the simultaneous harvesting of both energy sources through time-division multiplexing in DCM or synchronized extraction in CCM. Additionally, this structure allows the dual sources to share a single cold starter, while also facilitating low-voltage startup. The proposed harvester, fabricated using a  $0.18~\mu $ m CMOS process, achieves end-to-end peak efficiencies of 84.3% and 82.5% for photovoltaic and thermoelectric energy harvesting, respectively, while achieving a dual-source synergistic cold-start voltage as low as 80 mV.</description></item><item><title>AccALS 2.0: Accelerating Approximate Logic Synthesis by Simultaneous Selection of Multiple Local Approximate Changes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10767734</link><description>Approximate computing emerges as an energy-efficient computing paradigm designed for applications that can tolerate errors. Many iterative methods for approximate logic synthesis (ALS) have been developed to automatically synthesize approximate circuits. Nonetheless, most of them overlook the potential of applying multiple local approximate changes (LACs) simultaneously in one iteration, which can significantly reduce the overall computation time. In this article, we propose AccALS 2.0, a novel framework for further accelerating iterative ALS flows, which is based on simultaneous selection of multiple LACs in a single round. However, there are two challenges for selecting multiple LACs. The first is that the mutual influence of multiple LACs can affect the estimation of the circuit error. The second is that there may exist conflicts among multiple LACs. To address these issues, first, we propose an efficient measure for the mutual influence between two LACs. With its help, we transform the problems of solving the LAC conflicts and selecting multiple LACs into a unified maximum independent set problem for solving. The experimental results showed that AccALS 2.0 outperforms state-of-the-art ALS methods in runtime, while achieving similar or better-circuit quality.</description></item><item><title>ESM: A Plug-in Power Side Channel Shuffling Protection for Scalar Processors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10742104</link><description>Hiding is a protection method against power side channel attacks on processor chips. Compared to masking, hiding has less area and time overhead. Existing hiding schemes usually have to identify the instructions which need protection to change their execution moments. This makes these efforts problematic in that 1) these hiding schemes need extension of the ISA and modification of the compiler, 2) large changes to the original microarchitecture, and 3) protection targets limited to cryptographic algorithms and the corresponding arithmetic instructions. In this work, we design a plug-in shuffling protection called external shuffling module (ESM), between the front-end and the back-end of the processor based on the instructions which can change the order of execution in program segments. By constructing an instruction dependency table, the order in which instructions are executed each time is changed within the processor, thus avoiding modifications to the compiler. ESM receives all signals from the front-end and forwards them to the back-end through internal processing, without the need for any other components in the microarchitecture. This allows ESM to be started and stopped at any time and applied to different microarchitectures. ESM applies protection to all instructions flowing through it. On the SAKURA-GIII board, we implement ESM on a RISC-V processor. When the processor is able to counter an multilayered perceptron-based power attack of 1 million training traces, ESM requires an additional 1.23% area overhead as well as 12.12% time overhead.</description></item><item><title>CodePM: Parity-Based Crash Consistency for Log-Free Persistent Transactional Memory</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745609</link><description>Emerging persistent memory (PM) can provide large persistent capacity with performance comparable to DRAM in modern memory systems. Persistent transactional memory (PTM) needs to ensure data consistency after unexpected power loss or crashes. Therefore, crash consistency strategies, such as persistent logging, are still required. However, the additional overhead introduced by these strategies, such as significant extra writes on PM, can lead to system performance degradation. In this article, we propose CodePM, a fault-tolerant PM transactional library that utilizes parity-based crash consistency to remove logging overhead while guaranteeing the correct state of data. CodePM reuses the decoding capability of parity to detect and recover inconsistent objects. To ensure consistency without logs when updating, CodePM employs fine-grained memory fences to carefully align potential inconsistency with the repairability of parity. To detect inconsistency without logs when recovering, CodePM utilizes optimistic speculative scanning recovery by reusing checksum and parity, which supports instant recovery with transient degraded reliability. Moreover, we study the memory fence blocking effects and further augment CodePM with pipelined encoding and persistent writing to hide update latency. We implemented CodePM on Pangolin, the state-of-the-art parity-based PTM for fault-tolerance. Evaluation results with real-world workloads on Intel Optane DCPMM show that CodePM can achieve up to  $3.4\times $  higher throughput than Pangolin.</description></item><item><title>PIMCOMP: An End-to-End DNN Compiler for Processing-In-Memory Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10750525</link><description>In the past decade, various processing-in-memory (PIM) accelerators based on various devices, micro-architectures, and interfaces have been proposed to accelerate deep neural networks (DNNs). How to deploy DNNs onto PIM-based accelerators is the key to explore PIM&#8217;s high performance and energy efficiency. The scale of DNN models, the diversity of PIM accelerators, and the complexity of deployment are far beyond the human deployment capability. Hence, an automatic deployment methodology is indispensable. In this work, we propose PIMCOMP, an end-to-end DNN compiler tailored for PIM accelerators, achieving efficient deployment of DNN models on PIM hardware. PIMCOMP can adapt to various PIM architectures by using an abstract configurable PIM accelerator template with a set of pseudo instructions, which is a high-level abstraction of the hardware&#8217;s fundamental functionalities. Through a generic multilevel optimization framework, PIMCOMP realizes an end-to-end conversion from a high-level DNN description to pseudo instructions, which can be further converted to specific hardware intrinsics/primitives. The compilation addresses two critical issues in PIM-accelerated inference from a system perspective: 1) resource utilization and 2) dataflow scheduling. PIMCOMP adopts a flexible unfolding format to reshape and partition convolutional layers, adopts a weight-layout guided computation-storage-mapping approach to enhance resource utilization, and balances the system&#8217;s computation, memory access, and communication characteristics. For dataflow scheduling, we design two scheduling algorithms with different interlayer pipeline granularities to support varying application scenarios while ensuring high-computational parallelism. Experiments demonstrate that PIMCOMP improves throughput, latency, and energy efficiency across various architectures. PIMCOMP is open-sourced at https://github.com/sunxt99/PIMCOMP-NN.</description></item><item><title>A Scalable 2T-1FeFET-Based Content Addressable Memory Design for Energy Efficient Data Search</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745585</link><description>Content addressable memory (CAM) is widely used in advanced machine learning models and data-intensive applications for associative search tasks, thanks to the highly parallel pattern matching capability. Most state-of-the-art CAM designs primarily aim to reduce the CAM cell area by utilizing nonvolatile memories (NVMs). However, there has been limited research on optimizing the design and energy efficiency of NVM-based CAMs for practical deployment in edge devices and AI hardware. This article introduces a general compact and energy efficient CAM design scheme that minimizes design overhead by using only one NVM device per cell. Our proposed CAM design realizes both binary CAM (BCAM) and multibit CAM (MCAM) by leveraging the binary and multilevel storage property of NVM devices without additional cell overheads. Additionally, we propose an adaptive matchline (ML) precharge and discharge scheme to further optimize search energy by significantly reducing the ML voltage swing. Ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs) serve as representative NVMs in our proposed design, and we present a 2T-1FeFET CAM array incorporating a sense amplifier that implements the proposed ML scheme. Evaluation results show that our proposed 2T-1FeFET BCAM design achieves energy efficiency improvements of  $6.64\times $ / $4.74\times $ / $9.14\times $ / $3.02\times $  compared to CMOS/ReRAM/STT-MRAM/2FeFET BCAM arrays, while 2T-1FeFET MCAM design achieves  $8.25\times $ / $5.68\times $ / $56.35\times $  better-energy efficiency compared to ReRAM/3T-1FeFET/1FeFET-1R MACM arrays. Benchmarking results demonstrate that our BCAM/MCAM approach provides  $3.2\times $ / $3.7\times $  and  $2.0\times $ / $2.2\times $  energy-delay product improvement over the 2T-2R and 2FeFET CAM in accelerating query processing applications.</description></item><item><title>CTFE: A High-Efficient Heterogeneous Cryptographic CGRA for Diverse Security Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10742119</link><description>Nowadays, cryptographic computation across various security applications necessitates the development of hardware that is not only fast and power-efficient but also flexible enough to support a range of cryptographic algorithms. Unfortunately, existing computing platforms for cryptography struggle to balance high flexibility, high performance, and low power consumption. To address these issues, this article introduces the crypto-tailored flexible engine (CTFE), a next-generation coarse-grained reconfigurable array (CGRA) for cryptography. Concretely, the CTFE incorporates four innovative ideas to achieve high flexibility and performance with high hardware efficiency: 1) processing element array (PEA) with dual-buffer lanes and multiplexer optimization; 2) high flexibility Hyper-ALU; 3) heterogeneous PEA; and 4) bi-tiered pipeline coordination. Real-time evaluation results on Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA at the System-on-Chip (SoC) level demonstrate that the CTFE is 1.13&#8211;14.3 times better in throughput and 55.3&#8211;14 232 times better in energy efficiency than state-of-the-art CPUs. Experiments on an ASIC 45 nm CMOS technology show that the CTFE consumes the power of 1.06 W, occupies an area of  $2.77 \; \text {mm}^{{2}}$ , and operates at the frequency of 510 MHz. In comparison to existing CGRA solutions, CTFE outperforms 1.63&#8211;20.23 times in throughput and 1.61&#8211;73.2 times in area efficiency.</description></item><item><title>HyCTor: A Hybrid CNN-Transformer Network Accelerator With Flexible Weight/Output Stationary Dataflow and Multicore Extension</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10742132</link><description>Hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer networks are emerging in computer vision, combining convolutional, linear, and attention layers to achieve high accuracies with moderate model sizes. Developing the accelerators for hybrid networks is pivotal to simultaneously optimize the static matrix multiplication (MM) in convolutional and linear layers, as well as dynamic MM in attention layers. However, the existing accelerators are primarily designed for either CNNs or Transformers, resulting in increased data movement to support dynamic MM and potential under-utilization of hardware for static MM. To enhance computational performance and energy efficiency for hybrid networks, we propose HyCTor, an accelerator featuring flexible output-stationary (OS) and weight-stationary (WS) dataflows, along with a multicore extension for higher throughput. The parallel array of HyCTor supports interlayer slicing and intralayer splicing to improve the utilization for static MM, and enables seamless switching between OS and WS dataflow to minimize the data movement in dynamic MM. By leveraging structured sparsity in OS dataflow and unstructured sparsity in WS dataflow, the computational efficiency is further boosted for each layer through flexible dataflow selection based on the sparsity ratio. Besides, a novel QuadLoop-mesh topology is proposed to address the complex data dependencies in hybrid networks and minimize data transmission distances in the multicore HyCTor. Experimental results on ResNet-18, ViT-B, and TransIAR-AF show that the proposed single-core HyCTor achieves  $1.83\times $ ,  $1.65\times $ , and  $2.41\times $  speedup than state-of-the-art (SOTA) accelerators with 100% utilization rate in most layers, and  $3.82\times $ &#8211; $38.5\times $  speedup than RTX4090 GPU. The energy efficiency of HyCTor is improved by  $1.81\times $ &#8211; $8.77\times $  compared with SOTA accelerators. Moreover, the 4-core HyCTor achieves speedups of  $3.32\times $ ,  $2.58\times $ , and  $2.91\times $ , while the 16-core HyCTor achieves speedups of  $7.05\times $ ,  $4.05\times $ , and  $9.64\times $  compared to 1-core HyCTor on three networks.</description></item><item><title>A Homogeneous FeFET-Based Time-Domain Compute-in-Memory Fabric for Matrix-Vector Multiplication and Associative Search</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745588</link><description>Matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) and content-based search are two key operations in many machine learning workloads. This article proposes a ferroelectric FET (FeFET) time-domain compute-in-memory (TD-CiM) array that can accelerate both operations in a homogeneous fabric. We demonstrate that 1) the AND and xor/XNOR logic functions required by MVM and content-based search can be realized using a single compute-in-memory (CiM) cell composed of 2FeFETs connected in series; 2) an inverter chain-based TD-CiM array along with a two-phase time-domain computation principle of the TD-CiM can be employed to implement the MVM and content-based search functions; 3) a signal delay-to-digital output conversion can be implemented by associating a loading capacitor with each stage of the inverter chain-based TD-CiM array, ensuring the full digital compatibility; and 4) the proposed 2FeFET cell and inverter chain-based TD-CiM array are robust against FeFET variation according to our comprehensive theoretical and experimental validation. We show how the FeFET TD-CiM can be exploited to accelerate hyperdimensional computing (HDC) and adjusted to process different tasks through dynamic and fine-grained resource allocation. HDC application benchmarking results show that the proposed FeFET-based TD-CiM offers on average  $106\times $ / $63\times $  energy reduction/speedup compared to GPU-based implementation. With more than 8500 TOPS/W energy-efficiency, the proposed FeFET-based TD-CiM exhibits huge potential as a processing fabric for various memory-intensive applications.</description></item><item><title>CSA-CiM: Enhancing Multifunctional Computing-in-Memory With Configurable Sense Amplifiers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10767728</link><description>Computing-in-memory (CiM) effectively alleviates the memory wall problem faced by traditional von Neumann architectures when handling data-intensive applications. Most CiM arrays employ dedicated sense amplifiers (SAs) to perform specific functions, and prior configurable CiM arrays achieve multifunctionality by stacking multiple SAs with corresponding functions. However, the independent nature of these SAs, particularly the analog-to-digital converter (ADC), results in excessive energy and area consumption. In this article, we propose a configurable multifunctional ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET)-based CiM array design, including configurable peripheral circuit with corresponding multifunctionalities and reusable SA components, to reduce energy consumption and latency. The array cells perform logical AND and XNOR operations, and the proposed SA can be configured to operate in either ADC or winner-take-all (WTA) modes, thereby enabling the array to implement both multiplication-accumulation (MAC) and associative search operations. Instead of operating independently, the WTA component within the SA participates as a flash stage in successive approximation register (SAR) conversions in ADC mode, thus enhancing the WTA utilization, energy efficiency and compactness. By integrating the multifunctional CiM array and the configurable SA, our design supports MAC, Hamming-distance computation (HDC), and nearest neighbor search (NNS) operations within the same structure. Compared to existing works, our design achieves energy efficiency improvements of  $7.2\times $  for MAC,  $2.9\times $  for HDC, and EDP improvement of  $6.4\times $  for NNS, respectively.</description></item><item><title>PISOV: Physics-Informed Separation of Variables Solvers for Full-Chip Thermal Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10767764</link><description>Thermal issues are becoming increasingly critical due to rising power densities in high-performance chip design. The need for fast and precise full-chip thermal analysis is evident. Although machine learning (ML)-based methods have been widely used in thermal simulation, their training time remains a challenge. In this article, we proposed a novel physics-informed separation of variables solver (PISOV) to significantly reduce training time for fast full-chip thermal analysis. Inspired by the recently proposed ThermPINN, we employ a least-square regression method to calculate the unknown coefficients of the cosine series. The proposed PISOV method combines physics-informed neural network (PINN) and separation of variables (SOVs) methods. Due to the matrix-solving method of PISOV, its speed is much faster than that of ThermPINN. On top of PISOV, we parameterize effective convection coefficients and power values for surrogate model-based uncertainty quantification (UQ) analysis by using neural networks, a task that cannot be accomplished by the SOV method. In the parameterized PISOV, we only need to calculate once to obtain all parameterized results of the hyperdimensional partial differential equations. Additionally, we study the impact of sampling methods (such as grid, uniform, Sobol, Latin hypercube sampling (LHS), Halton, and Hammersly) and hybrid sampling methods on the accuracy of PISOV and parameterized PISOV. Numerical results show that PISOV can achieve a speedup of  $245\times $ , and  $10^{4}\times $  over ThermPINN, and PINN, respectively. Among different sampling methods, the Hammersley sampling method yields the best accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Sign-Off Timing Considerations via Concurrent Routing Topology Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10767352</link><description>Timing closure is considered across the circuit design flow. Generally, the early stage timing optimization can only focus on improving early timing metrics, e.g., rough timing estimation using linear RC model or prerouting path length, since obtaining sign-off performance needs a time-consuming routing flow. However, there is no consistency guarantee between early stage metrics and sign-off timing performance. Therefore, we utilize the power of deep learning techniques to bridge the gap between the early stage analysis and the sign-off analysis. A well-designed deep learning framework guides the adjustment of Steiner points to enable explicit early stage timing optimization. Cooperating with deep Steiner point adjustment, we propose the routing topology reconstruction to accelerate the convergence and hold a reasonable routing topology. Further, we also introduce Steiner point simplification as a post-processing technique to avoid unnecessary routing constraints. This article demonstrates the ability of the learning-assist framework to perform robust and efficient timing optimization in the early stage with comprehensive and convincing experimental results on real-world designs. With Steiner point adjustment alone, TSteinerPt, can help the state-of-the-art open-source router to obtain 11.2% and 7.1% improvement for the sign-off worst-negative slack and total negative slack, respectively. Under the additional joint optimization with routing topology reconstruction and simplification, TSteinerRec can further save 25.9% optimization duration with a better-sign-off performance.</description></item><item><title>Glass Interposer Integration of Logic and Memory Chiplets: PPA and Power/Signal Integrity Benefits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10759787</link><description>Glass interposers have become a compelling option for 2.5-D heterogeneous integration compared to silicon. It allows 3-D stacking configuration between the embedded dies and the conventional flip-chip dies mounted directly on top at low cost. Furthermore, the interconnect pitch and through-glass-via (TGV) diameter in glass are becoming comparable to their counterparts in silicon. In this study, we investigate the power, performance, area (PPA), signal integrity (SI) and power integrity (PI) advantages of 3-D stacking afforded by glass interposers over silicon interposers. Our research employs a chiplet/package co-design approach, progressing from an register-transfer-level description of RISC-V chiplets to final graphic data system (GDS) layouts, utilizing TSMC 28 nm for chiplets and Georgia Tech&#8217;s 3-D glass packaging for the interposer. Compared to silicon, glass interposers offer a  $2.6\times $  reduction in area, a  $21\times $  reduction in wire length, a 17.72% reduction in full-chip power consumption, a 64.7% increase in SI and a  $10\times $  improvement in PI, with a 35% increase in thermal. Furthermore, we provide a detailed comparative analysis with 3-D Silicon technologies. It not only highlights the competitive advantages of glass interposers, but also provides critical insights into each design&#8217;s potential limitations and optimization opportunities.</description></item></channel></rss>
