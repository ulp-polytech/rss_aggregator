The proposed method injects voltage harmonics, generated by harmonic injection circuits, into the dc side of the rectifier through two specially designed asymmetric DNPST. It brings an almost sinusoidal input current and an output current with 2.5% ripple rate of the rectifier, significantly improving the power quality. Furthermore, the two small-capacity injection circuits are capable of performing phase shifting, thus eliminating the need for phase-shifting transformers. Finally, both simulated and experimental results are given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed system.</description></item><item><title>4-Vector SVPWM for Single-Phase Transformerless UPQC With Two-Leg and Low DC Voltage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10685112</link><description>In this letter, we propose a single-phase transformerless unified power quality conditioner (UPQC) with two legs. Owing to the limited quantity of switches, the half-bridge (HB) UPQC consists of a HB dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) and an active power filter (APF). The proposed topology maintains constant switching stress under all operational scenarios by combining an HB DVR with a full-bridge (FB) APF without increasing the number of switches. To address the issue of current compensation and voltage compensation coupling caused by the shared leg, a four-vector space vector pulsewidth modulation (SVPWM) is proposed for decoupling. With the proposed SVPWM for independent control reference calculation, the effects of dc voltage and load current on voltage compensation can be eliminated by the control strategy. Finally, the effectiveness of the topology and modulation strategy are verified by the experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Highly Efficient 800-to-48-V LLC-DCX With Matrix Transformer Using Side Leg Windings</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10690258</link><description>Adding side legs to a matrix transformer to achieve magnetic flux diversion and improve core utilization can effectively reduce core losses. The current approach of optimizing air gap is challenging in manufacturing and adjusting parameters. This letter proposes a side leg winding solution to naturally divert flux and achieve flux averaging among all the legs, where an off-the-shelf core can be applied to facilitate fabrication. In addition, the side leg windings are connected in series to enable adoption of low-voltage devices with better equivalent figure of merit. It helps improve efficiency in a high-voltage application. Finally, the proposed structure is verified on an 800-to-48-V 3-kW LLC-DCX prototype, achieving a peak efficiency of 98.5% and a power density of 650 W/in3.</description></item><item><title>Narrowband and Wideband Dual-Mode Wireless Power Transfer System With a Single Transmitter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10705043</link><description>This study introduces a dual-mode wireless power transfer system for multistandard wireless charging products. The system allows two receivers to operate concurrently at narrowband and wideband frequencies using the proposed sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM). Conventional SPWM does not provide independent control of switching and sideband harmonics, which are required for dual-mode excitation. We propose a new hybrid carrier and reference phase shift method to provide independent control of the reference, switching, and sideband harmonics. A prototype has been developed to validate power transfer at both narrowband (951 and 1190 kHz) and wideband (100 and 1190 kHz) frequency operations.</description></item><item><title>Boundary Adjustment Hysteresis Current Control for Improving the Efficiency of Parallel-Form Switch-Linear Hybrid Envelope Tracking Power Supply</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10717331</link><description>The parallel-form switch-linear hybrid envelope tracking power supply is usually composed of a buck converter with hysteresis current control (HCC) and a voltage-controlled linear amplifier (VLA) connected in parallel. The buck converter is aiming to provide most of the load current for minimizing the output current of VLA to reduce its power loss. However, when the load voltage swing is large, the voltage across VLA is high and thus its power loss is still significant. In this article, a boundary adjustment HCC method is proposed to reduce the voltages across the operating power devices, leading to decreased power loss of VLA and improved overall efficiency. A prototype with 10&#8211;27-V output voltage and 14-W average output power is fabricated and tested with both constant resistance and authentic power amplifier for tracking 10-MHz bandwidth envelope signal. The experimental results validated the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Resonant Condition for Maximum Output Power in Tightly Coupled WPT Systems Considering Harmonics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10717477</link><description>Previous studies for calculating the maximum output power (MOP) of wireless power transfer (WPT) systems typically employ fundamental harmonic analysis, which is accurate for loosely coupled WPT systems since high-order harmonics are largely suppressed. However, in practical applications, such as automated guided vehicles, the transfer distance is limited, leading to tight coupling. Inevitably, harmonics are introduced, causing inaccuracies in evaluating the MOP ability and associated operating conditions. In this article, a harmonic model is developed for MOP calculation using a series&#8211;series compensated system as an example. On this basis, the critical coupling coefficient is defined to establish the threshold for tightly coupled condition. Under this condition, optimal frequency selection is implemented to improve the output power of system rather than limiting it to operate at the inherent resonant frequency. Furthermore, higher output power is attainable by tuning compensation parameters to enable different resonant states in primary and secondary sides, while ensuring zero-voltage switching. The contribution of high-order harmonics to the total power is quantified. At a transfer distance of 5 mm and coupling coefficient of 0.7, the experimental results validate the accuracy of the harmonic model across a broad load range from 5 to 50 &#937; using a 400-W prototype.</description></item><item><title>Online Converter-Level Temperature Estimation for IGBTs Using Proportional Calibration Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10723219</link><description>In this letter, we propose a novel online converter-level junction temperature Tj evaluation method for insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) based on the common power loop parasitic inductance voltage overshoot of the bus bar. This temperature sensitive electrical parameter is at an appropriate quantity of several volts with relatively high sensitivity. In addition, to address the issue that different converters and different batches of IGBT modules need to be calibrated repeatedly, this letter proposes a proportional calibration method. Double-pulse test reveals the temperature dependence, and online experimental results of the three-phase converter with calibration method provide a basis for industrial application of the proposed junction temperature estimation method.</description></item><item><title>A Power Losses and Thermal Energy Optimization Method for Hybrid DC Chopper Based on Hysteresis Control Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10682815</link><description>DC chopper used to absorb the surplus power to prevent the devices from been damaged by the dc overvoltage is one of the important equipment for the offshore wind farm grid connection via the modular multilevel converter-HVdc system. A hybrid dc chopper structure composed of cascaded submodules and a lumped resistor is proposed in which the distributed resistor is deployed inside each submodule. Due to the cascaded structure, a hysteresis control strategy with dc bus voltage coordinated is proposed to reduce the large charging power of the dc chopper. By doing so, the capacitor in each submodule is only charged during the inserting and bypassing stages giving an opportunity to greatly reduce the charging energy and capacitance of capacitor. As a result, the switching frequencies and power losses of insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) as well as the thermal energies of the distributed resistors are reduced by 95%, 99%, and 97.7%, respectively, compared to that of the original control strategy. Consequently, the press-packed IGBTs can be replaced with welded-type ones resulting in air-cooling device instead of water-cooling device. Finally, an experimental prototype is established for the validation of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Low-Voltage Solid State DCCB Design Based on Bypassed Bidirectional Thyristor-Capacitor Suppressor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10684019</link><description>This article introduces a novel technique known as bidirectional thyristor capacitor designed to interrupt dc currents effectively and mitigate power surges in low-voltage (LV) solid-state dc circuit breakers (SS-DCCB). The method employs parallel snubber capacitors to absorb switching effects, subsequently releasing stored energy during the subsequent switch operation. The model incorporates considerations for both line and load inductances, offering a realistic portrayal of a dc system and ensuring authentic protective measures. To validate the efficacy of this approach, practical results from the system are cross-referenced with simulation outputs, validating the credibility of the research findings. Additionally, an ARM microcontroller is programmed to control the sequence of actions among the active SS switches, optimizing their performance. The proposed LV SS-DCCB operates at a voltage level of 48 VDC and nominal current of 8 A. However, the design is scalable and can be extended to accommodate higher voltage and current ranges.</description></item><item><title>A Master-Slave Model Predictive Control Approach for Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10684155</link><description>This article proposes a master-slave finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) for microgrids. To demonstrate it, a microgrid is considered, composed of a master neutral-point clamped (NPC) inverter with a battery energy storage system (BESS) and output LC filter; two slave NPC inverters with photovoltaic (PV) panels and output LCL filters; RL and nonlinear loads. Two modes of operation are proposed for the primary control of the microgrid. In the first, the microgrid is connected to the main grid, and the master and slaves are grid-following inverters. In the second, the microgrid is islanded, and the master is a grid-forming inverter, while the slaves remain as grid-following inverters. To validate the performance of the proposed master-slave FCS-MPC, hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) results are presented for different operational conditions of the microgrid, including grid connection, transition to islanded mode, and load variations. The results demonstrate the good performance of the proposed master-slave FCS-MPC, such as fast dynamic response, multivariable control, and robustness to parametric uncertainties and variations.</description></item><item><title>Dual-Loop Estimation Based Adaptive Controller for Microgrid Connected Boost Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10684545</link><description>DC microgrids are an excellent solution to integrate modern power generation and consumption with legacy infrastructure. Tightly regulated converters connecting ac and dc loads to the dc bus challenge the stability of the microgrid by showing a constant power load (CPL) behavior. This work proposes a dual-loop estimation based adaptive controller (DLEAC) for converters regulating the dc bus voltage, and a novel nonlinear estimator to identify the CPL and resistive power consumption components. The controller combines a feedback linearization control for the current loop with a traditional dual-loop proportional-integral control structure in which the proportional and integral gains of the voltage controller vary according to the estimated load power, allowing it to maintain constant dynamics at all operating conditions. The proposed methods show low computation complexity and are suitable for implementation on industry-standard microcontrollers. Detailed mathematical procedures, as well as comprehensive simulation and experimental validation are included in this article.</description></item><item><title>Combining Data-Driven and Event-Driven for Online Learning Predictive Control in Power Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10684549</link><description>The combination of data-driven and event-driven opens up the possibility of alleviating the long-standing research challenges for power converters in classical finite control-set model predictive control, i.e., model parametric uncertainties and unnecessary switching loss. Inspire by this, we will launch a major study on the problem of designing online learning predictive controller. Unlike most prior works in this area, it can be accomplished by an integrated data-driven and event-driven design framework. To be more precise, the design procedures rely on a combination of developing a data-driven model-free adaptive predictive control, introducing an online reinforcement learning technique, and leveraging an event-driven mechanism. Furthermore, we also provide extensions to robust model-free predictive control design based on input&#8211;output data and against unknown uncertainties under low switching frequency operation, while avoiding a priori knowledge of model information and weighting factors. Finally, we illustrate our approach and highlight its advantages on a numerical example, and the results presented are promising and motivate further research in this field.</description></item><item><title>Time-Step-Adaptive Filter Discretization for Variable Sampling Frequency Control of Power Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10684601</link><description>This article proposes a time-step-adaptive filter discretization method for variable sampling frequency (VSF) control considering the effect of the previous sampling time steps on the filter response. The proposed discretization method is upon discretized integral equation in conjunction with prewarping to ensure accurate filter responses. The frequency responses shown in the bode plots of the digital filters and the experimental results of the single-phase totem-pole ac&#8211;dc converter control demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method compared to the conventional discretization method with one-to-one mapping. The proposed discretization principle has a promising potential for digital control of power converters and electric machines under VSF.</description></item><item><title>Online Harmonic Reduction for Aircraft Electrical Power Distribution System With Global Phase-Shifted Carrier PWM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693500</link><description>The penetration rate of power electronics converters (PEC) within onboard electrical power distribution systems (EPDS) has been rising for years due to the trend of moving towards more electric aircraft (MEA) and all electric aircraft (AEA). Digital control and pulse width modulation (PWM) of these devices give rise to the electrical harmonics within the EPDS. Phase-shifted carrier PWM (PSC-PWM) has been a well-established concept for cascaded/paralleled PECs to eliminate certain harmonic components. However, when multiple PECs work cooperatively with different power ratings in the EPDS, an exhaustive system-level analytical model accurate to switching behavior is difficult to acquire and solve in real-time. In this work, a Simulated Annealing-based global optimization method is proposed for further enhancing the waveform quality at the EPDS transmission bus by tuning the PSC offset angle of the PECs directly according to the total harmonic distortion value measured online. Simulation and experimental results are given with a three-port system to verify the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>Offset-Free Optimal Control of Cascaded H-Bridge Converters Based on a Kalman Filter Harmonic Compensator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10702549</link><description>Cascaded H-bridge (CHB) converters are suitable candidates for numerous applications, including electrical drives, static synchronous compensators, and battery energy storage inverters. Optimal control strategies for CHB converters have attracted significant interest in recent decades due to their flexibility in including multiple control objectives and their simple design process. However, the steady-state performance of these control strategies deteriorates if the CHB converter model has parameter mismatches and/or the submodule (SM) capacitor voltage ripples are not measured. This work proposes a Kalman filter (KF) based strategy to eliminate the steady-state error and undesired low-frequency harmonic components in the CHB converter output currents. The proposed KF strategy estimates the instantaneous arm voltage harmonics representing the converter modeling errors and unaccounted disturbances. Then, these estimated voltage harmonics are used to improve the arm current predictions and obtain a compensation term for the steady-state arm voltage references to be used by the optimal control strategy. Experimental results for three different optimal control schemes are provided for a three-phase CHB converter with nine SMs to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed KF strategy.</description></item><item><title>Control Architecture for LLC Resonant Converters With High Input Disturbance Rejection Capability Using Output Diode Current</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10706009</link><description>The controller design for the LLC resonant dc&#8211;dc converter is challenging due to the large number of poles whose locations vary with operating conditions. A controller's ability to reject input disturbance is required to reduce the input filter size, increase power density, and improve reliability. This article presents a control architecture utilizing the output diode current measurement that reduces the control-to-output transfer function for an LLC resonant converter to first order and provides a high degree of input voltage disturbance rejection with a marginal increase in implementation complexity. The increased disturbance rejection allows the reduction of the bulky dc-link capacitance at the output of the PFC in electric vehicle battery charging application. A small-signal model for the proposed control variable is derived, and loop analysis using a Bode plot highlights the advantages of the proposed method. Simulation results verify the proposed architecture's high disturbance rejection capabilities. The proposed control architecture is evaluated using a 1-kW front-end power factor correction (PFC) rectifier followed by an LLC resonant converter with an intermediate dc-link voltage of 400 V. The proposed approach achieves a 4.5&#215; reduction in the energy storage requirement in the intermediate dc-link compared to direct frequency control without sacrificing output voltage ripple and efficiency of the LLC stage and total harmonic distortion at the input of the PFC stage.</description></item><item><title>Unified Modeling and Control Methods for Ripple Power Decoupling Circuit Based on DC-Split Capacitor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10706889</link><description>Single-phase inverter systems inherently exhibit second-harmonic ripple power, which must be suppressed to minimize its adverse effects on the system. One effective technique for ripple power decoupling involves injecting complementary ripple voltages into dc split capacitors. By exploiting the energy differential between the split capacitors, ripple power is effectively compensated, whereas the complementary capacitor voltages maintain a stable dc bus voltage. This article presents a unified model that elucidates the internal physical mechanisms underlying power decoupling methods based on dc split capacitors. From this model, four distinct methods are derived, revealing the necessity of bidirectional power flow and explaining why certain previous methods have only achieved partial ripple power decoupling. Furthermore, the methods are compared comprehensively, taking into account capacitance requirements, semiconductor stress, and system volume to determine the optimal design. Finally, the unified model is validated using a 400-W IPOS CLLLC-fed voltage source inverter prototype. Experimental results demonstrate that all methods significantly suppress ripple power with reduced capacitance, with the differential capacitance approach, featuring an unbalanced dc operating point design, delivering the best overall performance.</description></item><item><title>Compensating Frequency Converter Nonlinearity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10707349</link><description>Voltage and/or current of multiphase systems are usually controlled using frequency converters (FCs). Typically, these FCs consist of several half bridges and, due to their working principle, their output voltage will depend on the output current nonlinearly. Many well known compensation methods (CMs) rely on the assumption that the current is nearly constant during one switching cycle. However, with decreasing load inductances this assumption may not be fulfilled and therefore these methods may not succeed in achieving full compensation. This contribution provides a CM, which takes the so-called ripple current into account and is therefore especially useful when dealing with small load inductances.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Modulation Method for LLC Converter-Based Semi-Single-Stage Isolated Inverter With Hybrid Sliding Mode Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10713208</link><description>The LLC-converter-based pseudo-dc link semisingle-stage isolated inverters (PDL-SII) face the challenge of achieving low gain outputs within the zero-voltage switching operation region. As a competitive option, the burst-like modulation technique for LLC converters offers a lower gain than conventional pulse frequency modulation, by managing the converter's activation, which is particularly advantageous for LLC converters operation in PDL-SII configuration. Despite its advantages in soft switching and low gain, conventional burst modulation suffers from increased output ripple, potentially affecting the output current quality. This is largely attributed to the sampling time delay inherent in the sampling filters, and the continued energy transmission of the LLC converter post-deactivation due to residual resonant circuit energy. To tackle these issues, a novel hybrid sliding mode control (HSMC) for LLC converters is proposed in this article. In the proposed HSMC, the filter effect is minimized through an averaged LLC converter model, and the optimal trigger timing for deactivation and activation is accurately predicted by analyzing the phase plane trajectory of the LLC converter. When applied to the LLC-converter-based PDL-SII and paired with the full- and half-bridge topology morphing strategy of the LLC converter, the proposed HSMC presents higher efficiency and reduced total harmonic distortion (THD) characteristics. Experimental validations confirm the theoretical propositions, demonstrating that the proposed mixed control can lower THD by up to 1.6% and boost efficiency by 1% compared with conventional approaches.</description></item><item><title>Design-Oriented Transient Stability Analysis of Grid-Connected Converters: A Comparative Study of Analysis Methods</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10720102</link><description>Transient stability analysis of grid-connected converters can provide guidance for practical design. Previous studies have summarized monotonic relationships between stability and parameters. Given the complex nonlinear behavior of converter-based systems, these monotonic relationships are incomplete. In this article, design guidelines in the form of feasible parameter ranges are developed. Sensitivity analysis and bifurcation diagrams are utilized to derive feasible parameter ranges from typical stability analysis methods, including time-domain simulation, energy-based methods (manually derived and algorithmically searched), and bifurcation analysis. It is found that different analysis methods may provide equivalent design guidelines due to the similar sensitivity patterns identified by these methods. Furthermore, we reveal that the change in the sensitivity patterns can be induced by the bifurcation behavior of grid-connected converters. Therefore, the qualitative differences between the stability analysis methods are determined by their ability to capture the various bifurcations crucial for determining transient stability. Our results show different levels of consistency between the analysis methods. The findings are verified by laboratory experiments.</description></item><item><title>Model-Predictive Dual-Control Loop With Improved Current-Limiting Capability for Grid-Forming Inverter Under Grid Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10721289</link><description>Current-limiting capability is crucial for fault ride-through of grid-forming (GFM) inverters. Most current-limiting schemes for GFM inverters are implemented within classical linear controllers, which cannot guarantee optimal performance in case of emergencies like faults. Additionally, the inherent cascaded structure limits the bandwidth. The advanced model-predictive control (MPC) has been developed for power converters thanks to nonlinear objectives and constraints handling ability. One of the well-known MPCs, i.e., the finite-control-set MPC (FCS-MPC) has been employed to prevent overcurrent, which roughly includes a nonlinear penalization for current magnitude violation in the cost function. In this case, the cost function of FCS-MPC will go to infinity during faults at the expense of the voltage and current reference tracking ability, and thus, the power quality gets worse. Besides, the weighting factor design is usually a nontrivial task for MPC. To maintain the high bandwidth benefit of MPC and improve the power quality during faults, a model-predictive dual-control loop (MP-DCL) is proposed in this article. The proposed method involves the outer-voltage MPC loop to generate the optimal current reference. With the current-limiting factor applied, such a constrained reference will be tracked through the proposed inner-current MPC loop. The proposed MP-DCL expresses simple design benefits and ensures the GFM system recovers from fault to normal conditions smoothly with low overshoots and without oscillation. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy through numerous comparisons with state-of-the-art solutions.</description></item><item><title>Flexible 1.5-GHz Probe Isolation Extension With High CMRR and Robust dv/dt Immunity Empowering Next-Generation WBG Measurement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10705906</link><description>Advancements in the next-generation wide-bandgap (WBG) power devices, distinguished by higher blocking voltage and faster switching speed, give rise to the advent of ultrahigh dv/dt. These three factors collectively impose demanding performance requirements on future high-performance measurement systems. This article conducts an in-depth exploration of the challenges encountered during the low- and high-side dynamic testing of the next-generation WBG device. Drawing from this examination, the performance requirements for future galvanically isolated testing systems are summarized, i.e., a broad dynamic range extending to medium voltage levels, a minimum measurement bandwidth of 500 MHz, a common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of at least 50 dB at 100 MHz, and a dv/dt immunity exceeding 100 V/ns. To effectively response these objectives, the concept of probe isolation extension (PIE) is introduced, with the aim of providing exceptional galvanic isolation while preserving the high electrical performance of traditional nonisolated testing systems to the greatest extent possible. Building upon the PIE concept, an optics-based physical implementation method, known as optical dock (OD), is presented. The operating principles of the OD are derived, and a detailed analysis is conducted to examine the factors that influence its high-frequency response. Additionally, parameter tuning methods are provided to maximize its bandwidth. These collective efforts have successfully resulted in the development of a high-performance PIE OD, which exhibits outstanding galvanic isolation capability, an ultrahigh bandwidth of 1.53 GHz, a high CMRR of 72 dB at 100 MHz, and robust dv/dt immunity of 1.3 kV/ns. Extensive comparative experiments with the state-of-the-art galvanically isolated probes/systems have demonstrated that by incorporating PIE OD to expand various different nonisolated probes/systems, precise characterization of all high-side dynamic electrical parameters, i.e., vgs, vds, and id, for the MV SiC mosfet can be achieved. This highlights the significant potential of the PIE OD for next-generation WBG and even ultra-WBG applications.</description></item><item><title>Gate Voltage Closed-Loop Regulation Technique for High-Voltage Supercascode Power Switches</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10707346</link><description>A normally-off device based high-voltage supercascode switch topology with the gate voltage adaptive closed-loop regulation is proposed for the high-voltage converter application. The gate voltages of each in series device are adaptively regulated to balance through the closed-loop circuits in the proposed supercascode switch. As a result, the turn-on uniformity and the number of devices in series are improved, and the gate voltage overshoots are suppressed. The closed-loop circuit is simple to implement, consisting only of a low-voltage N-channel depletion mosfet, two resistors, and a capacitor. A 16-kV/30-A supercascode power switch (SCPS) is built based on the proposed topology, and the turn-on gate voltages of all devices are consistent and stable at +15 V finally during the turn-on process. Compared with the conventional topological gate voltages, the waveform overshoots are suppressed. Furthermore, the SCPS is tested in a double pulse tester at 10 kV and a switching load experiment at 10 kV, 15.6 Hz, demonstrating outstanding switching characteristics.</description></item><item><title>PCB Inductor With Integrated Shielding to Contain Switching Electric Field and Reduce CM Noise</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10683893</link><description>Continued improvements in power semiconductor technology have allowed power supplies to become increasingly miniaturized and integrated. However, care must be taken to ensure the converter's switching noise does not interfere with its sensing circuitry, gate drivers, or electromagnetic interference (EMI) filter. Prior works have shown how switching noise can capacitively couple to the EMI filter and significantly increase conducted common mode (CM) noise. This article aims to contain the switching electric field of a front-end power factor correction (PFC) converter by integrating conductive shielding around the switches and PCB-winding inductor. A novel planar inductor structure is proposed to shield the inductor's electric field without adding significant eddy losses. The proposed shielding effectively contains the switching electric field of a GaN-based totem-pole PFC converter, which reduces its CM noise up to 28 dB with minimal impact on converter loss ($\Delta \eta$ = 0.06%). A detailed design procedure is provided for the proposed inductor shielding based on parametric studies with 3-D finite element analysis (FEA) simulation tools.</description></item><item><title>One-Step Method of Dynamic Capacitances Extraction From a SiC Power MOSFET in a Half-Bridge Package for EMI Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10707321</link><description>The electromagnetic interference (EMI) and dynamic capacitance characteristics of metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (mosfets) are essential considerations in circuit design and electromagnetic compatibility. A mosfet is a semiconductor widely used in switching applications. The dynamic capacitance characteristics of a mosfet are closely related to the switching behavior of the circuit and EMI generation. Therefore, for EMI analysis and to control power conversion systems, the capacitances of the mosfets have to be accurately known. The capacitance of a mosfet changes depending on the dc bias voltage. In other words, this means that EMI characteristics may vary depending on operating conditions, so capacitance must be obtained based on the dc voltage. Much research has been conducted on the capacitance extraction of a single mosfet. However, the complexity of the half-bridge structure increases as the number of terminals increases, so conventional research has limitations. This article proposes a method to extract the half-bridge mosfet dynamic capacitances simply using a one-step measurement. By changing the terminal connection of the half-bridge mosfet, the dynamic capacitances were obtained through two-port S-parameter measurement. The proposed method was verified through simulation and experiment, and a switching test was performed for EMI analysis.</description></item><item><title>Virtual Vector Modulation and Capacitor Voltage Control for Coupled Eight-Switch Three-Phase Three-Level Inverter With Full Lagging Reactive Power Flow Capability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10586755</link><description>Due to the requirement of low cost in photovoltaic (PV) applications, an eight-switch three-phase three-level inverter (TP-TLI) and its modulation strategy have been proposed. However, it can only operate under high power factor (PF) conditions with this modulation strategy. In this article, the reactive power flow capability of each voltage vector is analyzed for the eight-switch TP-TLI. Based on this, a novel virtual space vector modulation (VSVM) is proposed. In each sector, it defines one virtual small vector and uses the vectors which are viable for full operation range of lagging PF. Hence, the proposed VSVM achieves full operation range of lagging PF. Besides, an active neutral point voltage control (NPVC) strategy is also proposed. Only one coefficient needs to be calculated, so the calculation is simple. In addition, it considers both the NPV fluctuation and the NP current introduced by the selected virtual small vector, and it can provide zero, positive, and negative NP current. Hence, it is accurate to control the NPV, and it could balance the NPV without obvious dc offset and ac ripples under all PF conditions and modulation indexes. The proposed modulation and control strategies are verified by experiment results with a 3 kVA prototype.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Topology and Design Methodology for Improved Power Quality of High-Power Charger</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10601658</link><description>This article introduces a novel topology and design methodology of a high-power charger. The proposed topology integrates a modified 12-pulse Diode Bridge Rectifier (12pDBR) with an interleaved boost converter (IBC) to meet the charging requirements and power quality standards. This results in an efficient charger with a reduced number of components and magnetic ratings compared to its counterparts. The mathematical analysis that highlights the significance of triangular shaping of the output currents of a 12pDBR and its impact on the input current harmonics is presented. Furthermore, the role of overlap angle, which is a function of system inductances, in triangular wave shaping is emphasized. A systematic methodology for the coordinated design of 12pDBR and IBC is proposed. To verify the design, MATLAB/Simulink simulations are conducted, followed by experimental validation using a 1 kW prototype. The proposed topology attains a grid current Total Harmonic Distortion (%iTHD) of 4.9%, a power factor (PF) of 0.97 lag, and a charging current ripple of 2.75% at full load condition.</description></item><item><title>A Decoupled Flux Path Hybrid Excitation DC Generator Combining Direct-Drive Permanent Magnet and Geared Flux Modulation Machines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10586775</link><description>A decoupled flux path hybrid excitation generator (HEG) with a radially parallel structure is proposed and analyzed in this paper.

However, it is difficult to meet the comprehensive requirements of high water pressure resistance, micro size, and low power consumption at the same time, which means that the existing vehicles are difficult to achieve long-term operation in the narrow and complex deep water environment. The piezoelectric jet drive can realize miniaturization, good antipressure ability, and simple control method, while the underactuated mode can reduce energy consumption and extend the endurance time. In this work, a piezoelectric jet microsize unit with high water pressure resistance is proposed based on piezoelectric drive, and a piezoelectric jet-driven underwater plane with low power consumption is designed. Its maximum stable straight-line velocity can reach 47.62 mm/s (0.397 BL/s). It can realize a variety of actions such as horizontal forward, floating forward, diving forward, and rotation, and its power consumption in horizontal motion is much lower than that of a fully actuated vehicle. This article will provide an important reference for the research of long-endurance vehicles that operate in deep diving and narrow area.</description></item><item><title>Multi-State Voltage Balancing of UAV&#8217;s Cell String: A Reconfigurable WPT Based Multiport Hybrid Charging Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10586754</link><description>Wireless power transfer (WPT)-based voltage equalizers (VEs) are desired for flexible and secure balanced charging of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, the existing WPT-based VEs fail to balance the cells once the onboard receiver (Rx) is away from the transmitter (Tx), and the efficiency and capacity are limited. This article proposes a reconfigurable WPT-based multiport hybrid charging approach to achieve UAV&#8217;s cell string balancing under multiple states. By converging one Tx port, one Rx bidirectional port, and two voltage-balance (Vx) driving ports, the approach enables the source-to-cell (STC) and pack-to-cell (PTC) charging/balancing, which achieves cell balancing during charging, discharging, and standing conditions. Circuit analyses of the corresponding topology validate its operating principles and basic performance. Efficiency and capacity in the STC balance mode are improved with the combined Rx and Vx output ports. The cell&#8217;s voltage equivalation can still be realized without Tx in the PTC balance mode. Asymmetric Tx and Rx coils and orthogonal Vx coils integrated into Rx are designed with specific coupling or decoupling as the multiport WPT coupler to enable the charging and balancing with a robust misalignment tolerance. An experimental prototype for eight cells is established, and the test results demonstrate the effectiveness of this scheme.</description></item><item><title>A Family of High Step-Up Interleaved DC-DC Converters Based on the Coupled Inductors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10586749</link><description>This article proposes a series of high-step-up interleaved dc&#8211;dc converters utilizing coupled inductors and quadratic voltage gains.

For high-frequency alternating input voltage, which is conventionally used in wireless power transfer (WPT) systems, the high-order harmonic components are usually regarded as interferences to the system. However, this proposed WPDT solution, instead of filtering the high-order harmonics, uses it as the combined source for simultaneous power and driving signal transmission. Thus, it is possible to design the system for two resonance frequency channels with arbitrary primary currents for control. As a result, the transmission currents for the main power and driving signals can be automatically modulated on the primary side, while demodulated for the two channels on the secondary side. All the control can be completed through only one full-bridge converter. The experimental prototype successfully demonstrates that the system can be flexibly shifted between two modes for 1/0 driving signal transmission while maintaining the stability of the output power with high efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Multiple Frequency Spectrum Impedance Matching Method of Nonlinear Geological Surveying Electromagnetic Method for Power Amplifier Capacity Utilization Enhancement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10586773</link><description>This article proposes a multiple frequency spectrum impedance matching method to extend the applying environment of the impedance matching technology from linear sinusoidal voltage to nonlinear voltage in the electromagnetic method (EM) of geological survey.

Although SiC devices are known to reduce switching losses, a snubber is essential to mitigate the high dv/dt ratio on the switch&#8217;s drain&#8211;source voltage, which results from the surge in current when the SiC switch is turned off. This work proposes a floating-voltage source (FVS)-based snubber, presenting a single-circuit solution that provides soft turn-off (ringing suppression) capabilities for multiple power switches in MLC. Moreover, it ensures that this soft turn-off feature is consistently effective across all duty-cycle (D) ratios of the MLC without any constraint. This work also presents two approaches for realizing the FVS-based snubber: dissipative and energy-regenerative methods. In this article, a prototype of a 7-kW three-level flying-capacitor buck (TLFCB) converter with a 537 VDC input is developed. This prototype successfully demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed snubber across D ranging from 0.2 to 0.8.</description></item><item><title>Design of a High-Voltage Low-Ripple Converter With High-Frequency Dickson Multipliers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10595839</link><description>High-voltage, low-ripple dc-dc converters are essential in various industrial and scientific applications.

In this converter, an auxiliary circuit is integrated with the quadratic topology which uses coupled inductors and switched capacitors to improve the voltage gain and switch voltage stress without adding any extra magnetic core. The auxiliary circuit elements are arranged so that a passive clamp path is created to absorb the leakage inductance energy and recycle it to the output. In addition, most diodes turn off at zero current which eliminates the reverse recovery problem. Also, due to low switch voltage stress, high-quality switch with low conduction loss is used leading to high converter efficiency. The presented converter benefits from continuous input current and common ground between input and output which increase its applicability. The proposed converter is completely analyzed and compared with other counterpart structures. The implemented 300 W laboratory prototype converter has achieved the peak efficiency of 96%.</description></item><item><title>Design Methodology of High Power Density Converter with Wide Input Voltage Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10592035</link><description>High-power density and high efficiency have always been the pursuit of power supplies.

To address this problem, an adaptive current-limiting control (ACLC) method, which is based on the bridge arm current, has been proposed. A dynamic ACLC model, aiming to suppress the fault current, has been constructed by introducing of a bypass ratio that reduces the dc voltage. This model incorporates the bridge arm current as a critical variable, giving a linearized current limit suppression curve for adaptive bypass ratio output. Additionally, the ac/dc coupling mechanism within the converter has been thoroughly analyzed. The influence of the ACLC on the ac side current has been examined, providing a theoretical basis for the upper limit of the bypass ratio constraint in both strong and weak ac systems. A half-bridge high-voltage direct current transmission technology based on the modular multilevel converter (HB-MMC-HVDC) network model was built in the real-time digital simulator to test the proposed ACLC method. The results show that the proposed ACLC method reduces the peak current values by 12.33% and 34.52% under strong ac and weak ac systems, respectively, compared with other fault current-limiting (FCL) methods, and has a better current-limiting effect.</description></item><item><title>Territory Division Lyapunov Controller for Fast Maximum Power Point Tracking of Pavement PV System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10586782</link><description>The stochastic fast-varying output characteristics of pavement photovoltaic (PV) system pose a great challenge for the real-time measurement and rapid tracking of the maximum power point (MPP).

The proposed Lyapunov controller is designed to maintain the important stability requirement which enables a fast convergence to the control equation at each duty cycle. A territory division strategy is designed in the Lyapunov controller to improve its global searching capability. Finally, an experimental platform for pavement PV arrays was built. The effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method are thoroughly tested and compared with four other algorithms, which include the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, salp swarm algorithm (SSA) algorithm, gray wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm and Harris hawk optimization algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively adapt to a variety of vehicle shading conditions of the pavement PV arrays, and the average tracking accuracy reaches 98.3%, which is significantly higher than other comparative algorithms. In addition, the average tracking time of the proposed algorithm is only 0.147&#160;s, which is seven times faster than the four compared algorithms.

The proposed converter comprises an interleaved current-fed bridge and a voltage quadrupler rectifier with a bidirectional switch on the primary and secondary sides of the transformer, respectively, for achieving high-voltage gain and zero input current ripple. Furthermore, it can achieve an additional increase in voltage gain by adjusting the duty cycle of the bidirectional switch, even with a fixed duty cycle of 0.5, which simultaneously ensures ripple-free input current. So, these structural advantages allow the converter to achieve a much higher voltage gain with the least transformer turns-ratio value than existing step-up converters. The voltage quadrupler also makes the output component's voltage stress half the output voltage. In addition, the resonant operation enables all the switches and diodes to fully attain soft switching over the operating voltage range. Thus, the reverse recovery problem of the diodes and the switching loss for all switches can be eliminated. Its operating principles and theoretical derivations of the converter are discussed in detail. The effectiveness and performance of the proposed converter were verified using a 400-W prototype operating under input voltage ranging from 38 to 48 V inputs and an output voltage of 380 V, achieving a peak efficiency of 96.4%.</description></item><item><title>A Robust Inductance Estimation Method for Model Predictive Control of Grid-Connected Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10592057</link><description>The inductance parameter is crucial to realize high-precision model predictive control (MPC) for grid-connected inverter (GCI), while the traditional inductance estimation method is sensitive to the grid frequency deviation and cannot work normally when the active power is zero. To solve these problems, a new inductance online estimation method based on a full order sliding mode voltage observer (FSMVO) is proposed. First, the drawbacks of the traditional FSMVO-based inductance estimation method are analyzed. Second, a new inductance estimation method is proposed, which uses the error between the observed grid voltage and the actual one passed through a filter, whose transfer function is the same as the one of FSMVO. As a result, the new inductance estimation method is immune to the grid frequency deviation. Moreover, a new Lyapunov function is also designed in this article to deduce the new inductance estimation method, which can work well, no matter the active power is zero or not. Finally, by substituting the estimated inductance parameter into the MPC algorithm, the control performance of GCI can be improved. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed inductance estimation method are verified by experimental researches.</description></item><item><title>Smooth Reversal of Power Transfer Direction for ZVS Bidirectional Four-Switch Buck-Boost Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10597626</link><description>Bidirectional dc&#8211;dc converters have found wide applications in renewable energy generation systems, residential energy storage systems, and electric vehicles.

However, the HDLLER is a nonlinear system and has strong coupling between the joints and parameter ingestion problems, which will affect its trajectory tracking performance. This article focuses on an effective decoupling control algorithm. First, the strongly coupled nonlinear system of the HDLLER is converted from the strict-feedback form into a canonical form through feedback linearization, which can avoid the differential explosion problem of the backstepping method. To reconstruct the state variables and nonlinear term of the transformed system, the extended state observer (ESO) which is a foremost component of active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is adopted. Then, the backstepping controller based on ESO is designed and its stability is proved by Lyapunov's theorem. Finally, contrast experiments are implemented to confirm the correctness of the proposed algorithm, which indicates the presented approach can better suppress the coupling to improve tracking performance.</description></item><item><title>Investigation and Comparative Study of Double-Sided Yokeless Asymmetric Flux Reversal Permanent Magnet Linear Machine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10591787</link><description>This article proposes two types of double-sided yokeless asymmetric flux reversal permanent magnet linear machines (DYAFR-PMLM) for long-distance application. By employing asymmetric excitation, the second-order harmonic magnetomotive force (MMF) arises with significant amplitude, making it a valuable resource for enhancing thrust force density. The article starts by introducing the machine topology and working mechanism under both asymmetric excitation and a complementary secondary structure. Subsequently, the mechanism for thrust force generation under multiple MMFs is analytically calculated and validated by using finite element analysis. Then, some crucial electromagnetic performance metrics, including the open-circuit performances, thrust force performances, power factor, and demagnetization risk, are comparatively analyzed. The results reveal that the proposed DYAFR-PMLM with a consequent pole (CP) structure can achieve a thrust force density 59% higher than conventional FR-PMLM. Additionally, the power factor can be increased to 0.89, and the normal force can be significantly reduced from kilo-newtons to under 10 newtons. More notably, DYAFR-PMLM attains a thrust force density of 78.2% while substantially reducing the PM volume to about 1/74 over a 10-m distance in comparison to conventional PMLM. Finally, a prototype of DYAFR-PMLM with a CP structure is fabricated and validated through experimental testing.</description></item><item><title>Multilevel Limit Cycle Oscillator for Synchronizing Grid Connected Inverters in Fault Ride-Through Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10586760</link><description>Grid synchronization algorithms are important in control systems of power electronic converters. These algorithms must ensure proper synchronization even in the case of disturbances such as voltage-sags and phase-jumps, which are common in high-voltage and low-voltage ride-through applications. Therefore, the development of robust synchronization algorithms in these situations is of interest. In this article, a nonlinear synchronization algorithm suitable for application in grid-following inverters operating under fault ride-through conditions is proposed. This algorithm is called multilevel limit cycle oscillator frequency-locked loop (MLCO-FLL), and it is used as a prefilter for a synchronous reference frame phase-locked loop (SRF-PLL). This algorithm is robust against phase-jumps and variations in the voltage, both representing important features for fault ride-through applications. Also, it automatically detects the operation at different voltage levels without state machines or logic conditions. These features might be of interest in other research fields, where the detection of orbits is important. A comparison with other linear and nonlinear synchronization algorithms showed that MLCO-FLL features important advances. Moreover, in future, it is possible to improve its performance once its characteristics and parameters are examined in detail. Simulations and experimental results obtained from a 15 kW inverter connected to a grid-emulator were used to validate the MLCO-FLL.</description></item><item><title>Three-Switching Surface Nonsingular Terminal Sliding Mode Control for Two-Phase Buck Converters with Load Variations and Uncertain System Parameters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10583941</link><description>To enhance the robustness of two-phase buck converter under load variations and uncertain system parameters, a novel voltage regulation strategy is proposed. The voltage regulation strategy consists of a three-switching surface nonsingular terminal sliding mode controller (TSSNTSMC) to regulate the output voltage and a current controller to equalize the inductor currents. Regarding the TSSNTSMC, the phase plot is divided into four regions by three switching surfaces. Depending on the region in which the sliding variable is located, the TSSNTSMC can directly determine the quantity of high-side switches to be turned on. This approach is beneficial in reducing the internal disturbances. The convergence of the designed controllers is analyzed by the Lyapunov theory. The TSSNTSMC is not affected by the current controller in terms of convergence. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed strategy provides favorable response and disturbance rejection performance under load variations and uncertain system parameters.</description></item><item><title>Event-Triggered Secure Consensus Control for DC Microgrids Under DoS Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10586771</link><description>Distributed control strategy has been widely applied in dc microgrids for better performance, but it is susceptible to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, which can render it ineffective and impact system stability. To this end, this article has proposed a secure consensus control for dc microgrids under DoS attacks, which guarantees bus voltage regulation, current sharing for multiple distributed generation units, and the state of charge balance for multiple distributed energy storage units. Besides, a Zeno-free event-triggered aperiodic communication strategy is proposed to relieve the communication burden of the controller. Based on the Lyapunov method, the stability of the whole closed-loop system is rigorously analyzed and a simplified guideline is provided for control parameters selection and tolerable DoS attack evaluation.

However, the configuration of NMGs is subject to change due to revamping, faults, or privacy issues within each microgrid (MG), and existing control mechanisms cannot realize configurable control with a privacy guarantee. To address this control problem, we offer a fresh perspective on the control framework by proposing a configurable decentralized-distributed control strategy using directed graphs with minimal communication and less privacy disclosure risk. Specifically, one distributed generator (DG) in each MG is designated as the leader to ensure complete privacy protection in a decentralized manner, eliminating the need to exchange information among other NMGs. Follower DGs communicate exclusively with their leader DGs within clusters, enhancing the control performance. Furthermore, by introducing a novel leaky integral control law, the proposed configurable control framework can adapt to different NMG configurations without redesigning controllers. The stability of the entire NMG system is analyzed rigorously. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control framework is demonstrated in solving secondary frequency restoration and active power-sharing problems of NMGs. The experimental test system is built on the OPAL-RT system, and the results show the superiority of our proposed control method under decentralized, distributed, and hybrid NMG configurations.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Two-Stage Benders Decomposition and Dual Dynamic Programming for Hydrothermal-Wind Planning With Intra-Stage Cost Functions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10552437</link><description>The continuous increase of renewable energy sources (RES) brings challenges to electric power system planning, since RES effects must be considered in both short-term dispatch and mid/long-term planning (MLTP). In the latter, immediate or intra-stage cost functions (ICF or ISCF) have been proposed in the literature to provide thermal generation costs for each weekly/monthly stage, to address the uncertainty and high variability of RES without explicitly discretizing the stage in hourly steps. This work proposes a combined two-stage Benders decomposition and dual dynamic programming (DDP) approach to improve the construction and consideration of such ISCF for the MLTP problem. In this case, a set of subproblems considering hourly aspects as load curve, RES intermittency and peak capacity of hydro-generation are iteratively solved in the DDP master problem of each stage, for several scenarios of RES generation profiles, along DDP iterations. Since the discretization points of the ISCF are obtained on demand, this approach yields more accurate ISCF functions, specially in multi-area systems. The methodology is validated for both a tutorial case and a case based on data from the large-scale Brazilian system, where more realistic mid-term policies are obtained when compared to current approaches, with a reduced number of subproblems.</description></item><item><title>Graph Spatio-Temporal Networks for Condition Monitoring of Wind Turbine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10552429</link><description>Condition monitoring of wind turbines (WTs) is essential for advancing wind energy. Existing data-driven methods heavily rely on deep learning and big data, leading to challenges in distinguishing true faults from false alarms, impacting operational decisions negatively. Thus, this paper proposes a spatio-temporal graph neural network framework that incorporates prior knowledge. Prior WT knowledge is utilized by establishing a spatially structured directed graph embedded in a graph attention network (GAT). The features in WTs&#8217; supervisory control and data acquisition system are indicated by the nodes in GAT. Then, the global and local attention embedding layers as well as long short-term memory layers are employed to combine spatio-temporal information from each node. Finally, the condition monitoring in WTs&#8217; graph and node-level are established, and a fault propagation chain at node-level is constructed for explaining condition monitoring results. To demonstrate the explainability, robustness and sensitivity of the proposed approach, a comparative analysis between a true fault case and a false alarm case are given, and anomaly detection results are also reported.</description></item><item><title>Nonlinear Behavior and Transient Stability of Grid-Following Converters Using Direct Power Control Under Weak Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10555420</link><description>Ensuring reliable operation of renewable energy sources requires robust grid-connected converters. Depending on the choice of synchronization methods, grid-connected converters may exhibit distinct nonlinear behavior that plays a vital role in determining their transient stability. Recently, the grid-voltage-modulated direct power control (DPC) has been proposed as an alternative to the conventional phase-locked loop (PLL) to enhance the dynamic response of the grid-following converter (GFLC). However, existing studies have primarily treated the DPC-based GFLC as a linear system. In this paper, we investigate the nonlinear behavior of this converter under weak grids using a large-signal model based on double reference frames. Our findings reveal that the DPC-based GFLC demonstrates sustained oscillation. Interestingly, the stable periodic orbit observed does not arise from a Hopf bifurcation but rather a saddle-node bifurcation of periodic orbits. This critical bifurcation is characterized by the coexistence of a stable periodic orbit and a stable equilibrium point, resulting in a sudden contraction of the converter's stability region. Furthermore, we provide a comparison between the nonlinear behavior of PLL-based GFLCs and DPC-based GFLCs. To validate our findings, we present full-circuit simulations and laboratory experiments.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Functional Integrated Converter for Dynamic Voltage Restoration and Reactive Power Compensation in Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10555312</link><description>Conventionally, parallel-connected or series-connected power quality control devices cannot compensate for both the voltage fluctuation and reactive power simultaneously. To improve the equipment utilization and reliability of the existing power quality control devices, a multi-functional integrated converter (MFIC) is proposed, which can effectively integrate the functions of both dynamic voltage restoration and reactive power compensation. When the grid voltage sags or swells, the MFIC works in the series access mode to achieve voltage regulation function. When the grid voltage is normal, the MFIC works in the parallel access mode to achieve unity power factor operation at the grid side. Compared with the traditional series-connected power quality control device, the MFIC only has one more coupling capacitor, markedly improving the utilization factor of equipment. In addition, the port voltage of the converter module in MFIC is clamped to zero when a short circuit or grounding fault occurs. Meanwhile, a large equivalent impedance is formed to effectively limit the line fault current, which improves the reliability of the MFIC itself and its connected grid as well. Furthermore, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed topology and strategy are verified by simulation and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Power System Decarbonization: A Comparison Between Carbon Taxes and Forcing Coal Power Plant Retirements</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10555380</link><description>The U.S. power system faces a 2035 decarbonization target, though the exact pathway to the target remains unclear. Policy instruments, like carbon taxes and forcing coal plants to retire through various mechanisms, could help achieve the target. It is critical to analyze and compare decarbonization policies as different policies lead to different costs, emissions pathways, and political challenges. In this paper, we explore the ramifications of adopting alternative decarbonization policies. We assume a particular carbon tax to be the benchmark policy and compare it to alternative carbon tax and forced coal retirement policies in terms of emissions and costs. We use a power system dispatch model that co-optimizes unit commitment, energy, and frequency regulation capacity to simulate system evolution over multiple years, including retirements and renewables/storage expansion, under each policy. Our case study highlights the trade-offs between policies. We find that, counter-intuitively, higher carbon taxes do not always achieve lower emissions due to the complexity of dispatch, resulting profits and retirements, and the addition of renewables/storage. In contrast, forced coal retirements result in lower power system costs but higher emissions than the benchmark policy, with a large range of possible outcomes across different retirement cases.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Multistage Distribuionally Robust Programming to Hydrothermal Economic Dispatch With Renewable Energy Sources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10561496</link><description>The multistage solution is very important to achieve optimal hydrothermal economic dispatch considering the uncertainty of renewable energy sources. In data-driven settings, only some historical trajectories are available and the probability distribution is unknown.

Then a data-driven distributionally robust stochastic dual dynamic programming (DDR-SDDP) is proposed to tackle the corresponding computational intractability, where the conditional probability distributions are estimated by using kernel regression. The out-of-sample performances are improved by distributionally robust optimization on a Wasserstein distance-based ambiguity set. Furthermore, a scenario aggregation method is designed to reduce the computational burden. Numerical results for a practical regional power system in China are presented and analyzed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Co-Optimizing Distributed Energy Resources in Linear Complexity Under Net Energy Metering</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10568387</link><description>The co-optimization of behind-the-meter distributed energy resources is considered for prosumers under the net energy metering tariff. The distributed energy resources considered include renewable generations, flexible demands, and battery energy storage systems. An energy management system co-optimizes the consumptions and battery storage based on locally available stochastic renewables by solving a stochastic dynamic program that maximizes the expected operation surplus. To circumvent the exponential complexity of the dynamic program solution, we propose a closed-form and linear computation complexity co-optimization algorithm based on a relaxation-projection approach to a constrained stochastic dynamic program. Sufficient conditions for optimality for the proposed solution are obtained. Numerical studies demonstrate orders of magnitude reduction of computation costs and significantly reduced optimality gap.</description></item><item><title>Control and Power Balancing of an Off-Grid Wind Turbine With Co-Located Electrolyzer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10569094</link><description>Co-locating electrolyzers and offshore wind can significantly reduce the cost of green hydrogen. However, without a grid connection, a new control paradigm is required for the electrolyzer to follow the variable power supplied by the wind turbine. Commercial electrolyzers have power ramp rate limitations, which can result in a mismatch between the wind turbine and electrolyzer power, leading to frequent shutdown and potentially unstable operation. This paper is the first to develop a control system for this off-grid operation with three mechanisms to dynamically balance the power, including energy storage, rotor inertia, and enhanced pitch control. The results show that a $6.8 million supercapacitor is required with a power rating and capacity of approximately 6.7 MW and 8.5 kWh to enable the system to operate through 99% of the annual wind variation. If the electrolyzer ramp rates can be doubled, the same operating hours can be achieved using only control-based power balancing methods at the cost of a marginal reduction in energy production. If commercial electrolyzer ramp rates can be tripled, the system is able to operate without the need for any power balancing.</description></item><item><title>Real-World Scale Deployment of Hydrogen-Integrated Microgrid: Design and Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10571822</link><description>The development and utilization of hydrogen hold the potential to revolutionize new power systems by providing a clean and versatile energy carrier. This paper presents a practical hydrogen-integrated microgrid developed by Xi'an Jiaotong University in Yulin, China. The hydrogen-integrated microgrid features a 1-MW photovoltaic (PV) system and a 640-kW proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system, equipped with a complete set of hydrogen production and supply system, aiming to establish a near-zero carbon multi-energy supply and demand system.

Through real-world implementation and experimental tests, the microgrid system's ability to effectively harness renewable and clean energy sources, produce and utilize hydrogen, and respond to changes in operating conditions is validated. Some discussion on the benefits of integrating hydrogen into microgrids, comparisons with existing microgrids, practical design considerations, and challenges in the microgrid control system is also summarized for reference. The results showcase the potential of hydrogen-integrated microgrid as a key solution in achieving carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals.</description></item><item><title>IBR Power Plant Frequency Control Design Consideration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10579072</link><description>Voltage control is often time provided at the plant-level control of inverter-based resources (IBR). Addition of energy storage systems in an IBR power plant makes it feasible to have frequency control at the power plant level. While frequency control appears as a simple frequency-power droop control to adjust real power commands to inverter-level controls with measured frequency as an input, care must be taken to avoid interactions among the plant frequency control with communication delays, inverter-level control effects, and the frequency sensor, usually a phase-locked-loop (PLL). This paper present two types of interaction scenarios that makes frequency control design challenging. The first interaction scenario may occur if the frequency control's gain is large, while the second interaction scenario may occur at a small control gain if the plant-level PLL lacks sufficient damping. We contribute to the fundamental understanding of the causation of stability issues due to plant frequency control through the derivation of a simplified feedback system focusing on the frequency and power relationship, and the follow-up frequency-domain analysis for gaining insights. For validation, we also design a data-driven approach to obtain models from data generated from an electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation testbed. The findings from analysis have all been validated by EMT simulation. Finally, we contribute to mitigating strategies and also the understanding of the role of additional proportional integration power feedback control. This addition has been demonstrated as an efficient stability enhancement strategy to mitigate the effect of communication delay.</description></item><item><title>Differential Power Processing Based Control Framework for Multiple Battery Energy Storage Systems in DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10579077</link><description>Multiple battery energy storage systems (BESSs) have been widely used in the DC microgrids to balance generation and demand. To achieve this, the BESS converters need to deliver the full required input/output power imposed on BESSs under the conventional BESS-DC bus configuration, which often demands high power ratings for the converters, hence leads to high installation cost as well as high power losses. To reduce the power ratings for BESS converters while delivering the same power from BESSs, this paper proposes a new differential power processing (DPP) based control framework where the DPP techniques and BESSs are firstly combined without losing the following control objectives, namely, the accurate current-sharing and state of charge (SoC) balance of BESSs as well as DC bus voltage regulation. This is achieved first by introducing inverted bidirectional buck converters to function as a front-end converter and DPP converters. Then, a virtual state variable combining BESS output current and its SoC is proposed, based on which a consensus control strategy is proposed. The stability of the proposed DPP-based control framework is also analyzed. Finally, the real-time hardware-in-loop (HIL) tests confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control framework, showing that the proposed DPP-based control framework reduces the power ratings of the converters to less than 20 $\%$ of BESS converters used in conventional BESS-DC bus configuration even in the worst operating scenario, while delivering the same required power from BESSs, paving a way for an innovative BESS DC microgrid design with much down-sized converters for BESSs.</description></item><item><title>Replicating Power Flow Constraints Using Only Smart Meter Data for Coordinating Flexible Sources in Distribution Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10584114</link><description>The increasing integration of distributed energy resources necessitates effective coordination of flexible sources within distribution networks. Traditional model-based approaches require accurate topology and line parameters, which are often unavailable. Neural constraint replication can bypass this requirement, but it relies on complete nodal and branch measurements. However, in practice, only partial buses are monitored, while branches often remain unmeasured. To address this issue, this paper proposes a topology identification-incorporated neural constraint replication to replicate power flow constraints with only partial nodal measurements. Utilizing the additive property of line parameters, we develop a recursive bus elimination algorithm to recover topology and line impedance from power injection and voltage measurements on limited buses. We then estimate missing voltage and branch flow measurements based on the recovered model information. By combining observed and estimated measurements to construct training sets, we train neural networks to replicate voltage and branch flow constraints, which are subsequently reformulated into mixed-integer linear programming forms for efficient solving. Monte-Carlo simulations on various test systems demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed method, even with limited nodal measurements.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Power Tracking Performance and Small Signal Stability Analysis of Integrated Wind-to-Hydrogen System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10582460</link><description>To achieve the 2050 global climate target, offshore wind will increase to meet the growing demand of direct and indirect electrification (e.g. green hydrogen production for the hard-to-abate sector). To keep up with the rapid increase of offshore wind generation, the energy balancing challenges due to the intermittency nature of wind and the network congestion/capacity challenges resulting from structural network capacity planning latency are to be addressed with system integration technology. In this paper, it is proposed that the hydrogen electrolysis plant be co-located with the wind farm, where the power consumption is controlled to track the wind generation profile accurately to cancel the intermittency of wind generation, reduce the required grid connection capacity, and thereby avoid expensive grid expansion. However, this power tracking controller introduces a cross-plant feedback path from the wind farm to the hydrogen plant, posing challenges for partitioning the power tracking loop completely for stability analysis, which also makes it difficult to make a good trade-off between the tracking performance and stability margins. To address this issue, this paper proposes an equivalent transformation to eliminate the cross-plant feedback path. Then, the criteria for choosing the optimal partition method are proposed and examined for different types of partition methods, which are mathematically proven to be equivalent in terms of stability conditions but provide different insights. An optimal partition method is then proposed in this paper, which not only provides clear insight on the ideal and non-ideal power tracking performances but also can also identify the stability issues of different minor loops individually. Finally, the proposed optimal partition method and its valuable insights into power tracking performance and stability analysis are validated through time-domain simulations of a 180 MW integrated wind-to-hydrogen plant with a realistic complexity.</description></item><item><title>Toward on Rolling Optimal Dispatch Strategy Considering Alert Mechanism for Antarctic Electricity-Hydrogen-Heat Integrated Energy System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10582516</link><description>Renewable energy will be the important form of energy supply for future Antarctic scientific research station. This will complicate the dispatch of the Antarctic integrated energy system (IES), due to the harsh operation environment and diverse operation situation of the Antarctic system, especially for the problem of equipment outage caused by extreme weather. To cope with that, a rolling optimal dispatch method considering alert mechanism for Antarctic integrated energy system is proposed in this paper. First, the output of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is characterized by the feasible region and converted into a linear P-H-T model. By introducing the alert mechanism, a rolling optimal dispatch strategy is then established to ensure the security operation of the Antarctic integrated energy system. Furthermore, the normalized multiparametric disaggregation technology (NMDT) is presented to deal with the bilinear terms in dispatching formulation, in which a mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming (MIQCP) is converted into mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Finally, case study is verified on the actual Antarctic energy system. The results indicates that the proposed fuel cell P-H-T model can enhance the flexibility and economy of the operation system. Also the load shedding can be reduced during the emergency operation by developed optimal dispatch strategy, which improves the resilience of IES.</description></item><item><title>Improving Resiliency of Cyber-Dependent Power Distribution Network Using UAVs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10587086</link><description>Resiliency enhancement of the power distribution network (PDN) through restoration is paramount in the face of escalating natural disasters. State-of-the-art literature has centered on augmenting resiliency through network reconfiguration, along with the integration of renewable energy resources (RES) and mobile energy storage systems (MESS). However, these approaches often assume an intact communication infrastructure, a premise that fails to address the damage in the cyber or communication network (CN). This study introduces the integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for wireless communication in the aftermath of communication infrastructure damage. Motivated by this, a comprehensive mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem-based restoration framework is proposed, aiming to elevate PDN resiliency considering a cyber-dependent PDN. This approach encompasses network reconfiguration, MESS, and UAV integration. The proposed method's efficacy is evaluated through rigorous testing and validation on the cyber-dependent IEEE 33 bus system and IEEE 123 bus system. This work pioneers a holistic approach to PDN resiliency, considering communication challenges often overlooked.</description></item><item><title>Fault Current Limiting and Grid Code Compliance for Grid-Forming Inverters&#8212;Part I: Problem Statement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10589298</link><description>Grid-forming (GFM) inverters are controlled to directly regulate the voltage. A major challenge stemming from this control model is that sustaining the voltage during faults would require high currents&#8212;beyond the levels that an inverter can withstand. Various fault current limiting (FCL) methods have been developed in recent years for GFM inverter-based resources (IBRs). The theoretical analysis supported by detailed simulation studies in Part I of this paper investigates whether existing FCL methods for GFM inverters can be deemed feasible solutions for future IBR-centric power grids. The challenges revealed for the first time in this paper are multifaceted and depend on the type of the FCL method. The focus is not only on a GFM inverter's internal operation, but also on its impact on the grid and the practical requirements for grid integration of an IBR considering most recent grid codes. Part II of this paper will address these challenges.</description></item><item><title>Fault Current Limiting and Grid Code Compliance for Grid-Forming Inverters &#8212; Part II: Solution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10589281</link><description>Part I of this paper unveiled various shortcomings of existing fault current limiting (FCL) methods for grid-forming (GFM) inverters. Part II of this paper develops a new FCL method that overcomes these drawbacks. Additionally, the FCL method proposed in this paper follows the strict requirements of recent grid codes for the low-voltage ride-through mode of inverter-based resources (IBRs). This makes the exact response of GFM inverters during faults fully predictable. Such predictability is a prerequisite for the reliable design/setting of protection systems, operation, and planning of power grids with high penetration of IBRs. The paper uses PSCAD simulations to corroborate if the proposed method meets these objectives. It also uses simulation results to compare this new method with existing FCL solutions for GFM inverters.</description></item><item><title>Per-Phase Unsymmetrical Adaptive Derivative Optimized Droop for Mitigating Voltage Quality Issues of Unbalanced Islanded Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10589303</link><description>The proliferation of unbalanced linear and nonlinear loads in microgrids degrades the voltage quality at the inverter terminals, and thus, load terminals receive unbalanced and distorted voltages. To alleviate these voltage quality issues, this paper proposes a per-phase unsymmetrical adaptive derivative optimized droop control scheme for unbalanced islanded microgrids (UIMG). The proposed controller is coupled with a per-phase unsymmetrical virtual impedance (UVI) to mitigate the unbalance of the inverter-based UIMG. Additionally, a proportional multi-resonant (PMR) controller is adopted to compensate for the voltage distortion. To improve the UIMG dynamics response while changing the loading states, derivative terms of active and reactive powers are added to the proposed control. The derivative gains are adaptively updated with the change in the microgrid loading to achieve the desired transient response. The proposed scheme is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem to determine the per-phase unsymmetrical droop settings and UVI that fit different loading states simultaneously. Several case studies are designed to test the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme under different types of disturbances and operating conditions. The cases are conducted on the IEEE 34-bus benchmark power distribution feeder with a combination of unbalanced linear and nonlinear loads. Moreover, the proposed control is validated using real-time simulations carried out in OPAL-RT system. The results show that the proposed control scheme is capable of mitigating voltage quality issues by reducing the voltage unbalance factor and voltage distortion.</description></item><item><title>Design and Tank Testing of Reinforcement Learning Control for Wave Energy Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10592659</link><description>This paper introduces a model-free control strategy utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the electrical power generation of a point absorber wave energy converter (WEC). While model-based methods may suffer from control performance degradation due to modeling errors, such as inherent Coulomb-type friction, RL-based approaches are well-suited for the WEC environment, where system dynamics are complex or unknown. The strength lies in their ability to learn from interactions with the environment, bypassing the necessity for precise models. To enhance the control performance in electrical power generation, a control-oriented loss model is established, and a force penalty term is introduced into the reward function to avoid the WEC system operating in high-loss, low-efficiency regions. To further eliminate the reliance on wave information and improve applicability, an analysis is conducted to examine the contribution of each state feature to the training outcomes and a loss-considering and wave information-independent RL-based control scheme is developed. The RL-based controller is further validated on a point absorber WEC prototype in the wave tank experiment, demonstrating effective implementation and commendable performance in both regular and irregular waves.</description></item><item><title>Towards Improving Unit Commitment Economics: An Add-On Tailor for Renewable Energy and Reserve Predictions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10592660</link><description>Generally, day-ahead unit commitment (UC) is conducted in a predict-then-optimize process: it starts by predicting the renewable energy source (RES) availability and system reserve requirements; given the predictions, the UC model is then optimized to determine the economic operation plans. In fact, predictions within the process are raw. In other words, if the predictions are further tailored to assist UC in making the economic operation plans against realizations of the RES and reserve requirements, UC economics will benefit significantly. To this end, this paper presents a cost-oriented tailor of RES-and-reserve predictions for UC, deployed as an add-on to the predict-then-optimize process. The RES-and-reserve tailor is trained by solving a bi-level mixed-integer programming model: the upper level trains the tailor based on its induced operating cost; the lower level, given tailored predictions, mimics the system operation process and feeds the induced operating cost back to the upper level; finally, the upper level evaluates the training quality according to the fed-back cost. Through this training, the tailor learns to customize the raw predictions into cost-oriented predictions. Moreover, the tailor can be embedded into the existing predict-then-optimize process as an add-on, improving the UC economics. Lastly, the presented method is compared to traditional, binary-relaxing, neural network-based, stochastic, and robust methods.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive Controller of a Hybrid Storage System for Power Smoothing With Enlarged Battery Lifetime</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10596967</link><description>The volatility of grid-coupled photovoltaics can cause local voltage deviations, while the impact on frequency becomes obvious in isolated weak grids. Thus, a standalone battery is usually proposed for smoothing purposes. However, the frequent cycles and abrupt power variations shrink its life and impair control performance. To this end, this study introduces a controller for a hybrid system composed of a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) and a battery. The proposed method establishes an idling zone for battery to eliminate its short-term activity, while SMES handles any power mismatch. The zone limits are dynamically adjusted in case of power balance detection, while an adaptive saturation is applied to them for maximal SMES utilization and minimal battery degradation. When SMES current deviates from this zone, battery operates with an adaptive ramp rate (i.e., di/dt) depending on the state of charge of SMES, to further optimize its life. Additionally, to prevent unnecessary power circulation among SMES and battery, supervisory control loops are implemented. Finally, to evaluate this scheme against preceding controllers regarding battery life extension, a real-time approach is followed using a dedicated simulator, while a hardware-in-the-loop verification is presented using an actual controller.</description></item><item><title>Transient Stability of Synchronous Condenser Co-Located With Renewable Power Plants Under High-Resistance Faults and Risk Mitigation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10599822</link><description>Synchronous condensers (SynCons) are widely used in supporting the integration of renewable power plants (RPPs) in weak grids. However, recent research suggests that a SynCon co-located with RPPs may be prone to transient rotor angle instability due to the excessive active power injected by nearby RPPs during metallic faults. This paper further discovers that the transient stability of the SynCon may be lost even it generates electrical power during high-resistance faults. This novel mechanism of instability is investigated by deriving power-angle characteristics in different fault scenarios, and then the effect of the system parameters on the stability is analyzed via a proposed index based on the critical clearance time (CCT). It reveals that inappropriate parameters of SynCons, weak grid, and voltage support during fault ride-through (FRT) all contribute to such transient instability. To mitigate such instability, an adaptive FRT strategy is proposed. The electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations based on the PSCAD are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis and the proposed adaptive control strategy.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Chance Constrained Optimization Method for Risk-Based Routing and Scheduling of Shared Mobile Energy Storage System With Variable Renewable Energy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10599624</link><description>This paper proposes a pricing and scheduling method for shared mobile energy storage systems (SMSs) in coupled power distribution and transportation networks. Different from existing shared energy storage studies, which mostly focus on stationary resources, the paper investigates the SMS operation considering the negotiation of rental prices as well as mobility and charging/discharging among SMS owners and different users. Specifically, the SMS pricing and scheduling with variable renewable energy are established as a bilevel mixed-integer chance-constrained distributionally robust optimization problem. In the upper-level problem, the SMS owner determines pricing and day-ahead mobility strategy to maximize its payoff. In the lower-level problem, the SMS users, i.e., distribution grid operators, determine the SMS charging/discharging power according to the SMS day-ahead pricing results and intra-day distribution grid operation strategies for accommodating variable renewable energy. The distributionally robust chance constraint is designed to cope with the intra-day operational risk caused by the variability of renewable power generation. To cope with the solution difficulty in the proposed bilevel optimization problem, the chance constraint is reformulated as second-order cone constraints, which are further transformed into a set of linear constraints, and then the reformulated bilevel mixed-integer linear programming problem is decomposed and iteratively solved to avoid enumerating lower-level integer variables. Simulation results show that the utilization rate of SMS batteries is increased and the excess renewable power is fully consumed when SMSs are shared among different distribution grids. The proposed distributionally robust optimization achieves higher revenue for the SMS owner and smaller operating costs of distribution grids than robust optimization under uncertain environments.</description></item><item><title>Reliability Indexes for Variable Energy Resource Generation in IEEE Standard 762-2023</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10602780</link><description>IEEE Standard Definitions for Use in Reporting Electric Generating Unit Reliability, Availability, and Productivity has recently been revised to extend the standard to variable energy resource (VER) generating facilities.

Thus, an adjustable robust tri-level defender-attacker-defender (ART-DAD) model is proposed to improve the resilience of power systems by hardening critical transmission lines. The proposed ART-DAD model considers both uncertain attacks and uncertain wind power output, which provides meaningful insights into the resilience improvement of power systems that involve uncertainties. More specifically, the proposed defense model integrates dynamic N-K criterion for attack budgets and the polyhedral uncertainty set for wind power output to develop resilient line hardening strategies. The proposed defense model can be formulated as a mixed integer tri-level programming problem that is decoupled into a master and sub-problem. Then, a constraint-generation based solution algorithm is proposed to solve the overall ART-DAD model with a master and sub-problem scheme. Simulation results on IEEE RTS-79 and RTS-96 systems validate the effectiveness of the proposed resilience improving strategy.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Multi-Mode Single-Step Power Tracking for Microinverter-Based Photovoltaic System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10612237</link><description>The conventional de-load power tracking algorithm, utilizing a perturb and observe method, manifests deficiencies in terms of speed, stability, and efficacy in identifying operating points within the inverter's voltage range.

However, existing data-driven methods cannot be applied to new wind farms due to the lack of operational data. This paper presents a novel Bayesian deep learning-based adaptive wind farm power prediction (BDL-AWFPP) method, which is the first time to utilize the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation results as the prior of BDL-based method, thus avoiding the problem that data-driven approaches cannot be applied to newly constructed wind farms. Firstly, a CFD-based wind farm numerical simulation database and a wind turbine power curve database are established to construct a multi-source heterogeneous prior dataset. Then, the BDL-AWFPP model is proposed to utilize the multi-source heterogeneous prior dataset, which can be updated adaptively with newly acquired operational data and saved periodically throughout the life cycle. And an auxiliary aging assessment method for wind turbines is also developed according to the periodically-saved models. Finally, a stochastic variational inference (SVI)-based parameter updating algorithm is derived for the proposed BDL-AWFPP model. Case studies on an actual wind farm validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Net-Zero Scheduling of Multi-Energy Building Energy Systems: A Learning-Based Robust Optimization Approach With Statistical Guarantees</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10620675</link><description>Buildings produce a significant share of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, making homes and businesses a major factor in climate change. To address this critical challenge, this paper explores achieving net-zero emission through the carbon-aware optimal scheduling of the multi-energy building integrated energy systems (BIES). We integrate advanced technologies and strategies, such as the carbon capture system (CCS), power-to-gas (P2G), carbon tracking, and emission allowance trading, into the traditional BIES scheduling problem. The proposed model enables accurate accounting of carbon emissions associated with building energy systems and facilitates the implementation of low-carbon operations. Furthermore, to address the challenge of accurately assessing uncertainty sets related to forecasting errors of loads, generation, and carbon intensity, we develop a learning-based robust optimization approach for BIES that is robust in the presence of uncertainty and guarantees statistical feasibility. The proposed approach comprises a shape learning stage and a shape calibration stage to generate an optimal uncertainty set that ensures favorable results from a statistical perspective. Numerical studies conducted based on both synthetic and real-world datasets have demonstrated that the approach yields up to 8.2% cost reduction, compared with conventional methods, in assisting buildings to robustly reach net-zero emissions.</description></item><item><title>Deriving Sufficient Conditions for Exact Relaxation of Complementarity Constraints in Optimization Problems With Energy Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10629239</link><description>Energy storage is becoming increasingly important in power and energy systems. However, its strongly nonconvex complementarity constraints, which prevent simultaneous charging or discharging behavior, hinder its application in optimization-based decision making. One remedy is to relax these constraints, but the existing relaxation methods are specific to power system applications with limited universality. To bridge this gap, we provide a methodology to derive the general form of sufficient conditions for the exact relaxation of a general energy storage-concerned optimization problem (ESCOP). Specific sufficient conditions for a wide range of ESCOPs can be easily accessed via the proposed methodology. This paper provides mathematical proofs and analyses of the proposed conditions, where sufficient conditions obtained from specific forms of ESCOPs are numerically validated to guarantee exact relaxation and significantly improve the ESCOP solution efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Joint Electricity and Carbon Sharing With PV and Energy Storage: A Low-Carbon DR-Based Game Theoretic Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10623777</link><description>This paper proposes a joint electricity and carbon sharing framework with photovoltaic (PV) and energy storage system (ESS) for deep decarbonization, allowing distributed PV prosumers to participate in a sharing network established by aggregator of prosumers (AOP). The ESS-equipped AOP plays multiple roles as a carbon aggregator, an ESS operator, and an energy-sharing provider at the same time. First, a demand response (DR)-based model that incorporates the multi-strategy of ESS is proposed to optimize energy-carbon transaction. A low-carbon DR with consideration of electricity-carbon coupling is developed to incentivize prosumers to adjust consumption behavior for costs and emissions reduction. Second, a joint optimization based on Stackelberg game is proposed, where AOP is leader, and prosumers act as followers. A dynamic pricing mechanism is proposed for AOP to determine the electricity-carbon coupled selling and buying prices simultaneously. Meanwhile, prosumers would adjust their energy consumption as response to different sharing prices. In addition, a distributed optimization algorithm with interactions is used to reach the Stackelberg game equilibrium. Finally, through a practical testing case, the effectiveness of the method is validated in terms of economic benefits and PV sharing enhancement, as well as the reduction of carbon emissions.</description></item><item><title>Cooperative Planning of Multi-Energy System and Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10631701</link><description>Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) can play critical roles in transitioning to global net-zero emissions. However, existing works only focus on small-scale or local CO2 utilization. For the first time, this paper proposes a cooperative planning model of multi-energy system and CCUS considering the regional CO2 availability. In this model, the multi-energy system and CCUS are coupled through interconnected energy hubs. To leverage its inherent operational dispatchability and flexibility, the physicochemical and thermo-electrochemical processes of CCUS are mathematically formulated with source-sink matching analysis. The multi-energy planning is a demanding optimization challenge owing to its inherent nonconvexities and substantial energy-interest couplings. The original problem is firstly relaxed as mixed integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) to ensure satisfactory computational efficiency. A carbon-oriented bargaining problem can then be reformulated to share the cooperative surplus, which is further decomposed into a joint investment/operation subproblem and a cost-sharing subproblem. The proposed methodology is benchmarked over interconnected energy hub systems to show its effectiveness and superiority in technical, economic, and environmental aspects.</description></item><item><title>Semi-Peer-to-Peer Safety Coordination Control for Distributed Battery Energy Storage System in DC Microgrids via Saturated Limitation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10631704</link><description>This paper presents a semi-peer coordination control strategy to ensure the bus voltage stability and effectively constrain the power trajectory, thereby mitigating safety concerns arising from excessive unit power and communication failures in distributed battery energy storage systems (DBESS) based DC microgrids. Firstly, the primary controller is employed a saturated feedforward design to maintain bus voltage stability and address the excessive part of power allocation with droop control. The saturation results enable flexible switching of the reference state, allowing energy storage units (ESUs) to autonomously transition between voltage tracking and power tracking modes. Secondly, the dual-dynamic power allocation strategy is introduced with distributed consensus and saturation allocation.The power allocation with distributed consensus aims to achieve synchronous proportional charging and discharging for SOC balancing. For the offline ESUs of communication failures, saturation power allocation is designed with arrived operation point to avoid the over-utilization of offline ESUs. To address potential communication failures in offline ESUs, the saturation power allocation strategy based on the current operational point is devised to mitigate the risk of over-utilization of offline ESUs. Finally, simulations and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>An Equitable Active Power Curtailment Framework for Overvoltage Mitigation in PV-Rich Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10636072</link><description>There are various active power curtailment (APC) approaches to mitigate overvoltage. In PV-rich networks, the overvoltage happens to be especially at the end of the distribution feeders. While APC helps maintain voltage within operational limits, it results in varying degrees of renewable curtailment for each prosumer. This curtailment increases as the distance from the transformer grows. Hence, these approaches introduce unfairness among prosumers. This study proposes an equitable APC (EAPC) based on the prosumer's self-consumption rate (SCR). The method calculates each prosumer's SCR, compares it with the precalculated critical SCR, and calculates a fair share of curtailment for each prosumer. Subsequently, leveraging the voltage sensitivity matrix obtained from the inverse of the Jacobian matrix, the new active power injection at the point of common coupling (PCC) is calculated to mitigate the overvoltage. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, a comparison with three other methods is presented under various PV penetration levels. The proposed EAPC is less sensitive to the prosumer's location and improves fairness among prosumers. In addition, a battery deployment scenario is analysed considering the annual supply and demand balance to suppress the extra curtailment introduced by EAPC without increasing the battery capacity.</description></item><item><title>Shape Optimization of a Point Absorber Wave Energy Converter for Reduced Current Drag and Improved Wave Energy Capture Using Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638322</link><description>The shape of the floating buoy of a point absorber wave energy converter (WEC) plays a crucial role in both wave energy harvesting and current drag reduction. In this study, an approach to optimizing the buoy hull geometry with a neural network that replaces the hydrodynamic analysis software is presented, aimed at reducing the ocean current drag force while improving wave energy captured. A new parametric model is introduced to describe the complex shape of the buoy by utilizing the control points of non-uniform rational b-splines. A neural network is developed to significantly reduce the computational time compared to traditional hydrodynamic simulation methods. The optimal hull shape of the buoy is determined by solving an optimization problem using a genetic algorithm, a global optimization technique. The results of the case studies show that the optimal buoy hull shape reduces 68.7% and 71.1% of the current drag, and 50% of mooring line forces compared to the cylinder-shaped buoy and the optimal-power-shaped hull from literature. The optimal buoy hull shape increases the wave energy extraction by 46.1% compared to the thin-ship-shaped buoy but performs 21.1% worse than the optimal-power-shaped hull from the literature.</description></item><item><title>Electric Energy Maximization for Oscillating Water Column Wave Energy Systems Using a Receding-Horizon Pseudospectral Control Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10636763</link><description>Among the various wave energy technologies, oscillating water columns (OWCs) have shown some of the greatest promise, due to their simplicity of operation and possibility for shore mounting, with consequent ease of access and integration with other infrastructure, such as breakwaters. To minimize the levelized cost of energy, OWC energy capture must be maximized. To date, most focus has been on maximizing air turbine efficiency, while neglecting other aspects of the system. This paper presents an integrated wave-to-wire optimal control approach, considering the OWC hydrodynamics, turbine characteristics, and generator. The approach is based on a receding-horizon pseudospectral formulation, which transcribes the continuous-time optimal control problem into a finite-dimensional nonlinear program. The results show optimal exploitation of the hydrodynamic, aerodynamic, and electric subsystem efficiency characteristics, surpassing the electric energy production available through a specific focus on turbine efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Comparative Evaluation of Converter Control Impact on Torsional Dynamics of Type-IV Grid-Forming Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10637722</link><description>This paper explores the impact of back-to-back converter control strategies on the torsional dynamics of grid-forming permanent magnet synchronous generator wind turbines (GFM-WTs). Two general converter control methods for GFM-WTs, distinguished by the placement of dc-link voltage control (DVC)&#8211;either in the machine-side converter or the grid-side converter, are evaluated through the complex torque coefficient method to offer a theoretical basis. It reveals that a negative damping is introduced when the DVC is with the machine-side converter. Then, to further characterize the parametric impacts of electrical and mechanical system constants and controller gains, the sensitivity analysis is performed by employing the partial derivative algorithm, which is based on the feedforward neural network training. It is found that the converter control has a limited impact on the damped frequency in both GFM converter control methods. Finally, electromagnetic simulations based on full-order nonlinear models of GFM-WTs are carried out to confirm the theoretical findings.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive Transfer Learning Framework for Data-Scarce HVAC Power Consumption Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10637762</link><description>Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems constitute a large proportion of building energy consumption and provide considerable potential for power grid regulation. While the HVAC power consumption forecasting task is generally straightforward with sufficient historical data, it becomes challenging when dealing with scarce data. Such situation is common in cases of intermittent data collection or early system implementations, where precise forecasting is required despite limited data available. Considering accessible datasets from nearby or similar HVAC systems through energy management systems, this paper proposes an adaptive transfer learning framework to tackle this issue. Specifically, the framework leverages diverse source domains, employing model-level regularizers to quantify domain discrepancies and an adaptive parameter regulation mechanism to dynamically align source domains with the target domain. Embedded within the framework, a unique deep learning architecture with attention mechanisms is proposed, capable of identifying complex temporal patterns and hierarchical features in HVAC systems. Experiments on public HVAC datasets demonstrate the generalization, accuracy and robustness of our methodology under diverse data-scarce scenarios.</description></item><item><title>A Novel GAN Architecture Reconstructed Using Bi-LSTM and Style Transfer for PV Temporal Dynamics Simulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10601515</link><description>The stochastic production simulation of photovoltaic (PV) power is crucial for the analysis of power balance in power planning, annual or monthly operational planning, and long-term transactions in the electricity market, especially in power systems with a high share of PVs.

However, existing LFO analyses lack the consideration of microgrids&#8217; required rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) and steady-state active power-frequency (P-f) characteristics when designing the VSG&#8217;s inertia and damping. With these practical considerations, this paper reveals that the interactions between VSGs can cause significant LFOs, posing a threat to the microgrid&#8217;s stability. In contrast, the LFOs related to the interactions between SGs are less pronounced. To this end, a distributed LFO damping (DLFOD) control is proposed to suppress the LFOs between VSGs from two aspects: the adjustment of the VSG&#8217;s phase angle mitigates the uneven instantaneous active power sharing, while the adjustment of the VSG&#8217;s active power setpoint enhances the mutual damping. Compared with existing methods, the proposed DLFOD control 1) pertains to multi-bus microgrids, 2) guarantees the RoCoF and steady-state P-f characteristics, and 3) possesses a linear structure. Furthermore, a dynamic switching variable is devised to handle the disconnection and reconnection of communication links or VSGs, which enables the DLFOD control to remain partially functional during these interruptions. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated through theoretical analysis, real-time simulations, and experiments.</description></item><item><title>Parameter Boundary Characterization for DC Microgrid Islanding Detection Based on Time-Domain Voltage Oscillation Trajectory Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10571933</link><description>Unintentional islanding events cause potential threats to the safety of dc microgrids. Selected frequency islanding detection is considered a promising technology thanks to its good power quality and high detection accuracy. However, the conventional frequency-domain-based islanding detection parameter boundary cannot consider the impact of detection time, which causes a quite slow detection speed and thus leads to detection failure. To overcome this obstacle, a linear model of the islanding dc system is developed first to analyze the steady-state response of the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC). On top of that, the components of the islanding system characteristic equation are analyzed based on modal analysis, which lays a good foundation for simplifying the time-domain response model of the PCC voltage. Then, the oscillation trajectory of the PCC voltage triggered by the islanding event is characterized in the time domain, which facilitates the analysis and calculation of islanding detection time. Furthermore, the boundary of the islanding detection parameters considering the detection time effect is accurately depicted to guide the resonator design. In this manner, the effect of resonant parameters on the detection time can be evaluated visually while the fast detection speed is also ensured. Finally, the proposed method is validated in simulations and hardware-in-loop experiments.</description></item><item><title>Research on Generic Diagnostic Methods for Short-Circuit Faults in AC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10580987</link><description>Micro grid fault of rapid detection and removal is the key to ensure its reliability. With the access of many distributed generations (DG) to the system, the characteristics of short-circuit faults of microgrids in grid-connected and islanded modes have changed, and the traditional protection methods can no longer be applied to both operating modes of microgrids simultaneously. Due to the advantages of wavelet energy spectrum in the identification of the mutation characteristics of the weak signal as well as that of neural network in the location accuracy, this paper proposes a short circuit fault detection and protection method in AC microgrids. The method takes the current at the detection point as the object of analysis, uses the wavelet energy spectrum transform to analyze the current waveforms under normal and fault operation states, and extracts the fault characteristic quantities. At the same time, considering the effect of transition resistance, a generalized fault area identification model for both grid-connected and islanded modes is established by using a neural network algorithm. Simulation and experimental results show that this method can realize accurate judgment and area location of short-circuit faults in different modes, different DG capacities, different fault types and different fault regions.</description></item><item><title>A Comprehensive Review of High-Frequency AC Microgrids for Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10586271</link><description>Continuous advancements in distributed generation, energy storage, electric vehicles, and industrial modernization have forced the electrical distribution system to operate efficiently and controllably. To address these challenges, in addition to ensuring efficient bidirectional power flow while minimizing power losses, a comprehensive grid restructuring is crucial. The deployment of a high-frequency AC (HFAC) microgrid has emerged as a feasible solution, offering the potential to establish a reliable and efficient energy supply that aligns with the demands of the current distribution landscape. This necessitates thorough planning and operational assessments. However, parallel operations of the current HFAC involve multiple power conversion stages. This review outlines insights, challenges, opportunities, and recommendations for future HFAC research directions. The practical feasibility of the HFAC microgrid is tested on a typical IEEE-33 bus system in MATLAB/Simulink by incorporating AC-AC converters and their switching modulation techniques. The promising simulation results and existing research demonstrate that the HFAC microgrid architecture works well, illustrates the need and benefits in the context of the distribution system compared with the existing traditional system, and has possibilities for further extension with multiple case studies. This review can serve as a substantial foundation for researchers in HFAC microgrids to pave the way for promoting energy efficiency to unprecedented heights.</description></item><item><title>A Global Optimal Benchmark for Energy Management of Microgrid (GoBuG) Integrating Hybrid Energy Storage System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10614145</link><description>This paper proposes a general benchmark for evaluating online/real-time energy management strategies (EMS) for microgrids (uG) supported by hybrid energy storage systems (HESS). A multi-objective optimal control problem with multiple control/state variables, multiple control/state constraints, and multiple boundary conditions is introduced to reduce power losses, prevent the HESS from oscillations, and increase source lifespan, which is handled by using an alternative Pontryagin&#8217;s minimum principle and inheriting finite difference methods. On that foundation, the multi-objective Global optimal Benchmark for uG (referred to as GoBuG) is constructed and assessed via several numerical scenarios, including a real case study of a uG located in B&#7841;ch Long V&#297; island, Vi&#7879;t Nam. The assessment shows that GoBuG is tens of times faster than conventional methods like dynamic programming when computing EMS in the islanded uG with a single battery ESS. Moreover, for uG consisting of HESSs, while dynamic programming is unable to provide solutions, GoBuG remains superior with high accuracy, reliability, and speedy computation. With its superior performance, the proposed GoBuG is therefore compatible with benchmarking purposes for general uG systems.</description></item><item><title>An Improved Probe Power Unit (PPU)-Based Fault Location Estimation in Low-Voltage DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10553240</link><description>Good accuracy in estimating the exact fault location in low-voltage DC microgrids (LVDC MGs) reduces the time for fault restoration, power outage and maintenance. Off-line active fault location determination in low-voltage DC microgrid has an advantage of using sufficient information for analysis and reliable decision making. This paper proposes a parametric estimation-based fault location using a more accurate computation of the natural oscillating frequency. The proposed algorithm considers the advantage of both time as well as frequency domain analysis. Peak fittings of the probe current in time domain and exact resonating frequency in the Fourier magnitude spectrum, are used to find out the accurate natural oscillating frequency of the fault path. The proposed fault location technique is tested for various fault conditions of the LVDC network on MATLAB/Simulink environment and provides improved performance even in presence of noise in the measured probe current. The proposed algorithm is found to be robust for different line parameters and network topology of the LVDC network, ensuring an accurate and reliable protection measure for the LVDC network.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Voltage Control to Coordinate Multiple PV Inverters as a Cluster</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10582911</link><description>Dynamic voltage support is a critical ancillary service in electric power networks, and with the increasing penetration of inverter-based renewable energy resources such as solar photovoltaics (PV), utilizing their idle capacity to provide dynamic voltage support is becoming indispensable.

Based solely on the measured input/output data of the controlled system, the proposed method dynamically linearizes the controlled system through online identification. Subsequently, a data-driven cooperative adaptive controller is designed to coordinate multiple PV inverters as a cluster. The method can effectively regulate the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC) of the controlled PV cluster with adaptability to system changes. The stability of the proposed control method is theoretically clarified. Numerical simulation using MATLAB/Simulink shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Coordinated Islanding Partition and Scheduling Strategy for Service Restoration of Active Distribution Networks Considering Minimum Sustainable Duration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10609444</link><description>This paper presents a coordinated islanding partition and scheduling strategy for service restoration of active distribution networks (ADNs) to maximize weighted restored energy considering the minimum sustainable duration (MSD) of controllable islands (CIs). To avoid the forming of uncontrollable islands, the concept of dominated buses is proposed and integrated into the topological model of ADNs for islanding partition. The co-optimization of mobile distributed generator (MDG) dispatch and dominated bus identification is carried out to accelerate the restoration process. The MSD of CIs is explicitly modeled, and the CIs are scheduled in a risk-adjusted way, whose conservatism can be adjusted by controlling the predefined risk confidence level. Interruptible loads are considered as flexible resources in the islanding partition strategy considering the effects of the MSD of CIs. To improve the practicability of the presented method, time-varying power demands and distributed renewable generation outputs are incorporated into the presented framework. The studied problem is formulated as a mixed-integer second-order cone programming model, which can be efficiently solved by commercial solvers. Finally, a modified version of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company 69-bus distribution system, a practical medium-voltage distribution system in Denmark, and a modified IEEE 123-bus distribution system are employed to demonstrate the performance of the developed model.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Risk-Averse Optimal Dispatch for Integrated Power and Transportation System Considering Carbon Trading</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10556757</link><description>With the global climate change, the significance of carbon emission reduction is widely recognized. As an effective tool for emission reduction, carbon trading needs to be considered in the operation of the integrated power and transportation system (IPTS). This paper proposes a distributed risk-averse optimal dispatch scheme for IPTS considering carbon trading. First, a carbon trading framework for IPTS is developed, in which the microgrids (MGs) within the power distribution system (PDS) and the electric vehicle agent (EVA) of the transportation system (TS) jointly participate in the carbon trading market. Furthermore, the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) method is used in the proposed scheme to manage the risks arising from diverse uncertainties, including power load, renewable power generation, traffic demand, and carbon price. To protect the privacy of the PDS and TS and improve computational performance, the spectral penalty parameter based alternating direction method of multipliers (S-ADMM) distributed solution method is developed to solve the IPTS dispatch model. Numerical results on two test systems illustrate the economic and carbon reduction benefits, risk management ability, and computational performance of the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>Supervised Optimization Framework for Charging and Discharging Controls of Battery Energy Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10561610</link><description>Although residential houses have widely adopted battery energy storage (BES) in conjunction with solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, it has been challenging to optimize BES controls owing to the uncertainty inherent in electricity prices, renewable energy resources, and electricity demand loads. The main objective of this study is to propose a supervised optimization (SO) framework designed to enable supervised learning to infer efficient BES operations in conjunction with mathematical optimization. Based on the proposed SO framework, a mathematical optimization model is formulated and solved to generate optimal charging and discharging controls given historical data in an offline optimization fashion. Then, a supervised learning model can be trained based on the optimal charging and discharging controls to infer efficient BES charging and discharging controls in an online optimization fashion. Specifically, an objective function and constraints driven by the mathematical optimization model are reflected in the course of training and inferring by supervised learning models so that the SO framework can infer feasible and efficient BES controls. Numerical experiments are conducted with data collected from a residential community in Texas, and the results reveal that the proposed SO framework results in better performance compared to the benchmark model, such as reinforcement learning and model predictive control.</description></item><item><title>Asynchronous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-Based Framework for Bi-Level Noncooperative Game-Theoretic Demand Response</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10566880</link><description>Demand response (DR) is proposed to address the uncertainty of distributed energy resources (DER) and energy storage systems in distribution networks. However, current research neglects the temporal relationships and the noncooperative relationship of demand response participants. A novel bi-level non-cooperative Stackelberg-Nash dynamic game-theoretic framework is proposed in this paper, specifically designed to address the issue of overlooking consumers&#8217; interests and temporal relationships of participant actions in traditional demand response frameworks. Within this innovative framework, an asynchronous multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed and named as Stackelberg-Nash multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm (SN-MAPPO). SN-MAPPO allows utility company (UC) and consumers to maximize their utilities within the proposed framework, ultimately leading to the convergence of UC and consumers&#8217; strategies to Stackelberg-Nash equilibrium. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, simulations are conducted using authentic data, involving one UC and eight power consumers. Simulation results confirm that the proposed demand response mechanism, while safeguarding consumers&#8217; benefits, fosters the integration of distributed energy resource and effectively mitigates load fluctuations.</description></item><item><title>Eliminating Distribution Network Congestion Based on Spatial-Temporal Migration of Multiple Base Stations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10571587</link><description>The integration of high proportions of distributed energy resources and the soaring development of 5G base stations (BSs) could lead to operational issues such as grid congestion in distribution networks. Meanwhile, 5G BSs can also serve as the flexible resources to support the distribution network. In this regard, this paper proposes a novel method to eliminate distribution network congestion with spatial-temporal migration of multiple base stations (BSs). First, the collaborative structure of the distribution network operator (DNO) and mobile network operator (MNO) is presented and the event-driven congestion management framework of the distribution network with multiple BSs is illustrated. Secondly, the specific spatial-temporal migration models of multiple BSs are established, which contain traffic migration, BS sleeping, and dispatchable capacity of the BS backup energy storage system.

Finally, the modified IEEE 33-node and IEEE 123-node distribution system are adopted for case studies, from numerical analysis we can draw that, the proposed congestion management method can alleviate the congestion issue of the distribution network effectively while reducing costs of both DNO and MNO.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Preserved Aggregate Thermal Dynamic Model of Buildings</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10577505</link><description>The thermal inertia of buildings brings considerable flexibility to the heating and cooling load, which is known to be a promising demand response resource. The aggregate model that can describe the thermal dynamics of the building cluster is an important interference for energy systems to exploit its intrinsic thermal inertia. However, the private information of users, such as the indoor temperature and heating/cooling power, needs to be collected in the parameter estimation procedure to obtain the aggregate model, causing severe privacy concerns. In light of this, we propose a novel privacy-preserved parameter estimation approach to infer the aggregate model for the thermal dynamics of the building cluster for the first time. Using it, the parameters of the aggregate thermal dynamic model (ATDM) can be obtained by the load aggregator without accessing the individual&#8217;s privacy information. More specifically, this method not only exploits the block coordinate descent (BCD) method to resolve its non-convexity in the estimation but investigates the transformation-based encryption (TE) and the secure aggregation protocol (SAP) methods to realize privacy-preserved computation. Its capability of preserving privacy is also theoretically proven. Finally, simulation results using real-world data demonstrate the accuracy and privacy-preserved performance of our proposed method.</description></item><item><title>POMDP-Based Dispatch Scheme for Residential Distributed Energy Resources Under Customer Fatigue Consideration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10577471</link><description>With rapidly growing penetration of renewable energy, there is an increasing need for real-time balance in the power system. In recent years, as a vital component of the end user side, residential distributed energy resources (RDER) have shown promising prospects in demand response (DR). This paper addresses the RDER optimal dispatch problem from an online learning perspective. The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and the logistic regression model are employed to describe how the DR service contractor learns the uncertain response model of the customer affected by the fatigue and recovery effect. A non-stationary combinatorial multi-armed bandit paradigm is applied to dispatch RDER. In addition, we use the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) technique to estimate the customer&#8217;s unobservable states. Through simulations based on public datasets, our proposed Greedy-MLE and CUCB-MLE policies for dispatch decision-making outperform existing methods in relative power adjustment mismatch, collective fatigue, and cumulative regret. The simulation results highlight the benefits of the proposed RDER dispatch approach in ensuring customer satisfaction, service quality, and economic efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Robust Coordinated Planning of Multi-Region Integrated Energy Systems With Categorized Demand Response</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10606443</link><description>In this paper, categorized demand response (DR) programs are proposed to address the coordinated planning problem in multi-region integrated energy systems (MRIESs). The categorized DR programs comprise a discrete manufacturing production model for industrial areas, a real-time pricing-based DR program for commercial areas, and diverse operational tasks for various electrical appliances in residential areas. Subsequently, the detailed DR model is leveraged to minimize the operation cost and gas emissions in a renewable-integrated MRIES considering the uncertainties from wind and solar power. Then, a flexible adjustable robust optimization (FARO) approach is presented to deal with all uncertainty sources. The FARO approach aims to ensure the safe operation of the MRIES against any uncertainty while meeting predefined performance objectives. Furthermore, a bi-level solution algorithm is designed by combining the stochastic dichotomy method and the column-and-constraint generation (C&amp;amp;CG) algorithm to solve our coordinated planning model. Finally, case studies are conducted on a practical MRIES in Changsha, China. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the categorized DR programs in adjusting allocable resources to maximize holistic system profits. Besides, compared to the commonly used information-gap decision theory (IGDT) method, our FARO approach can maintain the optimality of the solution while reducing conservatism.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Frequency Control of Heterogeneous Energy Storage Systems Considering Short-Term Ability and Long-Term Flexibility</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10659173</link><description>Renewable energy sources introduce more fluctuations into the power system and bring challenges to maintain the system stability. Conventional generation units are gradually replaced and may soon become inadequate to meet the frequency regulation (FR) requirements. Consequently, demand-side resources for FR have received increasing attention. Among demand-side sources, inverter air conditioners (IACs) have huge regulation capacity and account for nearly 40% of the total power consumption in summer, while energy storage systems (ESSs) excel in rapid response and powerful ramp rate. However, the inadequate ramp speed of IACs and the insufficient regulation capacity of ESSs render them incapable of providing FR independently. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a distributed coordinated control algorithm that allows the effective utilization of ESSs and IACs to provide FR considering the respective advantages. Firstly, an equivalent thermal energy storage model of IAC in alignment with ESS is introduced considering heterogeneous parameters. Subsequently, a coordinated control framework is proposed for heterogeneous ESSs (hetero-ESSs), which are composed of ESSs and IACs. Based on the framework, a distributed consensus algorithm is devised for hetero-ESSs, and its stability is demonstrated through the application of the Lyapunov theorem. Finally, numerical studies verify that the proposed framework can promote ESSs&#8217; short-term ability and IACs&#8217; long-term flexibility.</description></item><item><title>Alleviating the Curse of Dimensionality in Minkowski Sum Approximations of Storage Flexibility</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10576684</link><description>Many real-world applications require the joint optimization of a large number of flexible devices over time. The flexibility of, e.g., multiple batteries, thermostatically controlled loads, or electric vehicles can be used to support grid operation and to reduce operation costs. Using piecewise constant power values, the flexibility of each device over d time periods can be described as a polytopic subset in power space. The aggregated flexibility is given by the Minkowski sum of these polytopes. As the computation of Minkowski sums is in general demanding, several approximations have been proposed in the literature. Yet, their application potential is often objective-dependent and limited by the curse of dimensionality. We show that up to  $2^{d}$  vertices of each polytope can be computed efficiently and that the convex hull of their sums provides a computationally efficient inner approximation of the Minkowski sum. Via an extensive simulation study, we illustrate that our approach outperforms ten state-of-the-art inner approximations in terms of computational complexity and accuracy for different objectives. Moreover, we propose an efficient disaggregation method applicable to any vertex-based approximation. The proposed methods provide an efficient means to aggregate and to disaggregate energy storages in quarter-hourly periods over an entire day with reasonable accuracy for aggregated cost and for peak power optimization.</description></item><item><title>Continuous Approximate Dynamic Programming Algorithm to Promote Multiple Battery Energy Storage Lifespan Benefit in Real-Time Scheduling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10586215</link><description>This paper aims to promote the lifespan benefit of multiple battery energy storage (BES) in real-time scheduling.

Numerical analysis demonstrates the validity of the proposed scheduling model, and superior computation tractability and solution optimality of the proposed PLFC-ADP algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Attention-Enhanced Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Against Observation Perturbations for Distributed Volt-VAR Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10587051</link><description>The cloud-edge collaboration architecture has been widely adopted for distributed Volt-VAR control (VVC) problems in active distribution networks (ADNs). To alleviate the computation and communication burden on edge sides, centralized training &amp; decentralized execution (CTDE) based multi-agent reinforcement learning methods have been proposed. However, the performance of these methods relies heavily on the agents&#8217; coordination mechanism and accurate observations. Given access to a vast amount of distributed energy resources, it becomes increasingly challenging to achieve efficient coordination within CTDE framework. Furthermore, the agents&#8217; observations always involve perturbations such as measurement noises and even cyber-attacks in real-world ADNs, which can significantly degrade the distributed VVC performance and may cause severe security issues. In this paper, we propose an attention-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning method to address observation perturbations for distributed VVC. In our proposed method, a mix network on the cloud platform with an agent-level attention mechanism is used to approximate the global reward, successfully capturing the intercorrelations between agents and achieving excellent coordination. A novel robust regularizer is also designed to enhance the agents&#8217; robustness facing the observation perturbations, which greatly improves the applicability of reinforcement learning methods. Numerical simulations on IEEE test cases with real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Secondary Voltage Control for DC Microgrids: A Design Perspective for SoC With Voltage Restoration Provision</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10609424</link><description>The energy management system (EMS) secondary voltage control design, integrating state-of-charge (SoC) equalization and droop control in redundancy-based dc microgrids (MGs), is ideal for vehicles, aircraft, and medical centers with sensitive loads. This paper proposes secondary voltage restoration in a dc MG to enhance S-shaped functions for SoC equalization among battery energy storage system (BESS) units. The dc MG topology is a cascaded bidirectional Cuk converter (CBC) linked to a cascaded bidirectional boost converter (CBB), both sharing two BESS units.

Additionally, a fuel cell (FC) is connected to the CBC dc-link. The EMS for coordinating BESS and FC is modified by secondary voltage control to maintain the dc-link voltage at the set-point. Initially, the redundancy-based dc MG operates with voltage secondary control for the EMS, with infinity norm and Lyapunov&#8217;s indirect method ensuring the stability analysis. Finally, the validation process is conducted integrating the SpeedGoat and dSPACE platforms.</description></item><item><title>A Distributed Privacy-Preserving Framework With Integrity Verification Capabilities for Metering Data and Dynamic Billing in a Malicious Setting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10609448</link><description>Smart metering enables near-real time collection of customer energy consumption data by Electrical Service Providers (ESP). Access to this granular metering data raises privacy concerns, hindering global adoption of the smart grid. Aggregation-based frameworks aim to address these concerns, but suffer from several limitations such as, a high computational overhead on smart meters, architectural complexity, and vulnerability to single points of compromise. Distributed aggregation-based frameworks show promise, but often assume an unrealistic semi-honest threat model, a lack of integrity verification capabilities for metering data, and dynamic billing (Time Of Use) capabilities. This paper introduces a distributed framework in a malicious setting that provides integrity verification of metering data while preserving customer privacy. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed framework is the first attempt to include integrity verification capabilities of metering data and dynamic billing in a distributed data collection setting while considering a malicious adversary. A proof of concept demonstrates our proposed framework&#8217;s viability and performance against other frameworks. Our framework is shown to be lightweight on smart meters, resilient to cyberattacks, and more efficient, compared to competing techniques in the literature.</description></item><item><title>A Semi-Decentralized Real-Time Charging Scheduling Scheme for Large EV Parking Lots Considering Uncertain EV Arrival and Departure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10580944</link><description>Developing large commercial electric vehicle (EV) parking lots to support the rapid EV adoption arouses interest in optimizing their real-time charging schedules with enhanced economic efficiency. This problem has been studied in literature via fully centralized or decentralized schemes, i.e., EV charging schedules are solely determined by the parking lot central operator or individual chargers, confronting the dilemma of scalability and parking-lot-wise economic optimality. This paper studies a semi-decentralized real-time charging scheduling scheme, in which the central operator and individual chargers collaborate to achieve optimal EV charging schedules. Specifically, the central operator uses a chance-constrained model to estimate aggregate charging energy needs in a rolling process at a coarse time granularity, while considering uncertainties of aggregate arrival and departure EV charging demands via a Gaussian mixture model; with the estimated aggregate charging energy, the central operator further calculates charging energy references of individual chargers regarding their distinct charging urgency and discharging availability; each charger finally determines the actual charging power by leveraging the charging dynamics, EV departure uncertainty scenarios, and charging energy reference at a fine time granularity. The economics and efficiency of the proposed scheme are evaluated by comparing it to various forms of fully centralized schemes via numerical simulations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme, with proper settings on the charging urgency factor, time granularity, and discount factor, significantly enhances efficiency in the minute-wise charging scheduling of large-scale EVs at the slight cost of compromised revenue.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Method for Estimating Inertia of a PV-Integrated Power Grid for Enhanced Security</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10592076</link><description>The decommissioning of traditional thermal power plants with high levels of renewable energy resources (RES) always causes a reduction in system inertia. A hybrid power grid must maintain stable frequency during severe disturbances. Therefore, this study provides a generalized approach for estimating the online grid inertia under normal and disturbed operating conditions. Large-scale deployment of photovoltaic (PV) power generation is considered to replicate the rapid growth of RES and its impact on actual power grids. The individual inertia of existing conventional synchronous generators in the hybrid system is quickly estimated using the online recursive least square (RLS) method. A Kalman filter is used to reject any noise contained in the measured signals. The noise-free rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) and electrical power are further used to refine the estimation of inertia, damping coefficient, and mechanical power to enhance the overall accuracy of the proposed tracking scheme. Next, the virtual inertia of the existing PV system is derived mathematically from the identified model parameters, which are further verified using simulation results, thereby demonstrating the robustness of the proposed approach. Finally, the spectral cluster-based method is used to determine the sets of coherent machines and provide online tracking for each coherent group&#8217;s inertia, as well as the total grid inertia in response to different disturbances and intermittency of RES power generation. The proposed inertia estimation method is proven to be very fast, allowing preventative action to be taken before any instability occurs.The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested and verified using IEEE 39-bus, 68-bus, an islanded AC microgrid, as well as a modified IEEE 39-bus based MTDC test system.</description></item><item><title>Peer-to-Peer Energy Transactions for Prosumers Based on Improved Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10571970</link><description>With the evolution of the power market, the active involvement of prosumers in both consuming renewable energy and maximizing financial gains has emerged as a pivotal and compelling trend in the prospective landscape of energy market development. However, the optimal energy trading strategy for prosumers under a complicated peer-to-peer (P2P) market environment is still a great challenge, due to the incomplete information and large decision space. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an improved deep deterministic policy gradient (IDDPG) algorithm to optimize the P2P energy trading and operation strategy for prosumers. The proposed IDDPG algorithm uses a wave-attention network to model the external interactive environment of each prosumer to simplify the complexity of multi-agent trading environment. Moreover, a priority sampling mechanism is proposed to learn valuable experiences purposefully and adopts a cyclic learning rate to avoid local optimality. Finally, the feasibility of the method is verified by the case study of P2P trading with different scales of prosumers. The numerical results show that the proposed IDDPG algorithm outperforms the traditional reinforcement learning algorithms in both calculating efficiency and convergence, and provides a reference for the P2P transaction strategy of prosumers.</description></item><item><title>A Dynamic and Static Combined State Recovery Method Against FDI Attacks in Power Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10564142</link><description>The widespread integration of information technology into power systems increases their vulnerability to false data injection (FDI) attacks, where attackers can mislead the power system state estimator to produce incorrect results. Consequently, it is critical to identify the attack and recover the real system state of the power grid. The primary method of state recovery is to derive the real state from measurements covered by the static measurement protection (SMP) methods, which are expensive to apply. The dynamic reactance perturbation (DRP) methods are low-cost but may fail in some conditions to detect attacks due to the topology limitation. In this paper, we propose a dynamic and static combined defense (DSCD) method, which combines the DRP and SMP methods to identify attacks and enhance the resilience of the state estimator at a lower cost. First, we propose the framework of DSCD and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for recovering the system state. Second, we develop a non-convex optimization model to implement DSCD and propose heuristic algorithms under two extreme scenarios. Using these algorithms, defenders have the flexibility to balance between cost and delay. Simulation results on four IEEE test systems validated the superior performance of the proposed DSCD method.</description></item><item><title>Barrier-Function Adaptive Finite-Time Trajectory Tracking Controls for Cyber Resilience in Smart Grids Under an Electricity Market Environment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10566851</link><description>The advancement and proliferation of digitalization and communication infrastructure have facilitated the rise of real-time bidding markets in smart grids. In these dynamic markets, energy distribution companies and power-generating companies interact to establish energy exchange contracts based on offered prices. However, the fluctuation in power flow resulting from contract changes within the real-time bidding market introduces a potential vulnerability that malicious attackers can exploit to launch successful stealthy attacks. To enhance the smart grid resiliency against cyber-attack in the power market bidding environment, a new barrier-function adaptive finite-time trajectory tracking control is proposed in this paper. The developed controller is utilized to actively counteract and mitigate potential cyber-attacks to ensure their rejection and prevention. The stability analysis convincingly demonstrates the rapid convergence of system states within a finite time frame, empowering the system to effectively reject cyber-attacks in real-time. Test results of an IEEE test systems, considering governor dead bound nonlinearity and communication time delay are presented and compared with those obtained from other methods to ensure and demonstrate the performance of proposed method. The Speedgoat real-time target machine, along with Simulink real-time, validates the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Blockchain-Based Authentication Scheme for Energy Trading in Electric Transportation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10580954</link><description>Authentication between Electric Vehicle (EV) users and Battery Charging/Switching (BCS) stations is a significant problem for energy trading. Although there are many existing authentication schemes, cross-domain authentication for EV users and BCS stations from different domains (such as different regions, companies, manufacturers) has not been well addressed; several blockchain-based cross-domain authentication schemes have more than 11 times communication rounds and involve over 4 times exponentiation, scalar multiplications and bilinear pairing cryptographic operations; this leads to high communication and computational costs. This work aims to tackle this problem by using blockchain and certificate-based public-key cryptography. It proposes an authentication scheme that uses a blockchain ledger to record authentication materials across different domains. A two-stage smart contract is designed and deployed to verify the authentication materials before storing them permanently in the blockchain. A novel certificate-based authenticated key establishment (CB-AKE) protocol is proposed to authenticate EV users and BCS stations. Based on the theoretical analysis and practical evaluation on the security and performance, the proposed scheme can well address the cross-domain authentication problem with acceptable cost. Compared to benchmark schemes, the authentication latency of CB-AKE is decreased by at least 25% and the throughput of CB-AKE is increased by at least 34%.</description></item><item><title>Data-Enabled Modeling and PMU-Based Real-Time Localization of EV-Based Load-Altering Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10586268</link><description>Recently, the integration of electric vehicles (EVs) and their associated electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) has increased significantly in smart grids. Due to the cyber vulnerabilities of this EV ecosystem, such integration makes the entire grid prone to cyberattacks, which can result in the outage of generators or even blackouts. On this basis, this paper leverages a data-enabled predictive attack model (DeeP-AM) to design an EV-based dynamic load-altering attack (EV-DLAA) that targets the frequency stability of the grid. Subsequently, a robust localization framework for the developed EV-DLAAs is proposed using power system measurements obtained from phasor measurement units (PMUs). First, frequency measurements in the transmission grid are used to develop an optimal EV-DLAA without having perfect knowledge of the grid&#8217;s topology. Such an optimal attack model ensures that the targeted frequency deviation is reached by utilizing the least number of EVs and a minimized time of instability (ToI). Then, a PMU-based real-time localization framework is developed based on the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) method, which simultaneously estimates the magnitude and location of EV-DLAAs. The equations obtained from the SINDy method are effectively solved using a modified basis pursuit de-noising (MBPDN) approach. This approach enhances the accuracy and robustness of the localization framework, particularly when confronted with noise. The attack implications and the localization performance are evaluated using the New England 39-bus and Australian power systems.</description></item><item><title>Anomaly Observer-Based Cyber-Resilient Torque Control Against Hybrid Attacks in Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10599829</link><description>Inspired by the continued focuses on renewable energy cybersecurity issues, this paper aims to propose a cyber-resilient torque control framework for wind turbines to defend against the hybrid attack. The cyber threat model is established combining denial-of-service and data manipulation attacks, which attempts to destabilize the wind turbine system by implementing the attacks on the communication link from the rotor speed sensor to the controller. Particularly, the impact of hybrid attack is analyzed and classified into two cases, and the corresponding compensatory measures are developed. To mitigate the impact of the hybrid attack and stabilize the wind turbine system, a cyber-resilient torque control scheme combining zero-order holder and anomaly observer is proposed, which requires simple computational ability of the wind turbine system. Using the Lyapunov theory, the control target of optimal rotor speed tracking is guaranteed and the tolerable attack range under the proposed method is derived. Extensive studies are carried out on a 1.5 MW doubly-fed induction generator-based wind turbine, and the simulation results indicate that the proposed control strategy could effectively reduce the impacts caused by the hybrid attack.</description></item><item><title>PAP: A Privacy-Preserving Authentication Scheme With Anonymous Payment for V2G Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10613000</link><description>Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) networks, as an emerging smart grid paradigm, can be integrated with renewable energy resources to provide power services and manage electricity demands. When accessing electricity services, an electric vehicle  $\left ({{\mathcal {E}\mathcal {V}}}\right)$  typically provides authentication or/and payment information containing identifying data to a service provider, which raises privacy concerns as malicious entities might trace  $\mathcal {E}\mathcal {V}$  activity or exploit personal information. Although numerous anonymous authentication and payment schemes have been presented for V2G networks, no such privacy-preserving scheme supports authentication and payment simultaneously. Therefore, this paper is the first to present a privacy-preserving authentication scheme with anonymous payment for V2G networks (PAP, for short). In addition, this scheme also supports accountability and revocability, which are practical features to prevent malicious behavior; minimal attribute disclosure, which maximizes the privacy of  $\mathcal {E}\mathcal {V}$  when responding to the service provider&#8217;s flexible access policies; payment binding, which guarantees the accountability in the payment phase; user-controlled linkability, which enables  $\mathcal {E}\mathcal {V}$  to decide whether different authentication sessions are linkable for continuous services. On the performance side, we implement PAP with the pairing cryptography library, then evaluate it on different hardware platforms, showing that it is essential for V2G applications.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Blockchain-Based Data Aggregation Scheme With Privacy-Preserving on the Smart Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10612996</link><description>With the development of smart grid, the introduction of blockchain technology provides a novel idea for secure power data sharing. The existing blockchain-based data aggregation schemes generally rely on a unique leader node to perform verification algorithms, but there may be a lazy leader node not performing aggregation data verification to save computation costs. In addition, in the existing verification mechanism, light nodes need to perform the same verification operations as the leader node, which results in resource-constrained light nodes being unable to bear. In this paper, we propose an efficient blockchain-based data aggregation scheme with privacy-preserving on the smart grid, called EC-ASPG, which implements a supervised mechanism for the lazy leader node, enhancing the security of the system. Furthermore, we propose a separable consensus verification mechanism, which can prevent other light nodes from performing duplicate verification operations like the leader node, effectively improving the efficiency of consensus verification. Finally, we present a formal security proof and comprehensive performance evaluations. The results show that our scheme is secure and outperforms the compared schemes in terms of performance analysis.</description></item><item><title>LLRA: A Lightweight Leakage-Resilient Authentication Key Exchange Scheme for Smart Meters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10623401</link><description>The authentication between smart meters and Neighbourhood Area Communication Network (NAN) gateways is a critical issue due to various types of side channel attacks. To address this, a new protocol called Lightweight Leakage-Resilient Authentication Key Exchange (LLRA) was proposed for smart meters. LLRA incorporates continuous after-the-fact leakage-resilient property. Furthermore, extended BPR (CLR-eBPR) security model and extended GNY (CLR-eGNY) logic were introduced. Through provable security analysis, logic analysis, and practical performance evaluations, we demonstrated that LLRA effectively mitigates side-channel attacks while maintaining minimum authentication delay and energy consumption for the computing devices used in smart meters and NAN gateways. Compared to benchmark protocols, the authentication delay of LLRA was decreased by at least 14%; in addition, the energy consumption of LLRA was decreased by at least 7%.</description></item><item><title>Detection of Malicious Command Injection Attacks Against Static Var Compensators in Smart Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643841</link><description>In a smart grid, voltage control and reactive power control are crucial to its safe and reliable operation. Static Var compensators (SVCs) are widely used to achieve these controls in a transmission system, either through centralized control by Energy Management Systems or through local closed loop control systems. In smart grids, the command channels to control SVCs are vulnerable to cyber attacks. In this paper, attack scenarios involving injection of malicious commands to SVCs are studied in detail. Attack models are established for both methods of control. Based on these attack models, two detection algorithms are proposed. The principle behind these algorithms involves the notion that even though an adversary can manipulate the commands and measurements related to SVCs, it is nearly impossible to hide the effect on other state variables and measurements in the system. The algorithms are developed mathematically using electrical quantities, making these schemes independent of the underlying Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) used. The rationale behind the choices made during the development of the algorithms are proven formally. Finally, two algorithms are formally proposed, which are easy to implement and computationally less intensive, when compared to iterative and multi-stage algorithms. These algorithms are then tested on various test-cases on the IEEE 118-bus system and found to be effective.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Optimal Power Flow for Multi-Agent Active Distribution Networks: A Differentially Private Consensus ADMM Algorithm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10659236</link><description>In multi-agent active distribution networks, the information exchanges in the ADMM algorithm for the decentralized distribution-level optimal power flow (D-OPF) may expose sensitive load flows of tie-lines across adjacent agents. This may be overheard by adversarial agents for business competition. To preserve this privacy, this paper proposes a differentially private consensus ADMM (DP-C-ADMM) algorithm, which can offer a mixture solution of both realistically optimal generator outputs and obfuscated-but-feasible load flows of tie-lines. And  $\epsilon -$ differential privacy holds for load flows of tie-lines across agents over iterations. Case study justifies the theoretical properties of this algorithm up to specified privacy parameters.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Charging Scheduling and Speed Control for Delay-Bounded Drone Delivery</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10637488</link><description>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have demonstrated success in delivering goods, but their delivery distances are limited due to their finite battery capacity. While roadside charging stations can replenish the battery, they cause delays and prevent timely delivery. In this paper, we present a novel UAV charging scheduling and speed control framework that optimizes the decisions on flight speed and charging schedule at roadside charging stations to achieve timely and energy-efficient goods delivery. The approach we take is to first formulate a finite-horizon Markov decision process (FH-MDP) problem and then analytically and rigorously reveal the underlying structure of the optimal solution to the problem. Specifically, a FH-MDP is put forth to minimize the energy requirement of the UAV while guaranteeing timely delivery at the destination. We analytically reveal an underlying monotone deterministic Markovian policy, asserting that the optimal charging time and speed are monotonic regarding the distance remaining and the time elapsed. We also show that the optimal charging time and speed change only when the UAV reaches the derived distance- and time-related thresholds. Simulations also show that our approach can extend the flight distance of the UAV by at least 19.8% under our simulation setting, compared to the benchmarks.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Energy Management Strategy for Battery Electric Vehicles: Incorporating Cell Balancing and Multi-Agent Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Architecture</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10598364</link><description>This paper introduces a real-time multi-objective adaptive Energy Management Strategy (EMS) based on a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) architecture.

Furthermore, it achieves a final state of charge (SOC) within a mere 0.3% deviation from the Dynamic Programming (DP) approach. The EMS excels by effectively balancing battery cells and optimizing temperature, mitigating long-term battery aging. Importantly, it outperforms the highest reported SOC value in the 2021 Motor Vehicle Challenge while satisfying all specified criteria.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Communication Network for Electric Vehicles Aggregation and Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10646585</link><description>The hierarchical aggregation and control of electric vehicles (EVs) is an effective way to promote the consumption of clean energy and ensure the balance of power demand-supply. In the case of increasingly insufficient wireless resources of cellular networks, one challenging problem is how to guarantee the real-time and accurate service interaction requirements of massive services in EV aggregation response. In this paper, in order to support the communication process of EV hierarchical aggregation and control, a hierarchical communication network architecture of &#8220;Central cloud- Regional cloud- Edge unit- EVs&#8221; is proposed. Considering the differences of service processing functions and communication demands of each layer, the utility function models are constructed to describe the different demands on the timeliness and accuracy. And based on the utility functions, a network communication resource allocation model is established to allocate power and channel resources on demand. Finally, to reduce the amount of computation, this paper proposes the joint allocation algorithm of power and channel resources based on the improved water-filling algorithm, adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm and two-sided matching theory. The simulation experiment results illustrate that the total utility of the proposed algorithm is increased by 0.43 times on average compared with the channel average allocation (H-A), and 0.08 times compared with the layer-by-layer optimization (H-NJO).</description></item><item><title>User-Centric Cooperative Transmission in Intelligent Reflecting Surface Assisted Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10602527</link><description>The intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) exhibits notable benefits in flexibility, low power consumption, and cost-effectiveness, offering a promising prospect for extensive deployment. However, the performance of the IRS-assisted networks can be hindered by double path-loss fading, resulting in limited serving region and IRS selection constraints. Therefore, it becomes imperative to propose a more rational network architecture that surpasses the current limitations of IRS. This paper proposes a user-centric IRS group cooperative serving scheme, which integrates the benefits of user-side IRS selection and multi-IRS cooperative transmission, and establishes a comprehensive system-level performance analysis framework under the proposed scheme via stochastic geometry. Specifically, IRS cooperative group is decided by an adjustable radius $C$ centered on each user and the IRSs within this circle collaborate to provide services to the user. The average signal strength under cooperative transmission approximated via moment matching, where we propose a general framework to calculate the high order moments of combined channel of IRS-reflected paths as a random sum. In addition, our proposed architecture exacerbates the irregularity of network topology, and more accurate interference Laplace functions by quantifying the irregular interference partitioning are obtained. Numerical results demonstrate that under our proposed user-centric IRS group cooperative serving scheme, the coverage probability can be improved by 3.66x when signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) equals to 0 dB, compared to traditional network with no IRSs.</description></item><item><title>A Joint Design for Full-Duplex OFDM AF Relay System With Precoded Short Guard Interval</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10621622</link><description>In-band full-duplex relay (FDR) has attracted much attention as an effective solution to improve the coverage and spectral efficiency in wireless networks. Considering the residual self-interference (RSI) at the FDR, the overall equivalent channel can be modeled as an infinite impulse response (IIR) channel. For this IIR channel, a joint design for precoding, power gain control and equalization of cooperative OFDM relay systems is presented. Compared with the traditional OFDM systems, the length of the guard interval for the proposed design can be distinctly reduced, thereby improving the spectral efficiency. By analyzing the noise sources under the single relay with single antenna scenario, this paper theoretically evaluates the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the proposed scheme and presents a power gain control algorithm at the FDR for the cases of with and without direct link. With the direct link considered, the FDR transmission system can be regarded as a $2\times 1$ virtual MISO system and the proposed scheme can achieve a diversity order of two. Furthermore, the proposed FDR system is generalized to multiple relay nodes and multiple antennas at each node. Simulation results show the proposed scheme achieves 5.7 dB and 2.9 dB gains compared with the traditional OFDM method with the same guard interval length in the Rayleigh fading condition and Rician fading condition at BER = $10^{-3}$, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Full-Duplex Cooperative NOMA Network With Multiple Eavesdroppers and Non-Ideal System Imperfections: Analysis of Physical Layer Security and Validation Using Deep Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10598216</link><description>In this work, we consider a full-duplex (FD) relay-assisted cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (FD-CNOMA) network and examine the physical layer secrecy (PLS) performance with multiple non-colluding eavesdroppers, considering residual self-interference (RSI) at the FD relay, residual hardware impairments (RHI) at the transceivers and imperfect successive interference cancellation conditions. Initially, we develop analytical equations for the secrecy outage probabilities (SOPs) of the downlink users and the system SOP (SSOP) of the FD-CNOMA network. It is observed that the users suffer notably higher SOPs and exhibit zero-diversity order, leading to an outage floor in the high transmit power regime. In order to enhance the PLS performance, we suggest a jamming-assisted (JA) framework and evaluate the SOPs and the SSOP through analytical and simulation studies. In comparison to the network without a jammer, the suggested JA framework greatly lowers the SSOP and the SOPs, while the diversity order is enhanced to unity, provided both RHI and RSI are negligible. We also develop a deep neural network (DNN) framework for accurate and fast prediction of SOPs and SSOP, that can overcome the limitations of the intricate mathematical modelling approach. For further improving the PLS performance, we determine optimal transmit powers for the users at the BS and at the relay that separately minimizes the SSOP of the JA-FD-CNOMA network. The findings indicate that, in comparison to equal/random power allocation approaches, the suggested approach leads to a significant reduction in SSOP and SOPs and a notable improvement in system secrecy throughput (SST) and secrecy energy efficiency (SEE).</description></item><item><title>Average Energy Detection With Adaptive Threshold for Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10598350</link><description>Spectrum sensing (SS) based on energy detection (ED) is a simple yet effective approach to detect the presence of unknown signals that are active in a specific band of frequencies. The classical ED (CED) algorithm uses the value of the energy detected in the current sensing slot as test statistic and has a fixed threshold, but improved signal detection performance is possible by modifying the test statistic and/or the detection threshold. In this paper we propose a novel ED algorithm for SS that considers a binary activity model for the signal to be detected and combines the use of an average energy test statistic with an adaptive decision threshold for improved detection performance. We present the analytical characterization of the proposed test statistic in terms of its mean and variance, and derive the expressions corresponding to the correct decision probability (CDP) and false alarm probability (FAP). Using the derived CDP and FAP expressions, we also determine the detection thresholds that yield desired values for the false alarm and missed detection probabilities. The proposed algorithm is illustrated with numerical results obtained from simulations, which confirm our theoretical findings and also show that the algorithm outperforms alternative adaptive ED algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Intelligent Reflecting Surface vs. Conventional Full-Duplex Relay in mmWave MIMO Networks: A Comprehensive Performance Comparison</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10598369</link><description>This article aims to provide a comprehensive performance comparison between intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) and conventional full-duplex (FD) relays, making it clear under which conditions and with what protocols, the performance boundaries are achieved by the two methods. We target millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input-multiple-output networks that are key players for the next generation mobile communication and consider the scenarios where an IRS or a FD relay is adopted to establish transmission links between two terminals that may suffer from blocked direct channels. In the comparison, both amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward relaying schemes are considered. Furthermore, practical power consumption models for IRS and FD relay are built. Aimed at maximizing the energy efficiency, we optimize the element/antenna sizes, active/passive beamforming and power allocation for IRS-aided and FD relay-aided systems, respectively. Our numerical results show that the superiority of each relaying scheme highly depends on the carrier frequency. Though IRSs exhibit lower spectral efficiency than active relays, this gap could be narrowed by decreasing the carrier frequency. Moreover, IRSs' energy efficiency is higher than that of active relays at sub-6 GHz. Specially, when the transmission/receiving gain of transceivers is very high, IRSs can further achieve higher energy efficiency at mmWave band. Compared to amplify-and-forward relays, decode-and-forward relays exhibit better performance in general, however, increasing transmit power can substantially enhance the performance of amplify-and-forward relays. Finally, we apply our conclusion to the relevant works to reveal the reasons for their seemingly conflicted findings.</description></item><item><title>Energy Efficiency Optimization of FBMC/OQAM-Based Massive MIMO Systems Subject to Electromagnetic Exposure Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10599856</link><description>The performance of offset-quadrature-amplitude-modulated filter bank multi-carrier (FBMC/OQAM) waveform based on massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is investigated considering not only the transceiver's classic metrics, but also the health concerns associated with exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF). Closed-form expressions are obtained for the lower-bounds on the uplink spectral efficiency (SE) for FBMC/OQAM-based Massive MIMO systems with both the maximum ratio combiner (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) receivers, in the face of realistic imperfect channel state information (CSI). Subsequently, by employing our closed-form SE expressions, a framework is developed for maximizing the global energy efficiency (GEE) of the proposed FBMC/OQAM-based system subject to both power and EMF exposure constraints. A nested quadratic-transform (NQT)-based approach is proposed next for maximizing the non-convex GEE objective by first approximating it as a concave-convex function and then by applying the quadratic transform. Subsequently, a low-complexity iterative algorithm is developed that sequentially applies the Lagrangian dual transform, quadratic transform and Dinkelbach's transform to obtain a closed-form solution of the GEE optimization problem formulated. Our simulation results verify the analytical SE expressions and also demonstrate the improved GEE of the proposed FBMC-based massive MIMO systems subject to the EMF exposure limits.</description></item><item><title>Ergodic Secrecy Capacity Analysis for RIS-Aided Wireless Powered Communication System Under Different Phase Shifting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10606085</link><description>This paper investigates the physical layer security (PLS) of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided wireless powered communication (WPC) system, where an energy-limited user first harvests energy from a hybrid access point (HAP) and then uses the harvested energy to transmit information in the presence of a passive eavesdropper. In particular, four phase shifting designs at RIS are considered, i.e., imperfect continuous phase shifting, perfect continuous phase shifting, imperfect discrete phase shifting, and perfect discrete phase shifting. To reveal the impact of four phase shifting designs on the secrecy performance of system, we analyze the ergodic secrecy capacity (ESC) and derive new closed-form expressions. Then, the asymptotic ESC is derived to gain useful insights. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the imperfect continuous phase shifting has the same ESC performance with the imperfect discrete phase shifting, while the ESC of perfect continuous phase shifting is similar to that of perfect discrete phase shifting. Besides, the ESC firstly increases and then decreases with the increasing time switching factor, and each phase shifting design has a different optimal time switching factor. Moreover, RIS aided WPC system under four phase shifting designs outperforms the traditional WPC system without the aid of RIS under high transmission power, verifying the superiority of using RIS to enhance the secrecy performance.</description></item><item><title>Unsupervised Power Allocation Based on Combination of Edge Aggregated Graph Attention Network With Deep Unfolded WMMSE</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10603410</link><description>To address the challenge of optimizing power distribution within ad hoc wireless networks, deep learning techniques have been employed to navigate the complexities of evolving network topologies and variable channel characteristics. Moreover, there's an anticipation for the deep learning model to unearth more generalized and distinct features. In this paper, we introduce the Unsupervised Power Allocation based on Attentive Graph Representation (UPAR) method. UPAR combines an Edge Aggregated Graph Attention Regression Network (EGRN) with Deep Unfolded Weighted Minimum Mean Square Error (DU-WMMSE) within an unsupervised learning framework. Initially, EGRN leverages an attention mechanism and Gate Recurrent Units (GRU) to amalgamate features from adjacent nodes and their connecting edges, enhancing the identifiability and generalization of the graph's features. Subsequently, DU-WMMSE applies unsupervised learning to refine these graph features through regression training, transforming WMMSE iterations into efficient, interpretable layers within the neural network. This process introduces adjustable parameters, employing both feed forward and back propagation phases during end-to-end training. The proposed method significantly narrows the solution space for the objective function, accelerating the training process and enhancing the efficiency of the deep learning model. Simulation results confirm the UPAR method's superior performance and adaptability across a variety of scenarios.</description></item><item><title>UAV-Assisted Wireless Networks: Mobility and Service Oriented Power Allocation and Trajectory Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10603393</link><description>In this paper, we consider a downlink wireless network assisted by single unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in an area with no-fly zones (NFZs), where there are multiple moving users with diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements to be served. In addition to the cylindrical NFZs, we also modeled and analyzed the polygonal NFZs that are common in reality but seldom investigated in research. We aim to maximize the sum-rate of all user by jointly optimizing the power allocation and trajectory design of the UAV under the constraints on the limited power resource, the QoS requirements of users and the NFZs evasion for UAV. Since the formulated joint optimization problem is non-convex, to deal with it, we design a low-complex iterative scheme based on the proposed modified water-filling algorithm, the successive convex approximation (SCA) technology, disjunctive programming and penalty functions. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly increase the system sum-rate while ensuring the QoS requirements of all users, reasonably evading the NFZs and adapting well to the real-time mobility of uses.</description></item><item><title>Electric Vehicle Cluster Assisted Multi-Tier Vehicular Edge Computing System: Cross-System Framework Design and Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10603416</link><description>Cooperative vehicle infrastructure is critical for facilitating multi-tier vehicular edge computing (VEC) systems to collaboratively process latency-sensitive intelligent tasks. However, the dynamic topology and the scarcity of available computing resources on real traffic roads pose significant challenges. While previous works have explored using public transit and parked vehicles as cooperative vehicles, they often overlook the incentive mechanisms and the specific tasks of these vehicles, rendering these solutions impractical. Motivated by the achievements in smart electric vehicles (EVs), this paper presents an electric vehicle cluster (EVC) assisted multi-tier VEC system that leverages the capabilities of the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology to provide stable computing resources to traffic areas. The proposed EVC-assisted multi-tier VEC system employs a cross-system two-level optimization method that jointly considers offloading and resource allocation decisions for road task vehicles (RTVs) in the VEC system and charging power decisions for the EVs in the EVC. At the lower level, we minimize the task latency for RTVs by utilizing the computing resources of idle EVs. At the upper level, we build a multi-agent two-step game model and introduce a potential game-based strategy and a Nash equilibrium (NE) based EV-RSU mapping method to derive the optimal decision strategy for the EVC. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the efficient reduction in total-task latency of RTVs and lower cost for the EVC while meeting the essential requirements in the V2G.</description></item><item><title>Communication-Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning via Joint Knowledge Distillation and Differential Privacy in Bandwidth-Constrained Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10618889</link><description>The development of high-quality deep learning models demands the transfer of user data from edge devices, where it originates, to centralized servers. This central training approach has scalability limitations and poses privacy risks to private data. Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed training framework that empowers physical smart systems devices to collaboratively learn a task without sharing private training data with a central server. However, FL introduces new challenges to Beyond 5G (B5G) networks, such as communication overhead, system heterogeneity, and privacy concerns, as the exchange of model updates may still lead to data leakage. This paper explores the communication overhead and privacy risks facing the implementation of FL and presents an algorithm that encompasses Knowledge Distillation (KD) and Differential Privacy (DP) techniques to address these challenges in FL. We compare the operational flow and network model of model-based and model-agnostic (KD-based) FL algorithms that enable customizing per-client model architecture to accommodate heterogeneous and constrained system resources. Our experiments show that KD-based FL algorithms are able to exceed local accuracy and achieve comparable accuracy to central training. Additionally, we show that applying DP to KD-based FL significantly damages its utility, leading to up to 70% accuracy loss for a privacy budget $\epsilon \leq 10$.</description></item><item><title>Optimized Federated Multitask Learning in Mobile Edge Networks: A Hybrid Client Selection and Model Aggregation Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10596975</link><description>Clustered federated multitask learning is introduced as an effective strategy, specifically designed to tackle statistical challenges, including non-independent and identically distributed data among clients. This is achieved by clustering clients based on a similarity in their data distributions and assigning a specialized model for each cluster. However, this approach encounters complexities when applied in hierarchical wireless networks due to hierarchical two-level model aggregation and resource-based client selection. This results in a slower convergence rate and deprives clients of the best-fit specialized model for those having similar data distribution from different mobile edge networks. To this end, we propose a framework comprising two-phase client selection and two-level model aggregation schemes designed for IoT devices and intelligent vehicles. For client selection, the cloud ensures fairness among all clients by providing them with equal priority to participate in training, contributing to more accurate clustering. Once a particular cluster reaches a stopping point, the related edge server performs two client selection methods separately, greedy and round-robin. The greedy algorithm prioritizes clients with less latency and superior resources, while the round-robin algorithm allows for cyclic participation in training. The cloud then executes model aggregation in two distinct ways: one based on reaching pre-determined aggregation rounds (round-based model aggregation) and the other by performing at least one split at the edge servers (split-based model aggregation). We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our proposed approach. Our results show that the proposed algorithms significantly improve the convergence rate, minimize training time, and reduce energy consumption by up to 60% while providing every client with a specialized model specifically attuned to its data distribution.</description></item><item><title>Power Allocation Game Between Multiple Statistical MIMO Radar Networks and Multiple Jammers Based on Mutual Information</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654577</link><description>This article investigates the power allocation problem between multiple statistical multiple-input multiple-output(MIMO) radar networks and multiple jammers. Specifically, the main objective of multiple statistical MIMO radar networks is to maximize the mutual information(MI) between the received signal and the path gain matrix under power constraints, whereas the jammers aim to minimize the MI. Based on the theory of Stackelberg game, multiple statistical MIMO radar networks and the jammers are taken as the leader, respectively, and the power allocation problem between the opposing players is effectively solved by using the Lagrange multiplier method. In addition, we derive the existence and uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibria. Finally, we provide simulation results and compare the performance with other algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Energy Management for UAV-Enabled VR Systems: A Tile-Based Collaboration Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10603411</link><description>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been envisioned as a promising technology to support wireless virtual reality (VR) applications. However, the huge energy consumption during the rendering process is challenging for UAV-enabled VR systems. The existing energy management strategies neglecting the dynamic and tiling features of VR tasks may not achieve optimal performance. To cope with these issues, we present a dynamic energy optimization framework for UAV-enabled VR systems. In the proposed framework, a tile-based collaborative rendering scheme for multi-UAVs is developed by exploiting the correlation among different tiles of VR users. Further, we formulate an optimization problem by jointly considering the collaboration decision, resource allocation, and UAV trajectory, aiming to reduce the long-term energy consumption under the motion-to-photon (MTP) latency requirement. Due to the tight coupling variables and the dynamic factors, the formulated problem is non-convex and difficult to tackle by adopting the traditional method. To this end, we first decompose the original problem into two sub-problems, i.e., the UAV trajectory and collaboration decision (UTCD) problem, and the resource allocation (RA) problem. Then, we design a dynamic UTCD algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and present an optimal RA algorithm based on the Lagrangian multiplier iterative (LMI) method. To enhance the solving efficiency, a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based solving method is introduced by embedding the RA algorithm in the learning environment of DRL. Finally, simulation results prove that the proposed scheme can obtain good performance for UAV-enabled VR systems.</description></item><item><title>Double Self-Sustainable Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces Aided Wireless Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10599855</link><description>A double self-sustainable reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) assisted multi-user multiple input multiple output (MIMO)system is investigated, where two RISs are equipped with energy harvesting circuit to achieve self-sustainable transmission. We aim to minimize the transmission power at the base station (BS), while guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) requirements of the users and meeting the power consumption requirements of the RISs. In order to address the formulated coupled non-convex problem, we employ a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm based on the penalty-based method and successive convex approximation (SCA) to alternatively optimize the active beamforming at the BS and the phase shifts, as well as amplitude coefficients of two RISs. Simulation results show that the required power consumption at the BS for the proposed double self-sustainable RISs system is significantly reduced compared to conventional RIS systems.</description></item><item><title>Energy Minimization for Radio Map-Based UAV Pickup and Delivery Logistics System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10603397</link><description>Cargo UAVs have been used in short-distance logistics scenarios in cities, and this paper investigates the path planning problem for multi-user pickup and delivery of UAVs. The UAV takes off from the depot, completes the pickup and delivery tasks, and returns to the depot; it needs to maintain a reliable connection with the ground base station (GBS) during the UAV's flight. In the mission, the energy consumption of the UAV is closely related to the order of pickup and delivery as well as the weight of the goods. Therefore, this paper achieves the goal of minimizing UAV energy consumption and designing UAV flight trajectory by optimizing the access sequence. In this paper, we first construct a radio map of the target area, and then we propose an improved Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the path which is the shortest between any two access points that satisfies reliable communication. Then, using the constructed distance matrix, we use a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) to solve the UAV trajectory of the minimum energy pickup and delivery problem (PDP). Finally, through the simulation analysis of traditional PDP and energy-efficient PDP on the python platform, it can be found that our proposed minimum energy consumption PDP saves about 20% of energy consumption compared with the traditional PDP without considering energy consumption.</description></item><item><title>IRS-Aided Multi-Antenna Wireless Powered Communications in Interference Channels</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10608074</link><description>This paper investigates intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided multi-antenna wireless powered communications in a multi-link interference channel, where multiple IRSs are deployed to enhance the downlink/uplink communications between each pair of hybrid access point (HAP) and wireless device. Our objective is to maximize the system sum throughput by optimizing the allocation of communication resources. To attain this objective and meanwhile balance the performance-cost tradeoff, we propose three transmission schemes: the IRS-aided asynchronous (Asy) scheme, the IRS-aided time-division multiple access (TDMA) scheme, and the IRS-aided synchronous (Syn) scheme. For the resulting three non-convex design problems, we propose a general algorithmic framework capable of suboptimally addressing all of them. Numerical results show that our proposed IRS-aided schemes noticeably surpass their counterparts without IRSs in both system sum throughput and total transmission energy consumption at the HAPs. Moreover, although the IRS-aided Asy scheme consistently achieves the highest sum throughput, the IRS-aided TDMA scheme is more appealing in scenarios with substantial cross-link interference and limited IRS elements, while the IRS-aided Syn scheme is preferable in low cross-link interference scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Transistor-Based Dynamic Equivalent Circuit Modeling of Mesostructured-Based Solar Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10676321</link><description>This study introduces a pioneering transistor-based equivalent circuit model explicitly tailored for mesostructured-based solar cells, primarily focusing on dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs).

Root-mean-square error analysis assesses the model's accuracy in predicting the experimental data. At the same time, the investigation extends to include the dynamic response of the cells through current&#8211;time analysis, as well as power losses. Notably, the response curve of the perovskite cell exhibits rapid escalation to peak current levels and displays heightened sensitivity to changes in illumination levels compared with DSSCs, with a response time of 1 ms for PSCs as opposed to 5 ms for DSSCs.</description></item><item><title>808 nm Laser Power Converters for Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10716003</link><description>808 nm ten-junction laser power converters (LPCs) with different areas were designed and grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition.

However, the data obtained mostly contains errors. Commercial I-V curve tracking units are generally expensive, hard to transport, slow to respond, and limited at low irradiations. This article proposes a novel I-V tracer (SEPIV) based on an optimized single-ended primary inductance converter. The SEPIV comprises a linear variable dc load connected to the solar panel's output. In this study, the experimental performance of the SEPIV was compared with the outcomes of commercial and lab devices, which are PVPM 1000 C 40 (PVPM) and WAVELABS SINUS-3000 PRO, respectively. SEPIV's accuracy matched lab units and surpassed PVPM's. As a highlight of this study, the introduced setup can capture the I-V curves of PV modules up to 650 W, a maximum VOC of 60 V, and a maximum ISC of 20 A. In contrast to commercial units, the SEPIV measurement does not depend on irradiation level. Moreover, it has the Internet of Things capability through a Wi-Fi connection for remote measurement.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Photovoltaic Power Prediction Based on CEEMDAN and Hybrid Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10670083</link><description>Accurate photovoltaic (PV) power prediction technology plays a crucial role in effectively addressing the challenges posed by the integration of large-scale PV systems into the grid. In this article, we propose a novel PV power combination prediction model based on complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) in conjunction with a hybrid neural network. To mitigate the influence of strong fluctuations in PV power on prediction outcomes, we employ CEEMDAN to decompose the PV data into several subsequences. Subsequently, sample entropy (SE) is used to quantify the complexity of each subsequence. Subsequences with similar SE values are then restructured to reduce computational load. Moreover, to overcome the limitations of a single neural network in capturing historical data features of PV power, a hybrid sequential convolutional neural network-gate recurrent unit (CNN-GRU) neural network is proposed. The effectiveness of our proposed model is validated through case studies involving PV power stations in two regions. To provide a comprehensive assessment, we conduct comparative validation by building and evaluating alternative models, including long-short term memory (LSTM), GRU, CEEMDAN-LSTM, CEEMDAN-GRU, and CNN-GRU. The results unequivocally demonstrate that the model presented in this article exhibits exceptional prediction performance, characterized by high accuracy and robust generalization.</description></item><item><title>Power-Efficient Analog Hardware Architecture of the Learning Vector Quantization Algorithm for Brain Tumor Classification</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10659713</link><description>This study introduces a design methodology pertaining to analog hardware architecture for the implementation of the learning vector quantization (LVQ) algorithm.

Due to the nonidealities of the calibration circuits, the calibrated bit weights carry errors. This error could propagate during the calibration procedure. Due to the high precision requirement of these ADCs, such residue error commonly becomes the signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) bottleneck of the overall ADC. This article presents an analysis of the residue error from bit weight self-calibration methods of high-resolution SAR ADCs. The major sources contributing to this error and the error reduction methods are quantitively analyzed. A statistical analysis of the noise-induced random error is developed. Our statistical model finds that the noise-induced random error follows the chi-square distribution. In practice, this random error is commonly reduced by repetitively measuring and averaging the calibrated bit weights. Our statistical model quantifies this bit weight error and leads to a clearer understanding of the error mechanism and design trade-offs. Following our chi-square model, the SNDR degradation due to the circuit noise during the calibration can be easily estimated without going through the time-consuming traditional transistor-level design and simulation process. The required repetition time can also be calculated. The bit-weight error models derived in this article are verified with measurement on a 16-bit SAR ADC design in a 180-nm CMOS process. Results from our model match both simulations and measurements well.</description></item><item><title>A nMOS-R Cross-Coupled Level Shifter With High dV/dt Noise Immunity for 600-V High-Voltage Gate Driver IC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10596101</link><description>In digital integrated circuits with multiple power domains, level shifters (LSs) are essential circuit elements that can transform the voltage region from low to high. However, high-frequency gate drivers can generate hundreds of voltages per nanosecond noise (high dV/dt noise). Such high dV/dt noise can cause malfunction of a conventional pulse-triggered cross-coupled LS (CCLS) that is used to control the high-side nMOS switch. In this article, a novel LS with noise immunity is proposed and investigated. Compared with the conventional resistor load LS, the proposed circuit adopts nMOS-R cross-coupled (NRCC) LS, and realizes the selective filtering ability by exploiting the path that filters out the noise introduced by the dV/dt. The high-voltage gate drive integrated circuit (HVIC) is implemented using a 600 V silicon-on-insulator (SOI) BCD process. Analyses and experiments show that the proposed design can help the HVIC maintain a high common-mode transient immunity (CMTI) of up to 137 V/ns while allowing a negative VS swing down to -9.4 V under a 15 V supply voltage. Compared with the traditional HVIC with resistance load LS, the proposed novel HVIC with the NRCC LS improves the noise immunity of dV/dt by 182%.</description></item><item><title>A Two-Channel Interleaved ADC With Fast-Converging Foreground Time Calibration and Comparison-Based Control Logic</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10669386</link><description>A dual-channel interleaved analog-to-digital converter (ADC) operating at 320 MS/s is prototyped to validate a fast-converging foreground time calibration algorithm that is independent of ADC offset errors. An input polarity switching technique is introduced to eliminate the impact of sub-ADC offset mismatches during foreground time calibration. After foreground calibration, the signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) and spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) are improved by 8.6 and 18.4 dB, respectively. In the sub-ADC design, a comparison functionality is enabled in the digital circuits to prevent metastability and expedite data conversion. The single-channel conversion rates reach 160 MS/s. The ADC is implemented via 40-nm digital CMOS technology, achieving a 52.01 dB signal-to-noise plus distortion ratio (SNDR) at near-Nyquist input while sampling at 320 MS/s.

However, this method imposes a significant area and power/energy overhead. Also, the majority-based voter in the typical TMR designs is highly sensitive to soft errors and the design diversity of the triplicated module, which may result in an error for a small difference between the output of the TMR modules. However, a wide range of applications deployed in critical systems are inherently error-resilient, that is, they can tolerate some inexact results at their output while having a given level of reliability. In this article, we propose a high precision redundancy multiplier (HPR-Mul) that relies on the principles of approximate computing to achieve higher energy efficiency and lower area, as well as resolve the aforementioned challenges of the typical TMR schemes, while retaining the required level of reliability. The HPR-Mul is composed of full precision (FP) and two reduced precision (RP) multipliers, along with a simple voter to determine the output. Unlike the state-of-the-art RP redundancy multipliers (RPR-Muls) that require a complex voter, the voter of the proposed HPR-Mul is designed based on mathematical formulas resulting in a simpler structure. Furthermore, we use the intermediate signals of the FP multiplier as the inputs of the RP multipliers, which significantly enhance the accuracy of the HPR-Mul. The efficiency of the proposed HPR-Mul is evaluated in a 15-nm FinFET technology, where the results show up to 70% and 69% lower power consumption and area, respectively, compared to the typical TMR-based multipliers. Also, the HPR-Mul outperforms the state-of-the-art RPR-Mul by achieving up to 84% higher soft error tolerance. Moreover, by employing the HPR-Mul in different image processing applications, up to 13% higher output image quality is achieved in comparison with the state-of-the-art RPR multipliers.</description></item><item><title>MCAIMem: A Mixed SRAM and eDRAM Cell for Area and Energy-Efficient On-Chip AI Memory</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10684121</link><description>AI chips commonly employ SRAM memory as buffers for their reliability and speed, which contribute to high performance. However, SRAM is expensive and demands significant area and energy consumption. Previous studies have explored replacing SRAM with emerging technologies, such as nonvolatile memory, which offers fast read memory access and a small cell area. Despite these advantages, nonvolatile memory&#8217;s slow write memory access and high write energy consumption prevent it from surpassing SRAM performance in AI applications with extensive memory access requirements. Some research has also investigated embedded dynamic random access memory (eDRAM) as an area-efficient on-chip memory with similar access times as SRAM. Still, refresh power remains a concern, leaving the trade-off among performance, area, and power consumption unresolved. To address this issue, this article presents a novel mixed CMOS cell memory design that balances performance, area, and energy efficiency for AI memory by combining SRAM and eDRAM cells. We consider the proportion ratio of one SRAM and seven eDRAM cells in the memory to achieve area reduction using mixed CMOS cell memory. In addition, we capitalize on the characteristics of deep neural network (DNN) data representation and integrate asymmetric eDRAM cells to lower energy consumption. To validate our proposed MCAIMem solution, we conduct extensive simulations and benchmarking against traditional SRAM. Our results demonstrate that the MCAIMem significantly outperforms these alternatives in terms of area and energy efficiency. Specifically, our MCAIMem can reduce the area by 48% and energy consumption by  $3.4\times $  compared with SRAM designs, without incurring any accuracy loss.</description></item><item><title>A Novel TriNet Architecture for Enhanced Analog IC Design Automation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10672521</link><description>Analog integrated circuit (IC) design and its automation pose significant challenges due to the time-consuming mathematical computations and complexity of circuit design. Though efforts have been made to automate the analog design flow, the current approach falls short in meeting the exact design requirements and plagued by inaccuracies, highlighting the necessity for a more robust approach capable of accurately predicting circuits. In addition, there is a need for an improved dataset collection technique to enhance the overall performance of the automation process. The power management unit (PMU) is a crucial block in any IC that requires the design of low-dropout regulator (LDO) for which amplifiers are fundamental blocks. This research harnesses the capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs) to automate essential amplifier blocks, such as the differential amplifier (DiffAmp) and two-stage operational amplifier (OpAmp). In addition, it proposes an automation framework for the higher level circuitry of the LDO. This article introduces a novel &#8220;TriNet&#8221; architecture designed for various parameters of amplifiers, including gain, bandwidth, and power facilitating precise predictions for DiffAmp and OpAmp, and presents a decoder architecture tailored for LDO. A notable aspect is the development of an efficient technique for acquiring larger datasets in a condensed timeframe.

The DEM algorithm achieves very good averaging of mismatch-induced errors in the succeeding CS-DAC. It features a minimum element transition rate, therefore opimizing the power dissipation and ensuring minimal glitch energy at the output. Due to the chosen network-based architecture, with only a few modifications of the hardware, the decoder allows the integration of a comprehensive current source mismatch calibration that can be fully operated in the background and even in parallel to the regular DEM operation. A proof-ofconcept hardware implementation of the presented decoder was fabricated in a 22-nm FD-SOI CMOS process and characterized in a high-speed DDFS system with a sampling rate of 5 GHz. Measurements reveal a significant improvement in the spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) and signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) when the calibration and DEM are enabled. Compared to the state-of-the-art (SoA), the presented DDFS achieves one of the best figures of merit.</description></item><item><title>1.63 pJ/SOP Neuromorphic Processor With Integrated Partial Sum Routers for In-Network Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10570234</link><description>Neuromorphic computing is promising to achieve unprecedented energy efficiency by emulating the human brain&#8217;s mechanism. Conventional neuromorphic accelerators employ split-and-merge method to map spiking neural networks&#8217; inputs to surpass the fan-in capabilities of a single neuron core. However, this approach gives rise to the risk of accuracy compromise and extra core usage for the merging process. Moreover, it requires excessive data movement and clock cycles to aggregate spikes generated by partial sums instead of total sums obtained from different cores with substantial power and energy overhead. This work presents a novel approach to addressing the challenges imposed by the split-and-merge method. We propose an energy-efficient, reconfigurable neuromorphic processor that leverages several key techniques to mitigate the above issues. First, we introduce a partial sum router circuitry that enables in-network computing (INC), eliminating the need for extra merge cores. Second, we adopt software-defined Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) by leveraging predefined, efficient routing, eliminating power-hungry routing computation. At last, we incorporate fine-grained power gating and clock gating techniques for further power reduction. Experimental results from our test chip demonstrate the lossless mapping of the algorithm and exceptional energy efficiency, achieving an energy consumption of 1.63 pJ/SOP at 0.48 V. This energy efficiency represents a 22.4% improvement compared to the state-of-the-art results. Our proposed neuromorphic processor provides an efficient and flexible solution for neural network processing, mitigating the limitations of the traditional split-and-merge approach while delivering superior energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>VLSI Design of Light-Field Factorization for Dual-Layer Factored Display</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10568566</link><description>This article introduces a VLSI design for light-field factorization, aimed at enhancing immersive 3-D visual experiences for computational light-field factored displays.

Accordingly, we first propose half-block-based factorization (HBBF) and sparse ray sampling (SRS) to reduce DRAM bandwidth by 99% and SRAM size by 74%. Then, we devise integer hybrid quantization (INTH) to cut down computational logic by 41%, leading to improvements in die area and power efficiency. Finally, we fabricated a processor chip that incorporates 75.1 kB of SRAM and 5.9M logic gates using 40-nm CMOS technology. It can operate with three different performance modes: high quality (56.9 MPixel/s at 971 mW), balanced (62.5 MPixel/s at 442 mW), and low power (61.7 MPixel/s at 283 mW). Across these modes, its normalized energy ranges between 4.4 and 16.2 nJ/pixel. This implementation surpasses existing GPU platforms and offers an  $85\times $  increase in processing speed and a  $311\times $  reduction in power consumption.

However, conventional polar codes are reliant solely on binary ( $2 \times 2$ ) kernels, which restricts their block length to being only powers of 2. In response, multi-kernel (MK) polar codes have been proposed as a viable solution to achieve increased flexibility in code length. This article proposes unrolled and pipelined architectures for encoding both systematic and nonsystematic MK polar codes, capable of high-throughput encoding of codes constructed with binary, ternary ( $3 \times 3$ ), or binary-ternary mixed kernels. Furthermore, two novel nonsystematic stage-folded encoders, designed to minimize resource usage, have been introduced for the encoding of pure-ternary and MK codes. The proposed MK encoders additionally provide the functionality of dynamic kernel assignment. The proposed architectures exhibit an unprecedented level of flexibility by supporting 83 different codes and offering various architectures that provide tradeoffs between throughput and resource consumption. The FPGA implementation results demonstrate that a partially pipelined polar encoder of size  $N=4096$  operating at a frequency of 270 MHz gives a throughput of 1080 Gb/s. In addition, a new compiler scripted in Python is introduced to automatically generate HDL modules for the desired encoders.

The PMR employs passive integrators in parallel to simultaneously integrate the average result of the multiple sequential residual voltages. The proposed PMR technique provides an alternative scheme to enhance the NS rather than increasing the order of the integrator to suppress the instability and power. A prototype 7-bit second-order NS-SAR ADC is designed and simulated in a 130-nm CMOS process. PMR increases the effective number of bits (ENOBs) to 10.6 bit, which enhances the NS effect of 3.6 bit. It achieves a peak signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) of 65.84 dB over a bandwidth of 1.3 kHz at the oversampling ratio (OSR) of 16.</description></item><item><title>Multidie 3-D Stacking of Memory Dominated Neuromorphic Architectures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10609345</link><description>Event-driven neuromorphic processors for artificial intelligence (AI) inference on edge/IoT devices require largeon-chip memory capacity, for efficient execution of spiking neural networks (NNs). In this work, we evaluate 3-D stacking benefits on SENECA, a digital neuromorphic accelerator core, sweeping itson-chip memory capacity from 2 up to 32 Mb in both legacy planar and advanced nanosheet CMOS logic nodes. In a planar CMOS node (GF-22 nm), two-die memory-on-logic (MoL) partitioning enables  $8\times $  moreon-chip memory, and it boosts operating frequency by 7% with 26% less power than the 2-D. Moving to an advanced nanosheet technology (imec A10), multidie (up to 7 dies) MoL stacking enables a performance increase of up to 29% and power savings up to 31%. Furthermore, a core folding (CF) partitioning in A10 shows up to 16% performance improvement with 12% total power savings with respect to the 2-D implementation on the same technology. We also demonstrate no thermal overhead for multidie stacking at advanced nodes for designs exhibiting low power density. These physical design explorations lay the foundation for system technology co-optimization studies for edge devices.</description></item><item><title>Improvement in Resilience of AES Design With Reconfigured CFB Mode Against Power Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10596060</link><description>Advanced encryption standard (AES) is used to secure the communication process on the Internet-of-Things (IoT) hardware. It is implementable in various 128-bit modes, such as electronic code book (ECB), cipher block chaining (CBC), cipher feedback (CFB), output feedback (OFB), and counter (CTR), to facilitate parallel processing of data. The noninvasive nature of power analysis attacks (PAAs) to retrieve secret information off a physical device renders such hardware to be unsafe from the adversaries. Also, the assessment of the aforementioned modes for security remains obscured, which is undertaken by this work as a novel attempt. In addition, this work proposes a novel 64-bit version of CFB mode, which provides the highest security with respect to other modes and several unprotected AES designs. PAAs are performed on ASIC platform utilizing UMC 65-nm technology node and a hardware experimental setup using side-channel attack security evaluation board (SASEBO), both at 16-MHz AES frequency and traces sampled at the rate of 1 GSa/s. The measurements to disclose (MTDs) of &gt;1 000 000 provided by the proposed CFB-64 are significantly more than that provided by usual unprotected AES designs. It also offers the highest MTD, and least signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and mutual information (MI) among other modes, indicating the highest security. The proposed CFB-64 acts as a countermeasure upon integration with an unprotected AES.</description></item><item><title>A 28 nm 16-kb Sign-Extension-Less Digital-Compute-in-Memory Macro With Extension-Friendly Compute Units and Accuracy-Adjustable Adder-Tree</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10582884</link><description>Conventional digital-domain SRAM compute-in-memory (CIM) faces challenges in handling multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations with signed values, either in serial data feeding mode or extra sign-bit processing. The proposed CIM macro has the following features: 1) a sign-extension-less array multiplication circuit structure that eliminates the need for converting partial sums into 2&#8217;s complement, which removes the constraints related to handling specific symbol bits; 2) developing a circuit that avoids signed bit extension shift and accumulate, resulting in reduced area cost; and 3) integrating an adder structure that provides adjustable accuracy, thereby enhancing network adaptability as compared to traditional approximation techniques. A fabricated 28 nm 16-kb sign-extension-less DCIM was tested with the highest MAC speed with 5.6 ns (Signed 8 b IN&amp;amp;W 23 b Out) and achieved the best energy efficiency with 40.15 TOPS/W over a wide range of network adaptability.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Jitter and Compact-Area Fractional-N Digital PLL With Fast Multi-Variable Calibration Using the Recursive Least-Squares Algorithm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10682595</link><description>This work presents a fractional-N digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) characterized by low jitter and small area, featuring fast multi-variable calibration. To minimize the use of silicon area, the LC voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) incorporated a compact three-turn inductor. Then, to still achieve low jitter, the bandwidth of the PLL was designed to be wide to suppress the poor phase noise of this VCO. To mitigate in-band noise, a digital-to-time converter (DTC) was employed to cancel the quantization noise (Q-noise) from the  $\Delta \Sigma $ M, and a phase selector (PSEL) was used to reduce the thermal noise of the DTC. The effectiveness of these jitter-reduction techniques relies on digital background calibration. However, conventional multi-variable calibrators (MVCs), which utilize the least-mean-squares (LMS) algorithm, suffer from a prolonged convergence time. To overcome this limitation, this work introduced a recursive least-squares (RLS)-based MVC using a dichotomous coordinate descent (DCD) algorithm that can facilitate rapid calibration at a moderate implementation cost. The proposed DCD-RLS MVC achieved a calibration time of less than  $7.2~{\mu }$ s, which was 40 times faster than the LMS MVC. The DPLL of this work achieved 88 fsrms jitter at a near-integer-N channel with 68-dBc fractional spurs. Fabricated using a 40-nm CMOS process, it occupied only a 0.12-mm2 active area and consumed 15.7 mW of power.</description></item><item><title>A Millimeter-Wave Four-Way Doherty Power Amplifier With Over-GHz Modulation Bandwidth</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10675497</link><description>This article presents the design and analysis of a millimeter-wave (mmWave) four-way Doherty power amplifier (PA), aiming to enhance the PA energy efficiency when amplifying orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based 5G new radio (NR) signals with a 10&#8211;12-dB peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). We first introduce a systematic approach to extending a conventional two-way Doherty PA to N ways, followed by a new transformer-based N-way Doherty network synthesis flow. The proposed network synthesis achieves N-way Doherty load modulation using ( $N-1$ ) transformers, one fewer transformer and thus lower loss than conventional designs. In addition, it enables the desired impedance transformation from  $R_{\text {ANT}}$  to  $R_{\text {OPT}}$  and effectively absorbs the parasitic capacitance of the power cells. Along with the Doherty network, we also introduce a high-speed adaptive biasing circuit, addressing the modulation bandwidth bottleneck in prior Doherty PA demonstrations. As proof of concept, a four-way Doherty PA prototype is implemented in the 47-GHz 5G band (band n262) using the GlobalFoundries 45-nm CMOS silicon-on-insulator (SOI) process. It achieves 24.0-dBm saturated power ( $P_{\text {SAT}}$ ), 23.7-dBm output 1-dB compression point ( $P_{1\,\text {dB}}$ ), 26.8% peak power-added efficiency ( $\text {PAE}_{\text {PEAK}}$ ), 26.3% PAE at  $P_{1\,\text {dB}}$  ( $\text {PAE}_{1\,\text {dB}}$ ), 21.7% PAE at 6-dB back-off ( $\text {PAE}_{6\,\text {dB}}$ ), and 13.1% PAE at 12-dB back-off ( $\text {PAE}_{12\,\text {dB}}$ ), demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. In the modulation tests, the PA achieves 14.1-dBm average output power ( $P_{\text {avg}}$ ) and 13.7% average efficiency ( $\text {PAE}_{\text {avg}}$ ) when amplifying a 2000-MHz 5G NR 64-QAM OFDM signal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first silicon PA demonstration of 2000-MHz channel modulation bandwidth for 5G NR OFDM along with back-off efficiency enhancement up to 12-dB back-off.</description></item><item><title>A Chain-Weaver Balanced Power Amplifier With an Embedded Impedance/Power Sensor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10679720</link><description>This article introduces an N-way chain-weaver balanced power amplifier (PA) for millimeter-wave (mm-wave) phased-array transmitters (TXs). Taking advantage of the proposed combining network, an embedded impedance/power sensor is implemented, which can be utilized for output power regulation, built-in self-test, and load-based performance optimization. The proposed PA architecture offers linearity and gain robustness under the antenna&#8217;s frequency/time-dependent voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR). In the event of impedance mismatch, the proposed PA provides N different loads equally distributed on the VSWR circle. Consequently, the performance of the PAs is the average of N PAs with N different loads, which makes this structure VSWR resilient. As a proof of concept, an eight-way chain-weaver balanced PA (BPA) is realized in 40-nm bulk CMOS technology, and it delivers 25.19-dBm  ${P} {_{\text {SAT}}}$  with 16.19% PAE. The proposed PA supports a 2-GHz 64-QAM OFDM signal with 16-dBm average power, achieving &#8722;25-dB error vector magnitude (EVM). The average EVM is better than &#8722;30.3 dB without digital pre-distortion (DPD) for an &#8220;800-MHz 256-QAM OFDM&#8221; signal while generating an average output power of 12.17 dBm. The performance of the PA is also evaluated under 1.5:1&#8211;3:1 VSWR conditions. The measured small-signal gain variation under VSWR 3:1 is &#177;0.7 dB. Moreover, assuming any frequency/time-dependent loading condition within the VSWR 3:1 circle, the proposed chain-weaver BPA achieves &lt;2.8&#176; amplitude-to-phase (AM-PM) over 3-GHz bandwidth. Besides, the embedded impedance/power sensor accuracy outperforms the state of the art. The proposed impedance sensor can measure VSWR 3:1 by the maximum angle and magnitude errors of 12.3&#176; and 0.106, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A 23.2-to-26-GHz Low-Jitter Fast-Locking Sub-Sampling PLL Based on a Function-Reused VCO-Buffer and a Type-I FLL With Rapid Phase Alignment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10684529</link><description>This article presents a type-II sub-sampling phase-locked loop (SSPLL) that achieves low jitter, low spur, and sub- $\mu $ s locking time when synthesizing millimeter-wave (mm-wave) frequencies. The proposed function-reused (FR) voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)-buffer eliminates the noise and capacitive loading from the transistors in the buffer, improving the jitter and reference (ref.) spur of the SSPLL simultaneously. It also eliminates the inductor typically employed in the high-frequency buffer, reducing the chip area. The proposed low-power fast frequency-locked loop (FLL) utilizes a phase aligner to decouple the dependency of the locking time on the initial phase error. The FLL also employs a coarse-fine-time-to-digital converter (TDC)-based type-I loop for promptly searching the control word of the switched capacitors (SCs). This article also details the analysis of the ref. spur and the phase noise (PN) performance using the FR VCO-buffer as well as the design considerations of the proposed FLL. Fabricated in 28-nm CMOS, the SSPLL occupies a compact area of 0.065 mm2 and achieves an rms jitter of 48.3 fs at 26 GHz while consuming 19.1 mW, corresponding to excellent FoMJ and FoMN of &#8722;253.5 and &#8722;277.6 dB, respectively. The measured ref. spur is &#8722;66 dBc, and the measured locking time at a frequency jump from 0.4 to 2.8 GHz is within 55 ref. cycles.</description></item><item><title>A Tri-Band Dual-Concurrent Wi-Fi 802.11be Transceiver Achieving &#8722;46 dB TX/RX EVM Floor at 7.1 GHz for a 4 K-QAM 320 MHz Signal</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643491</link><description>A high-linearity, wideband transceiver for Wi-Fi 7 to support 4 K-QAM 320 MHz bandwidth (BW) is presented and fabricated using a 14 nm Fin-FET CMOS process. To provide a high-performance local oscillator (LO) signal, a fractional-N sampling phase-locked loop with a high gain sampling phase detector (SPD) is implemented with digital-to-time converter (DTC) non-linearity calibration (NLC) based on a least mean square (LMS) algorithm. The transceiver exhibits excellent integrated phase noise (IPN) performances with a single-core voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) achieving &#8722;54.3 dBc at 7115 MHz frequency channel. IPN performance can be further improved to &#8722;55.2 dBc with a dual-core VCO. A wideband frequency operation transmitter (TX) architecture for a 5&#8211;7 GHz frequency range is introduced. It utilizes a high Q tunable switched inductor for a wideband matching network and flexible frequency adjustment. A coupling-minimized switched inductor (CMSI) is implemented to cancel out magnetic flux when two inductors are enabled simultaneously. This improves mutual inductance and the Q factor while extending the frequency tuning range. The TX error vector magnitude (TX EVM) floor is achieved up to &#8722;46.1 dB at 7.1 GHz, marking the best-reported value to date. A 5/6G receiver (RX) is designed to improve noise performance while maintaining linearity. To achieve this, a resistor attenuator block is introduced between a voltage-to-current (V2I) and a mixer, while a high signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) performance is maintained in a wider input power range. The RX error vector magnitude (RX EVM) floor is measured as &#8722;46 dB at 7.1 GHz. These results demonstrate the transceiver&#8217;s excellent performance, making it a promising solution for Wi-Fi 7 applications.</description></item><item><title>A 167- &#956;W 71.7-dB SFDR 2.4-GHz BLE Receiver Using a Passive Quadrature Front End, a Double- Sided Double-Balanced Cascaded Mixer, and a Dual-Transformer-Coupled Class-D VCO</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10701049</link><description>This article reports a 2.4-GHz Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) receiver with a number of passive-intensive RF functions to improve power efficiency and blocker resilience. It features a passive quadrature front end (QFE) built with a hybrid coupler plus two step-up transformers. They passively provide input-impedance matching, voltage gain, and single-ended-to-differential-I/Q RF generation. The four-phase RF outputs simplify the LO generator into a 2.4-GHz class-D voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) that has an intrinsically boosted output swing, averting the power-hungry divider-by-2 and LO buffers. The frequency down-conversion based on a double-sided double-balanced (DSDB) cascaded mixer offers a high passive gain to reduce the noise and power consumption of the baseband (BB) circuitry while securing a high spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) to tolerate the out-of-band (OOB) blockers. The BB circuitry is a power-efficient hybrid low-IF filter that employs a 2nd-order active-feedback notching to enhance the 1st-adjacent channel rejection. Fabricated in 28-nm CMOS, the BLE receiver exhibits a maximum RF-to-IF gain of 71 dB. The noise figure (NF) is 8.5 dB and the OOB-IIP3 is 20.1 dBm; they correspond to a 71.7-dB SFDR for a 2-MHz BLE channel and a 10-dB minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR $_{\min }$ ). The VCO exhibits a phase noise (PN) of &#8722;110/&#8722;119.1/&#8722;131 dBc/Hz at 1-/2.5-/10-MHz offset, corresponding to a figure of merit (FOM) of 188/189/189.1 dBc/Hz, respectively. The total power consumption of the receiver, including the VCO, is  $167~{\mu }$ W.</description></item><item><title>A 7.6-mW IR-UWB Receiver Achieving &#8722;17-dBm Blocker Resilience With a Linear RF Front-End</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10662966</link><description>This article presents a low power, linear RF front-end (RF-FE) for an 802.15.4a/z compatible impulse-radio ultrawideband (IR-UWB) receiver. A complementary topology-based LNA is proposed with a bandpass filter (BPF) integrated into its output. The LNA includes a complementary common gate (CCG) stage to isolate the BPF from the undesired loading of the LNA&#8217;s input stage to achieve a high Q and 5- to 10-GHz tuning range. This CCG stage relaxes a trade-off between headroom and linearity. Furthermore, capacitive and transformer coupling techniques are proposed in the LNA to increase its OP1dB and second-order intermodulation (IM2) by 4 and 27 dB, respectively, compared to noncomplementary counterparts without these techniques. An automatic feedback-based back-gate biasing technique is proposed for the variable gain transconductance amplifier (VGTA) following the BPF to increase VGTA&#8217;s transconductance range for a given width over length (W/L). The receiver is fabricated in a 22-nm fully depleted silicon on insulator (FDSOI) CMOS. The measured results over the 5- to 10-GHz RF frequency range show a minimum noise figure (NF) of 6 dB and a blocker resilience of &#8722;17 dBm at 7.6-mW power dissipation.</description></item><item><title>Implementation and Application of Harmonic Reset Switching in Passive Mixers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10700997</link><description>This article covers a synthesizing methodology for addressing harmonic rejection (HR) in hard-switching passive mixers. The integration of bottom and top plate mixing provides HR at both the antenna node and the output of the mixer in a passive and low-loss manner. A prototype mixer-first receiver (RX) in 45-nm partially depleted silicon-on-insulator (PD-SOI) is implemented, consuming 34.8&#8211;64.5 mW for clock frequencies ( $f_{\text {LO}}$ ) of 0.25&#8211;4 GHz and occupying an active area of 0.68 mm2. Due to the passive and early HR, it achieves an exceptional in-band (IB) harmonic blocker 1-dB compression point (B1 dB) of +14/+16.5 dBm at the third/fifth harmonics at a clock frequency of 1 GHz. Notably, with blocker powers up to 5 and 6.5 dBm at  $3f_{\text {LO}}$  and  $5f_{\text {LO}}$ , respectively, the harmonic blocker noise figure (BNF) only deteriorates by 3 dB at a clock frequency of 1 GHz. The minimal overhead of components facilitates the seamless incorporation of HR in widely tunable RXs and benefits from scaling.</description></item><item><title>A Blocker-Tolerant Non-Uniform Sub-Sampling Receiver With a Non-Uniform Discrete-Time FIR Filter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10748385</link><description>A non-uniform (NU) sub-sampling receiver (RX) with a NU discrete-time FIR (NU DT FIR) filter can create multiple tunable frequency notches both near and far from the passband via predesigned NU sampling clocks and filter coefficients. NU DT finite impulse response (FIR) acts as an anti-aliasing (AA) filter for a nonuniformly sampled signal which relaxes the subsequent ADC speed and dynamic range (DR). To save power and area and to improve linearity, the FIR filter is implemented in the current domain and shares the capacitive DAC with a subsequent asynchronous SAR ADC. A proof-of-concept NU DT FIR RX is implemented in 28 nm CMOS. It achieves up to 42 dB of blocker rejection with B1dB of 4 dBm. The receiver measures &#8722;27.4 dB EVM for a 64-QAM 100 MSymbol/s signal centered at 20 GHz in the presence of a 10-dBc blocker. The end-to-end RX consumes 24 mW from a 1-V supply and occupies an active area of 0.072 mm2.</description></item><item><title>A 121.7-dB DR and -109.0-dB THD+N Filterless Digital-Input Class-D Amplifier With an HV IDAC Using Tri-Level Unit Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10634313</link><description>The dynamic range (DR) of digital-input closed-loop class-D amplifiers (CDAs) is typically limited by the noise introduced by their resistive DAC (RDAC) or current-steering DAC (IDAC). It could be improved by using tri-level cells in the IDAC, but this has not yet been realized in high-voltage (HV) CDAs due to the large difference in the common-mode levels between the DAC and the CDA. This article describes an HV CDA directly driven by an HV IDAC. By using the same output common mode for the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and CDA, the noise penalty associated with shifting the common mode is avoided. To address the distortion due to mismatch and intersymbol interference (ISI) in the IDAC, a transition-rate-balanced bidirectional real-time dynamic element matching (RTDEM) technique is also introduced. Fabricated in a 180-nm BCD process, the CDA prototype achieves a DR of 121.7 dB and a peak THD+N of -104.0 and -109.0 dB for 1- and 6-kHz inputs, respectively. It can deliver a maximum of 14 W into an 8- $\Omega $  load with a power efficiency of 90%.</description></item><item><title>A 0.00055% THD + N Class-D Audio Amplifier With Capacitive Feedforward PWM and Wide-Band Aliasing Reduction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654776</link><description>Linearity of Class-D audio amplifier based on conventional closed-loop pulsewidth modulat ion (PWM) is deteriorated by large swing of loop filter and input-dependent comparator delay. Furthermore, PWM-residual-aliasing has been revealed as a source of distortion, especially in low-power filter-less structure. This article presents a class-D amplifier (CDA) that utilizes an input-feedforward carrier to mitigate both loop filter swing and comparator delay coupling. As for the PWM-residual-aliasing, we propose a 2nd-order PWM-residual-aliasing reduction (PRAR) technique with loop compensation to achieve steeper filtering and wide-band linearity improvement. In addition, a fully passive anti-aliasing filter is used to suppress the PWM residue leakage. This CDA was fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu $ m CMOS 5 V process. It achieves a state-of-the-art total harmonic distortion plus noise (THD + N) of 0.00055% (&#8722;105.2 dB) and an FoM $_{\text {THD}\,+\,\text {N}}$  of 2119 while consuming a low quiescent current of 0.81 mA.

An NPN-based front end uses two resistors to efficiently generate a PTAT and CTAT current, whose ratio is then digitized by a continuous-time (CT)  $\Delta \Sigma $ -modulator. A  $\beta $ -compensation technique is used to mitigate base current errors associated with the NPN&#8217;s finite  $\beta $ . Component mismatch and 1/f noise are mitigated by applying chopping and dynamic element matching (DEM), while the spread in  $V_{\text {BE}}$  and the ratio of the two resistors are digitally trimmed at room temperature (RT). Fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu $ m CMOS process, the sensor draws  $2.5~\mu $ A from a supply voltage ranging from 1.4 to 2.2 V. Measurements on 40 samples show that it achieves an inaccuracy of  $\pm 0.1~^{\circ }$ C ( $3\sigma $ ) from  $- 55~^{\circ }$ C to  $125~^{\circ }$ C.

The BGR is implemented by summing the proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT) and complementary to absolute temperature (CTAT) outputs of two PNP-based capacitive DACs. At the sampling rate, the DAC capacitors are pre-charged to the supply and then discharged for a fixed period via PNPs, thus biasing them and simultaneously sampling their base-emitter voltages. By using the modulator&#8217;s first integrator to sum the DAC outputs, a dynamic BGR can be realized, which does not need additional reference buffers or decoupling capacitors. To make the system fully dynamic, the modulator itself is based on capacitively biased (CB) floating inverter amplifiers (FIAs). Implemented in a standard 130-nm CMOS process, the sensor interface occupies an area of 0.2 mm2. It achieves an SNDR of &gt;84.5 dB over a scalable bandwidth (BW) ranging from 98 Hz to 5.9 kHz while consuming 1.7&#8211; $50.8~{\mu }$ W.

The proposed domino-like-buffered (DLB) design, which features multistage-cascaded buffers that progressively drive segmented pass transistors, significantly elevates non-dominant poles beyond the unity-gain frequency, thereby addressing stability challenges posed by the small output capacitor ( $C_{\mathrm {L}}$ ). This advancement allows the full exploitation of the high PSR advantage inherent in the output-pole-dominant (OPD) LDO, even with a compact on-chip  $C_{\mathrm {L}}$ . Compared to traditional LDO designs, our approach can loosen the  $C_{\mathrm {L}}$  requirement by  $2.4\times $  to maintain the same phase margin (PM). The chip, fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process, is designed to supply up to 10 mA of load current with a typical dropout voltage of 200 mV. Performance tests reveal an undershoot and overshoot of 51 and 50 mV, respectively, for a 9.8-mA load step. Despite its small on-chip  $C_{\mathrm {L}}$  of 50 pF, the DLB LDO demonstrates a worst case PSR of &#8211;28 dB across frequencies from 10 Hz to 1 GHz. It also occupies a minimal silicon area of 0.012 mm2, including the on-chip  $C_{\mathrm {L}}$ .</description></item><item><title>A High-Efficiency Envelope-Tracking Supply Modulator Using a Class-G Linear Amplifier and a Single-Inductor Dual-Input-Dual-Output Converter for 5G NR Power Amplifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10737452</link><description>This article presents a hybrid envelope tracking supply modulator (ETSM) comprising a class-G linear amplifier (LA), a single-inductor dual-input-dual-output (SIDIDO) converter and a switching amplifier (SA) for 5G new radio (NR) power amplifiers (PAs). With an additional supply rail, the class-G LA detects the amplitude of the input signal in real-time, adaptively utilizes the higher supply rail when the signal exhibits large swings, and seamlessly transitions to the lower supply rail when the signal swing decreases. This operation effectively reduces the average voltage drop of LA&#8217;s bias, sinking and sourcing current, thus improving the supply modulator (SM) efficiency at tracking bandwidth (BW) as high as 200 MHz. To mitigate the distortion induced on the output envelope due to high-speed switching between the different supply rails, a smooth transition technique is introduced for high linearity.

The topology combines fixed-ratio 2:1 stages together with a CSCR stage to limit the voltage across the CSCR stage while boosting the allowable input voltage higher without relying on stacking capacitors or transistors. Furthermore, by running the fixed-ratio and CSCR stage out of phase, the effectiveness of the CSCR&#8217;s intermediate rails and switches is doubled, thus reducing the required transistor footprint. This article discusses a scalable implementation of this technology, leveraging an array-able voltage regulator (VR) core that encompasses the required powertransistors, capacitors, as well as local signal generation circuits, that is then combined with a single centralized controller to meet the current demands of small and large power domains. Measurement results of the VR, realized on Intel 16 technology using high-density metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors, demonstrate the transient performance and reliability of the proposed approach, while showcasing a record 12.7 W/mm2 peak power density for monolithic voltage conversion, and 92% peak efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A 12-to-1&#8211;1.8-V Hybrid DC-DC Converter With a Charge Converging Phase for Inductor Current Reduction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10679735</link><description>This article presents a 12-V-input and 1&#8211;1.8-V-output hybrid buck converter featuring a charge converging phase (CCP-HB). During this phase, charges from multiple paths converge into one flying capacitor, increasing the charge accumulated on it. Such charge gets transferred to the output in parallel with the inductor during the other phase, and thus, the average inductor current is reduced to consistently less than half of the load current across the entire voltage conversion ratio (VCR) range. This approach significantly reduces dc resistance (DCR) conduction loss and mitigates the reliance on a bulky inductor. Besides, a stacked switched-capacitor network (SCN) is adopted between the input and the output to reduce voltage stress on power switches for better efficiency. The converter was fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu $  m BCD process, utilizing only 5- and 1.8-V NMOS as power switches. Measurement results show that the converter achieves a peak efficiency of 95.4% with a small DCR of 10.5 m $\Omega $ . Moreover, the CCP enables the use of a compact inductor as small as the 2016 series ( $2{\times }1.6{\times }1$  mm3) with a large DCR of 57 m $\Omega $  and a low saturation current of 3.6 A to deliver a full load of up to 5 A. The converter still maintains a peak efficiency of 94.7%, and the current density of total passive volume is up to 685 A/cm3.</description></item><item><title>A Power-Efficient Single-Mode Buck-Boost DC&#8211;DC Converter With Bilaterally Symmetrical Hybrid Topology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10670527</link><description>This article presents a bilaterally symmetrical hybrid buck-boost (BS-HBB) dc-dc converter designed for battery-to-3.4-V power conversion. Traditional buck-boost converters suffer from high inductor currents ( $I_{\text {L}}$ ) compared to load currents, resulting in considerable conduction losses. While many hybrid designs incorporating flying capacitors have attempted to reduce  $I_{\text {L}}$ , these topologies often struggle with non-smooth transitions between modes, the inability to reduce  $I_{\text {L}}$  in either the buck or boost region, and inefficient high-voltage switches with poor ON-resistances. In contrast, the BS-HBB topology proposed in this work enables seamless single-mode operation throughout its entire voltage conversion range. This converter not only achieves lower  $I_{\text {L}}$  in both buck and boost regions but also utilizes low-voltage CMOS switches that exhibit low ON-resistance, thereby enhancing power efficiency. The BS-HBB chip was fabricated using a 180-nm CMOS process. Designed to supply up to 1 A, this chip outputs a voltage of 3.4 V from an input voltage ranging from 2.7 to 4.2 V. A peak efficiency of 96.9% (95.5%) was achieved using an inductor having a dc resistance of 9 m $\Omega $  (250 m $\Omega $ ). This work also successfully validated the single-mode operation by demonstrating a flawless output voltage under continuously fluctuating input voltage.</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid Single-Inductor Bipolar-Output Converter With a Concise PWM Control for AMOLED Displays</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10682814</link><description>This article presents a compact single-inductor bipolar-output (SIBO) converter for active-matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED) displays. Addressing the demand for a large load capacity within a limited form factor, we propose a hybrid SIBO converter featuring two flying capacitors ( $C_{\mathrm {F}}$ s) which are introduced to further reduce the inductor current ( ${I} _{\mathrm {L}}$ ) and voltage stress of power switches. The proposed converter mainly consists of two operation states that determine the energy charging and distribution, respectively, when the two outputs have the same load currents. To address potential loading imbalance, two auxiliary phases are incorporated into the main operation states. A concise PWM control strategy, consisting of a common-mode (CM) loop and differential-mode (DM) loop, is also proposed for bipolar output regulation with fast transient responses. The converter is fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu $ m BCD process and the measured peak efficiency reaches 94.5% using a  $2.5\times 2.0\times 1.2$  mm3 inductor. Furthermore, the converter achieves 3.99 W/mm2 on-die power density with the total off-chip components occupying 15.32-mm3 volume, demonstrating that this design provides a compact solution for AMOLED displays.</description></item><item><title>An Integrated Dual-Side Series/Parallel Piezoelectric Resonator-Based DC-DC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10623621</link><description>The use of piezoelectric resonators (PRs) as energy storage elements in dc-dc converters has captured considerable interest, in part due to the ultra-thin planner form factor, excellent frequency/volume scaling properties, and high coupling and quality factors offered by PRs. Traditional PR-based converters, however, exhibit performance diminishment at low voltage conversion ratios (VCRs), rendering them less appealing to applications that require low VCR operation.

To sustain reliable power transfer against inductive-link fluctuation, a hybrid voltage-/current-mode (V/CM) receiver (RX) is proposed to provide CM recovery when the coupling becomes weak for VM operation. To optimize the end-to-end (E2E) efficiency, a digital pulsewidth modulation (PWM)-based global power regulation technique is proposed, which allows a fully on/off operation of the three-mode power amplifier (PA) at the transmitter (TX) side and fast load-transient responses. Moreover, the system adopts a fully integrated voltage-sensing load-shift-keying (LSK) demodulation technique, which replaces conventional current sensing methods with a streamlined implementation and reduced power consumption. Both prototype TX and RX chips were fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS process. The proposed system, powered by a 1.8-V supply at TX, realizes a regulated 1.8-V dc output at RX. With the help of the hybrid V/CM RX, the proposed system achieves an up-to-150% WPT range extension compared to VM-only operation and an up to 7.2-cm WPT range. Benefiting from the global digital-PWM regulation, it achieves up to 72.3% E2E efficiency over the loading range from 0.18 to 81 mW. A 10- $\mu $ s load-transient recovery is also attained at a  $164{\times }$  load step with a 110-mV undershoot and unnoticeable overshoots.</description></item><item><title>98.7% Efficiency 1200&#8211;48 V LLC Converter Using Triple Step-Down Converter With One-Inductor Technique Compliant With EVSE Level 1</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10628040</link><description>The proposed LLC flyback converter converts the 1200 V of the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) into a 48 V battery system. The triple step-down converter with one inductor (TSDC-OL) technique converts 1200&#8211;400 V, and the transformer steps it down to 48 V. The zero-voltage switching (ZVS) mechanism is used for each switching operation and the equivalent on-resistance  $R_{\text {ON}}$  is reduced to 1/4.5 times that of the existing technology. The proposed reference voltage compensator (RVC) can accurately maintain the charging current at 25 A. Since the left half-plane zero error amplifier (LZEA) contributes to the LHP zero, it ensures the stability of the RVC and prevents periodic variations. When the battery charges to 48 V, the operation switches to constant voltage (CV) mode via burst operation control (BOC) comparison with a leakage-based ultralow  $I_{Q}$  comparator (LUC) with 2 nA  $I_{Q}$  leakage. Finally, the proposed LLC flyback converter meets EVSE level 1 requirements in constant current (CC) mode and achieves 98.7% efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A 2.08-mW 64.4-dB SNDR 400-MS/s Pipelined- SAR ADC Using Mismatch and PVT Variation Tolerant Dynamically Biased Ring Amplifier in 8 nm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10710178</link><description>In this article, we introduce a new dynamically biased ring amplifier that is tolerant to mismatch and PVT variation without requiring bias calibration, and we verify it in a 12-bit 400-MS/s pipelined-SAR analog-to-digital converter (ADC), fabricated in an 8-nm FinFET process. Our novel ring amplifier solves the biasing issues inherent in conventional ring amplifiers while maintaining the benefits of high gain, slew-based charging, and nearly rail-to-rail output swing. We also propose a technique to enhance the DC accuracy of a switched-capacitor common-mode feedback (CMFB) without consuming additional power, which we named feedback voltage sampling CMFB. Furthermore, we introduce a full-scale matching residue amplification technique for the prototype pipelined-SAR ADC to utilize the top-plate input sampling for the first-stage SAR ADC, resulting in faster and lower power conversion. The prototype ADC demonstrates the robustness of our dynamically biased ring amplifier to mismatch and PVT variation without any interstage gain, bias, or reference calibration, and achieves 64.4-dB SNDR and 77.6-dB SFDR for a low-frequency input while consuming 2.08 mW. This measured performance is equivalent to Walden and Schreier FoMs of 3.8 fJ/conversion $\cdot $ step and 174.2 dB, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A 12-GS/s 12-b 4&#215; Time-Interleaved ADC Using Input-Independent Timing Skew Calibration With Global Dither Injection and Linearized Input Buffer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10747403</link><description>This article presents a 12-GS/s 12-bit  $4{\times }$  time-interleaved (TI) pipelined analog-to-digital converter (ADC), which utilizes a global dither injection (GDI) scheme to facilitate an input-independent background timing skew calibration. The GDI scheme adds dithers into the input signal of the push-pull source follower (PP-SF) in the input buffer (IBF), avoiding undetectable skews in conventional local dither injection (LDI) schemes. Meanwhile, the perturbations between the input signal and dither are mitigated by cross-coupled capacitive networks. This work also significantly improves the efficiency of the interleaver using the following techniques: first, the PP-SF-based IBF is linearized by a self-adaptive current compensation (SACC), achieving high linearity under 1.2-V low supply voltage headroom. Second, the speed of the 12-bit channel is lifted to 3 GS/s in 28-nm CMOS using a sturdy ring amplifier (SRingAmp) with feedforward (FF), which enables a nonhierarchical interleaver with a small interleaving factor of  $4{\times }$ . The time-interleaved ADC attains a 54.1-dB SNDR and a 66.0-dB SFDR under a near-Nyquist input with 179.8-mW power consumption, translating into a Walden figure of merit (FoM) of 36.2 fJ/conversion step and a Schreier FoM of 159.3 dB.</description></item><item><title>A &#8722;90-dBFS-IM3, &#8722;164-dBFS/Hz-NSD, 700-MHz-Bandwidth Continuous-Time Pipelined ADC With Digital Cancellation of DAC Errors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10715661</link><description>This paper describes a continuous-time (CT) pipelined analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that represents a technology push along both&#8212;third-order distortion and noise&#8212;dimensions.

The proposed asymmetrically terminated PAM-4 driver is optimized for pseudo open drain (POD) channel configurations and improves signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with a larger output swing. The dynamic logic-based high-speed 4-to-1 serializer enhances the transmitter output&#8217;s jitter characteristic by avoiding high-frequency components in the selection signals. The 4-tap feed-forward equalizer (FFE) with two operation modes and one sliding tap flexibly compensates for inter-symbol interference (ISI) of the channel. In the receiver frontend, a continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE), which utilizes a trans-admittance stage (TAS) and a trans-impedance amplifier (TIA) with an inductive load, provides high-frequency boosting and robust single-to-differential conversion performance through the design techniques of current source gain-boosting and capacitive compensation. The low kickback noise comparators mitigate clock feedthrough and noise coupling during multi-phase PAM-4 sampling and embed the 1-tap PAM-4 decision feedback equalizer (DFE) operation by directly feeding back the previous sampling phase&#8217;s outputs.

The reduction in BJT biasing current can reduce the power consumption, thus relieving the burden on the  $2\times $  charge pump as well, in which the minimum supply voltage of the proposed BGR decreases down to 0.4 V. In this paper, we employ a differential pair proportional-to-absolute-temperature (PTAT) voltage generator to provide a sufficiently large PTAT voltage. To suppress the temperature coefficient (TC) under limited power and voltage budgets, we propose using a nA level PTAT plus nonlinear current to bias both the BJT and PTAT voltage generator. This approach provides an indirect voltage curvature compensation. The proposed reverse BGR fabricated in 65 nm CMOS, occupies an active area of 0.0470 mm2. Measurement results from 8 chips show an average reference voltage of 487.4 mV under 0.4 V supply, with an average TC of 28.4 ppm/&#176;C over a temperature range from -40&#176;C to 100&#176;C, while consuming only 12 nW power.</description></item><item><title>Artificial Neural Network Based Calibration for a 12 b 250 MS/s Pipelined-SAR ADC With Ring Amplifier in 40-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10620219</link><description>This paper presents a 2-stage pipelined-SAR ADC with artificial-neural-network (ANN) based digital calibration algorithm to calibrate the mismatch error in the  $1^{\mathrm {st}}$ -stage capacitive DAC (CDAC) and the inter-stage gain error (IGE) together. Previous ANN-based calibration schemes suffer from excessive power and hardware overhead due to the large number of network parameters. To facilitate hardware implementation, the proposed algorithm only requires  $N_{1}+1$  input parameters ( $N_{1}$  is the resolution of the  $1^{\mathrm {st}}$ -stage SAR ADC), in which the overall output of the  $2^{\mathrm {nd}}$ -stage SAR ADC is combined into a single parameter. In addition, the ANN utilizes a single-neuron hidden layer with linear activation function to calculate the actual bit weight of the ADC, remarkably reducing the hardware overhead and power consumption of the calibration circuit. The prototype 12-bit, 250 MS/s pipelined-SAR ADC with &#8220;loop-unrolled&#8221; architecture is implemented in 40-nm CMOS, in which a ring amplifier with improved bias circuit is used to realize a robust closed-loop gain for residue amplification. With the ANN-based calibration circuit implemented in an FPGA, the calibrated ADC achieves the SNDR of 65.0 dB and the SFDR of 84.0 dB at Nyquist input (124 MHz), with a Schreier figure of merit of 169.0 dB and a Walden figure of merit of 14.0 fJ/conv-step. The ADC core consumes 4.95 mW, with an active area of only 0.013 mm2.</description></item><item><title>A DVS-Enabled Distributed Digital LDO Providing Rapid Uniform Power Grid and Ripple Reduction Achieving 20.1-ps FOM in 28 nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10601247</link><description>A dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) enabled distributed digital low-dropout voltage regulator (LDO) is described.

Besides, two interleaving phases can reduce the inductor current to half of that conventional design. Benefiting from a coupled inductor with a negative mutual inductance (M&lt;0), the equivalent I $_{\mathrm {L(AC)}}$  becomes small to achieve low output voltage ripple due to large equivalent inductance Leq in a steady state. Based on the loading current, the phase shedding can change the number of driving phases for high efficiency. Moreover, a transient enhancement circuit is proposed to speed up transient response time. The proposed circuit achieves the maximum inductor current ripple reduction of 9.09% and the maximum P $_{\mathrm {AC\_loss}}$  reduction of 17.36% at D=0.5. Experimental results show 96.1% peak efficiency. In the case of the load step 0.5A to 5A, the recovery time and undershoot are reduced to  $10.7\mu $ s and 133mV, respectively, and in the case of the load step 5A to 0.5A, the recovery time and overshoot are reduced to  $9.4\mu $ s and 147mV, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Loop-Break Decision Feedback Equalizer for DAC/ADC-DSP-Based Wireline Transceivers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10629180</link><description>This paper presents a novel digital decision feedback equalizer (DFE) design that can relax the feedback timing constraints for analog-to-digital converter (ADC)-based high-speed wireline receivers. The proposed technique breaks the loop-unrolled DFE (LU-DFE) chain by computing multiple LU-DFE chains in parallel with all possible seed symbols, and selecting the appropriate output by the post-processing selection logic. The proposed loop-break DFE (LB-DFE) is functionally equivalent to the conventional DFE with any other implementation techniques such as LU-DFE, look-ahead DFE (LA-DFE), or direct DFE.

Consequently, there has been a proliferation of alternative computing paradigms aimed at tackling this disparity. Approximate Computing (AxC) has emerged as a modern way of improving speed, area efficiency, and energy consumption in error-resilient applications such as image processing or machine learning. The trade-off for these enhancements is the loss in accuracy. From a technology point of view, memristors have garnered significant attention due to their low power consumption and inherent non-volatility that makes them suitable for In-Memory Computation (IMC). Another computing paradigm that has risen to tackle the aforementioned disparity between the demand growth and performance improvement. In this work, we leverage a memristive stateful in-memory logic, namely Material Implication (IMPLY). We investigate advanced adder topologies within the context of AxC, aiming to combine the strengths of both of these novel computing paradigms. We present two approximated algorithms for each IMPLY based adder topology. When embedded in an Ripple Carry Adder (RCA), they reduce the number of steps by  $6\%-54\%$  and the energy consumption by  $7\%-54\%$  compared to the corresponding exact full adders. We compare our work to State-of-the-Art (SoA) approximations at circuit-level, which improves the speed and energy efficiency by up to 72% and 34%, while lowering the Normalized Median Error Distance (NMED) by up to 81%. We evaluate our adders in four common image processing applications, for which we introduce two new test datasets as well. When applied to image processing, our proposed adders can reduce the number of steps by up to 60% and the energy consumption by up to 57%, while also improving the quality metrics over the SoA in most cases.</description></item><item><title>A Phase Interpolated Dual-Phase Adaptive On-Time Controlled Buck Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10597378</link><description>This paper introduces a dual-phase buck converter that utilizes a phase interpolator for interleaving, based on adaptive on-time control. This method successfully resolves ripple cancellation challenges in multi-phase adaptive on-time controlled buck converters, thereby eliminating the reliance on external ramp signals or complex phase-locked loops. Consequently, the loop bandwidth is expanded, enhancing the converter&#8217;s noise immunity and reducing jitter within a compact circuit design. Operating at 3 MHz per phase, the converter demonstrates a maximum jitter of 30.25 ns and a phase error of 7.3 degrees at the ripple cancellation point. Moreover, features like rapid transient on-time extension and a dual-phase full turn-on mechanism significantly improve dynamic performance during load transitions. Experimental results show a voltage drop of 80 mV and a settling time of  $2~\mu $ s under a 3 A load step, with input and output voltages of 1.8 V and 0.9 V, respectively.

Traditionally, the CRC and FEC encoding circuits in JESD204C are implemented independently of each other, which consumes a significant amount of hardware resources. Therefore, a high logic density CRC and FEC logic sharing (CFLS) encoding circuit for JESD204C controller is proposed in this paper, and the logic density of the encoding circuit is improved by sharing the registers and common encoding factor (CEF). Meanwhile, a straightforward critical path delay (CPD) calculation method was proposed to assess whether the data transmission delay satisfies the requirements of CFLS circuits. This method is derived in conjunction with the manipulation of the common factor matrix, thus reducing computational complexity. The CFLS encoding circuit proposed in this paper is verified with an FPGA platform, and the results show that the circuit can realize CRC and FEC function with a 21.96% reduction in hardware resources, compared to the traditional methods. The area of the JESD204C controller with CFLS encoding circuits is 0.09 mm2, by using a 40-nm CMOS process, and the power consumption is 24.66 mW according to the post-layout simulation.</description></item><item><title>De-Correlation and De-Bias Post-Processing Circuits for True Random Number Generator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10595992</link><description>True random number generators (TRNGs) are commonly used in hardware security for secure authentication, data encryption, etc. The raw random numbers often exhibit defects. The most commonly observed defects are bias and correlations. Post processing techniques have been developed to address them. The von Neumann method addresses bias, but it requires input that is uncorrelated and has an identical distribution. On the other hand, the Markov chain can address correlation but introduce bias. In this work, we research the lightweight combination of two techniques. We verified that MKV2(QL4)/VN2 performs well for both Markov and non-Markov model bitstreams. MKV1(QL8)/VN8W is effective for the Markov model. The randomness is verified by NIST SP 800&#8211;22 and 800-90B, and ENT, respectively. Both of these circuits require only 16 bits of memory, which is 12 times smaller than in previous work. MKV1(QL8)/VN8W is implemented using 65-nm CMOS. A prototype chip demonstrates a minimum energy consumption of 0.149 pJ/bit at 0.45V. When applied to a latch-based TRNG, it can double the operation frequency thanks to the enhanced decorrelation. The total energy consumption is reduced by 21%.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Continuous Beam Angle Resolution for Next Generation Wireless Systems: A Multi-Stage Phase-Shifting Polyphase Filters Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10601326</link><description>Increasing user density and capacity in next-generation systems presents a need for fine beam angle resolution especially in the emerging upper mid-band  $7-24$  GHz frequency regime.

Generally, microwave sensors utilized in field measurement setups for dielectric sensing often face significant challenges, such as high costs, limited accuracy and resolution, and the potential need for extensive equipment. To address this, PIN diodes are incorporated into the structure, enabling tunable RPS to extend the capacity to measure phase variations across a broader range, leading to higher resolution while preserving the same compact form factor. Also, exciting the TDT-RPS sensor with a sine-wave signal instead of a pulse at a single frequency improves the accuracy since the Material Under Test (MUT) is dispersive. Moreover, two key components have been integrated into the RPS structure to estimate phase difference variations using the TDT technique: a power splitter and a compact commercial phase detector (AD8302). This integration minimizes the necessary measurement equipment in the testing setup. Consequently, the proposed TDT-RPS can be integrated into Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and IoT systems for in-situ scenarios, making it a promising solution for use in various fields such as biomedical, agriculture, and chemical industries.</description></item><item><title>An Open-Circuit Fault Diagnosis for Three-Phase PWM Rectifier Without Grid Voltage Sensor Based on Phase Angle Partition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10623173</link><description>In order to accurately locate the open-circuit fault of power tube for three-phase PWM rectifier under the grid-voltage sensorless control strategy, an open-circuit fault diagnosis algorithm based on phase angle partitions of the current and voltage is proposed. To improve dynamic response for the system, predictive current control is implemented. The real-time change rate of the grid-current phase angle is utilized to determine whether a fault occurs. Based on the zero value platform in the grid-side distortion current generated by open-circuit faults, the corresponding phase angles for the grid current and the grid voltage are partitioned to locate the fault tubes. In a grid voltage sensorless control system, the grid voltage information obtained by the voltage observer and phase-locked loop can be susceptible to distortion or interference. To enhance the accuracy of phase-locked angle, a double generalized second-order integrator is used. The proposed open-circuit fault detection method can realize rapid diagnosis and location for single and double power tubes under grid-voltage sensorless predictive current control. Finally, experimental results are presented to verify the feasibility of the diagnosis method.</description></item><item><title>Low-Voltage CMOS Capacitor-Less LDOs: Bulk-Driven Versus Gate-Driven Comparative Study</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638180</link><description>This paper explores the feasibility of a capacitor-less (CL) low-dropout (LDO) regulator to operate efficiently in a low-voltage environment. The CL-LDO scheme selected is based on a unity-gain feedback configuration around the error amplifier (EA), so that the inclusion of high-value on-chip resistors is avoided and different key parameters, such as the power supply rejection or the noise, are optimized. A comparative analysis has been carried out over the same LDO structure including a bulk-driven and a gate-driven EA, respectively. The pass branch of the voltage regulator is provided with pseudo-class-AB operation, in order to lead to a very small quiescent current in the standby operation mode, whereas a very large current can be delivered to the load when required. Both regulators were designed and fabricated in 180 nm CMOS technology to operate with a maximum supply voltage of 1.8 V. The extensive experimental characterization showed that the bulk-driven LDO can achieve a significantly lower minimum supply voltage, i.e., 0.6 V, as compared to the gate-driven counterpart, 1 V, under the same reference voltage and load current conditions.</description></item><item><title>A Triboelectric Energy Harvesting IC With High-Voltage Synchronous Electric Charge Extraction Strategy and Superior Systematic Efficiency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10550063</link><description>Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), as emerging mechanical energy harvesters, have attracted extensive research interests.

However, current nvCIMs adopt fully-pipelined (FP) or layer-serial (LS) dataflows for all DNN layers, suffering poor area and energy efficiency for the layer-wise-varied workloads. Furthermore, their fixed macro structure results in resource under-utilization, as it is unable to adapt to varying weight sizes. To address these issues, this brief proposes a reconfigurable nvCIM with dynamic dataflow. First, it contains a dynamic inter-pipelined-intra-serial (IPIS) dataflow with group partition mechanism, adapting to the diverse workloads for high area and energy efficiency. Second, it has a dual-input block-reconfigurable (DIBR) macro structure, allowing finer granularity input selection to improve macro utilization and achieve input data reuse. When applied to four well-known networks, the proposed design attains  $2.27\sim 11.92\times $  area efficiency gains and  $2.21\sim 14.43\times $  energy efficiency gains over nvCIM baselines.</description></item><item><title>An 800-MS/s 8.2-ENOB TDC-Assisted Pipelined-SAR ADC With Parallel Conversion</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638764</link><description>This brief presents a ring amplifier embedded with the time-to-digital converter (TDC) to implement parallel conversion techniques in a pipelined-SAR ADC.

The proposed design makes an unconventional usage of the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) slice embedded within the AMD-Xilinx FPGA devices to implement high jitter ring oscillators as entropy sources for efficient TRNG designs. Thanks to its wide bit-width output, several configurations can be enabled to group multiple oscillators within a single DSP slice. As a result, a TRNG designed through the proposed scheme outputs up to 4 random bits per clock cycle, thus leading to a considerably high-throughput, while exploiting an ultra-compact architecture.

The ASIC implements a recently-proposed power-saving technique called sparsity-adaptive equalization (SPADE). SPADE exploits the inherent sparsity of mmWave channels in the beamspace domain to reduce the dynamic power of matrix-vector products by skipping multiplications for which the magnitude of both operands are below pre-defined thresholds. Simulations with realistic mmWave channels show that SPADE incurs less than 0.7 dB SNR degradation at 1% target bit error rate compared to antenna-domain equalization. ASIC measurement results demonstrate an equalization throughput of 46 Gbps and show that SPADE offers up to 38% power savings compared to antenna-domain equalization. A comparison with state-of-the-art massive MIMO equalizer designs reveals that our ASIC achieves superior normalized energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A 266F2 Ultra Stable Differential NOR-Structured Physically Unclonable Function With &lt; 6&#215;10-9 Bit Error Rate Through Efficient Redundancy Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10609250</link><description>This brief presents a NOR-structured physically unclonable function (PUF) tailored for low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) applications.

Given the constraints of deploying detection models at resource-limited pipeline stations, there is a compelling need to develop efficient, lightweight models suitable for edge device applications. This brief introduces an adaptive heterogeneous model knowledge distillation network (AHKDnet) for edge deployment of pipeline network detection models.

Inspired by the state-of-the-art high-efficiency NN accelerators, three techniques are proposed for effectively integrating the approximate computing unit into convolutional neural network (CNN) accelerator to achieve a dynamic energy-accuracy tradeoff: 1) an approximate multiplier that can be configured to three precision modes is proposed. A weight pre-encoding method is used to save hardware overhead; 2) for hybrid-accuracy layerwise mapping, the hessian-aware layerwise accuracy scaling is proposed, which concerns inference accuracy and hardware overhead simultaneously.

On Their Role in Static Power Side-Channel Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10509766</link><description>Static or leakage power, which is especially prominent in advanced technology nodes, enables so-called static power side-channel attacks (S-PSCAs). While countermeasures exist, they often incur considerable overheads. Besides, hardware Trojans represent another threat. Although the interplay between static power, down-scaling of technology nodes, and the vulnerability to S-PSCA is already established, an important detail was not covered yet: the role of the components at the heart of this sensitive interplay, the standard cells. Here, we study this intricate relationship for two commercial 28 and 65 nm technologies, using a commercial-grade integrated circuit design setup, and under realistic power consumption, performance, and area (PPA) objectives. Specifically, we study how threshold-voltage (VT) tuning of standard cells impacts the resilience of representative AES and PRESENT cipher hardware, including versions with established countermeasures. Our proposed CAD framework enables a security-versus-PPA-aware design-space exploration. Contrary to the belief that high-performance designs are generally more vulnerable to S-PSCA, we find that timing constraints and the distribution of different VT cells are more pivotal factors. Furthermore, we discover that attackers can deploy highly effective and stealthy S-PSCA-based Trojans, all without any gate overheads or any timing violations.</description></item><item><title>TVTAC: Triple Voltage Threshold Approximate Cache for Energy Harvesting Nonvolatile Processors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10542704</link><description>Energy harvesting is considered to be a substitute for batteries in many modern systems. Systems based on energy harvesting receive environmental energies from sources, such as sun, radio frequency, wind, vibration, etc, and convert them to electrical energy to be used by the capacitor of the system or feed the cyber-physical system (CPS) system directly. Despite its advantages, energy harvesting comes with some limitations, such as the instability of the received energy, which means that the energy may not be received for a moment due to environmental conditions during energy harvesting. Therefore, due to not receiving enough energy, the system function may face problems, which can lead to system shutdown and data loss. To prevent program execution interruption caused by frequent power interruptions in systems based on energy harvesting, these systems use nonvolatile processor (NVP). Saving the state in the NVP is done through nonvolatile registers and memories that can hold the contents until the power is restored. However, systems based on energy harvesting and NVPs also have challenges, such as frequent backups&#8217; energy consumption, slow program forward progress, and loss of data. In this article, we propose TVTAC, a framework for energy harvesting-based NVP CPS systems. TVTAC modifies conventional NVP&#8217;s cache architecture to efficiently work with newly introduced operational mode to prevent unnecessary backup operations. Furthermore, TVTAC is equipped with an NVP&#8217;s specific approximation unit that controls the approximation knobs during the approximate data cache accesses in order to save more energy. The simulation results show that TVTAC improves forward progress by 28% in the best case and 12% on average, compared to similar methods. From an energy consumption perspective, TVTAC reduces energy consumption by 43.5% in the best case and 28.5% on average.</description></item><item><title>Block-Wise Mixed-Precision Quantization: Enabling High Efficiency for Practical ReRAM-Based DNN Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10547183</link><description>Resistive random access memory (ReRAM)-based processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures have demonstrated great potential to accelerate the deep neural network (DNN) training/inference. However, the computational accuracy of analog PIM is compromised due to the nonidealities, such as the conductance variation of ReRAM cells. The impact of these nonidealities worsens as the number of concurrently activated wordlines (WLs) and bitlines (BLs) increases. To guarantee computational accuracy, only a limited number of WLs and BLs of the crossbar array can be turned on concurrently, significantly reducing the achievable parallelism of the architecture.While the constraints on parallelism limit the efficiency of the accelerators, they also provide a new opportunity for the fine-grained mixed-precision quantization. To enable efficient DNN inference on the practical ReRAM-based accelerators, we propose an algorithm-architecture co-design framework called block-wise mixed-precision quantization (BWQ). At the algorithm level, the BWQ algorithm (BWQ-A) introduces a mixed-precision quantization scheme at the block level, which achieves a high weight and activation compression ratio with negligible accuracy degradation. We also present the hardware architecture design BWQ-H, which leverages the low-bit-width models achieved by BWQ-A to perform high-efficiency DNN inference on the ReRAM devices. BWQ-H also adopts a novel precision-aware weight mapping method to increase the ReRAM crossbar&#8217;s throughput. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of BWQ, which achieves a  $6.08 \times $  speedup and a  $17.47 \times $  energy saving on average compared to the existing ReRAM-based architectures.</description></item><item><title>A Multichiplet Computing-in-Memory Architecture Exploration Framework Based on Various CIM Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10561622</link><description>Computing-in-memory (CIM) architectures based on various devices, such as resistive random access memory, SRAM, DRAM, etc., have demonstrated promising energy efficiency. Single-device-based CIM chips show different advantages on performance, power, or area metrics under different workload/operators sizes and application requirements. Some nonidealities, such as the write endurance of some nonvolatile devices, also influence the design choices. Motivated by the emerging 2.5-D/3-D chiplet integration, this work aims to combine the advantages of CIM/storage chips based on different devices, and proposes a design exploration framework to combine the advantages of CIM chips based on these devices in a 3-D-stack architecture. This work proposes: 1) an evaluation method for the power, performance, and area metrics of the multichiplet CIM architecture; 2) an abstraction for the single-device-based CIM chiplets and artificial intelligence algorithm operators; and 3) a mapping and optimization strategy to explore the 2.5-D/3-D CIM chiplet set. The effectiveness of the mapping strategy is verified with a small-scale brute-force search. The proposed design exploration framework can help to find a better-multichiplet CIM architecture. Under a simple design case, the proposed 3-D CIM architecture shows  $4.68\times $ &#8211; $53.32\times $  energy efficiency compared with the single CIM chip baselines. The abstracted chiplet library is open-source available in the open-source https://github.com/dai0dai/3D_CIM_Chiplet_Architecture_Exploration.</description></item><item><title>Data-Pattern-Based Predictive On-Chip Power Meter in DNN Accelerator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10554667</link><description>Advanced power management techniques, such as voltage drop mitigation and fast power management, can greatly enhance energy efficiency in contemporary hardware design. Nevertheless, the implementation of these innovative techniques necessitates accurate and fine-grained power modeling, as well as timely responses for effective coordination with the power management unit. Additionally, existing performance-counter-based and RTL-based on-chip power meters have difficulty in providing sufficient response time for fast power and voltage management scenarios. In this article, we propose PROPHET, a data-pattern-based power modeling method for multiply-accumulate-based (MACC) deep neural network (DNN) accelerators. Our proposed power model extracts the predefined data patterns during memory access and then a pretrained power model can predict the dynamic power of the DNN accelerators. Thus, PROPHET can predict dynamic power and provide sufficient responding time for power management units. In the experiments, we evaluate our predictive power model in four DNN accelerators with different dataflows and data types. In power model training and verification, our proposed data-patterns-based power model can realize the 2-cycle temporal resolution with  $R^{2} \gt 0.9$ , normalized mean absolute error &lt;7%, and the area and power overhead lower than 4.5%.</description></item><item><title>Study of p-(6H, 4H, 3C)SiC/n-GaN Heterojunction SDR, DDR IMPATT Diodes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10540363</link><description>In this article, three polytypes of p-(6H, 4H, 3C)SiC and n-GaN heterojunction single-drift (SDR) and double-drift (DDR) impact-ionization-avalanche-transit-time (IMPATT) diodes are studied. We conduct the numerical simulations of the direct current (DC), radio frequency (RF), and noise characteristics of IMPATT diodes. The results show that (6H)SiC/GaN IMPATT diodes have the optimum RF characteristics. Among them, the RF power density of (6H)SiC/GaN DDR IMPATT diode can reach 2.23 MW/cm2. The DC-RF conversion efficiency of (6H)SiC/GaN SDR IMPATT diode can reach 23.4%. Their noise performances are being examined in the meantime. The (3C)SiC/GaN IMPATT has better noise characteristics in the SDR structure, while (4H)SiC/GaN IMPATT has better noise characteristics in the DDR structure. This study provides a reference for the design and fabrication of IMPATT diodes.</description></item><item><title>Janus: A Flexible Processing-in-Memory Graph Accelerator Toward Sparsity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10540086</link><description>Graph application is ever-growing in relational data analysis. However, the memory access patterns become the performance bottleneck in graph analytics and graph neural network (GNN) suffering from single-side and dual-side sparsity, separately. Existing resistive random access memory (RRAM)-based processing-in-memory accelerators reduce data movements but fail to handle both types of sparsity in graph data. To address these issues, our work introduces Janus, a flexible highly compact architecture that is capable of being configured to enable single-sparse mode and dual-sparse mode, to accelerate graph analytics and GNN workloads in compressed mapping, respectively. Upon performing graph analytics with single-side sparsity, Janus employs a tandem-isomorphic-crossbar design both to remove zero-stored footprint, and to eliminate redundant search and sequential indexing. To address the challenge of dual-side sparsity in GNN, Janus still takes a random index access mechanism to gather data rapidly and uses a semi-SPM2 compute paradigm to boost the RRAM-based analog multiplication-and-accumulation in the compressed format. Compared with the state-of-the-art works, Janus outperforms them in both performance and energy efficiency for graph analytics and GNN, respectively.</description></item><item><title>OPT-GCN: A Unified and Scalable Chiplet-Based Accelerator for High-Performance and Energy-Efficient GCN Computation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10531075</link><description>As the size of real-world graphs continues to grow at an exponential rate, performing the graph convolutional network (GCN) inference efficiently is becoming increasingly challenging. Prior works that employ a unified computing engine with a predefined computation order lack the necessary flexibility and scalability to handle diverse input graph datasets. In this article, we introduce OPT-GCN, a chiplet-based accelerator design that performs GCN inference efficiently while providing flexibility and scalability through an architecture-algorithm co-design. On the architecture side, the proposed design integrates a unified computing engine in each chiplet and an active interposer, both of which are adaptable to efficiently perform the GCN inference and facilitate data communication. On the algorithm side, we propose dynamic scheduling and mapping algorithms to optimize memory access and on-chip computations for diverse GCN applications. Experimental results show that the proposed design provides a memory access reduction by a factor of  $11.3\times $ ,  $3.4\times $ , and  $1.4\times $ , and energy savings of  $15.2\times $ ,  $3.7\times $ , and  $1.6\times $  on average compared to HyGCN, AWB-GCN, and GCNAX, respectively.</description></item></channel></rss>
