The flying capacitor of the DIH converter is utilized as the energy buffer for the auxiliary stage, which is a low-cost, GaN-based bidirectional buck converter. The main DIH converter delivers the dc load power from the 48 V bus using an average-current-mode-control scheme, while the auxiliary stage regulates the output voltage with an output-capacitor-current (OCC) sensing scheme. The proposed architecture operates with a virtual auxiliary voltage bus with minimal auxiliary capacitance, $C_\text{AUX}$, due to the OCC-sensing scheme. A 40 W prototype has been fabricated to validate the proposed architecture with the virtual bus concept. The prototype achieves a peak efficiency of 93.8% and regulates the output voltage of 1 V within $\pm$50 mV during 20 A load transients with an output capacitance of only 800 &#181;F. Experimental results validate the operation of the virtual bus with $C_\text{AUX}$ = 0.47 &#181;F during 20 A load transients while observing a deviation of 4.7 V on the 12 V auxiliary virtual bus voltage, $V_\text{AUX}$.</description></item><item><title>A Graph and Number Theory Based Description Method and Equivalence Judgment of Power Electronics Topology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10415262</link><description>In the study of power electronics topology, the existing graph structure description methods cannot comprehensively manifest properties of topologies, leading to difficulties in their equivalence judgment.

Therefore, power electronics topology equivalence judgment can be conducted straightforwardly based on graph isomorphism. The proposed method effectively simplifies physical topology descriptions and related equivalence judgment. Case studies demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>Design of High-Efficiency Microwatt RF Energy Harvesting System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10416376</link><description>A radio frequency energy harvesting (RFEH) system can harvest and utilize radio frequency (RF) energy in the natural environment.

However, the existing ZSL-TLIs bear high conduction loss because of the coupling between the resonance tanks and the main power loops. In order to solve this problem, an improved zero-switching-loss H6 inverter (IZSL-H6) with low conduction loss composed of novel resonance tanks and an H6 inverter has been proposed in this article. The resonance tanks provide zero-current switching (ZCS) for H6 inverter switches, and the auxiliary devices of the resonance tanks are also turned on and off with ZCS. Compared with the existing ZSL-H6, IZSL-H6 reduces conduction loss by avoiding resonant current flow through the main switches during resonant capacitor charging mode and reducing the number of power devices in the main power loops during the freewheeling mode. Resonant parameters design, soft-switching criteria, and common-mode voltage characteristics are discussed. Finally, a 1000-W prototype has been developed to verify the theoretical analysis of the proposed IZSL-H6.</description></item><item><title>Bridgeless Star Power Factor Correction Architecture</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10423075</link><description>Two-stage bridgeless power factor correction (PFC) architecture is widely used in high-power ac/dc applications. However, the bridgeless PFC front-end of the two-stage architecture often encounters challenges, such as high switching losses in continuous conduction mode (CCM) or high conduction and magnetic losses in critical conduction mode and other soft-switching modes. These challenges limit the overall system's efficiency and power density. This article presents a patent-pending semi-single-stage bridgeless Star PFC architecture. It allows simultaneous soft switching and CCM operation of the front-end bridgeless PFC rectifier, resulting in high-efficiency and high-density ac/dc system design. Simultaneous soft switching and CCM operation of the front-end bridgeless PFC rectifier is made possible by smartly &#8220;borrowing&#8221; the inductor/transformer current from the second-stage dc/dc back-end to create zero-voltage switching (ZVS) conditions for all switches in the PFC front-end. The architecture maintains the operation of the second-stage dc/dc back-end, and enjoys similar control simplicity to that in conventional two-stage PFC architecture. The merits of the proposed architecture are validated through a 240-W GaN-based laboratory prototype, achieving a full-load efficiency of 96.1%. Additionally, it boasts an impressive power density of 50 W/in3 uncased.</description></item><item><title>An FPGA-Based On-the-Fly Reconfigurable Low-Power SHEPWM Inverter With a Compact SiP Implementation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10430438</link><description>This article presents a selective harmonic elimination pulsewidth modulation (PWM) (SHEPWM) full-bridge inverter featuring real-time on-the-fly reconfigurability of output waveform amplitude and frequency using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The inverter is integrated on a compact three-dimensional (3-D) system-in-package using low-temperature cofired ceramics as a substrate, reducing the printed circuit board (PCB) area. Validated through simulations and measurements at $0.12 \,\mathrm{W}$ and $1.2 \,\mathrm{W}$ peak output power, the inverter cancels harmonics up to the 34th order at switching nodes.

The controller clock continuously tracks twice the switching frequency through internal control that employs a primary clock. The system responds to 256x load rise transients within four switching periods using synchronous control to have fine output voltage attributes with a 27 nF-capacitor at output. Zero current switching in &#8804;10 ns is achieved using an active diode (AD). Employment of the AD ensures nonoverlap conduction of the switches in the buck converter. The analog AD-controller operates bias-free and the power consumed by it scales with switching frequency. As the average switching frequency is proportional to load, the losses in the main controller and AD-controller scale with load that improves the efficiency at light load. The system fabricated in 180 nm CMOS technology for 1.2 V output voltage, enhances the state-of-the-art transient response rate in synchronous mode (to 2.6&#8211;657 &#956;A in 812.8 &#956;s) for limiting the voltage droop to 7 mV. Peak efficiency achieved is 94.8% at 788 &#956;W output. Efficiency &gt;80% is obtained for the minimum output power levels of 12.4 &#956;W and 1.75 &#956;W at primary clocks of 1.25 MHz and 1.25/32 MHz, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Mode Full-Bridge/Modified-Stacked- Switches Structured CLLC Resonant Converter for Energy Storage Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433736</link><description>In this article, a new full-bridge/modified-stacked-switches multimode CLLC isolated resonant converter is presented for energy storage applications. In particular, a multimode wide voltage gain control system is proposed, which takes advantage of the topology reconfiguration method in both the inverter and the rectifier blocks in the proposed circuit to regulate the output voltage while preventing the switching frequency from drifting away far from the resonant frequency. The impact of the parasitic elements in the isolated CLLC resonant circuit is also investigated in this article. In addition, a smooth mode transition is provided to avoid any transients caused by a rapid frequency change. The operating principles of the control system is analyzed extensively. Compared with the traditional pulsefrequency modulated resonant converters, the proposed control system attains enhanced efficiency even at extremely low voltage gains while sustaining a nearly consistent high-efficiency profile. Furthermore, it mitigates voltage regulation instability under light loads attributed to parasitic components by constraining the frequency spectrum. The proposed control system presents an appealing solution for high-voltage, high-power energy storage applications that demand a broad range of voltage gains and where the influence of switch RdsON is reduced due to the low current characteristics typical of these applications. Finally, a 500 W 100 V-350 V input, 96 V output prototype has been built to verify the performance of the proposed converter system.</description></item><item><title>Nonisolated Ultra-High Step-Up Quadratic Converter With ZVS Operation and Low Switch Voltage Stress</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433760</link><description>This article proposes a nonisolated quadratic converter with ultra-high voltage conversion ratio. In the presented structure, an auxiliary circuit containing coupled inductors (CIs) and a voltage multiplier cell is integrated with the quadratic converter to obtain higher voltage gain. As a result, voltage stress over switches is reduced significantly and mosfets with low on-resistance can be used to lower the conduction losses. In addition, soft switching performance is achieved by the auxiliary circuit and all switches are turned on and turned off under zero voltage conditions to eliminate the switching and capacitive turn-on losses. Furthermore, the soft switching is load independent and is performed over the entire load variation. Moreover, due to leakage inductances of the CIs, the reverse recovery problem of the output diodes is alleviated. Due to the abovementioned advantages, the converter efficiency is enhanced notably. Also, the converter benefits from continuous input current and common ground between the input and output, which removes any limitation on the converter applications. In this article, the converter operation is investigated comprehensively and in order to validate the theoretical analysis, the experimental results of a 150 W prototype are provided.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Complexity Pure-MOS Sliding-Frequency Semi-Digital Buck DC-DC Converter Based on a Triple-Comparator Structure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10440481</link><description>Based on a triple comparator and several digital modules, a semidigital buck dc&#8211;dc converter is proposed and fabricated in 65-nm CMOS, for SoC power management.

Compared with the basic variable frequency control, an improved variable frequency strategy can reduce the envelope of leakage inductor peak current and reduce the dependence and sensitivity to the load power. More accurate ZVS criteria in view of the magnetizing inductor Lm are proposed. Seven operating modes are adopted and the transition among them is seamless. Three control variables are used in every mode. Wide voltage conversion gain and high-quality grid-side ac current can be obtained without mandatory current-tracking loops.

Conventional interleaved buck converters have been extensively used due to their high-current output and quick response. However, its output ripple in various duty cycles is not acceptable in many modern applications. The low ripple of IBC-CLLC is guaranteed regardless of the duty cycle by using coupled winding and small passive components. For the IBC-CLLC, a multiphase decoupled equivalent circuit is derived with dual aims: to establish a frequency domain model for transient response analysis, and to deduce a single-phase ripple equivalent circuit for ripple calculation and parameters optimization. A laboratory prototype is developed to validate the effectiveness of IBC-CLLC, which has 90% ripple cancellation and less energy storage.</description></item><item><title>Low-Temperature Direct Bonding of Sputtered Nanocrystalline Ag Film for Power Electronic Packaging: Bonding Mechanism, Thermal Characteristics, and Reliability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443533</link><description>Nanocrystalline metal films are emerging as die-attach materials for power electronic packaging owing to their organic-free nature and capacity for low-temperature bonding. In this study, we proposed magnetron-sputtered nanocrystalline Ag (Nano-Ag) film as a die-attach material for power device packaging. Low-temperature direct bonding of Nano-Ag films was achieved at 200 &#176;C in air, utilizing the thermal instability of Nano-Ag. Significant grain growth in Nano-Ag films facilitated the interfacial voids shrinkage, ultimately enabling high-quality bonding of Nano-Ag films.

The thermal resistance (Rth) measurement revealed that the Nano-Ag film die-attach layer exhibited a low Rth of 0.10 K/W, representing a reduction of 37.5% than the Ag nano-paste. Furthermore, the SiC devices using Nano-Ag film as die-attach material showed excellent electronic property and power cycling reliability, achieving a power cycling life of 19&#8201;240 cycles at a temperature swing of 150 &#176;C. These results indicate that this organic-free and dense Nano-Ag film is a promising die-attach material for enhancing the electronic property, thermal performance, and power cycling reliability of power modules.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive-Reset Extended Kalman Filter Method for Subsynchronous Oscillation Monitoring</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433725</link><description>The proliferation of renewable generations significantly in power system increases the severity and possibility of subsynchronous oscillations (SSOs) recently. Monitoring SSOs is critical for setting up control strategies and mitigating SSOs effectively. In many SSO events, the oscillation frequency and magnitude are time-varying, which brings great challenges to SSO monitoring. This article proposes an adaptive-reset extended Kalman filter (AREKF) method for accurate estimation of SSO modes. Two improvements are made to the EKF method. The first one is establishing a four-state SSO signal model for the EKF algorithm to track damping factors of SSO modes. The second one is developing an adaptive-reset method to make the EKF algorithm capable of handling the time-varying SSOs by resetting the covariance matrix adaptively. The threshold in the adaptive-reset criterion is automatically tuned with the M2M4 estimator. The performance of the AREKF method is demonstrated under various conditions and compared with that of conventional KF-based and phase-locked loop-based methods. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method as well as its superiority over conventional approaches. Real-time experiment results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in practical applications.</description></item><item><title>A High Conversion Ratio Converter Based on Tapped-Series Capacitor Circuit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10444032</link><description>A high conversion ratio converter is detailed analyzed in this article.

However, as a new type of power devices, aging/failure mechanisms of such are far less studied than silicon counterparts, making reliability one of the most formidable obstacles towards mass production. To mitigate this, device online condition monitoring is highly desirable, in which dynamic on-resistance, dRON, is popularly employed as an aging precursor. However, continuous and drastic changes of operation condition and switching dynamics make it highly challenging to measure dRON online accurately. To address such, this article introduces an integrated dRON full profile scan and offset calibration approach that allows GaN power devices to be monitored online without interrupting normal operation of device under test (DUT), making it a desirable plug-and-play solution to virtually all GaN-based power circuits.

The analysis reveals that electrochemical corrosion is the primary aging factor, with negligible capacitance reduction until catastrophic failure occurs. Further investigation, including temperature rise results and microstructure evaluation, indicates that the melting of the dielectric film is a crucial precursor to catastrophic failure. Finally, the possible degradation and failure mechanisms for this type of ac filtering capacitors are summarized. The observations provide a new perspective on the possible failure mechanisms and condition monitoring of film capacitors in ac filtering applications.</description></item><item><title>Grounded Thyristor Loop-Based Hybrid MMCs for Valve-Side Single-Phase-to-Ground Faults in Bipolar HVdc Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443523</link><description>The valve-side single-phase-to-ground (SPG) fault is one of the key challenges for the MMC-based bipolar HVdc system.

However, a more or less dispersity of the parallel chip parameters is inevitable, which may lead to the current imbalance. Due to the existence of dynamic threshold voltage drift, the dispersity of the threshold voltage of the parallel devices during the whole life is vital for the long-term reliability. This article aims to investigate how dispersity evolves and how it affects the current sharing. It is found that the threshold voltage dispersity indeed does not keep constant during the operation, but on the opposite, it increases with gate stress time, especially at elevated temperatures. This leads to the deterioration of the current sharing of parallel devices. A boost converter with two devices paralleled was built and tested, which validated that the threshold voltage dispersity and current imbalance ratio increase with stress time. Finally, a classification method is proposed to suppress the increase in threshold voltage dispersity and current imbalance ratio. These findings are believed to be useful to improve the performance of SiC mosfets in parallel applications.</description></item><item><title>Comprehensive Performance Improvement of SRG by Turn-ON Angle Optimization Using Linear Normalized Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10293265</link><description>Starter/generator systems based on switched reluctance generators (SRGs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional generators for aircraft and hybrid vehicles. To achieve optimal performance, it is critical to consider both machine performance and voltage quality, which are affected by the turn-on angle. Despite its significance, a lack of systematic analysis in existing literature has made it difficult to optimize both aspects of SRG performance. Therefore, this article investigates the influence of turn-on angle variation on the machine performance, including efficiency and power factor, and voltage quality, based on which a multiobjective optimization method is proposed to obtain the optimal turn-on angle for the overall performance improvement of SRG. What is particularly worth mentioning is that a linear normalized model of SRG is proposed for the first time to analytically express the voltage ripple, which makes the voltage quality evaluation more accurate and simple, and makes the optimized solution easily expanded to SRGs with different parameters. Experimental results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization method.</description></item><item><title>Various MPPT Modes and Dynamic Performance of Coupled Inductor Bipolar Multi-Output Converter With no Right Half Plane Zero</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10412684</link><description>This article proposes a coupled inductor bipolar multi-output converter (CI-BMC) and its four different operating modes for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) operations with improved dynamic performance during various transient and environmental conditions.

This hybrid structure utilizes FSBBs to regulate its output voltage by adjusting its duty cycle, handling a small portion of the total power, and providing a fast dynamic response. Meanwhile, the CLLC in the structure operates in a complete resonant state to ensure high system efficiency. By sharing a bridge arm between the FSBB and the CLLC, where one arm from each system serves a similar function, the number of switches utilized is significantly reduced, resulting in higher system efficiency. In addition to the structural improvements, to achieve a higher average system efficiency under different loads, this article presents an efficiency-based parameter design methodology. Furthermore, phase shift, an additional control freedom of FSBB, is employed to further enhance the system's overall efficiency; however, calculating the relationship between efficiency and phase shift can be burdensome, especially in real-time controllers. To address this issue, this article proposes a fitting-model-based maximum efficiency tracking approach to reduce calculation complexity. Ultimately, experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design, highlighting its enhanced performance.</description></item><item><title>Dual-Transformer-Based DAB Converter With Controllable Integrated Inductances</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10438883</link><description>A dual-transformer-based dual active bridge (DT DAB) converter is proposed in this article. The proposed DT DAB has a small input current ripple and a wide voltage range because the magnetizing inductances of the dual transformers can be used as the input filter inductances at the same time. In addition, the zero-voltage-switching of all switches in the full load range under a wide range of input voltage variation can be realized. Unlike the previous three-winding-coupled-inductor-based DAB converter, in the proposed DT DAB converter, the magnetizing inductances and leakage inductances can be all integrated into split UI core-based dual transformers and controlled accurately. Moreover, the split UI cores can reduce the layers of PCB windings and a low-profile design can be achieved. Furthermore, to obtain the magnetic integration design with low loss, a systematic design methodology for the planar integration magnetics is introduced to make a tradeoff between efficiency and power density. Finally, the validity of the proposed topology and design is verified by experimental results from a 1-kW laboratory prototype.</description></item><item><title>A Comprehensive Review of Integrated Three-Port DC&#8211;DC Converters With Key Performance Indices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10439655</link><description>Integrated three-port dc&#8211;dc converters (TPCs) exhibit obvious advantages in achieving flexible power flow regulation among photovoltaic (PV) module port, battery port, and load/grid port in distributed PV power generating systems. In the past three to five years, many new TPC schemes have been proposed, exhibiting unique characteristics, including isolation performance, number of components, and efficiency, which cannot be accurately described using traditional TPC classification methods. Moreover, there has been a lack of comparison of key performance indicators for a large number of TPC schemes in previous studies. Therefore, a comprehensive review on circuit topologies and control techniques of TPCs by properly defining key performance indicators becomes essential for converting high fluctuation solar energy into reliable and stable power while maintaining high efficiency and small footprint. This article is just to fill this gap by a comparative analysis and overview of classical and recently reported TPC schemes with key performance indexes. After introducing main operation modes of TPCs during one day, four topological structures of TPCs composed of two or three two-port dc&#8211;dc converters are classified and comparatively analyzed. Four important indexes of TPCs, namely voltage gain, control coupling, soft switching, and high-stress working, are used for a fair and comprehensive performance comparison. The advantages and disadvantages of various TPC schemes are featured, leading to a guidance for the selection of TPCs under different scenarios and valuable suggestions for the future development of TPCs.</description></item><item><title>Prediction-Based MIMO Control of a Multiport Magnetic-Coupled Energy Router</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10440508</link><description>Multiport power converters are important for energy routing in renewable energy applications. Particularly, magnetic-coupled multiport converters are especially advantageous in terms of galvanic isolation and reduced number of magnetic components. They also enable highly integrated and modularized circuit designs. Meanwhile, their multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) nature complicates the control, particularly with a possibly large number of ports for routing purposes. Unlike the existing single-input and single-output (SISO) controls, this article develops a continuous-control-set model predictive control (MPC)-based MIMO control scheme that improves the dynamic performance of the multiport power converters, minimizes interference among different ports, and simplifies the controller design process. The aspects of state-space MIMO modeling, optimization problem definition and solution, and necessary modifications are systematically discussed for practical real-time implementation, especially on low-cost microcontroller units (MCUs). Finally, the developed MPC-based MIMO control is experimentally validated by a prototype eight-port energy router (800 W maximum power) exhibiting superior dynamic responses and a high system efficiency above 94% over a wide power range.</description></item><item><title>Mathematical Modeling and Optimization for the Power Density of the Free-Standing Magnetic Field Energy Harvester</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10444935</link><description>The free-standing magnetic field energy harvester (FSMFEH) offers a potential solution for powering sensors in the power grid. However, designing the FSMFEH through finite element simulations and experiments is time-consuming and difficult to summarize generalized design guidelines. To address this issue, a mathematical model relating the power density to the coil and core parameters is developed in this article. A correction term is introduced to reflect the aggregation of the H-shaped core to the external magnetic field. The experimental results show that the model error is less than 4%. Based on this model, the core geometry, core material, coil turns, and wire radius are optimized to enhance the power density of the FSMFEH. It is found that the coil has a significant impact on the power density, which deviates from previous studies that solely focus on the core volume. The induced voltage of the coil is also considered in the optimization procedure. The optimized FSMFEH attains an output power of 6.33 mW with a magnetic field of 200 &#956;T/50 Hz. Compared to previous studies, the FSMFEH designed in this work can achieve high power and power density with a smaller size and weaker external magnetic field.</description></item><item><title>On the Limitations of the Coupled Mode Theory and Parity-Time Symmetry for Near-Field Wireless Power Transfer Research</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10391278</link><description>The coupled mode theory (CMT) and parity-time (PT) symmetry were recently used in studying wireless power transfer (WPT) systems. This paper re-examines these approaches. The limitations of CMT and PT symmetry are identified and highlighted so that WPT researchers can avoid their pitfalls. Electric circuit theory (ECT) is based on laws of physics and offers exact solutions. CMT is actually derived from ECT through two simplification stages, and it only gives approximate solutions. CMT involves assumptions that neglect high-frequency components in the WPT systems. Therefore, CMT cannot offer more information and better accuracy than ECT for WPT studies. The PT symmetry leads to the zero-phase-angle condition that was well known from previous WPT research based on ECT for minimizing reactive power flow and maximizing efficiency. The limitations of these two approaches are explained in detail and compared with ECT with practical examples. Both theoretical and practical results are included in the comparison. These results show that CMT and PT symmetry have shortcomings arising from their respective underlying assumptions. They do not offer new explanations and insights that ECT cannot offer. ECT is still the most appropriate analytical tool to study near-field WPT systems on the conditions that the dimensions of the circuit components are much smaller than the wavelengths of the operating frequencies.</description></item><item><title>A New Design and Analysis for Metasurface-Based Near-Field Magnetic Wireless Power Transfer for Deep Implants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10400819</link><description>Wireless power transfer (WPT) is a crucial enabler for the long-term powering of existing implantable medical devices (IMDs). This article proposes a new design and analysis methodology for a tunable metasurface (MTS) based near-field magnetic WPT system. A near-field magnetic WPT system using a multi-coil topology creates stable power with a low specific absorption rate. However, maintaining the optimal performance of a system under misalignment conditions continues to be a challenging issue. To address this issue, the proposed design method enables the optimal coupling of the WPT system by tuning the system capacitances at a fixed frequency. Moreover, it is undefined to accurately determine the effective permeability of the MTS in the near-field range. Therefore, based on optimized results, a method is proposed to retrieve effective permeability in near-field scenarios. The effective permeability results are distinct from the typical response of the Lorentz oscillator. As a result, the specific connection between the optimization method and retrieval of effective permeability has been established. The methodology is applied to an exemplified system, where the maximal simulated and measured power transfer efficiencies at an implant depth of 8 cm are 2.32% and 2.60%, respectively. In addition, the planar MTS exhibits a high lateral misalignment tolerance, thereby enabling the development of a reliable WPT system for continuous power supply to IMDs.</description></item><item><title>Memristor Equivalent Model of an Inductive Wireless Power Transfer System Based on the Sigmoid Function</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10411131</link><description>The bridge rectifier with filter circuit is a fundamental component of inductive wireless power transfer (IWPT) and other power electronic systems that accomplish ac&#8211;dc conversion. It belongs to the category of extended memristors. Circuits containing this component may exhibit unconventional dynamical characteristics, such as hidden attractors, coexistence of multiple attractors, multistability, and transient transitions. These characteristics increase system uncertainty. Focusing on IWPT systems with different compensation topologies, this article establishes memristor mathematical models for two types of bridge rectifier circuits, namely C-filtering and LC-filtering, based on the sigmoid function. Taking the S-S type IWPT system as an example, an equivalent memristor circuit model was developed, and the established model was verified through simulations and experiments. The results show that the established model accurately captures the static and dynamic characteristics of a system. The load characteristic of the IWPT system follows a pinched hysteresis loop, aligning with the three memristor features. The established model is concise in form and can uniformly describe the continuous conduction and discontinuous conduction modes. It perfectly models continuous and smooth instantaneous values and offers a suitable tool for analyzing system dynamics.</description></item><item><title>A Front-End Monitoring Method for Coupling Coefficient and Receiver Resonant Frequency in the SS-Compensated Wireless Power Transfer Systems With Unknown Receiver Parameters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10415543</link><description>In this article, a front-end monitoring method is proposed to estimate the coupling coefficient and receiver resonant frequency in the series&#8211;series compensated wireless power transfer systems. The proposal requires no prior knowledge of the receiver circuit parameters, such as the self-inductance of the coil, compensated capacitor, load resistance, and resonant frequency. Hence, it is suitable for the development of universal wireless charging systems and is immune against parameter tolerances and aging effects. It uses a sensing coil, which is decoupled from the transmitter coil but coupled with the receiver coil, to detect the phase information of the current on the receiver side. Only one zero-crossing sensor is required to detect the voltage information in the sensing coil. Two frequency sweeping processes are included to find the frequency points where the ac output voltage is in phase or out of phase with the ac input voltage. In the experiment, the estimation errors are less than 4.91% for the coupling coefficients and 1.33% for the receiver resonant frequencies. In addition, the estimation is extremely fast. The estimation time is within 5&#8211;9 ms.</description></item><item><title>Improved H&#8734; Control for Input-Series&#8211;Output-Series Multichannel Inductive Power Transfer System Considering Parameter Inconsistency and Load Perturbation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10416756</link><description>To achieve stable output and enhance the robustness of input-series&#8211;output-series multichannel inductive power transfer system under parameter inconsistency and load perturbation, an improved H&#8734; robust control is proposed in this article. First, the control effect of multichannel system is analyzed, which transfers the controller design into single system with uncertainty. Then, a linear model is established based on generalized state space averaged method and the influence of parameter inconsistency and load perturbation is analyzed. After that, the uncertain model is obtained via frequency-domain analysis, generating a numerical solution of weighting function to describe the uncertainty of parameter inconsistency and load perturbation. Based on the proposed weighting function, the improved H&#8734; robust controller is designed and the dynamic performance and robustness of the close-loop system is analyzed. Finally, a down-scale prototype with three channels is built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the system obtains good dynamic performance and strong robustness against parameter inconsistency and load perturbation. When load changes between 60 and 80 &#937;, the settling time is less than 4.7 ms with the overshoot being less than 7.3%. Even against large load perturbations, the settling time is still less than 8 ms.</description></item><item><title>Research on Mutual Inductance Identification and Efficiency Optimization of the Three-Coil Wireless Power Transfer Systems With Switchable Relay Coil</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10423809</link><description>One of the most difficult problems of the three-coil wireless power transfer (WPT) systems is that the receiving coil is hardly fully aligned with the transmitting and relay coils, which affects the efficiency of the practical system seriously as the coupling exists among the transmitting, relay and receiving coils simultaneously. Therefore, this article presents a new mutual inductance identification and efficiency optimization method for the three-coil WPT system with a switchable relay coil. First, the mathematical model of the three-coil WPT system with and without the relay coil is constructed. Second, the mutual inductance identification method is proposed to analyze the mutual inductances among the three coils by the switchable relay coil, which does not need complicated mathematical calculation strategies and the operating frequency of the system can be held constant. Then the coil-to-coil efficiency of the system is compared with and without the relay coil when the load resistance or position varies. Finally, a coil-to-coil efficiency improvement method is proposed to ensure that the system can always operate under high-efficiency conditions according to the identified mutual inductances of the three-coil WPT system.</description></item><item><title>Optimized Design of Passive Array Coils for High-Efficiency and Anti-Misalignment WPT System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433699</link><description>Mid-range wireless power transfer (WPT) system for consumer electronics has been hamstrung by modest energy efficiencies and low misalignment tolerance. As the increase in transfer distance, the increasing leakage magnetic flux between transmitting coil and receiving will deteriorate the system performance. In this article, a novel optimization-based design method of passive array coils (PACs) is presented in order to maximize the power transfer efficiency (PTE) and improve the misalignment tolerance in WPT system. A modified multiobjective genetic algorithm is implemented to optimize parameters of PACs in consideration of PTE, displacement flexibility and volume of PACs. Moreover, a parameter design scheme for compensation network, namely Series-Seriess-Series topology for co-planar multiple coils is investigated, which can achieve zero phase angle in primary side and enhance power factor. Finally, the reasonable prototype of the proposed WPT system with PACs is designed, fabricated and tested. The experimental results show that the proposed structure can increase the efficiency by almost 50% over the system without PACs at 400 mm distance and deliver almost 40 W of output power. Moreover, the PTE and output power can still remain stable under large lateral misalignment with PACs.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Design of Load-Independent Series Resonant Power Amplifier With Constant Current Output and Its Application for WPT System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10440459</link><description>This article presents an analysis and design of a load-independent (LI) series resonant (SR) power amplifier with constant current (CC) output, along with its application for an MHz wireless power transfer (WPT) system. A novel inverse Class E power amplifier is introduced, which essentially produces a sinusoidal output current even with a low-$Q$ SR filter. Besides, the proposed amplifier achieves zero-current switching and CC output simultaneously, regardless of the load resistance. The LI operation is obtained for a specific set of component values, whose design conditions are clarified analytically in this article. The experiment was carried out with a WPT system incorporating the proposed amplifier as a transmitter and the Class D rectifier as a receiver. Although the input reactance of the Class D rectifier changed against dc-load variations due to the parasitic capacitances, the proposed amplifier showed consistent CC operation by using the low-$Q$ SR filter. Also, the proposed WPT system maintained a low total harmonic distortion of the transmission current over the wide load range, even with the low-$Q$ output filter. The prototype WPT system with the proposed amplifier achieved 88% power-delivery efficiency with 60 W output power at 3.39 MHz transmission frequency. The experimental results showed the effectiveness of the proposed amplifier.</description></item><item><title>A Simultaneous Wireless Power and Coil Inductance Insensitive Data Transfer System for Rotary Structures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10440478</link><description>This article proposes a simultaneous wireless power and coil inductance-insensitive data transfer system for rotary structures. Power and data are transferred simultaneously via a pair of coupled coils, adopting frequency division multiplexing technology. The data carrier is injected into and extracted from the power transfer channel by inductors connected serially with the coupled coils and by multiplexing the compensation networks of the power transfer channel. The transfer gain of the data transfer channel is insensitive to the inductances of the coupled coils within a certain interval. LCLC compensation topology is proposed to realize constant voltage output and to filter the high-order harmonics out of the power transfer channel, reducing the total harmonic distortion and creating a favorable condition for simultaneous data transfer. The circuit model is built to analyze the power and data transfer performance, and the complex-frequency-domain model of the system is established to analyze the responses of power interference. Finally, the feasibility of the technology proposed is verified by a 300 W prototype with a data rate of 40 kbps.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Type of 3-D Transmitter for Omnidirectional Wireless Power Transfer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443506</link><description>In a wireless power transfer (WPT) system based on coupled magnetic resonance, 2-D planar coils are commonly used as coupling structures. As the spatial position between the coupling structures changes, the system transmission efficiency decreases dramatically, seriously reducing the flexibility of power transfer. To solve this problem and achieve a power transfer with a high degree of freedom in a 3-D space, a novel 3-D coil based on a 26-faced polyhedron is proposed as the transmitting coil winding structure, which is wound using the regular monolithic winding method without overlapping. By means of this coil, it is ensured that the winding direction of each planar coil is different from those of the adjacent planes so that the magnetic fields between adjacent coils are mutually reinforced, thus enhancing the spatial magnetic field density of the system and enabling a stable and efficient transmission of power at any position. The transmitting coil can be enlarged by changing the coil structure, thereby enabling omnidirectional WPT in a larger space. Through experimental research, the system can achieve omnidirectional WPT with an efficiency of 60%, and its transmission efficiency can remain stable within a defined range as the receiver moves.</description></item><item><title>Direct Power Regulation of Grid-Connected Voltage-Source Inverters Based on Bang-Bang Funnel Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10243451</link><description>This article proposes a direct power control strategy based on bang-bang funnel control (BBFC-DPC) for the three-phase grid-connected voltage-source inverters. The BBFC has inherently robust nature due to its model-free design. It can provide time-optimal dynamics and effectively constrain the tracking error of output variables within the prespecified funnels. The BBFC-DPC approach is implemented based on a newly established DPC model in the abc frame, which enables satisfying decoupled power control without using coordinate transformations and feedforward decoupling terms. Built upon the merits of BBFC, the BBFC-DPC features high-quality static output performance, promoted dynamic responses, stronger robustness against parameter uncertainties, and pleasing resilience to slight grid disturbances. Moreover, an extended BBFC-DPC scheme equipped with reactive power support and current limitation functions is developed as a feasible alternative to tackle unbalanced network conditions in weak grid. Finally, both the simulation and experimental results are well in line with the theoretical expectations, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Segment Switching Method of Three-Phase Wireless Power Transmitter for AGV</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10258057</link><description>This article proposes a segment-switching method of a three-phase wireless power transmitter for automatic guided vehicles (AGV). The method includes the segmented coil structure, the segment-switching control, and circuit configuration with resonant devices. The segmented coil structure ensures that mutual inductance between the transmitter phase coils and the receiver coil is in a three-phase balance. The segment-switching is conducted in each phase; depending on the receiver coil position, the segment of each phase is changed independently and sequentially. The mutual inductances between the transmitter phase coils vary significantly depending on the switching state. The proposed circuit configuration has resonant devices to cancel the variable mutual inductances for effective operation. The receiver position is estimated by the unbalanced current control. Experiments confirm that the method can perform a power transfer of 300W with a slight variation to a moving AGV, equipping the receiver at 30m/min as well as an AGV at a standstill.</description></item><item><title>Delta-Type Serial Shunt Soft Normally-Open Points With Wide Power Flow Regulation Range in Distributed Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10246800</link><description>The soft normally-open points (SNOP) have been proposed in response to challenges raised from renewable energy in the grid. Main scheme adopted in SNOP demonstration projects are back-to-back modular multilevel converter (BTB-MMC), which is costly in multifeeder scenarios. The series shunt multiport SNOP (S2-MSNOP) can reduce the cost and volume. But its energy balance faces difficulties under operating conditions where reactive power provided by the cascaded H-bridge of the device is too small, thus impeding its practical implementation. Accordingly, this article presents a novel delta-type serial shunt soft-normally open points (D-S3NOP) scheme, offering a practical multifeeder interconnection solution. D-S3NOP employs an internal circulating current mechanism to achieve energy balance among its constituent parts, thereby expanding the power flow regulation range. First, the topology feature and working principle of D-S3NOP are presented. Subsequently, a suitable control strategy is designed. Comparison of power flow regulation area and cost among S2-MSNOP, D-S3NOP, and BTB-MMC is made after. Finally, a simulation model and an experimental prototype are constructed for verifying the effectiveness of D-S3NOP.</description></item><item><title>A Coupled-Inductor-Based Input-Parallel Output-Parallel Quasi-Resonant Single-Stage DC&#8211;DC Converter to Mitigate Current Difference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10264791</link><description>The input-parallel output-parallel (IPOP) dc&#8211;dc converter is suitable for high-current applications, such as voltage regulator module. However, the parameter mismatch in the IPOP converter causes uneven current sharing between the constituent modules, which makes the IPOP converter unreliable for practical use. In this article, a coupled-inductor-based IPOP quasi-resonant (QR) single-stage dc&#8211;dc converter is proposed to mitigate the current difference. The coupled inductor integrates the discrete external inductors of parallel modules to automatically balance the primary currents between modules and act as resonant inductors, which can reduce the number of magnetic components and simplify the control strategy. Besides, primary switches of QR single-stage converter can achieve zero-voltage switching (ZVS), and synchronous rectifiers can achieve ZVS and zero-current switching with the resonance, resulting in the efficiency improvement. What is more, the current sharing method can be extended to an N-module converter with an N-phase coupled inductor. Finally, a 48-V/1.8-V 144-W two-module QR single-stage converter prototype is made and tested to verify the analysis.</description></item><item><title>Experimental Validation and Reliability Analyses of Minimum Voltage Control in Modular Multilevel Converter-Based STATCOM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10236896</link><description>The application of modular multilevel converters (MMCs) as medium voltage static synchronous compensators (STATCOMs) has aroused interest in recent years. Nevertheless, the implementation of this converter is still expensive. Consequently, improvements in the efficiency and reliability of MMC-STATCOM are essential to reduce operational costs and enable the use of this technology. The recently proposed minimum voltage control (MVC) can potentially improve converter reliability and reduce losses by controlling the submodule (SM) voltage as the minimum required at each operational condition. Nevertheless, the evaluation of MVC during transients and with different insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) blocking voltages is still missing in the literature. This work aims to fulfill this gap by experimentally validating MVC in an MMC setup platform in steady-state and during transient conditions. Moreover, it also analyzes the role of the IGBT blocking voltage and modulation strategy on the reliability and the reduction of losses of an MMC-STATCOM when MVC is employed. The experimental results demonstrated a slower power response and lower SM voltage for all operational conditions with MVC, compared with the conservative approach. The reliability results demonstrate that MVC can reduce the wear-out of semiconductor devices and capacitors (around 53%) in all cases studied.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Multiple-Medium-AC-Port Power Electronic Transformer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10219432</link><description>The multiport power electronic transformer (PET) is a critical equipment in ac/dc hybrid distribution grids, which has the functions of multidirectional power flow, flexible power flow regulation and reactive power control, and fault isolation. However, most proposed PETs have only a single-medium-voltage-ac (MVac) port, limiting their application scenarios in distribution grids. To address this problem, in this article, we propose a PET topology with multiple controllable MVac ports based on the cascaded H-bridge PET. The proposed PET topology can connect to multiple-MVac feeders and supply low-voltage-side loads through multiple terminals, achieving the full utilization of the remaining capacity of connected feeders, thus delaying the distribution capacity expansion and grid upgrade due to the rapid development of energy electrification. Besides, the decoupling control of active and reactive power for each feeder can be achieved. In this article, the operating principle, energy balance mechanism, control strategies, and design and comprehensive comparison of the proposed topology are studied. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed topology and control strategy.</description></item><item><title>Fast and Accurate Neutral-Point Voltage Control Under Balanced and Unbalanced Neutral-Point Voltage for Coupled Ten-Switch Three-Phase Three-Level Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10261314</link><description>Virtual space vector modulation (VSVM) is capable of suppressing neutral-point voltage (NPV) ripples in a coupled ten-switch three-phase three-level inverter. However, it presents a low NPV control (NPVC) speed. In this article, an enhanced VSVM (EVSVM) with the improved NPVC speed for balanced and unbalanced NPVs is proposed. By analyzing the features of the defined virtual vectors under the unbalanced NPV, the region division and duty ratio calculation are properly modified. Two coefficients are configured in the EVSVM. One distributes the duty ratios of two virtual small vectors to improve the NPVC speed, whereas another adjusts two pairs of redundant small vectors considering the NP current polarity to achieve accurate active NPVC. The highlight of this method is the improved NPVC speed and zero NP current in each switching cycle in a steady state. Theoretical analysis shows that the EVSVM increases the available NP current by 4.5% at least under a higher modulation index. Besides, the EVSVM could regulate the NPV without obvious ac ripples and dc offset under a full range of modulation index and power factor for both balanced and unbalanced NPVs. The feasibility and performance of the proposed modulation and control strategies are verified by a 3-kVA experimental prototype.</description></item><item><title>Predictive Control of Voltage Source Inverter: An Online Reinforcement Learning Solution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10244194</link><description>The focus of this article is to introduce the concept of an online reinforcement learning (RL) solution and to propose a novel finite control-set model predictive control framework subject to system uncertainties, which possesses the excellent applicative potential for power converter systems with unknown perturbations.

To be more precise, a critic neural network is responsible for learning a strategic utility function online, and an actor network is developed to derive control behaviors by approximating the unknown model dynamics and optimizing the learned utility function obtained from the critic network. Compared to previous works, it not only attenuates the inherent issues of system uncertainties and unknown disturbances, but also provides a flexible framework and allows the enhancement of control property. Furthermore, by deploying the Lyapunov approach, it shows that all signals in the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, numerical simulation and experiments validate our theoretical findings.</description></item><item><title>Single-Stage 48 V/1.8 V Converter With a Novel Integrated Magnetics and 1000 W/in3 Power Density</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10246797</link><description>High-efficiency, high-power-density 48-V voltage regulator modules are crucial and also challenging for 48-V data center power architecture. In this article, a novel single-stage 48 V/1.8 V converter for high-performance microprocessors is proposed, offering ultrahigh power density and high efficiency. The converter utilizes a novel magnetic structure that integrates the transformers and four-phase coupled inductors of two current doubler rectifiers. The magnetic structure design guidelines highlight the tradeoff between the coupling coefficient and magnetic core size. To minimize core and winding losses while maintaining compactness, small core legs are employed in corner areas, replacing the bulky leakage legs. In addition, the printed circuit board winding arrangement is optimized, with the use of buried vias further reducing winding loss. Finally, a 48 V/1.8 V prototype is designed with 93.1% peak efficiency and 1037 W/in3 power density, including its gate driver loss and size. The prototype can handle 120 A continuous current and 300 A peak current for 2 ms &#215; 62 Hz, with 500 linear feet per minute air cooling.</description></item><item><title>Research on Maximum Power Point Tracking Control in Omnidirectional Wireless Power Transfer System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10225390</link><description>In an omnidirectional wireless power transfer (OWPT) system, the frequent movement of load coils leads to a significant decrease in transmission power and efficiency. In order to obtain better-received power, the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) method for the load coil is commonly used. However, the existing methods are slow in detection speed and cannot achieve fast tracking effect on load movement. Based on the current amplitude modulation strategy, the mathematical model of the OWPT system with three orthogonal transmitting coils and one load coil is established in this article. By analyzing the relationship between load power and transmission power, the MPPT problem of the load coil can be transformed into an optimization problem of the maximum output power on the transmission coil side. And an invasive weed optimization algorithm is proposed to change the current injected into the orthogonal transmission coils to indirectly achieve the maximum power of the load coil. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reduces the convergence time of MPPT to less than 100 ms, and proves the correctness and feasibility of the method.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Online Induction Motor Parameter Adjustment Method for Maximum Torque Output</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10225308</link><description>Electric vehicle motors are expected to both run stably and output maximum power. However, most existing online motor parameter estimation methods are model-based, which aim to estimate parameter values for stable running but not necessarily for maximum power output. In order to address this issue, this article proposes a data-driven rotor resistance adjustment method, aiming to ensure that induction motors output maximized torque over a broad range of operating conditions. The method differs from traditional model-based approaches, as it converges to the motor's optimal states through analyzing operating data, rather than relying on mathematical models. The proposed method consists of two stages: an offline data-mining stage and an online parameter adjustment stage. With the computationally intensive part performed in the offline stage, the timeliness of the online operation can be ensured. Experimental results show that the method can complete the parameter adjustment task within 1&#8211;5 s during online operation, and result in 10%&#8211;15% higher torque production than classical model-based methods under a wide range of operation conditions. Therefore, the proposed method is well-suited for electric vehicle motor control. Furthermore, comparative studies indicate that the proposed method's performance remains unaffected by model errors, showing better robustness than traditional model-driven methods.</description></item><item><title>Discontinuous Modulated Model Predictive Control for Low Inductance High-Speed Electric Drive Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10229938</link><description>The performance improvement of high-power density electric machines with low inductance values for high-speed applications is still under investigation. The low inductance characteristics present higher harmonics and poor dynamic performance while applying the conventional control methods in the current loop. Modulated model predictive control (M2PC) with higher dynamics performance is a promising solution, which has been successfully applied to different applications including electric drive applications. However, the M2PC control of a machine with low inductance has not been fully investigated. Besides, the power converter operation can be improved through the implementation of certain switching patterns including discontinuous pulsewidth modulation (DPWM). So, a new strategy is proposed through the implementation of the M2PC controller based on the DPWM for low inductance electric machines. The presence of the modulator reduces the harmonic content while still maintaining the fast dynamic response of the M2PC. Also, the DPWM will provide higher voltage utilization, lower switching losses, and more potential to increase the switching frequency for a wide range of operating conditions. The proposed strategy has been applied successfully to a low inductance drive system as a case study with direct and quadrature axis inductances of 74 &#956;H. The system has been tested and results have been demonstrated.</description></item><item><title>Open-Circuit Fault Diagnosis Strategy for Novel DFPMM Drive Based on Fuzzy Logic</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10255292</link><description>To diagnose different types of open-circuit (OC) faults in novel dual-winding fault-tolerant permanent magnet motor (DFPMM) drive, a fault diagnosis strategy based on fuzzy logic is proposed and investigated. The proposed DFPMM drive requires less independent power supply and power switches, its reliability, utilization, and power density are improved compared with some existing multiphase fault-tolerant drives. To locate power switch intermittent OC fault that is difficult to be diagnosed by traditional strategies, the fuzzy logic theory is used in the proposed strategy, the membership functions and fuzzy rules in the proposed fuzzy logic system are specially designed and optimized to meet the requirements of fault diagnosis. The proposed fault diagnosis strategy has strong robustness, due to the optimized dynamic average calculation cycle and normalization, its diagnosis results are not affected by speed or load mutation; Additionally, an error-proof processor is added to the system as a part of the proposed strategy, which prevents misdiagnosis by improving the shape of phase current waveform when DFPMM operates at no-load or light-load state. The proposed strategy can quickly and accurately locate winding OC, power switch OC, and power switch intermittent OC faults in DFPMM drive, furthermore, it can quantify the fault level of intermittent OC fault for staff to take different remedial measures according to different situations.

Moreover, the power consumption of these fans are more than 35 W. A high step-down gain (HSDG) switched-inductor Zeta active power factor correction (SI-Zeta-APFC) converter with change in output-voltage (15&#8211;48 V) for a ceiling fan is presented to improve the supply side power quality (SSPQ) performance. For the reduced voltage source inverter (VSI) losses, a 48-V BLDCM for CF is wound, and it is driven by VSI at a fundamental switching. The HSDG converter with a low-side switch enhances the discontinuous inductor current mode (DICM) performance and its driver circuit with desired duty. A DICM-operated SI-Zeta-APFC converter at a high-frequency switching (200 kHz) is designed to reduce the components size, and it offers inherent SSPQ. This motor-drive draws the reduced current from the dc-link, which minimizes i2R losses. These modifications considerably reduce the supply's input power, improving the PQ performance. For the sensorless operation of a motor, a back-EMF control is utilized. Finally, its effectiveness is investigated with a laboratory-developed prototype. Test result comparisons are shown to validate performance over a conventional CF.</description></item><item><title>Fast Calibration With Raw Data Verification for Current Measurement of Dual-PMSM Drives</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10251615</link><description>Dual permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) based electric powertrain has been widely used in electric vehicles. Torque ripple caused by current measurement errors has a huge impact on the performance of dual-PMSM based electric powertrain. Currently, the measurement errors of current sensors in a dual-PMSM system are individually calibrated results in inconsistent calibration standards. The inconsistent calibration for errors of current sensor affects the current distribution of dual-PMSM based electric powertrain, thus making the motors unable to output power based on the specified ratio. To unify the calibration standards of dual-PMSM subsystems, a fast calibration method with high reliability is proposed in this article. The proposed calibration method is able to: check the rationality of the compensation values to eliminate the wrong value in the sampling process, and calibrate within one second even under the conditions of load distribution, speed mutation, no-load, interference or noise. A 2 kW dual-PMSM based electric powertrain testing rig is employed to verify the effectiveness of proposed calibration method.</description></item><item><title>Impedance Buffer-Based Reactance Cancellation Method for CLC-S Compensated Wireless Power Transfer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10264788</link><description>Due to the inevitable variation of component parameters, interference of ferromagnetic foreign body, active regulation of operation frequency, and rectification effect caused virtual capacitance or inductance, zero-phase-angle (ZPA) operation and zero-voltage switching (ZVS) could hardly be maintained without extra control strategies, especially for high-order compensation WPT system.

To maximize the potential benefit, differential power processing (DPP) converters can be implemented to maximize solar energy capture in partial shading conditions. Furthermore, an isolated high step-up converter is required to transfer solar energy to the high-voltage battery, and a buck converter is useful to create an efficient direct path from the solar cells to the low-voltage accessory bus. If implementing these power electronic requirements with separate converters, the component count is high and power density can suffer. Thus, this article proposes the first multiport converter with solar DPP, an isolated high-voltage output port, and a low-voltage port, which is uniquely suited for solar-charged EVs. The switch count is low, and a simple control strategy is proposed to allow separate control of the two output ports. A 200-W experimental prototype is built and tested and shows a peak efficiency of 96.7% when solar power is flowing to both the high-voltage and low-voltage ports.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Weighting Factor Design of Finite Control Set Model Predictive Control Based on Multiobjective Ant Colony Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10227545</link><description>In this article, an improved multiobjective ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is proposed to design the weighting factors (WFs) in the model predictive control of power converters.

However, these methods are not the most effective approaches and would further affect the overall system performance of BIPT converters. To date, no detailed analysis of deadtime effects and optimum deadtime control schemes has been reported for BIPT converters. In this article, an accurate and comprehensive analysis of the deadtime effects and the factors affecting its choice are discussed. Based on the analysis, an effective and optimum deadtime control scheme for BIPT converters is proposed, which dynamically optimizes the deadtime while ensuring zero-voltage-switching for different operating conditions. Finally, an experimental prototype is built to verify the analysis of the deadtime influence and the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.</description></item><item><title>Bridgeless Cuk PFC Converter With Soft Switching in Full Input Voltage and Load Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10225352</link><description>In this article, a new bridgeless Cuk power factor correction converter is presented. The proposed converter is capable of providing full soft switching operation for all semiconductor components in the entire line cycle and load variations, only by a single auxiliary switch. The converter operates in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) that intrinsically provides low input current total harmonic distortion (THD) without any input filter. Despite imposing higher current stress on semiconductors in DCM, the proposed converter achieves high efficiency due to its soft switching operation.

The proposed converter optimally integrates the coupled inductors, voltage multiplier cells, and series capacitor techniques to attain high voltage gain with low voltage stress. Moreover, in this configuration, the voltage multiplier circuit not only participates in increasing the voltage gain but also absorbs the leakage energy. In addition, zero-voltage switching and zero-current switching conditions are obtained for all switches and diodes, respectively. As a result, overall efficiency is improved. In this topology, the leakage inductance of the coupled inductors is used as a resonant inductor. Therefore, no additional magnetic core is needed. Furthermore, the ripple of the input current is reduced by using the interleaving technique.

However, the resonant current often contains nonnegligible harmonics, which may cause large error in the detected phase. To solve the problem, this article proposes an in-phase/quadrature (I/Q)-based phase synchronization method for BWPT system, which is insensitive to the harmonics and does not require complicated signal processing circuit or digital signal processing technique. The basic characteristics of the BWPT system are introduced with the harmonic characteristics analyzed. The phase synchronization method is proposed, in which the resonant current signal is equivalently multiplied with a pair of virtual quadrature five-level staircase signals for phase detection. Certain orders of harmonics in the five-level staircase signals are eliminated to reduce the influence of current harmonics. The influence of harmonics on phase detection error of the proposed method is analyzed. The experimental results show that the phase-lock error with the proposed method is small under various conditions, and the proposed method has a fast transient response.</description></item><item><title>A Low Power IPT System With Integrated Magnetics and Hybrid Tuning for Metal Object Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10215059</link><description>Metal object detection (MOD) plays a crucial role in ensuring the safe operation of inductive power transfer (IPT) systems. One of the main challenges in MOD is distinguishing magnetic misalignments from the presence of metal objects, especially when ferrite cores are utilized. This article proposes an IPT system with integrated magnetics and a hybrid tuning circuit designed to differentiate the existence of a metal object from coil misalignments involving ferrite cores. To enable this differentiation, a hybrid tuning method is developed by incorporating an additional coil with series and parallel configurations. This configuration allows the system to resonate at two distinct frequencies. Despite being magnetically decoupled, the extra tuning inductor is physically integrated into the transmitter (Tx) pad, thereby enhancing the system's metal object detection capability. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the ratio between the two resonant frequencies remains approximately the same even under misaligned conditions, but this ratio varies when a metal object is present. Simulation results further illustrate that both nonferromagnetic and ferromagnetic metal objects can be effectively detected by monitoring the ratio between the two resonant frequencies as part of the handshaking process prior to power transfer. A 10 W working prototype is built, and the experimental results demonstrate that a metal object with an object-to-coil size ratio down to 0.2 can be effectively detected even when the magnetic misalignment is increased to 20%.</description></item><item><title>High-Precision Control for Auxiliary Resonant Snubber Converter Considering Dead-Time Effect and On-Resistance of Switching Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10246791</link><description>On-resistance of switching device and dead-time effect are both the major contributors to nonlinear output error, which is the main problem of switching power amplifier in ultra-precision positioning application. Due to zero-current clamping and estimation error, these error sources are hardly to be completely compensated at same time. Therefore, a high-precision control strategy for auxiliary resonant snubber converter (ARSC) which is a zero-voltage switching power amplifier is proposed to solve the problems above. Moreover, the proposed strategy does not require precise parameters to estimate the error. In this article, the generation mechanism of the nonlinear output error in the ARSC is analyzed, and the error analytical model is established. In addition, the proposed strategy and its design method are introduced. Finally, the proposed strategy is verified on the experimental platform. The experimental results show that the quality of the output current is effectively improved with the proposed control strategy.</description></item><item><title>Highly Efficient Asymmetric Boost Half-Bridge Diode-Clamped DC/DC Converter Under Wide Input Voltage Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10246803</link><description>This article proposes highly efficient asymmetric boost half-bridge diode-clamped dc/dc converter that can accommodate a wide input voltage range. The proposed converter uses a boost half-bridge structure at the primary side and an active diode-clamped cell at the secondary side along with small size primary-side/secondary-side capacitors. Thus, this circuit is small and can be developed at low cost, but it experiences different resonance combinations during the first half and remaining half switching periods. By incorporating an active diode-clamped cell and asymmetric resonance, the proposed converter accomplishes nearly zero-voltage-switching turn-off at the upper secondary-side switch and turn-off at the voltage closed to half of the output voltage at the lower secondary-side switch regardless of variation in input voltage. This helps to reduce switching losses at the secondary-side switches. We identified the accurate voltage gain of the proposed converter and obtained its detailed design guideline taking the asymmetric resonance into account. Furthermore, the currents flowing through the output diodes are unbalanced due to the asymmetric resonance, but can be balanced by applying different secondary-side duty ratios. A 400-W rated prototype that converts 48&#8211;72 V input to a 380-V output is designed and tested to validate the concept. The prototype demonstrates 95.9% peak efficiency and enhanced efficiency performance over the wide input voltage range.</description></item><item><title>Bidirectional Power Flow Control of Grid-Connected Converter Using Resistance-Emulating Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10214362</link><description>Resistance-emulating control is a cost-effective control scheme for grid-connected converters.

Compared with the conventional resistance-emulating control, two extra degrees of freedom are introduced into the proposed one. By choosing the degrees of freedom properly, both the steady and dynamic performance of the system can be enhanced. In addition, the operating range of the grid-connected converter is extended greatly. Meanwhile, the advantages of no grid voltage sensor and phase-locked loop are retained in the proposed method. Experimental results verify the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Primary-Side ZVS PWM Resonant Converter With Near-Zero-Ripple Input Current and High Efficiency for Fuel Cell Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10226510</link><description>In fuel cell applications, numerous prior researches have concentrated on current-fed type pulsewidth modulation (PWM) resonant dc&#8211;dc converters to achieve a low input current ripple and high efficiency. However, conventional approaches still cause a non-negligible input current ripple in practice due to two factors. The first factor is roll-off and tolerance of inductance according to the instantaneous current. The second factor is desynchronized drain-source voltage transitions during the dead time. This article proposes a new primary-side zero-voltage switching (ZVS) PWM resonant dc&#8211;dc converter for fuel cell applications. The proposed converter with a novel synchronous rectifier modulation solves the aforementioned two factors that cause input current ripple. Besides, in the process of input current ripple improvement, the primary-side switches can also achieve the ZVS, so switching losses are also reduced. Therefore, the proposed converter can achieve near-zero-ripple input current and high efficiency. Its effectiveness is verified by 600 W prototypes with 35&#8211;45 V input and 380 V output conditions.</description></item><item><title>Memristive Characteristics and Extreme Multistability of LLC DC-DC Resonant Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10224061</link><description>The characteristics of a power electronic circuit composed of a rectifier bridge and passive filter correspond with the basic characteristics of extended memristors. Using the PI control system of an LLC resonant dc&#8211;dc converter as an example, this article establishes an equivalent memristor model for the system and investigates its dynamics. The Floquet theory, bifurcation diagram, and Poincar&#233; map are used to investigate the dynamics of the system. The correctness of the established model and analysis results were verified through a simulation and experiments. The study results show that it is a system with no equilibrium, and the attractors generated by it are all hidden attractors. Similar to general converters, LLC resonant converters produce various types of bifurcations, such as Neimark&#8211;Sacker, boundary-collision, and topological equivalence bifurcations with the change in parameters, exhibiting ordinary nonlinear phenomena such as periods, quasi-periods, and chaos. LLC resonant converters also rely significantly on initial values to produce transient periods and extreme multistability, thereby increasing the uncertainty of the system. Therefore, to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the system, the dynamical characteristics of power electronics systems should be studied from the perspective of transient transition and multistability, which is a new problem worth investigating.</description></item><item><title>Development and Implementation of a DCM Boost Converter With Multilayer Stacked Circuits Achieving High Voltage Gain</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10229928</link><description>In this article, a high-voltage-gain boost converter (HVGBC) is designed, analyzed, and implemented.

This article provides a newly developed all-solid-state pulsed power generator (PPG) with a high boost ratio (HBR) for dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) applications. By using a common low-voltage power supply, the proposed generator achieves high-voltage pulses via simply connecting modules in series without regard for isolation problems due to inductive voltage adder technology. For HBR, we introduce a step-up transformer to enhance voltage gain further. The topology effort of the step-up transformer focuses on a high primary-secondary side voltage ratio.

The high-frequency inverter (HFI) can operate with zero switching loss in the whole charging process by adopting a novel auxiliary resonant network, which can effectively reduce the switching loss in the HFI and refrain from soft-switching loss due to the compensation element parameter perturbation. Besides, the HFI adopts a new modulation method, and only one power switch tube is in the high-frequency switching state in a switching cycle, which is also conducive to enhancing efficiency. The operating principle of the presented SS-BWC is elaborated in detail, and the realization conditions for soft-switching are also designed.

Malicious agents can attack a system by providing false measurements of sensed signals, such as power available/generated, or the grid current to sabotage the inverter control system. To defend against such attacks, we propose a technique of dynamic watermarking that superimposes a small secret signal onto the actuator signal and raises an alarm when the purported measurement data returned from the sensors do not contain appropriate transformations of the secret watermark. In this article, a robust attack detector is introduced, which does not require either knowledge of the variance of the ambient sensor noise or a model of the system. We develop an additional test that is not only impervious to sensor noise variance but can also be used to distinguish malicious attacks from sensor unreliability due to changing levels of sensor noise. We also show that a data-driven system identification of the switching inverter system can be employed in the dynamic watermarking tests. We present both simulation and experimental results from a grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) system, which show that the resulting robust dynamic watermarking method can detect malicious attacks on inverter control systems.</description></item><item><title>A Power Balancing Strategy in a PV-Based Modular Multilevel Converter During Mismatched Power Generation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10230314</link><description>In this article, we focus on the power balancing strategy in a modular multilevel converter (MMC) for a large-scale photovoltaic (PV) system. Large-scale PV-based MMC suffers from leg&#8211;leg and arm&#8211;arm power mismatch issues, leading to unbalanced power injection into ac grid. To inject balanced power into the ac grid, this article proposes a novel control technique, which minimizes the circulating current in the converter. A novel two fundamental frequency zero-sequence voltages injection technique is proposed for a leg&#8211;leg (horizontal) power mismatch by which the dc circulating current from the MMC legs can be minimized significantly. Simultaneously, an independent arm power control technique is proposed for an arm&#8211;arm (vertical) power mismatch, thereby minimizing the ac circulating current. With the proposed control strategies, overcurrent and subsequent losses in the converter due to circulating current can be reduced. Both horizontal and vertical power mismatch problems are theoretically analyzed and solved through the proposed technique to make the MMC more promising for large-scale PV applications where mismatched power generation is common. The theoretical analysis is verified through MATLAB/Simulink-based model and a 3-kW scaled-down experimental prototype.</description></item><item><title>New Integrated DC&#8211;DC Conversion System for Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10251583</link><description>This article proposes a new integrated dc&#8211;dc conversion system (IDCS) with dual-output phase-shift control for electric vehicles (EVs). The conventional dc&#8211;dc conversion system for EVs requires each dc&#8211;dc converter for on-board charger (OBC), traction converter (TC), and low-voltage dc&#8211;dc converter (LDC). It leads to the increase in the number of total components, overall volume, weight, and cost. Therefore, many studies on integrated power converter have been made to solve these problems. Nevertheless, they still need additional components and have drawbacks, such as high-voltage stress, nonisolation characteristics, and hard switching. To overcome these limitations, the new IDCS, which integrates the dc&#8211;dc converters of OBC, TC, and LDC at once is proposed. The proposed IDCS performs all functions of each dc&#8211;dc converter of OBC, LDC, and TC, while effectively reducing the total number of components and cost. In particular, it performs two simultaneous operations. One is to charge both the high-voltage battery and low-voltage battery (LVB) at the same time, and the other is to regulate the dc-link voltage, while charging the LVB. Moreover, the proposed IDCS increases the overall efficiency by synchronous rectification control. The featured characteristic and operational principles of proposed IDCS are first explained. Then, its design specifications are carefully investigated. Finally, the practical effectiveness is verified by experimental tests on the hardware prototype of 1.5 kW.</description></item><item><title>Shipboard Microgrid Frequency Control Based on Machine Learning Under Hybrid Cyberattacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10232899</link><description>Nowadays, marine vessels are critical to the industries and trade of many countries. Modern ships require clean energy and modern communications systems to function properly. The use of renewable energy resources requires efficient coordination using reliable communications, which can be threatened by cyberattacks. An attacker's ultimate goal is to collapse systems by implementing hybrid cyberattacks. Accordingly, this article studies the impact of hybrid cyberattacks involving a combination of denial of service and false data injection, as well as the implementation of attacks on both actuator and measurement signals for load frequency control performance in a low-emission shipboard microgrid. In this regard, a parallel attack detection strategy based on machine learning is developed to detect the attacks imposed on the measurement and actuator signals. A novel resilient control scheme, called adaptive reinforcement learning active disturbance rejection control (ADRC), is also presented to compensate for the impacts of attacks on the system frequency performance and ensure the ship can operate under different attack scenarios. Due to the simplicity and ease of implementation of ADRC, the ability to use reinforcement learning to tune parameters, and the resilience of the technique against attacks, the proposed strategy is a viable method as opposed to other mathematically complicated methods. The feasibility of the proposed method under various conditions has been evaluated by hardware-in-the-loop real-time simulations.</description></item><item><title>Improved Snake Optimizer Algorithm-Based GMPPT With a Fast Response to the Load Variations Under Different Weather Conditions for PV Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10223461</link><description>Photovoltaic (PV) systems are subjected to varying irradiance conditions throughout the day and because of the bypass diodes that are connected in parallel with the PV module to prevent hotspot occurrences, leading to several peaks on the power curve during the partial shading conditions (PSCs).

However, accurate real-time simulation in high-frequency applications demands extremely small time steps, which poses significant computational and memory challenges. Explicit methods can achieve small time steps due to low-computational burdens, but have stability issues. In this article, the authors propose a topology-aware matrix partitioning (TA-MP) method, which adopts the implicit numerical algorithm to ensure stability, and uses iterative methods to solve the implicit equations. In detail, the PES matrix is partitioned into blocks with clear topological meanings, and its constant diagonal blocks are used to construct a constant iterative matrix. Since the iterative matrix is constant, the TA-MP method bypasses the limitations of using iterative methods in real-time simulations by predetermining the number of iterations. The TA-MP method eliminates the need to store inverse matrices for different topologies, requiring only matrix-vector multiplications, which are efficient on FPGA. The TA-MP method's effectiveness is validated with n-port active bridge converters on an FPGA board with a 25 ns step size, ensuring simulation accuracy at the highest switching frequency of 200 kHz while consuming only 1/15 the memory resources of the conventional method.</description></item><item><title>A Switched-Boost Four-Leg Inverter With Leakage Current Mitigation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10209232</link><description>A new switched-boost four-leg inverter is proposed in this article.

One limitation is the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the interference among the broadband frequencies. In this thread, a delicate data processing procedure is an urgent requirement for EIS measurement with PRS. Motivated by this, a rapid impedance extraction method is proposed for lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries in this work for EIS measurement, which integrates the power spectrum and frequency properties of the PRS excitation signal to the impedance measurement. All the intrinsic connections of the impedance, frequency, and power spectrum are utilized to form a novel fusion mechanism so that the battery impedance can be effectively extracted by an automatic selection procedure. Experimental validation on an 18650 Li-ion battery confirms the good performance of the proposed method at varying SOCs and temperatures.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Improvement of Transient Voltage Stability for Grid-Forming Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10219172</link><description>Grid-forming converters are gradually becoming the enablers of more-electronic power systems. However, the challenge of fault-ride through prevents the widespread adoption of grid-forming converters. Although the existing literature investigates active power-transfer limitations and transient stability problems of grid-forming converters during fault-ride through, few of them touch reactive power-transfer limitations. In this article, we reveal that grid-forming converters also face transient voltage stability problems, which are caused by the violation of reactive power absorption limitations between converters and grids. This is particularly of interest for grid-forming static compensators and different from conventional power system voltage stability problems. Moreover, this article derives the equilibrium points, reactive power absorption limitations, and stable regions of grid-forming converters with two typical reactive power controllers, namely, reactive power proportional&#8211;integral (PI) and voltage-droop control. To improve fault-ride through, this article further proposes and designs voltage inertia control, which smoothens the voltage amplitude change and extends the stable region. In addition, this article finds that the active power control deteriorates transient voltage stability. Finally, the experimental results verify the analysis and the impact of control on the transient voltage stability of grid-forming converters.</description></item><item><title>Enhanced Single-Inductor Single-Input Dual-Output DC&#8211;DC Converter With Voltage Balancing Capability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10224355</link><description>Single-inductor single-input dual-output (SI-SIDO) dc&#8211;dc converters with a higher power density and fewer components are attractive for various applications such as renewable energies, portable chargers, PFC, HVdc, LED lightening, and electric vehicles (EVs). However, the voltage balancing of the output capacitors is a big challenge and always limits the application of these converters. In this regard, an enhanced SI-SIDO three-level dc&#8211;dc converter with a high voltage gain, inherited common ground condition, and voltage balancing capability is proposed in this article. A time-multiplexed control scheme is designed for the proposed converter to charge two output capacitors independently and provide different voltage levels for different requirements. Hence, the proposed converter can provide balanced or nonbalanced output voltages for various applications, maintaining constant output voltages even under unbalanced loads. Furthermore, it can be designed to support bidirectional operation. Because of the voltage balancing feature, the proposed converter can provide the dc-link voltage balancing for different applications, such as the bipolar low-voltage dc distribution system and the neutral-point-clamped inverter. The performance of the proposed topology is verified by the PLECS simulation program and experimentally in an 800-W prototype.</description></item><item><title>Wireless Sensor Power Supply Based on Eddy Currents for Structural Health Monitoring</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10214363</link><description>To monitor stress levels inside both concrete and rebars, structural health monitoring systems utilize sensors integrated within reinforced concrete. These sensors can be powered wirelessly using inductive power transfer (IPT) technology, effectively negating the need for batteries with their limited lifespans. However, powering sensors through IPT proves inefficient and challenging due to the presence of eddy currents induced in the rebar loops, which significantly impact power transfer. This article presents an IPT system that utilizes these inherent eddy currents to wirelessly power sensors near the rebars. The proposed IPT system employs the loops in rebar arrays as relay coils, and thereby enables sufficient power to be harvested by a tiny receiver coil. A mathematical model based on an equivalent circuit for magnetically coupled rebar loops is presented to investigate and optimize the system's performance. Moreover, experimental results of a 5-V/2-W output prototype with a 10-cm concrete gap are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Coordinated Balancing Charging Strategy for Cascaded H-Bridge Inverter With Supercapacitor and DC&#8211;DC Stage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10219006</link><description>This article presents a coordinated balancing charging strategy for the cascaded H-bridge inverter (CHBI) with supercapacitor (SC) and dc&#8211;dc stage by adopting multistage adjustment of the SCs&#8217; charging powers. The power distribution constraints among the submodules (SMs) are analyzed to prevent over-modulation of the H-bridges. The reactive power distribution is optimized to expand the stable operation range of the CHBI in case of significant disparity in the active power distribution among the SMs. The relationship among the charging powers of different SCs is also derived under the aforementioned constraints. Finally, the effectiveness of the presented strategy is verified through the experimental results on a 16-kW CHBI single-phase prototype with four SMs.</description></item><item><title>Control-Based Faulty Phase Detection Methods for Lines With Converter-Interfaced Sources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10234137</link><description>Unequal sequence superimposed impedance angles of converter-interfaced renewable energy sources (CIRESs) may lead to the maloperation of traditional phase selectors based on relative angles of sequence superimposed currents. To solve this problem, two control-based schemes are proposed to make original phase selectors operate correctly. In the first method, the negative-sequence superimposed impedance angle of converter-interfaced RES (CIRESs) is adjusted to respectively track positive- and zero-sequence superimposed impedance angles by calculating suitable negative-sequence current references, but this method cannot ensure that two phase selectors operate simultaneously. To achieve this aim, the second method is proposed to adjust positive- and negative-sequence superimposed impedance angles close to 90&#176; together. Two methods can be applied to different fault types, fault points, weak grids, and high-resistance faults. Moreover, typical fault ride-through requirements can be performed strictly in the first method, and reactive power can be also provided in the second method while a large active power is maintained. PSCAD simulation and hardware-in-the-loop testing verify the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Robust Adaptive Output Regulation for EV Dynamic Wireless Charging System With Sinusoidal Disturbance of Unknown Frequency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10237118</link><description>This article proposes a control strategy for electric vehicle (EV) dynamic wireless charging (DWC) system subject to sinusoidal disturbance with unknown frequency. The power fluctuation issue arising from the EV motion is an inherent problem of the segmented DWC system. The mutual inductance variation between the receiver coil and the transmitter coils results in a periodic disturbance whose frequency typically depends on the vehicle speed and the coil arrangement. The objective of the controller is to maintain a constant output voltage for the DWC system by compensating for such disturbance based on the adaptive output regulation theory. As a key component of the proposed controller, an internal model-based regulator that is robust with respect to uncertainties on the system parameters is designed. Especially, the frequency parameter of the internal model is adapted in order to cope with the unknown frequency of the disturbance. Finally, both simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. A DWC prototype is constructed, and the results demonstrate the satisfactory set-point tracking and rejection of an unknown sinusoidal disturbance caused by the EV motion compared with other traditional methods.</description></item><item><title>Universal Phase-Shift Modulation Scheme and Efficiency Optimization for Modular Multiactive Bridge Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10242261</link><description>Phase-shift modulation has been widely adopted in dual active bridge (DAB) converters due to its simple implementation and great system performance. However, modular multiactive bridge (MMAB) converter, a multiport version of DAB, has poor efficiency performance under traditional single phase-shift control and lacks a comprehensive analysis of multiphase-shift modulation. In order to improve the efficiency under unfavorable working conditions, this article proposes a universal phase-shift (UPS) modulation scheme for MMAB as well as multiactive bridge converters where the port numbers can be flexibly scaled. A time-domain mathematical model under the UPS scheme is obtained by a decomposition-and-superposition modeling method. Based on the model, an optimization strategy, aiming at full zero-voltage-switching turn-on actions and minimized root-mean-square inductance currents, is proposed to reduce the overall power loss. The proposed optimization strategy takes simplicity, scalability, and optimization performance into consideration, and its optimization effects can be regarded as a global optimum. Finally, a four-port laboratory prototype of MMAB converters has been constructed. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed UPS control strategy within the full working range have been verified by experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Maximum Power Factor Tracking Technique for LCC-Capacitor Charging Power Supply Through Variable DC Link Voltage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10256251</link><description>This article proposes a maximum power factor tracking (MPFT) technique for the LCC resonant converter which functions as a capacitor charging power supply. The proposed MPFT technique is achieved through variable dc-link voltage whose reference value can be adjusted in real time for the maximum power factor. By means of the proposed method, the dc-link voltage follows the output capacitor voltage to minimize the turn-off current of mosfets, thereby reducing the turn-off switching loss. Additionally, this technique reduces the circulating current, which in turn decreases the instantaneous reactive power in the resonant tank. In comparison with the conventional constant-current (CC) charging and constant-power (CP) charging strategies without MPFT, the proposed CC charging with MPFT (CC-MPFT) and CP charging with MPFT (CP-MPFT) both exhibit great efficiency improvement. In CC-MPFT, the efficiency can be improved by up to 26.84% under light load condition. In CP-MPFT, the efficiency can be increased by up to 11.63% under light load condition and 2.66% under heavy load condition.</description></item><item><title>An Event Driven Synchronization Framework for Physical Controller Co-Simulation of Megawatt-Level Power Electronic Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10242602</link><description>Model-based design (MBD) technology has substantially enhanced safety, reliability, and efficiency in power electronic system (PES) controller development. However, conventional MBD technologies face real-time constraints when collaborated with physical controllers, posing challenges for applying them to megawatt-level (MW-level) PESs with numerous switches. Therefore, this article presents a physical controller co-simulation (PCCO) approach to alleviate real-time constraints and satisfy controller testing requirements for MW-level PESs. Besides, an event-driven synchronization (EDS) framework is proposed to maintain consistent controller behavior in both the PCCO simulation and real -world systems, while using switch-event information to accelerate the simulation. Moreover, a hybrid CPU-FPGA hardware platform is designed for the PCCO simulation, and a 2 MW power electronic transformer with 576 switches is implemented as the case study with the EDS framework. The results show that the EDS framework provides a high-accuracy numerical controller testing environment for MW-level PESs without altering the controller behavior. Comparative analysis with commercial HIL simulators, and prototypes indicates that the proposed framework supports safe and efficient testing of physical controllers in large-scale MW-level PESs, thereby promoting the use of MW-level converters in modern power grids.</description></item><item><title>An Interleaved High Step-Up Boost-Zeta Converter Using Coupled Inductors With Resonant Soft-Switching</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10216340</link><description>An interleaved high step-up boost-zeta converter with resonant coupled inductors voltage multiplier cell is proposed in this article. The proposed converter achieves very high voltage gain by integrating the boost converter and the zeta converter and using coupled inductor voltage multiplier technique. Meanwhile, low input current ripple and continuous output current are realized, which is beneficial for photovoltaic, fuel cell, and dc-bus. Moreover, the zero-voltage switching (ZVS) and low voltage stress of the switches are achieved by utilizing the active clamp circuits. With the resonance between the leakage inductance and the resonant capacitor in the resonant coupled inductor multiplier cell, the zero-current switching (ZCS) of the diodes are achieved, leading to low reverse recovery losses. In addition, the main switches of the proposed converter can be operated in the full duty cycle range, which achieves a wide range of step-up regulation. The operation principles and steady-state performance of the proposed converter are analyzed in detail. A 400 W prototype with 30&#8211;40 V input, 400 V output is built to verify the theoretical analysis.</description></item><item><title>Incentivized Coordinated Heat-Electricity-Gas Dispatch: A Zero Knowledge Proof-Based Solution Considering Privacy and Anti-Forgery</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10183368</link><description>The coordination of multienergy systems has been commonly adopted to improve energy utilization performance. Reallocating profits of all systems is utilized to provide incentives for the coordination. However, some systems might forge their profits to maliciously obtain more reallocated profits. Existing works partially solve this problem by developing privacy-preserving anti-forgery methods that focus on the coordination of two energy systems with linear constraints. This article proposes a coordinated heat-electricity-gas dispatch mechanism that addresses incentive, privacy and anti-forgery issues. The coordination model based on Nash bargaining is decomposed into both a dispatch problem that maximizes the total profit and a profit reallocation problem that provides incentives. The profit reallocation problem is solved using exponential ElGamal encryption to avoid leaking the profit variation of each system before and after coordination. Furthermore, to prevent any system from forging its profit for maliciously obtaining more reallocated profit, we propose a privacy-preserving anti-forgery method based on zero knowledge proof. The method enables each system to prove that its profit variation satisfies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the dispatch problem with nonlinear constraints. The numerical tests show that our proposed method provides incentives for coordination and detects forgery of profit variation without leaking privacy.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Privacy-Preserving Secondary Control for DC Microgrids via State Decomposition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10207776</link><description>In this article, a distributed secondary controller is proposed for an islanded DC microgrid to preserve privacy information of the local power sources, while achieving current sharing among the generators and voltage regulation of the DC bus. Based on the state decomposition mechanism, the original secondary control signal of each generator is decomposed into two parts: one takes over the role of communicating with neighbors, while the other affects the evolution of the former one and is invisible to the neighbors. Besides, random noises are introduced to mask the true value of the transmitted signals. Under the proposed controller, the current data of the local generators can be kept confidential, as well as the associated privacy power information. In this way, the power security risks caused by privacy information leakage can be avoided. Lastly, both simulation and experiment tests are imposed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Reactive Current Optimization Based Onshore AC Fault Ride-Through Strategy for MMC-HVDC Integrated Offshore Wind Farms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10207701</link><description>Onshore AC faults may cause the modular multilevel converter based high voltage direct current integrated offshore wind farms (MMC-HVDC-OWF) to develop surplus power and trigger overvoltage problems. This article proposes a dynamic reactive current optimization (DRO) strategy that combines MMC energy control capability with transient overload capability to achieve onshore AC fault ride-through (ACFRT). Firstly, the decoupling control mechanism and constraints of the active and reactive currents of the onshore gird-side MMC (GSMMC) are analyzed. Furthermore, a dynamic reactive current optimization based ACFRT strategy is proposed based on the current constraints and the energy control capability of MMCs. The main parameters of DRO are set according to the fault characteristic analysis results. Once a fault occurs, the proposed DRO based ACFRT strategy can control the offshore surplus power by controlling the MMC internal sub-module energy. The DRO strategy quickly optimizes the active and reactive power output commands of the GSMMC by collecting and comparing the local power signals. It enables to increase the onshore AC grid voltage and the transient active power output of the MMC-HVDC-OWF. Finally, The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified through comprehensive case studies conducted on the PSCAD/EMTDC.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive PI Control of Wave Energy Converters With Force and Motion Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10207822</link><description>This article presents the application of adaptive PI control design to a point absorber - wave energy converter (WEC) under force and motion constraints. Adaptive PI control has several features that make it attractive for WEC system. In particular, it has a clear physical interpretation. The &#8220;P&#8221; component converts the wave energy into useful energy, while the &#8220;I&#8221; component changes the WEC system natural frequency allowing the absorber to be more in phase with the incoming waves. However, standard adaptive PI control schemes in the literature do not have the ability to incorporate the constraints in the design phase. The main objective of this article is to fill this gap by proposing a new adaptive PI control law that can take the constraints into account. Simulation results show that the new control law can improve the performance while respecting system limitations.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Optimization of Photovoltaic Power With Lifted Linear Decision Rule for Distribution System Voltage Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10214028</link><description>This article proposes a lifted linear decision rule (LLDR) as a photovoltaic (PV) power control strategy for distribution system voltage regulation. First, the active-reactive power control is designed as a linear function in a lifted space of PV power, which is presented as a piecewise linear function without auxiliary integer variables for benefiting the parameter optimization of control functions. Then, a hierarchical central-local voltage regulation framework is designed. In the central control stage, the constant part of LLDR determines the reactive power of PV units, which is also coordinated with other voltage regulation devices. In the local control stage, the adjustable part of LLDR would control the PV power in real time for reducing voltage deviations. Finally, optimization problems and their solution methods are developed to obtain LLDR parameters. In particular, robust optimization (RO) and distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems are designed to obtain the affine coefficients of LLDR considering multiple PV power uncertainty models. The tractable formula of RO is derived based on the convex hull of PV power uncertainty sets in the lifted space, and Benders decomposition is combined with a distribution separation method to solve the DRO problem. The proposed method is tested on distribution systems with actual PV power data, and the results are compared with those of other linear and piecewise-linear control methods to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in diminishing voltage deviations caused by variable PV power.</description></item><item><title>Active Fault Current Limitation for VSC-MTDC Integrated Offshore Wind Farms Participating in Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10218998</link><description>The onshore local grid is facing the challenge to avoid continuously increasing fault current caused by frequency regulation (FR) of broad-scale offshore wind farms (OWFs) integrated by voltage source converter based multi-terminal high voltage direct current (VSC-MTDC) system. To tackle this challenge, an active fault current limitation (AFCL) method is proposed in four aspects: 1) a fault current contribution factor (FCCF) is introduced for grid side VSC (GSVSC) to quantify the incremental degree of fault current caused by FR of GSVSC under different fault types; 2) a current phase angle control (CPAC) strategy based on vector analysis is conducted for GSVSC to actively mitigate the fault current increment; 3) according to FCCF and CPAC, an active and reactive current quantification (ARCQ) strategy is developed for GSVSC to satisfy bilateral demands of AFCL and FR; 4) an adaptive frequency regulation (AFR) strategy, which considers FCCF and the operating conditions of the offshore system (e.g., rotor speed and DC voltage), is formulated for OWFs to quantify and generate the active power required for FR and AFCL. Numerous test results are analyzed to verify the effectiveness and performance of the proposed AFCL method in satisfying system fault current limitation during FR of OWFs.</description></item><item><title>Uncertainty-Aware Procurement of Flexibilities for Electrical Grid Operational Planning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10221712</link><description>In the power system decarbonization roadmap, novel grid management tools and market mechanisms are fundamental to solving technical problems concerning renewable energy forecast uncertainty. This work proposes a predictive algorithm for procurement of grid flexibility by the system operator (SO), which combines the SO flexible assets with active and reactive power short-term flexibility markets. The goal is to reduce the cognitive load of the human operator when analyzing multiple flexibility options and trajectories for the forecasted load/RES and create a human-in-the-loop approach for balancing risk, stakes, and cost. This work also formulates the decision problem into several steps where the operator must decide to book flexibility now or wait for the next forecast update (time-to-decide method), considering that flexibility (availability) price may increase with a lower notification time. Numerical results obtained for a public MV grid (Oberrhein) show that the time-to-decide method improves up to 22% a performance indicator related to a cost-loss matrix, compared to the option of booking the flexibility now at a lower price and without waiting for a forecast update.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Negative-Emission Optimal Energy Scheduling for Off-Grid Integrated Electricity-Heat Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10224346</link><description>This article proposes a distributionally robust chance-constrained (DRCC) negative-emission optimal energy scheduling scheme for the off-grid integrated electricity-heat microgrid (IEHM). A negative-emission operating strategy is designed to regulate the electric power, thermal power, and carbon emission of the off-grid IEHM under uncertainty. The post-combustion carbon capture system (PCCS) and direct air capture (DAC) modeling consider both electric and thermal energy consumption. Besides, the duration of DAC process flow is considered in its model. In the DRCC energy scheduling model for the off-grid IEHM, the negative emission is achieved by scheduling PCCS and DAC, and the negative emission constraint is included considering the uncertainty of carbon emission. The uncertain forecasting errors of wind power are balanced by coordinating the combined heat and power unit and battery storage. DRCC approach under the moment-based ambiguity set is employed to tackle both uncertainties. The DRCC energy scheduling model is reformulated as a tractable mixed-integer second-order cone programming. Evaluation indices are defined from three aspects, i.e., carbon emission, economy, and reserve capacity, to assess the overall performance of the DRCC energy scheduling scheme for the off-grid IEHM. Case studies were carried out on two test systems to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Simulation results demonstrate that the off-grid IEHM can achieve negative emission operation while minimizing the energy cost under wind power and carbon emission uncertainty.</description></item><item><title>Combined Heat and Power Dispatch Against Cold Waves Utilizing Responsive Internet Data Centers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10224307</link><description>The extreme weather disaster is a main threat to the operation of integrated electricity and heat systems (IEHSs), particularly the cold wave, which is prone to cause surges in regional demand for heat and electricity. In IEHSs, Internet data centers (IDCs) consume a huge amount of electricity and generate waste heat. The former can be regulated spatially by migrating workloads in the interconnected data network and interrupted temporally with the equipped backup generators or uninterruptible power supply (UPS), the latter can be captured and supplied to the districts using heat pump facilities. Thus, energy behaviors of IDCs are impressively responsive, which are completely considered and dispatched to enhance the resilience of IEHSs against cold waves in this paper. Firstly, the integrated energy response (IER) meaning responsive electricity consumption and heat production of IDCs is modelled considering workload scheduling and emergency standby power supply. Secondly, the adverse impacts of cold waves on IEHS operation are comprehensively formulated using intervals considering both component outages and sudden energy demand increases. Moreover, a scenario-based stochastic optimization model with interval parameters is constructed incorporating IER formulations, in which both unit commitment plan of IEHSs and IER strategies of IDCs are simultaneously optimized. Furthermore, a two-stage stochastic-interval solution method is proposed to handle the hybrid heterogeneous uncertainties in the model based on the L-shaped algorithm and interval linear programming theory. Numerical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques using a test IEHS composed of IEEE 118-bus system, seven 32-node heating systems, and eight IDCs.</description></item><item><title>Joint Optimization of Production and Maintenance in Offshore Wind Farms: Balancing the Short- and Long-Term Needs of Wind Energy Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10229237</link><description>The rapid increase in scale and sophistication of offshore wind (OSW) farms poses a critical challenge related to the cost-effective operation and management of wind energy assets. A defining characteristic of this challenge is the economic trade-off between two concomitant processes: power production (the primary driver of short-term revenues), and asset degradation (the main determinant of long-term expenses). Traditionally, approaches to optimize production and maintenance in wind farms have been conducted in isolation. In this article, we conjecture that a joint optimization of those two processes, achieved by rigorously modeling their short- and long-term dependencies, can unlock significant economic benefits for wind farm operators. In specific, we propose a decision-theoretic framework, rooted in stochastic optimization, which seeks a sensible balance of how wind loads are leveraged to harness short-term electricity generation revenues, versus alleviated to hedge against longer-term maintenance expenses. Extensive numerical experiments using real-world data confirm the superior performance of our approach, in terms of several operational performance metrics, relative to methods that tackle the two problems in isolation.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Data Center Energy Management With Hybrid Quantum-Classical Multi-Cuts Benders' Decomposition Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10232912</link><description>The flourishing of the data era has led to a higher demand for hyper-scale data centers, resulting in a great energy gap.

The first stage aims to determine the optimal thermal unit commitment, and the second stage tries to adjust the operation modes of an NPP and thermal unit generation output to cope with different renewable energy scenarios. Due to the discrete adjustments of NPPs, the proposed model is mathematically a two-stage stochastic optimization with mixed-integer recourses. Furthermore, a Fenchel cut based bilevel decomposition is proposed to solve this model, where the inner second-stage subproblem is first relaxed into a linear program and a Fenchel cut is then generated to recover the facet of the convex hull solution. The technique can significantly accelerate the computational speed of the proposed model with a special mathematical structure. Numerical results on a provincial power system verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and method.</description></item><item><title>Sky-Image-Derived Deep Decomposition for Ultra-Short-Term Photovoltaic Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10246013</link><description>Because of the stochastic and nonstationary weather changes, photovoltaic (PV) power exhibits high uncertainty and fluctuation, which severely challenges the operation of power systems. PV variations can be detected by investigating inherent properties and reflections of sky images. However, limited study has focused on the effect of sky image changes on PV inherent properties. Therefore, in this study, a novel sky-image-derived decomposition method was proposed for ultra-short-term PV power forecasting. First, historical PV series were decomposed into seasonal and trend parts with guidance of sky image sequence. The Auto-Correlation mechanism was adopted to enhance the temporal dependencies of seasonal parts. Then, to reduce the model instability in different weather scenarios, the latent features were handled by an improved density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise using a semi-supervised strategy to identify forecasting scenarios. Finally, a rolling scenario-wise decoder was proposed to conduct multi-step forecasting task. The proposed method was compared with various state-of-the-art methods, including empirical mode decomposition and deep decomposition methods. The results validated the high performance of the proposed method in terms of accuracy within forecast horizons of 5 to 30 min.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Management of Hybrid Energy Station Under Exogenous-Endogenous Uncertainties and Bounded Rationality</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10252038</link><description>Hybrid energy station (HES) systems coupling diverse energy sectors can facilitate the low-carbon and sustainable transition by integrating massive wind-solar power and energy conversion technologies. With the proliferation of renewable and flexible demand response (DR), different uncertainties are inevitably introduced into energy systems because of external volatile surroundings and internal consumers' mutable behavior. Moreover, the probability distribution function (PDF) of these uncertainties may be unavailable or ambiguous and even affected by decisions. In this work, we propose a hierarchical optimal framework for HES systems, in which the energy hub plant determines the schedules of generation and trade in different markets (upper-level) and users minimize energy expense by managing facilities operations considering decision-dependent uncertainties (lower-level). A scheme of energy transaction options is also provided under the bounded rationality of user sides. To tackle problems with uncertain PDFs, a tailored chance-constrained distributionally robust method is implemented. In the process, the correlation DR operation pattern and analytic pricing formulation are derived incorporating the property of users. Case studies with comparison tests validate the efficacy of the proposed model in handling uncertainties and pursuing economic profits.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Service Restoration of Distribution Networks With Volt-Var Devices, Distributed Energy Resources, and Energy Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10251925</link><description>The new energy resources in distribution systems have led researchers to consider the operation of such elements during service restoration. Hence, the current state-of-the-art regarding the restoration problem considers the operation of distributed resources in both island and grid-connected modes. Few articles also address the system's restoration capacity changes throughout the time needed to repair the network after an outage, given the variations in the system's demand and availability of energy sources. However, the solutions proposed in the literature converge in proposing a single topology that is feasible throughout the entire repairing time. In this article, we propose addressing the mutable nature of the system's restoration capacity by splitting the repairing time into several time intervals and associating each of them with a specific configuration that minimizes the out-of-service load. Energy storage systems, intermittent and dispatchable generators, and voltage-control devices are also considered. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). The model and its scalability are tested using the 53-, 217-, and 404-node systems, considering different fault scenarios and reliability indices. The results show that the nonsupplied energy during the repairing time decreases when dynamic changes in the system topology are considered. Furthermore, the effects of storage systems operation and their integration with dynamic topology changes are highlighted.</description></item><item><title>Coordinating Multi-Energy Microgrids for Integrated Energy System Resilience: A Multi-Task Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10255302</link><description>High-impact and low-probability events have occurred more frequently than before, which can seriously damage energy supply infrastructures. As localized small energy systems, multi-energy microgrids (MEMGs) can provide a viable solution for the system-wise load restoration of integrated energy systems (IESs), due to their enhanced flexibility and controllability. However, existing literature tends to realize MEMGs as corrective response rather than load restoration resource after extreme events, which cannot fully exploit the benefits of multi-MEMGs on IES resilience. This article introduces a decentralized operating paradigm for the real-time coordination of local multi-MEMGs towards system-wise IES load restoration, while a novel topology-aware multi-task reinforcement learning method with soft modularization is proposed to solve it. The multi-task learning framework enables MEMGs to simultaneously learn scheduling decisions across different network topologies and better adapt to unanticipated contingencies. Additionally, to avoid insecure MEMG operations, a physics-informed safety layer is embedded on top of the multi-task learning framework for action corrections. Case studies have been conducted on two IESs (33-bus power, 20-node gas, and 20-node heat network as well as 69-bus power, 40-node gas, and 62-node heat network) to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enabling effective coordination among multi-MEMGs towards system-wise IES load restoration.</description></item><item><title>Virtual Inertia Scheduling (VIS) for Real-Time Economic Dispatch of IBR-Penetrated Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10264213</link><description>A new concept called virtual inertia scheduling (VIS) is proposed to efficiently handle the increasing penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) in power systems. VIS is an inertia management framework that targets security-constrained and economy-oriented inertia scheduling and generation dispatch with a large scale of renewable generations. Specifically, it determines the appropriate power setpoint and reserved capacity of synchronous generators and IBRs, as well as the control modes and control parameters of IBRs to provide secure and cost-effective inertia support. First, a uniform system model is employed to quantify the frequency dynamics of IBR-penetrated power systems after disturbances. Leveraging this model, the s-domain and time-domain analytical responses of IBRs with inertia support capability are derived. Then, VIS-based real-time economic dispatch (VIS-RTED) is formulated to minimize generation and reserve costs, with full consideration of dynamic frequency constraints and the derived inertia support reserve constraints. The virtual inertia and damping of IBRs are formulated as decision variables. A deep learning-assisted linearization approach is further employed to address the non-linearity of dynamic constraints. Finally, VIS-RTED is demonstrated on a two-machine system and a modified IEEE 39-bus system. A full-order time-domain simulation is performed to verify the scheduling results.</description></item><item><title>Proactive Scheduling of Mixed Energy Resources At Different Grid Levels</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10265110</link><description>The optimal utilisation of distribution grids requires the proactive management of volatilities caused by mixed energy resources installed into different grid levels, such as buildings, energy communities (ECs) and substations. In this context, proactive control based on predictions for energy demand and generation is applied. The mitigation of conflicts between the stakeholders' objectives is the main challenge for the control of centralized and distributed energy resources. In this article, a bi-level approach is proposed for the control of stationary battery energy storage systems (SBES) supporting the local distribution system operator (DSO) at the transformer level, as well as distributed energy resources (DERs) operated by end customers, i.e., EC-members. Model predictive control (MPC)-based and hybrid approaches merging rule- and MPC-based control schemes are evaluated. Simulation studies based on a typical European low voltage (LV) feeder topology yield the performance assessment in terms of technical and economic criteria. The results show an advantage of hybrid approaches with respect to the DSO's cost savings from peak shaving. From the EC's perspective, both hybrid and MPC-based schemes can achieve effective cost savings from proactive energy management.</description></item><item><title>An Anti-Windup Mechanism for State Constrained Linear Control of Wave Energy Conversion Systems: Design, Synthesis, and Experimental Assessment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10266789</link><description>Motivated by the necessity of suitable state constraint mechanisms within linear time-invariant (LTI) energy-maximising control of wave energy converters (WECs), we present, in this article, an anti-windup (AW) scheme for state constraint satisfaction, where the associated unconstrained controller is designed via impedance-matching theory for WEC systems. As in the standard (input) AW scenario, the adopted technique provides a mechanism for &#8216;informing&#8217; the (unconstrained) controller when constraints are active, so that appropriate modifications to future control actions can be taken accordingly. The overall adopted AW technique is tested experimentally, on a prototype of the Wavestar WEC system, available at Aalborg University (Denmark). We explicitly demonstrate that the proposed AW scheme is able to consistently respect the defined state constraints, having a mild impact on overall energy absorption performance when compared to its unconstrained counterpart.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Objective Estimation of Optimal Prediction Intervals for Wind Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268627</link><description>Accurate and reliable wind power forecasting is crucial for efficient operation in a power system. Due to the substantial uncertainties associated with wind generation, probabilistic interval forecasting offers a distinct approach for assessing and quantifying the potential impacts and risks that may arise from the integration of wind energy into a power system. This article proposes a novel multi-objective lower upper bound estimation method to directly construct optimal wind power intervals without the assumption of any specific distribution function. Prediction intervals at a nominal confidence level are formulated through simultaneously optimizing the Winkler loss and coverage probability. The proposed framework is gradient descent-enabled and therefore allows flexible integration of various deep learning algorithms. An evaluation using four wind power datasets is conducted, and the results are analyzed and compared with those from several benchmark models. The findings indicate the proposed method outperforms its counterparts in terms of both reliability and overall performance.</description></item><item><title>Collaborative Response of Data Center Coupled With Hydrogen Storage System for Renewable Energy Absorption</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10269736</link><description>The demand response of data center is considered as an effective flexible method to absorb excessive renewable energy (RE) in the power system, especially for the data center with high-density hydrogen storages. Therefore, this article proposes a collaborative response framework considering regulations of data workload and hydrogen storage. It is expected to further improve the data center flexibility. However, this collaborative response is a high-order and non-convex optimization problem involving the multi-period and complex model. Considering the condition of uncertain RE supply, it is difficult for power optimization dispatch to realize the precise decision in this NP-hard problem. To address this issue, a global interval optimization (GIO) approach is developed. It is to obtain efficient and robust decisions in the collaborative response. This approach deduces an interval optimization model to achieve the global optimality of convergent solution. Furthermore, this article introduces a probability correction into the GIO approach. It is used for improving the decision accuracy in the actual renewable power scenarios. A case study based on the IEEE 24-bus system verifies superiority of the GIO approach. It further validates effectiveness of the collaborative response framework for RE utilization.</description></item><item><title>A Regulation Method Considering Coupled Voltage Violation and Unbalance in Three-Phase Four-Wire Hybrid AC/DC LVDNs With High Penetration PVs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10272708</link><description>Low-voltage distribution networks (LVDNs) have witnessed an increasing penetration of distributed photovoltaics (PVs), which exacerbates the existing voltage violation and voltage unbalance issues. PVs, energy storage systems, and voltage source converters can regulate voltages in hybrid AC/DC LVDNs. To solve the above two voltage problems simultaneously, a partition-based coordinated regulation method is proposed in this article considering the coupling of the two issues and the effect of active power on reactive power in electrical distance calculation. The voltage adjustments in different voltage violation scenarios are obtained based on a graph that describes the coupling of the two issues mathematically. In order to better determine control devices, the equivalent coefficient of active power adjustment on electrical distance calculation is considered in the partition method, in which regulation efficiency, regulation cost, and regulation capability are used as objectives. The coordination of controllable devices is achieved according to three-phase four-wire sensitivities. Case studies are performed to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed regulation method in hybrid AC/DC LVDNs.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Step Clustering and Generalized Nash Bargaining-Based Planning Strategy of Community-Shared Energy Storage for Large-Scale Prosumers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10274997</link><description>Inspired by economies of scale, the joint planning of community-shared energy storage (CSES) among prosumers provides a new solution to the issues of high investment costs associated with independent construction of individual energy storage. However, the cooperation among large-scale prosumers is rarely investigated and there is an urgent need to formulate an appropriate strategy. Hence, a multi-step clustering and generalized Nash bargaining (GNB)-based CSES joint planning strategy for large-scale prosumers is proposed. First, a CSES planning-oriented multi-step clustering algorithm based on nonparametric kernel density estimation (NPKDE) and a modified fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm is proposed to reduce the input data dimensionality of the planning model. Then, taking the optimal construction time sequence into consideration, a bi-level CSES joint planning model is established to minimize the total costs of prosumers. On this basis, a contribution rate index is designed to evaluate prosumers' bargaining power, and a GNB-based allocation strategy is formulated for realizing fair cost allocation. Finally, case studies show that the proposed strategy can help large-scale prosumers effectively deal with the joint CSES planning problem and achieve lower investment and operation costs. It also demonstrates that the proposed cost allocation approach is more efficient and practical than other cooperative game-based methods.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Coordinated Control Strategy for Frequency Regulation of MMC-HVDC Connecting Offshore Wind Farms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10278216</link><description>To solve the problems of weak inertia support and poor frequency regulation capability of power system, a novel coordinated control strategy for frequency regulation of MMC-HVDC connecting offshore wind farms (OWFs) is proposed to improve system frequency stability. In terms of inertia support, based on analyzing the available energy margin of MMC-HVDC, a virtual inertia control method based on decoupling control of DC voltage and capacitor voltage is proposed, which can fully utilize the energy margin of capacitors and improve its inertia support capability. The coupling relationship between the rotor speed of wind turbines and the frequency is directly established through DC voltage, an inertia support coordinated control strategy for MMC-HVDC and OWFs is designed to realize the rational utilization of available energy. In terms of primary frequency regulation, according to the local DC voltage, a primary frequency regulation control strategy is proposed for OWFs based on the variable speed control and pitch angle control. The overall coordination is realized through the reasonable design of control links and parameters, so as to improve the frequency stability of the system. Finally, the simulation model of MMC-HVDC connecting OWFs is built to verify the validity of the proposed control strategies.</description></item><item><title>Neural Networks-Based Inverter Control: Modeling and Adaptive Optimization for Smart Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10283888</link><description>The optimal voltage control of inverter-based resources, especially under the high penetration of solar photovoltaics, is critical to the stability of the distribution power system. However, the computational complexity as well as the coordinated operation performance of the voltage control optimization in the distribution power system limits the real-time applications. To mitigate this issue, a model-free based adaptive optimal control scheme for the smart inverter is proposed to maximize the active power generation, minimize the power loss, and maintain the bus voltages in smart distribution networks. An inverter-based optimization model for coordinated operation is first established, considering the uncertainties of renewable power generation. Subsequently, by collecting the data and control strategies, the neural networks (NNs) based algorithm is proposed to efficiently predict the best possible control strategy. The main objective of this scheme is to accurately predict candidate optimal solutions with near-negligible feasibility and optimization gaps, with the advantage of avoiding complicated iteration-based numerical algorithms. Thereafter, the co-simulation among OpenDSS, MATLAB, and Python is set up to fully take advantage of the three individual software. Experiments are conducted based on different control parameter characteristics and structures of NNs. The results reveal that an average mean squared error of 0.013 and 1 ms response time are achieved, which is lower than some state-of-the-art methods.</description></item><item><title>A Control Method Using Two Electromotive Forces and a Disturbance Observer to Improve the Dynamics of a Virtual Synchronous Machine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10285072</link><description>The modern power grid is facing a significant challenge due to decreasing grid inertia, which is caused by the high penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs). Virtual synchronous machines (VSMs) have been considered as effective solutions to support the grid by providing inertial responses similar to that of traditional synchronous machines. However, fast and flexible dynamic responses to reference inputs, which can be achieved by conventional RES interfacing inverters, are degraded when inverters emulate the behavior of a synchronous machine. In this article, a current-referencing electrified synchronous machine (CURESYM) is proposed as a control method to adjust the dynamics to the reference input regardless of the parameter settings for emulating a synchronous generator. That is, the output current of CURESYM can be regulated with an intended dynamic response to follow the current reference. In addition, the accuracy of the current regulation can be enhanced by virtue of a disturbance observer. The fundamental characteristics of CURESYM are described with laboratory-scale experimental results. Finally, the effectiveness of CURESYM is discussed with practical data from on-site tests that applied the proposed method to a battery energy storage system in an actual island microgrid.</description></item><item><title>Day-Ahead PV Power Forecasting Model Based on Fine-Grained Temporal Attention and Cloud-Coverage Spatial Attention</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292906</link><description>With the increase of grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) power plants, measuring the uncertainty of PV output forecast due to multiple meteorological factors has become an important method to ensure the stable operation of the power system. However, the manual similar days' extraction methods of historical power features and cloud motion features, which are commonly used for PV spatial-temporal prediction, are inefficient and coarse-grained. In this paper, focusing on automatic attention of the local similar sequences in daily features, we improve the attention scoring method of the original transformer to increase the calculation accuracy of the similarity of PV power sequences. We construct an end-to-end PV power prediction framework using an encoder-decoder architecture. Based on the spatial-temporal similarity characteristics of PV output, the fine-grained temporal and cloud-covered spatial attentions embedded in the prediction framework are proposed using the improved similar sequence attention module. Among them, fine-grained temporal attention can dynamically position and utilize similar historical PV power sequences for the predicted period; cloud-coverage spatial attention automatically captures the neighbor site's matching PV power sequences. Experiments were conducted on a real PV dataset, and the root mean square error was reduced by 21.34% on average compared to the baseline model. The results proved the effectiveness of the proposed model.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Wind Power Scenario Generation Based on Conditional Latent Diffusion Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10296015</link><description>Quantifying short-term uncertainty in wind power plays a crucial role in power system decision-making. In recent years, the scenario generation community has conducted numerous studies employing generative models. Among these generative models, diffusion models have shown remarkable capabilities with excellent posterior representation. However, diffusion models are seldom used to quantify renewable energy uncertainty. To fill this research gap, this manuscript proposes a novel conditional latent diffusion model (CLDM) adapted for short-term scenario generation. CLDM decomposes the wind power scenario generation task into deterministic forecasting and forecast error scenario generation. The embedding network is used to regress deterministic forecasts, which reduces the denoising complexity of diffusion models. The denoising network generates forecast error scenarios in a latent space. Subsequently, the wind power scenarios are reconstructed by combining deterministic forecasts and forecast error scenarios. The case study compares with existing state-of-the-art methods, CLDM demonstrates superior evaluation metrics and enhances the denoising efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Periodic Allocation Mechanism for Allocating Demand Response Reserves Deployed by Multiple Ancillary Services</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10296534</link><description>High penetration of renewable energy resources poses technical and economic challenges to system operation. Utilizing demand response to provide ancillary services is beneficial to the security of the grid, but for this, an adequate level of reserves to support possible ancillary services is required. Reasonable allocation of the demand response reserves (DRREs) deployed by different ancillary services can guarantee performance and participant profits during ancillary service provision. An allocation mechanism that periodically allocates DRREs for various ancillary services considering uncertainty and demand response resource (DRR) sufficiency is proposed to address this problem. The participants include purchasers and providers of DRRs. First, K-means clustering is used to obtain the occurrence characteristics of different ancillary service events. Second, the utility functions of the participants in the allocation process are modeled while fully considering the uncertainty in periodic allocation. Then, different types of Stackelberg games are formulated to determine the DRREs deployed by different ancillary services under different DRR sufficiency situations. Finally, an intraday scheduling method is presented to optimize the use of the allocated DRREs and achieve the expected regulation performance. Simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed allocation mechanism in terms of achieving a win-win situation for all participants.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Incentive Pricing on Charging Stations for Real-Time Congestion Management in Distribution Network: An Adaptive Model-Based Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10298595</link><description>This paper concerns the pricing strategy for real-time distribution network congestion management, aiming at maximizing the total social welfare while eliminating congestion. The difficulty lies in dealing with the complex time-varying relationship between price and charging demand in the integrated power system and transportation network, and ensuring the safe application of the proposed method with limited real historical data. To address these challenges, we first model the EV user charging decision-making process to indirectly reflect the unquantifiable price and demand relationship, and then formulate the pricing problem as a bi-level model with a constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). After that, we propose a model-based safe DRL framework and develop an adaptive model-based safe deep reinforcement learning (AMSDRL) algorithm to solve the CMDP problem. AMSDRL learns the environment transition model and uses a strict and adaptive cost constraint to offset potential modeling errors. Compared to the state-of-the-art safe DRL methods, AMSDRL can be deployed with security guarantees by training on limited historical data, which is more practical for applications. The numerical results on modified IEEE 33-bus and 118-bus systems and a transportation network with real-world EV data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Autonomous Energy Management Strategy for Multi-Paralleled Hybrid Energy Storage Systems in the DC Microgrid With Mismatched Line Impedance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10298785</link><description>In this paper, a decentralized P-V$^{2}$ droop-based energy management strategy for the hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs), including multiple batteries/supercapacitors (SCs), in the DC microgrid is proposed. By using the output voltage of the SC converter as the unified feedback voltage in each HESS, the impacts of non-negligible and mismatched line impedance on the power allocation performance and bus voltage tracking are eliminated. Compared with the I-V droop-based method, the adopted P-V$^{2}$ droop technique improves the stability of the HESS, especially considering the constant power loads (CPLs). In addition, the state-of-charge (SoC) recovery is considered for the SCs to prolong the service life of the HESSs. Finally, the experiment and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations have been carried out for the studied system to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.</description></item><item><title>A Bayesian Hierarchical Model to Understand the Effect of Terrain on Wind Turbine Power Curves</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10301539</link><description>This paper is concerned with explicitly modeling the effect of terrain on wind power curves. Terrain characteristics are spatially-varying but temporally constant, whereas other power curve-affiliating variables such wind speed, temperature, and wind power vary both spatially and temporally. In order to effectively model such two modes of variation in the data, we employ a Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) that connects the terrain characteristics with the parameters in a power curve. BHM jointly models the data from all turbines on a wind farm for attaining the turbine-specific, terrain-incorporating power curves. Our analysis shows that, out of the three terrain variables available in our data, ruggedness has the strongest effect on the power curve. We also evaluate the applicability of using the resulting power curve model for turbines on a different terrain and find that incorporating terrain information explicitly is beneficial. The specific BHM mechanism of using terrain information leads to 7&#8211;10% improvement over the group averaging approach.</description></item><item><title>A Stochastic Charging Station Deployment Model for Electrified Taxi Fleets in Coupled Urban Transportation and Power Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10306294</link><description>Metropolitansworldwide are increasingly adopting electric taxis (ET) to address concerns about transportation-related emissions. However, the widespread deployment of electric taxis presents challenges in terms of increased electricity demand and changing demand profiles. This transition impacts both the urban transportation network (TN) and the electricity power distribution network (PDN), highlighting the interdependence between these two systems. In this paper, we propose a two-stage stochastic programming planning model that aims to optimize both the TN and PDN, enabling efficient deployment of charging stations and grid upgrades. Our model seeks to strike a balance between meeting ET drivers' charging preferences, minimizing the costs associated with infrastructure deployment and grid expansion, and harmonizing the coordination between the TN and PDN. Additionally, we explore the potential benefits of utilizing an autonomous ET fleet to enhance overall system performance.</description></item><item><title>Low-Voltage Survivability of Islanded Microgrids With Mixture of Single-Phase and Three-Phase DGs under Harmonic Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308631</link><description>Unbalanced low-voltage survivability of islanded microgrids under three-phase nonlinear load conditions in terms of primary control of distributed generations (DGs) is a research gap. This paper bridges the gap by proposing dynamic-sliding mode controller (SMC) for the voltage control loop and a novel current limiting strategy (CLS) based on the sliding-discrete Fourier transform (DFT) algorithm. The proposed sliding-DFT-based CLS separates fundamental and harmonic components of the reference value of inverter current and only restricts its fundamental component to a value less than the threshold value. The proposed dynamic-SMC, which presents robust performance with low chattering phenomenon, in combination with the sliding-DFT-based CLS prevents DG's output voltage distortion. This feature is favorable for supplying local and sensitive loads. Moreover, single-phase washout filter-based power sharing method has been implemented to ensure precise active power sharing and frequency regulation of the microgrid with mixture of single-phase and three-phase DGs during asymmetrical short-circuit faults as well as better fault clearance dynamics than the conventional three-phase droop control method. The offline and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation results also confirm the effectiveness of the proposed CLS and voltage controller applied to the control structure of DGs operating in the grid-forming mode in comparison with existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Secondary Control With an Event-Triggered Consensus-Based Observer for Energy Storage Systems in Islanded DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10306326</link><description>This paper proposes a distributed secondary control strategy with an event-triggered consensus-based observer. Firstly, a voltage-shifting term is introduced in the proposed control strategy to ensure accurate current sharing, faster state-of-charge (SOC) balancing and bus voltage restoration. Since the SOC balancing speed becomes very slow when the difference in SOC between battery energy units (BEUs) is small, and SOC balancing of BEUs with low power is difficult. Therefore, an adaptive SOC balancing factor to improve the balancing speed is proposed in this control strategy. In addition, communication delay can lead to large errors in traditional consensus-based observers, and continuous communication can bring a significant burden. Considering these issues, the event-triggered consensus-based observer is proposed. This observer can achieve accurate average consensus under communication delay and greatly reduce communication burden. The convergence of the proposed observer under communication delay is theoretically proven, and the Zeno behavior is excluded. At last, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy has been verified in MATLAB/Simulink and RT-LAB experiments.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Agent Graph Reinforcement Learning Method for Electric Vehicle on-Route Charging Guidance in Coupled Transportation Electrification</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10310266</link><description>This paper proposes a multi-agent deep graph reinforcement learning-based EV on-route charging guidance strategy, aiming at minimizing the charging cost for EV drivers in an uncertain and complex environment. First, a real-time online EV charging guidance framework with bi-timescales coupled transportation electrification is proposed. On the slow timescale, the distribution locational marginal pricing of the node where the charging station is located is solved by the power purchase cost optimization of the power distribution network. On the fast timescale, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning is used to solve real-time EV requests. Second, charging stations are considered as agents, and the potential competition for future charging demand at charging stations is considered. A multi-agent actor critic algorithm with embedded graph attention networks is proposed to optimize charging decision-making of EV drivers, which exploits the interactions between agents&#8217; observations using graph attention networks. Case studies are carried out in a practical area of Xi'an, China. We analyze the necessity of model components. The effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing charging cost and its applicability in PV-equipped scenarios is verified. The convergence performance and scalability are verified by the comparison with SAC and MADDPG algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Committed Carbon Emission Operation Region for Integrated Energy Systems: Concepts and Analyses</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10313074</link><description>A novel concept called the committed carbon emission operation region (CCEOR) of integrated energy systems (IESs) is proposed in this paper, which provides a powerful tool for low-carbon operation analyses (LCOA) of IESs. The CCEOR of IESs is first defined, and a CCEOR model is then proposed by considering the uncertainty of renewable power outputs and the characteristics of low-carbon sequential operation. Based on the nonlinear constraint transformation method and distributionally robust chance-constrained (DRCC) approach, a reformulation method is developed to convert the proposed uncertain nonlinear CCEOR model into a deterministic mixed-integer convex CCEOR model. The characteristics of the CCEOR are investigated. Based on the transformed CCEOR model, the CCEOR is a high-dimensional and bounded region composed of finite convex sub-regions. A region approximation method is then presented to construct the CCEOR. The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed CCEOR model and method are validated by numerical simulation on three test systems. Simulation results indicate that the proposed CCEOR can characterize the low-carbon feasible space (LCFS) visually, the visual coupling relationships between observation variables and LCFS, and the comprehensive low-carbon operation information of operation points.</description></item><item><title>Joint Sizing Optimization Method of PVs, Hybrid Energy Storage Systems, and Power Flow Controllers for Flexible Traction Substations in Electric Railways</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10313989</link><description>Flexible traction substation (FTSS) integrates PVs, energy storage systems (ESSs), and railway power flow controllers (RPFCs) into the existing split-phase traction substation. It is a vital solution in advancing electric railways towards a low-carbon, efficient, and grid-friendly future. To improve the techno-economic performance of FTSSs, this paper proposes a sizing method to jointly size PV, RPFC, and battery-ultracapacitor hybrid ESS (HESS). Firstly, a flexible operation model of FTSS is established. It fully uses the capacity of RPFCs for improving the three-phase voltage unbalance and average power factor, thus, reducing the capacity requirements of RPFCs. Next, a linearized approach is developed for estimating battery aging affected by battery cycles, depth of discharge, state of charge, and calendar time. It facilitates obtaining battery sizing with relatively accurate life evaluation in sizing optimization. Then, a joint sizing optimization model of PV, HESS, and RPFC is established to minimize the total annualized investment and operation cost of an FTSS, and it is formulated as mixed-integer second-order programming. Finally, case studies show that the proposed method can optimize the total annualized cost of FTSSs while ensuring efficient energy utilization and improvements of the three-phase voltage unbalance and average power factor.</description></item><item><title>Novel Black Start Control Strategy With Power Boundary Analysis for PMSG-Based Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10319342</link><description>A novel power boundary analysis-based black start control (PBBC) strategy of PMSG-based wind turbines (WTs) is proposed in this paper to reduce the outage time of WTs and improve the reliability of wind power supply. The active power-rotor speed maximum boundary is quantified to estimate the kinetic energy (KE) reserve limit and the power response capability of the WTs during the black start period. In the power boundary analysis, the power response capability will collapse as the rotor speed increases to maximum. To achieve the trade-off between high KE reserve and power response capability, an overloaded power response control method during the black start period is developed, which can fully utilize the reserved KE. Moreover, the dc-bus capacitor charging model of WTs with initial KE is constructed, which can accurately represent the required KE of the WTs black start. The WTs are coordinated to achieve black start with the minimum backup power supply for the safety devices and auxiliary load according to the capacitor charging model. The proposed PBBC strategy can maximize the KE reserve of the WT and improve the power response capability, as well as reduce the backup power cost during the black start period.</description></item><item><title>Low Carbon Planning of Multiple Integrated Energy Systems Considering Trans-Regional Battery Logistics Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10323512</link><description>With the emergence of integrated energy system (IES) paradigm, planning and control of multiple interconnected IESs starts to draw attention in academia.

A CPLEX-based numerical optimization approach is developed for solving the proposed planning model and extensive numerical case studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving the energy efficiency and promoting decarbonization for multiple IESs.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Fault Ride-Through and Voltage Support Capability for MMC-HVDC Integrated Offshore Wind Farms Based on Multi-Mode Matching</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10336519</link><description>To cope with onshore AC faults in modular multilevel converter based high voltage direct current integrated offshore wind farms (OWF-MMC-HVDC), this paper proposes a multi-mode matching control (MMMC) approach. Mode I is active energy control. It is activated at high fault levels, when the reactive power output capability of the MMC is weak. Mode I uses the MMC sub-module energy to maximise the absorption of offshore surplus power to mitigate DC overvoltage problems. Mode II is dynamic reactive current optimization (DRO) control. It is activated at medium fault levels. It dynamically optimises the MMC active and reactive current command values within the permitted current margins. This simultaneously enables voltage support to the onshore grid and maximises offshore active power output, reducing offshore surplus power. Mode III is energy coordinated synchronous (ECS) control. It is activated under more mild faults. It allows simultaneous adjustment of the energy absorption rate of the wind farm-side MMC (WFMMC) and the grid-side MMC (GSMMC). This allows the energy margin of the MMCs to be utilised more fully to improve support to the onshore grid while maintaining fault ride-through capability.

Without any external controller or feedback signal filter, such components give power-sharing errors and develop voltage distortion at the output of participating inverters associated with particular sources. This paper proposes a decentralized inverter control scheme with an advanced voltage injection technique that minimizes the voltage unbalance factor (VUF) and reduces voltage total harmonic distortion (THD) in a low-voltage AC microgrid using Pareto multi-objective optimization (PMOO). It has a mean function with a second-order filter to minimize the DC offset and distortion in the feedback signal. It manages power sharing in a multi-bus distribution network with an advanced angle droop control. It also accounts for the line impedance, i.e., connecting the inverter unit to the network and the effect of zero sequence components. The simulation is tested on a modified CIGRE LV multi-bus distribution system with four wire configurations and experimentally validated on a two DG, single-bus resistive distribution model.</description></item><item><title>Data Driven Decentralized Control of Inverter Based Renewable Energy Sources Using Safe Guaranteed Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10354415</link><description>The wide integration of inverter based renewable energy sources (RESs) in modern grids may cause severe voltage violation issues due to high stochastic fluctuations of RESs. Existing centralized approaches can achieve optimal results for voltage regulation, but they have high communication burdens; existing decentralized methods only require local information, but they cannot achieve optimal results. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based methods are effective to deal with uncertainties, but it is difficult to guarantee secure constraints in existing DRL training. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes a projection embedded multi-agent DRL algorithm to achieve decentralized optimal control of distribution grids with guaranteed 100% safety. The safety of the DRL training is guaranteed via an embedded safe policy projection, which could smoothly and effectively restrict the DRL agent action space, and avoid any violation of physical constraints in distribution grid operations. The multi-agent implementation of the proposed algorithm enables the optimal solution achieved in a decentralized manner that does not require real-time communication for practical deployment. The proposed method is tested in modified IEEE 33-bus distribution and compared with existing methods; the results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving decentralized optimal control with guaranteed 100% safety and without the requirement of real-time communications.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Objective Stochastic Optimization Approach for Planning a Multi-Energy Microgrid Considering Unscheduled Islanded Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10354526</link><description>The multi-energy microgrid (MEMG) improves the energy supply economy through a multi-energy coupling operation. However, due to faults or maintenance, outages may occur in the main grid, forcing the MEMG switch to the islanded mode, which heavily impacts the energy supply reliability. To solve this problem, a multi-objective stochastic optimization approach for planning the MEMG considering unscheduled islanded operation is proposed in this paper. This method aims to optimize the planning decision, improve the operation economy in the grid-connected mode and enhance the energy supply reliability in the islanded mode. A planning-operation co-optimization model is established with two objective functions: the minimum total planning cost and the minimum expected economic loss caused by islanded operation. The model incorporates equipment capacity allocation constraints, operation constraints in two operation modes and load curtailment constraints in the islanded mode. In addition to considering the uncertainties of load and renewable energy, the model of the uncertain islanded mode is established using four correlated random variables, and the scenario tree is used for islanded scenario generation. The adaptive weighted sum (AWS) method is used to solve the multi-objective model and obtain an optimal and evenly distributed Pareto frontier. On this basis, the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) is employed to determine the final planning scheme. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which makes a trade-off between planning economy and energy supply reliability.</description></item><item><title>Grid-Forming Control of Offshore Wind Farms Connected With Diode-Based HVdc Links Based on Remote Active Power Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10361591</link><description>The connection of offshore wind farms (OWFs) via diode rectifier-based- high-voltage direct current (DR-HVdc) transmission requires the use of wind turbine (WT) converters with grid-forming (GFM) capability. However, active and reactive power coupling and oscillation issues have been revealed in WTs employing reactive power frequency (Q/f) droop-based control schemes. This paper proposes a GFM control for OWFs based on remote active power regulation. The proposed scheme remotely regulates the active power of the DR-HVdc link by adjusting the dc voltage of the onshore modular multilevel converter (MMC). As a result, the voltages of offshore point of common coupling and WT converters are freed from being controlled for active power. On this basis, the WT converters can be equipped with classical GFM control schemes that incorporate active power frequency (P/f) and reactive power voltage (Q/V) droop relationships. The offshore frequency acts as an indication of the OWF active power balance and it is measured and transmitted to the onshore MMC through a communication channel to close the remote active power control. Comparative studies of power coupling characteristics and stability reveal that the proposed control scheme can achieve efficient decoupling control of active and reactive power in WT converters, prevent oscillation risks, and significantly enhance the system's stability. The feasibility and advantages of the proposed control scheme are verified through comparative time-domain simulations.</description></item><item><title>Incentivizing the Collaboration Between Travelers and Power-Traffic Network Operators: An Asymmetric Nash Bargaining Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10363682</link><description>With the proliferation of electric vehicles and the deepened interdependence between power and traffic networks, tariff- and subsidy-based monetary incentives have been leveraged by network operators to shape vehicular&amp;amp;charging flow distributions to more closely align with network-level objectives. Travelers and network operators are generally regarded as two self-interested entities. As a result, the conflict between the system- and user-optimality usually forces travelers to bear an extra expenditure (either tariff payment or detour time) or requires network operators to dispense overmuch subsidies, both resulting in social welfare losses. The present work bridges this gap by designing a Cooperative Game based operation scheme that facilitates the collaboration between the two entities, in which collaborative travelers follow the social routing advice and then receive a certain level of reimbursement from network operators. To ensure a fair benefit allocation, we quantify the individual contribution as the difference of the path travel cost before and after the collaboration, then adopt the asymmetric Nash bargaining theory to settle the dispense of reimbursement. Numerical results on case studies indicate that the proposed model outperforms the subsidy-based non-cooperative Stackelberg Game in terms of promoting a win-win situation for both entities.</description></item><item><title>Wave Energy Optimal Control Structure With Second-Order Sliding Mode Tracking: Hardware-in-the-Loop Assessment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10363673</link><description>This article presents a hardware-in-the-loop assessment of a moment-based optimal controller including a robust super-twisting tracking term. The aim of the overall control structure is to maximise the energy extracted by a flap-type wave energy converter. An experimental assessment is performed via hardware-in-the-loop testing, which allows experiments in a controlled environment and repeatable conditions. Key aspects of the control structure are analysed in the results, with particular focus on the behaviour of the second-order sliding mode tracking term. Robustness against modelling uncertainties and finite-time convergence are evaluated, initially for a single sea state, and then across three different sea conditions. Excellent tracking performance is observed for all considered operating conditions. Finally, the super-twisting algorithm in the tracking loop is compared with the performance of a linear controller synthesised based on Youla-Ku&#269;era parametrisation, observing that the former presents better tracking capabilities, also outperforming in terms of energy extraction.</description></item><item><title>Fuzzy Adaptive Frequency Support Control Strategy for Wind Turbines With Improved Rotor Speed Recovery</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10365243</link><description>With the large-scale integration of wind power, the frequency stability of the power system is facing a significant challenge due to the wind power generation system typically operating in maximum power point tracking (MPPT) mode. Traditional frequency support control methods for wind turbines (WTs) do not consider the state of WTs and the frequency changes simultaneously. This article proposes a fuzzy adaptive frequency support control strategy for WTs with improved rotor speed recovery. Based on fuzzy logic control, the proportional gain is adaptively adjusted using the rotor speed and frequency deviation to support the grid frequency. It can fully utilize the frequency support capability of WTs with more available rotor kinetic energy while averting the over-deceleration of WTs with low rotor speed. Moreover, as the frequency deviation increases, the output power of WTs is increased by a larger proportional gain to alleviate the excessive frequency degradation. In response to the shortcomings of traditional rotor speed recovery methods, an improved rotor speed recovery method is presented by integral control, which can restore the rotor speed in stages without affecting the frequency support performance of WTs and can avoid secondary frequency drop (SFD). Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Fault-Tolerant and Attack-Resilient Cooperative Control in an Offshore Wind Farm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10366828</link><description>Modern wind farms promise increased capacity, sustainability, and efficiency through the integration of information technology with the existing wind energy technologies. However, this integration creates a new category of cyber-physical vulnerabilities stemming from physical faults and/or cyberattacks potentially leading to devastating physical impacts and catastrophic consequences. The large scale and high complexity of a wind farm, in addition to its growing connectivity, control functionality, and wind intermittency and variability make the task of cyber-physical protection particularly challenging. This paper introduces novel approaches for guaranteeing the safety, security, and reliability of a modern wind farm under simultaneous occurrence of faults and attacks using an advanced cyber-physical health monitoring scheme, defined as &#8220;intrusion detection and fault diagnosis system&#8221;, as well as fault-tolerant/attack-resilient control strategies at different levels. The proposed fault-tolerant control strategy is based on adaptive model predictive control at turbine level, enhanced with a control reallocation mechanism at farm level. The attack-resilient control strategy is based on an automatic signal correction (ASC) technique that is applied at network operator level. The effectiveness of the suggested approaches is demonstrated using an offshore wind farm model under wind turbulences, measurement noises, and realistic physical fault and cyberattack scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Dual Current Control of Renewable Energy Sources for Recent Grid Code Compliance and Reliability Enhancement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10373073</link><description>Inverter-interfaced renewable energy sources (IIRESs) are controlled to follow low-voltage ride-through requirements during different fault conditions to support grid voltages and enhance stability. However, these requirements could result in improper operation of conventional protection functions, e.g., phase selection, that are designed based on the fault current characteristics of conventional power systems. In this paper, a dual-current controller (DCC) is designed for IIRESs to allow precise operation of the conventional phase selection method (PSM) while following the positive- and negative-sequence reactive current generation (RCG) requirements imposed by recent grid codes (GCs). First, the negative-sequence current reference is designed to comply with GC requirements and inject the minimum value of negative-sequence-active current that secures a correct operation of phase selection. Subsequently, the positive-sequence-reactive current is designed to comply with RCG requirements and allow injecting the maximum combination of the positive-and negative-sequence currents without hindering the proper operation of PSM or RCG requirements. Comprehensive time-domain simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed DCC in meeting both PSM and recent RCG requirements during different fault types, resistances, and locations.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive BESS Controller for Stability Enhancement of Islanded Low Voltage Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10376028</link><description>Battery energy storage system (BESS), as grid-forming unit, can quickly regulate voltage and frequency for a 100% inverter-based islanded low voltage microgrid. However, due to some inherent characteristics of this network, such as: (a) coupling among voltage and frequency dynamics, (b) dynamics of dc source, and (c) timescale coupling among converter and network, small-signal stability is a major concern. This paper proposes an adaptive feed-forward compensation scheme for each BESS unit to reduce dynamic interactions among converters and network/load parameters. Additionally, the proposed scheme can enhance system damping capability for a wide range of operating conditions without the need for any prior/ continuous generation/network information or additional sensors. This technique can preserve the voltage/frequency regulation capability of the traditional ($\omega -P/V-Q$) droop control scheme for any low voltage networks. The existing small-signal model is modified to include dc-source, dc link, and proposed feed-forward dynamics, which assists in analyzing the impact of dc-side, ac-side, and network parameters on system small-signal stability. The system performance is analyzed with extensive case studies conducted on a CIGRE TF C$6:04:02$ benchmark system. The proposed model is validated using a real-time digital simulator with hardware-in-loop setup.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Power Imbalance Time Series With Solar Power Penetration: Butterfly Curve</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443304</link><description>Variable renewable energy (VRE) is known to be highly influenced by weather events and may ramp up or down abruptly. Therefore, increasing penetration of solar power will cause fundamental and structural changes to power system operation regimes. In this letter, we conduct an analysis of a 1-minute temporal resolution dataset from 6 Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) in the US during 2018 and 2019. By examining day-ahead power exchange and real-time power imbalance time series characteristics, distinct patterns can be observed: the day-ahead power exchange time series curve looks like the canyon, while the real-time power imbalance time series curve looks like a butterfly shape, which becomes bigger as solar penetration level increases. This letter will provide some scientific evidence for the reform of the day-ahead power exchange and real-time power balance operation in response to high solar power penetration.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Power System Topology and Energy Management Scheme Design for Hydrogen-Powered Aircraft</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10172057</link><description>The electrification of the aviation industry is a major challenge to realizing net-zero in the global energy sector. Fuel cell (FC) hybrid electric aircraft (FCHEV) demonstrate remarkable competitiveness in terms of cruise range and total economy. However, the process of simply hybridizing different power supplies together does not lead to an improvement in the aircraft economy, since a carefully designed power system topology and energy management scheme are also necessary to realize the full benefit of FCHEV. This paper provides a new approach towards the configuration of the optimal power system and proposes a novel energy management scheme for FCHEA. Firstly, four different topologies of aircraft power systems are designed to facilitate flexible power flow control and energy management. Then, an equivalent model of aircraft hydrogen consumption is formulated by analyzing the FC efficiency, FC aging, and BESS aging. Using the newly established model, the performance of aircraft can be quantitatively evaluated in detail to guide FCHEA design. The optimal aircraft energy management is realized by establishing a mathematical optimization model with the reduction of hydrogen consumption and aging costs as objectives. An experimental aircraft, NASA X-57 Maxwell, is used to provide a detailed performance evaluation of different power system topologies and validate the effectiveness of the energy management scheme. The new approach represents a guide for future power system design and energy management of electric aircraft.</description></item><item><title>Plug-and-Play of Grid-Forming Units in DC Microgrids Assisted With Power Buffers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10186352</link><description>Grid-forming units (GFUs) are fundamental devices in DC microgrids for DC bus voltage regulation. Droop control is widely used for GFU control due to its Plug-and-Play feature. However, it may fail to meet some desired DC microgrid control features and performances, such as zero steady-state DC bus voltage deviation, high system inertia, and fast DC bus voltage regulation. To achieve these desired control performances, some advanced control strategies have been proposed, but the introduction of time-dependent terms or the centralized controller in these control strategies leads to the loss of the key Plug-and-Play feature for GFUs. To maintain the Plug-and-Play feature of GFUs while meeting the desired microgrid control features and performances, this paper proposes a power buffer based control framework. The power buffer is a new device combing a capacitor and a bidirectional DC-DC converter as an interface between GFUs and the DC bus. It enables the development of a novel decoupled control strategy where GFUs are regulated by the droop control while advanced control strategies are applied to the power buffer. Thus, the Plug-and-Play feature of GFUs is maintained, while specific DC microgrid performances are also achieved simultaneously. Supported by this power buffer based control framework, GFUs can be plugged in/out DC microgrids seamlessly at any time without introducing DC bus voltage fluctuations. This allows GFUs, especially mobile GFUs, to achieve high DC bus voltage regulation performance. The hardware-in-loop (HIL) test and real circuit experimental results demonstrate its efficacy.</description></item><item><title>Model Reduction for Grid-Forming Hybrid Renewable Energy Microgrid Clusters Based on Multi-Timescale Characterization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10188666</link><description>Due to the high-order model of photovoltaic and wind power generation systems, it is complicated to accurately establish the detailed state-space model of the multi-source renewable energy microgrid (MG) system. In addition, when the MGs are interconnected into microgrid clusters (MGCs), the difficulties of the control and stability analysis are greatly increased. However, the fast and slow dynamics of power electronic interface-based units may not be sufficiently separated on time-scale, which cannot directly follow the assumptions of the traditional model reduction method. This paper selects a typical grid-forming hybrid renewable energy MGC, where the multi-timescale characteristics of the system considering detailed electromagnetic and electromechanical transient modes are analyzed. An identification method without trial-and-error searching for coupling dynamics is proposed under the non-classical singular perturbation characteristics, which is unreported in previous studies and is different from the traditional power systems. Moreover, the reduced-order model can characterize multi-timescale while guaranteeing computational efficiency, which is able to further perform the key parameter optimization and stability analysis for the larger-scale MGCs. The theoretical analysis and the time-domain simulations verify the feasibility and the accuracy of the reduced-order model.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Planning of Dual-Zero Microgrid on an Island Toward Net-Zero Carbon Emission</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10197218</link><description>This paper proposes an optimal planning method for the dual-zero microgrid (DZMG) on an island. The DZMG is the off-grid microgrid that exchanges zero power with entity grids and operates in a net-zero carbon emission mode. A net-zero emission operating strategy is designed considering the positive interaction between  $\rm CO_{2}$  flow and energy flow. The multi-scale circulation of  $\rm CO_{2}$  flow is realized by coordinating the carbon capture system, solvent storage tank (SST), and direct air capture (DAC), while the seasonal shift of energy flow is completed by the hydrogen storage system (HSS) and DAC. An optimization planning model for DZMG is developed to size the SST, DAC, and HSS optimally. The net-zero emission target and the net-zero operating strategy are involved in the model to balance the environmental and economic concerns in the planning. Numerical experiments are carried out on two IEEE test systems and a real-world island microgrid to validate the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed method. Simulation results reveal that the proposed method reduces the planning cost by over 25% compared with the extant zero-carbon-based method. Besides, the economy of the DZMG positively correlates to carbon prices and technological maturity, while inversely relates to fuel prices.</description></item><item><title>A Transfer Learning-Based Method for Cyber-Attack Tolerance in Distributed Control of Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10210203</link><description>Distributed secondary control of a microgrid highly relies on information exchange via communication networks, which may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This paper aims to enhance the cyber-attack tolerance against various types of cyber-attacks, including false data injection (FDI) attack, denial of service (DoS) attack, latency attack. To this end, a data-driven signal estimator is developed based on a deep neural network (DNN), where the inputs are local sampled time-series measurements (frequency, voltage, active/reactive power) and the outputs are the sums of communicated signals from other units. To achieve a better generalization ability, a representation subspace distance (RSD)-based transfer learning model is designed for offline training. As an advantage, the proposed estimator can work for various working conditions without multiple training processes. For online stage, a reference tracking scheme is designed to recover the attacked signal based on the estimated signal, which mitigates or eliminates the effect of cyber-attacks. Finally, numerical case studies are presented to validate the effectiveness and advantages of the method.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive Discrete Piecewise Droop Control in DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10210195</link><description>In DC microgrids, the discrete piecewise droop control is an attractive decentralized control strategy due to its ability to better achieve load distribution targets within a preset bus voltage deviation range. However, the practical application of this control strategy is challenged by the difficulty of implementing switching among different segments of droop curves. The conventional hysteresis-based switching approach suffers from serious undesired droop curve switching issues that parallel distributed generators extremely easily switch to different segments of droop curves as loads vary. Consequently, the power distribution significantly deviates from its intended control objective, leading to suboptimal system performance and adversely affecting the durability and longevity of energy storage units that are costly to maintain. Even worse, certain units may abruptly overload, posing a significant safety threat to the entire system. In this paper, first, the negative effect and corresponding cause of undesired droop curve switching that occurs in the hysteresis-based discrete piecewise droop control are both comprehensively investigated. Accordingly, a decentralized adaptive discrete piecewise droop control featuring a distinct control structure and control logic is proposed. Compared to the hysteresis-based switch approach, the control structure enables continuous command regulation rather discretely. The control logic restricts the command change to a small value during a step cycle instead of a significant change. Furthermore, the proposed controller is comprehensively designed based on the transient analysis. Results from both simulations and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed control method.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Optimization for Reactive Power Sharing and Stability of Inverter-Based Resources Under Voltage Limits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10210641</link><description>Reactive power sharing and voltage containment for inverter-based resources (IBRs) are two important but related objectives in inverter-based grids. In this paper, we propose a distributed control technique to achieve these objectives simultaneously. Our controller consists of two components: a purely local nonlinear integral controller that adjusts the IBR voltage setpoint, and a distributed primal-dual optimizer that coordinates reactive power sharing among the IBRs using neighbor-to-neighbor communication. The controller prioritizes the voltage containment objective over reactive power sharing at all times; except for the IBRs with saturated voltages, it provides reactive power sharing among all IBRs. Considering the voltage saturation and the coupling between voltage and angle dynamics, a formal closed-loop stability analysis based on singular perturbation theory is provided, which provides practical tuning guidance for the overall control system. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed controller for different case studies, we apply it to a low-voltage microgrid, the modified CIGRE medium-voltage network benchmark, and the IEEE 33 bus radial distribution system, all simulated in the MATLAB/Simulink environment.</description></item><item><title>Novel IoT-Based Droop Control for Battery SoC Balancing Among Multiple Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10214366</link><description>Energy storage systems are a crucial part of microgrids, making up for their autonomous operation. Therefore, much research has focused on increasing their lifetime and operational efficiency. One of the most viable topics is maintaining connected energy storage units (ESUs) at the same state of charge (SoC). Droop control techniques have been developed in centralized, decentralized, and distributed fashions. This paper proposes a novel IoT-based droop control that can achieve SoC balancing not only within the same microgrid but also between multiple microgrids. The proposed architecture increases reliability and flexibility while allowing the system to be expanded, reconfigured, or upgraded, enabling the plug-and-play capability more easily. First, the proposed IoT-based hierarchical control and communication architecture is presented. Then, the proposed SoC balancing technique and its coordination with IoT architecture are introduced. Through 24-hour simulations, the proposed technique&#8217;s scalability, adaptiveness, and robustness are validated under different scenarios, including the operation of any microgrids or ESUs with different capacities and the operation in case of a communication failure. Finally, the IoT value chain of the proposed technique is experimentally validated using a physical laboratory microgrid that uses HTTP protocol to send and receive data through the ThingSpeak IoT-cloud service.</description></item><item><title>An Affine Arithmetic-Based Energy Management System for Cooperative Multi-Microgrid Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10224308</link><description>This paper presents an Energy Management System (EMS) for a Multi-Microgrid (MMG) system that considers power exchanges between a set of interconnected microgrids (MGs) in an Active Distribution Network (ADN), taking into account electricity demand and renewable energy generation uncertainties using an Affine Arithmetic (AA) approach. The deterministic EMS model is formulated as a cost minimization problem which includes detailed operational constraints of thermal generators and Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) within each MG, as well as power flow limits at the Point of Common Coupling (PCC), considering all power exchanges among the set of MGs and the ADN. The uncertainties are formulated in the AA domain to obtain an EMS model that is robust for a range of realizations of the uncertain parameters, with no need of statistical assumptions or repeated calculations, which can be solved with relatively low computational burden, as opposed to other approaches such as Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). The proposed AA model is then tested and validated with data of a set of MGs in an ADN located in S&#227;o Paulo, Brazil, through comparisons with the deterministic model, MCS, and a Two-Stage Stochastic Programming (TSSP) approach. Results show an execution time improvement in the AA model of approximately 70% when compared to a MCS approach, which is expected to be slower, while considering the same range of uncertainties. Furthermore, the operation cost of the overall system decreases, as expected, by approximately 63% when power exchanges are enabled, as opposed to the individual operation of each MG, demonstrating the economic benefit of MMG systems.</description></item><item><title>Assessment and Mitigation of Multi-Mode Oscillations in Wind-Solar Hybrid Multi-Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10225568</link><description>Multi-microgrids (MMGs) provide an effective solution for further improving the overall economy and ensuring resilience under major disasters, while high penetration level of renewable energy generations inevitably brings adverse oscillation problems to the system. So far, no comprehensive study has been carried out to assess the interaction and oscillatory stability of autonomous wind-solar hybrid MMGs. Besides, the feasible method giving consideration to coordinated control and simple communication architecture for damping out the multi-mode oscillations deserves further research. Therefore, this paper first establishes a detailed model of wind-solar hybrid MMGs by taking multiple types of renewable energy generations with similar and different response features in timescale into account, which are rarely included by most of the existing studies. Then, participation factor analysis is applied to reveal the multi-timescale interactions within the single microgrid and MMGs. Meanwhile, different critical influence factors, especially primary energy source fluctuations, are thoroughly investigated through sensitivity analysis to assess the multi-mode oscillations and stability issues. To mitigate the undesirable multi-mode oscillations, a hierarchical distributed damping controller based on the optimal partial output feedback technique is proposed subsequently. Finally, comparative tests are conducted to validate the correctness of the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>An Improved Additional Control Method for Extending Stable Operating Region of Multi-Terminal LVDC System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10227311</link><description>The low damping of a multi-terminal low-voltage direct current (MT-LVDC) system with the influence of negative impedance characteristic in DC network, can reduce the system stability. This study aims to find an additional control method to extend the system stable operating region on the premise of not changing the local control system of each converter and not affecting the accurate tracking of each converter&#8217;s power command under their normal dispatching, thereby significantly extending the stable operating region of a MT-LVDC system by small damping powers, and ensuring the stable DC voltage when operating point changes. First, an additional control method based on feedback linearization is proposed. Then an analytical expression of damping powers required to realize additional control is built, and a method to obtain the overall stable operating region is established. Furthermore, a multi-objective optimization model for additional control is proposed, and the optimized additional controller is obtained using Pareto front solution. The proposed method is experimentally verified to be able to provide an effective method to improve the system stability with simple control structure and low complexity, which can be conveniently implemented in the MT-LVDC system.</description></item><item><title>Bi-Level Adaptive Storage Expansion Strategy for Microgrids Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10246411</link><description>Battery energy storage (BES) is a versatile resource for the secure and economic operation of microgrids (MGs). Prevailing stochastic optimization-based approaches for BES expansion planning for MGs are computationally complicated. This work proposes a data-driven bi-level multi-period BES expansion planning framework to determine the siting, sizing, and timing of BES installations. The proposed planning framework unifies deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and linear programming, thereby decoupling the determinations for the integer and continuous decision variables in two time scales, respectively. In the upper level, a rainbow DRL agent with quantile regression is trained to provide dynamic planning policies to accommodate stochastic renewable energy resources (RESs), load, and battery price changes efficiently. The lower level computes the optimal operation of MGs with frequency constraints to hedge the islanding contingency. The two levels communicate with one another by exchanging storage configuration and operating expenses in order to accomplish the shared goal of minimizing investment and operation costs. Comparative case studies on an MG are carried out to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DRL-based solution to the mixed-integer linear programming counterpart on efficiency, scalability, and adaptability.</description></item><item><title>Analytical Large-Signal Modeling of Inverter-Based Microgrids With Koopman Operator Theory for Autonomous Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10250860</link><description>The microgrid (MG) plays a crucial role in the energy transition, but its nonlinearity presents a significant challenge for large-signal power systems studies in the electromagnetic transient (EMT) time scale. In this paper, we develop a large-signal linear MG model that considers the detailed dynamics of the primary and zero-control levels based on the Koopman operator (KO) theory. Firstly, a set of observable functions is carefully designed to capture the nonlinear dynamics of the MG. The corresponding linear KO is then analytically derived based on these observables, resulting in the linear representation of the original nonlinear MG with observables as the new coordinate. The influence of external input on the system dynamics is also considered during the derivation, enabling control of the MG. We solve the voltage control problem using the traditional linear quadratic integrator (LQI) method to demonstrate that textbook linear control techniques can accurately control the original nonlinear MG via the developed KO-linearized MG model. Our proposed KO linearization method is generic and can be easily extended for different control objectives and MG structures using our analytical derivation procedure. We validate the effectiveness of our methodology through various case studies.</description></item><item><title>Voltage Sensitivity-Related Hybrid Coordinated Power Control for Voltage Regulation in ADNs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10174718</link><description>Voltage is a key operation index for active distribution networks. Coordinated power compensation of distributed energy resources (DERs) has shown promising results in alleviating voltage violation. Most methods use global optimization to obtain the optimal use of network-wide available resources, which becomes unfair when solving the same voltage issue of regional buses. Refined coordination of DERs on regional buses has not been formed as well. Therefore, this paper proposes a voltage sensitivity-related hybrid coordination algorithm. In order to fully tap into surplus reactive power of DESs, Volt/VAr control is considered in a higher priority than Volt/Watt control. For the selected crucial bus, a hybrid coordinated power compensation of regional DERs is designed in descending order of sensitivity or in proportion to available capacity under the same sensitivity value, which prioritizes using local and adjacent DERs to improve regulation effect and reduce changes in power flow. Due to the fact that voltage information is updated through association, the crucial bus needs to be reselected based on voltage assessment as a result, and the algorithm process will continue until the updated bus voltages become acceptable. Finally, the case study results in MATLAB indicate the effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>Graph Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Inverter-Based Active Voltage Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10223729</link><description>Active voltage control (AVC) is a widely-used technique to improve voltage quality essential in the emerging active distribution networks (ADNs). However, the voltage fluctuation caused by intermittent renewable energy makes it difficult for traditional voltage control methods to deal with. In this paper, the voltage control problem is formulated as a decentralized partial observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP), and a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm is developed considering each controllable device as an agent. The new formulation aims to adjust the strategies of agents to stabilize the voltage within the specified range and reduce the network loss. To better represent the mutual interaction between the agents, a graph convolutional network (GCN) is introduced. By aggregating the information of adjacent agents, complex latent features are effectively extracted by the GCN, hence promotes the generation of voltage control strategy for the agents. Meanwhile, a barrier function is applied in MARL to ensure the system voltage within a safe operation range. Comparative studies are conducted with traditional voltage control and other MARL methods on IEEE 33-bus and 141-bus systems, which demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>An Improved Neural Lyapunov Method for Transient Stability Assessment of Networked Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10208158</link><description>The transient stability analysis (TSA) of power-electronics-interfaced microgrids has a vital role in secure system operation. Such analysis normally entails extremely nonlinear and complex dynamics. Nearly all of the current studies have addressed this problem by making further assumptions in the system dynamics, and there remains an overall lack of an effective and general solution. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel neural Lyapunov framework with a trial solution structure for the TSA, which is a learning-based approach. On top of that, the modules that have been included within the framework consist of a learning and a falsification module. In general, the learning module iteratively learns the candidate Lyapunov functions via deep neural networks. The falsification module guides the learning process to satisfy the Lyapunov conditions and guarantees provable stability. The learned neural Lyapunov function attempts to identify the disturbances that the networked microgrid tolerates through the estimated region of attraction (ROA) in addition to determining large-signal stability. Applications of this method for power electronics interfaced networked microgrids are presented and multiple case studies are used to validate the suggested strategy. The findings demonstrate how the suggested framework expands the ROA while being quick, effective, and generalizable.

Specifically, we propose, respectively, SACPER (Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with Prioritized Experience Replay (PER)) and Constrained Variational Policy Optimization (CVPO) DRL algorithms to address the sequential decision-making problem of active network management (ANM) in distributed power systems and optimizing emergency load shedding (ELS) control problems. First, we propose SACPER for the ANM problem, which prioritizes the training of samples with large errors and poor policy performance. Evaluation of SACPER in terms of stability improvement and convergence speed shows that the ANM problem is optimized and energy loss and operational constraint violations are minimized. Next, we introduce CVPO for the ELS control problem, which is formulated as the Safe Reinforcement Learning (SRL) framework to address safety constraint prioritization issues in power systems. We consider additional voltage variables in the network as strong constraints for SRL to achieve fast voltage recovery and minimize unnecessary energy loss, while ensuring good training performance and efficiency. To demonstrate the performances of SACPER, we apply it to ANM6-Easy environment. The CVPO algorithm is applied to IEEE 39-Bus and IEEE 300-Bus systems. The simulation results of SACPER and CVPO are validated through extensive comparisons with other state-of-the-art DRL approaches.</description></item><item><title>Voltage-Price Coupling in Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10210691</link><description>Demand-side users are practical and economical resources for participating in voltage regulation of distribution networks, whose regulation effect is closely related to the price. This paper proposes a novel voltage-price coupling (VPC) mechanism to construct a fair voltage-based nodal pricing method for distribution networks to encourage demand-side users to participate in voltage regulation to improve voltage quality. The voltage impact factor is established to fairly characterize the impact of each nodal power on the voltage deviation in the distribution network. Further, the VPC mechanism is constructed to highly couple the nodal price with the voltage in both spatial and time dimensions by establishing distribution rules of prices at different nodes and different horizons. The VPC mechanism forms a fair and adaptable voltage-based nodal pricing method for distribution networks, which also considers the impact on the existing pricing mechanism, and the balance between the voltage regulation effect and user experience. Then, a price-driven voltage regulation (PVR) model is proposed for the distribution network to reduce voltage deviations and user costs, which integrates the demand-side resource management, voltage regulation, and voltage-based nodal pricing. Case studies verify the effectiveness of the VPC mechanism and the PVR model.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Sizing of Behind-the-Meter Battery Storage for Providing Profit-Oriented Stackable Services</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10177780</link><description>This paper focuses on an advanced optimization method for optimizing the size of the behind-the-meter (BTM) battery energy storage system (BESS) that provides stackable services to improve return on investment. The grid frequency regulation service and two customer-side services, i.e., energy arbitrage and peak shaving, are selected as stackable services of BTM BESS. A two-stage stochastic programming model is proposed to handle uncertainty and achieve the most cost-effective BTM BESS size. The first stage obtains the optimal BTM BESS size with the maximum annual net income. The operating strategy of the BTM BESS is optimized in the second stage to maximize revenue while considering the BTM BESS degradation cost and the uncertainty of operating scenarios. A hybrid solution algorithm combining genetic algorithm and mixed-integer linear programming is employed to solve the two-stage stochastic programming model. A strategy based on a recorder and a filter is proposed to speed up the solution. In addition, a novel method for converting the second-level regulation signal into the equivalent minute-level signal is offered to reduce computational burden while maintaining high accuracy. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated based on an industrial load and regulation information from the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) market.</description></item><item><title>Probabilistic Multi-Energy Load Forecasting for Integrated Energy System Based on Bayesian Transformer Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10185930</link><description>Probabilistic multi-energy load forecasting in an integrated energy system is very complex, because it needs to consider the following three aspects simultaneously: 1) Complex coupling relationship exists between multi-energy loads. 2) The intrinsic distribution of load uncertainties and dynamic changes of the distributions should be captured. 3) The probability distribution containing sufficient information should be generated. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-task Bayesian neural network, Bayesian Multiple-Decoder Transformer (BMDeT), which can capture both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, and achieve the joint probabilistic forecasting of the multi-energy loads considering their complex coupling relationship and related uncertainties. Firstly, the proposed model adopts the one-encoder multi-decoder framework, which could catch the multi-load coupling information by one Bayesian encoder and perform respective subtasks by multiple Bayesian decoders. Specifically, the Bayesian multi-head attention mechanism is proposed to capture the complex coupling relationship and uncertainties between multi-energy loads by optimizing the distribution of network parameters. Then, a multi-task balance method based on Bayesian theory is proposed to quantify the uncertainties of different tasks by giving trainable weights. Finally, the proposed model has been verified on a real-world load data set, the results show that it has superior performance over other benchmark models.</description></item><item><title>Resilience Assessment for Integrated Energy System Considering Gas-Thermal Inertia and System Interdependency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10221865</link><description>The gas-thermal inertia and power-gas-heat interdependency, as two fundamental features of the IES, play a crucial role in IES resilience during extreme events. This paper proposes a comprehensive resilience assessment framework to investigate the influence of these two factors on IES resilience performance during extreme events. Considering the inherent operational properties of power distribution system (PDS), natural gas system (NGS) and district heating system (DHS), the interactions among multiple sectors and gas-thermal inertia, a dynamic optimal energy flow model is established to simulate the IES cascading failures and restoration process under outage scenarios. On this basis, the multi-stage resilience curves for the IES as well as each subsystem are obtained. Regarding the geometric features of the resilience curves, a set of interdependency metrics is further proposed to quantify the sensitivity of NGS and DHS vulnerabilities that arise from their interdependency with PDS. Comparative experiments are conducted to analyze the influence of gas-thermal inertia and system interdependency on IES resilience. The results demonstrated the proposed metrics can effectively assess the spatial and temporal interdependency among the resilience of power, gas, and heat subsystems, providing useful information for operators in identifying critical links and evaluating potential upgrades to enhance the resilience of IES.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Agent Distributed Operation Solution to Electricity and Natural Gas Distribution Systems for Enhancing Resilience</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10229242</link><description>The multi-energy synergy of electricity and natural gas distribution systems (EGDS) offers a more proactive potential for resiliency in extreme contingencies. The interests of energy systems owned by different agents are nonnegligible in resilience enhancement. Existing distributed coordinated operation models seldom consider the multiple resilience resources co-scheduling cost and the social resilience enhancement benefit allocation. Absence of an equilibrium transaction settlement rule to constrain the &#8220;reap without effort&#8221; phenomenon and the concealed quotation behavior. To address this issue, this paper presents a multi-agent distributed operation and settlement model to EGDS for enhancing resilience, and a hierarchical solution based on the cooperative game theory is developed. Specifically, the model is formulated as a two-stage optimization framework including the social resilience enhancement subproblem and the transaction settlement subproblem. The transaction settlement rule of multi-energy coupling support is characterized as the model with quotation uncertainty is solved, and the balanced operational cost of a diverse allocation strategy is given as an output of the optimization. Two test cases of different scales are used to verify the validity and applicability of the model, whose numerical results show the subject interest and social interest are both improved while protecting privacy.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Energy Management of Multi-Entity Integrated Electricity and Heat Systems: A Review of Architectures, Optimization Algorithms, and Prospects</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10237300</link><description>Synergies among multiple energy sectors in an integrated electricity and heat system (IEHS) improve energy efficiency, economic operation and renewable energy utilization, thus contributing to a sustainable society. In reality, however, energy sectors are owned and operated by different entities, constituting a multi-entity integrated electricity and heat system (ME-IEHS). This calls for distributed energy management due to the curse of dimensionality and privacy concerns. Specifically, it is challenging to achieve socially optimal coordination using local information and limited information exchange, while the key to distributed energy management is to decompose the integrated energy management problem into smaller subproblems for interactive entities, respectively. This paper first explains the fundamentals of IEHSs including the definition of entities. According to the interactions among entities, this paper then establishes and compares the current energy management architectures. Distributed optimization algorithms supporting distributed energy management of the IEHS are systematically reviewed, while the extension to deal with uncertainties in a distributed fashion is also summarized. Finally, future research directions regarding the strategic behaviors yielded from multi-stakeholders and the distributed learning solution are envisioned.</description></item><item><title>Smart Home Energy Management: VAE-GAN Synthetic Dataset Generator and Q-Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10171153</link><description>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in academia and industry in the analysis of electrical consumption in residential buildings and the implementation of smart home energy management systems (HEMS) to reduce household energy usage and costs. HEMS have been designed to emulate the statistical and functional characteristics of real smart grids. However, a major challenge in this research area is the limited availability of publicly accessible datasets. To address this challenge and further leverage the potential of artificial HEMS applications, it is crucial to develop time series that accurately represent diverse operating conditions of synthetic systems. This paper introduces a novel approach based on the combination of variational auto-encoder-generative adversarial network (VAE-GAN) techniques to generate time-series data of energy consumption in smart homes. Additionally, we investigate the performance of the generative model when integrated with a Q-learning based HEMS. The effectiveness of the Q-learning based HEMS is assessed through online experiments using real-world smart home data. To evaluate the quality of the generated dataset, we employ various metrics including Kullback&#8211;Leibler (KL) divergence, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), and the Wasserstein distance, which quantify the disparities between probability distributions of the real and synthetic data. Our experimental results demonstrate that the synthetic data generated by VAE-GAN closely aligns with the distribution of real data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the utilization of the generated data facilitates the training of a more efficient Q-learning based HEMS, surpassing the performance achieved with datasets generated using baseline approaches.</description></item><item><title>Customer Targeting for Load Flexibility via Resident Behavior Segmentation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10188905</link><description>Caused by the widespread of renewable energy resources, oversupply and overdesign of reserve capacity are serious concerns in electrical power system. Hence, power system needs load flexibility (LF) to mitigate the concerns. Despite utilities&#8217; efforts to aggregate LF for residential loads, aggregated LF operations are typically inefficient due to load uncertainties caused by individual customers&#8217; varying behaviors. Therefore, in this study, a novel customer targeting model for LF participation is proposed based on resident behavior analysis. The proposed scheme comprises a resident behavior segmentation model (RBSM) performing deep-learning-based and probabilistic clustering and a virtual LF operation model (VLFOM) considering human comfort. Simulations were conducted in a residential environment in San Diego, California. The superior performance of RBSM was confirmed through internal clustering evaluation methods. Accordingly, the results of the VLFOM model confirmed the criteria of resident behaviors for adequate LF participation. The experiment results present that the proposed model is economically and environmentally effective to the LF operation for utilities. Finally, implications of LF aggregation based on uncertainty assessment and meaningful suggestions of the settlement design for future LF expansion are presented.</description></item><item><title>Novel Incentive-Based Multi-Level Framework for Flexibility Provision in Smart Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10210201</link><description>Within smart grids, end-users often seek to reduce electricity costs using a home energy management system, while the power utility aims to optimize the grid operation. This article proposes a novel three-level framework to tackle the contradictory nature of the objectives of end-user and distribution system operators (DSOs) by upward and downward flexibility provision. In addition, the proposed method designs a novel incentive program based on the flexibility provided by the end-users. Then, the aggregated flexibility is offered to the DSO. The model takes advantage of the local flexibility of home appliances to re-schedule their use based on the flexibility request from the DSO. The aggregator provides incentive programs based on the flexibility provided by the prosumers to reduce/shift energy consumption. The proposed methodology considers the alignment of the conflicting techno-economic objectives of the prosumers and system operators. The results show that our proposed strategy has increased the monetary benefits for prosumers for their flexibility services provided to the DSO compared to other scenarios. Moreover, the proposed method improves the voltage profiles and reduces the peak load and power losses by 20.8% and 24.6%, respectively, of the overall system.</description></item><item><title>Predicting Strategic Energy Storage Behaviors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10214105</link><description>Energy storage are strategic participants in electricity markets to arbitrage price differences. Future power system operators must understand and predict strategic storage arbitrage behaviors for market power monitoring and capacity adequacy planning. This paper proposes a novel data-driven approach that incorporates prior model knowledge for predicting the strategic behaviors of price-taker energy storage systems. We propose a gradient-descent method to find the storage model parameters given the historical price signals and observations. We prove that the identified model parameters will converge to the true user parameters under a class of quadratic objective and linear equality-constrained storage models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through numerical experiments with synthetic and real-world storage behavior data. The proposed approach significantly improves the accuracy of storage model identification and behavior forecasting compared to previous blackbox data-driven approaches.</description></item><item><title>A Distributed Coordination Strategy for Heterogeneous Building Flexible Thermal Loads in Responding to Smart Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10221860</link><description>Air conditioning systems are promising energy flexibility resources for smart grids. However, buildings with various thermodynamics must be coordinated to utilize limited energy flexibility effectively. This study proposes a distributed coordination strategy to coordinate building flexible thermal loads of different characteristics for optimized utilization of energy flexibility in a scalable and distributed manner. It consists of two components:1) an average consensus-based distributed sensing scheme to estimate the average thermal state of charge (SoC) of multiple zones, and 2) a weighted consensus-based distributed allocation module to allocate the demand response (DR) tasks or limited energy resources to multiple zones, proportional to their thermal storage capacities and deviations to the average thermal SoCs. Both algorithms achieve their goals respectively by fully distributed means through a sparse network with neighbor-to-neighbor communication. The sufficient condition for converging the weighted consensus algorithm is also derived for the first time. The proposed strategy is adopted for 1) weighted DR participation of residential inverter air conditioners and 2) weighted water flow redistribution of the commercial building water heating systems under urgent DR events. Simulation results show that adopting the distributed coordination strategy avoids the early depletion of demand flexibility resources and nonuniform thermal comfort sacrifices under uncoordinated control.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Online Game-Theoretic Framework for Real-Time Energy Trading in Smart Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10227354</link><description>In this paper, the real-time energy trading problem between the energy provider and the consumers in a smart grid system is studied. The problem is formulated as a hierarchical game, where the energy provider acts as a leader who determines the pricing strategy that maximizes its profits, while the consumers act as followers who react by adjusting their energy demand to save their energy costs and enhance their energy consumption utility. In particular, the energy provider employs a pricing strategy that depends on the aggregated amount of energy requested by the consumers, which suits a commodity-limited market. With this price setting, the consumers&#8217; energy demand response strategies are designed under a non-cooperative game framework, where a unique generalized Nash equilibrium point is shown to exist. As an extension, the consumers are assumed to be unaware of their future energy consumption behaviors due to uncertain personal needs. To address this issue, an online distributed energy trading framework is proposed, where the energy provider and the consumers can design their strategies only based on the historical knowledge of consumers&#8217; energy consumption behavior at each bidding stage. Besides, the proposed framework can be implemented in a distributed manner such that the consumers can design their demand responses by only exchanging information with their neighboring consumers, which requires much fewer communication resources and would thus be more suitable for the practical operation of the grid. As a theoretical guarantee, the proposed framework is further proved to asymptotically achieve the same performance as the offline solution for both energy provider and consumers&#8217; optimization problems. The performance of practical designs of the proposed online distributed energy trading framework is finally illustrated in numerical experiments.</description></item><item><title>Novel Architecture of Energy Management Systems Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning in Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10255281</link><description>In microgrids, energy management systems (EMS) have been considered essential systems to optimize energy scheduling, control and operation for reliable power systems. Conventional EMS researches have been predominantly performed by employing demand-side management and demand response (DR). Nonetheless, multi-action control in EMS is confronted with operational challenges in terms of the profitability and stability. In this paper, energy information systems (EIS), energy storage systems (ESS), energy trading risk management systems (ETRMS), and automatic DR (ADR) are integrated to efficiently manage the profitability and stability of the whole EMS by optimal energy scheduling. The proposed microgrid EMS architecture is optimized by using proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm, which has been known to have good performance in terms of learning stability and complexity. A novel performance metric, represented as a burden of load and generation (BoLG), is proposed to evaluate the energy management performance. The BoLG is incorporated into the reward settings for optimizing the management of multi-action controls such as load shifting, energy charging-discharging, and transactions. From the simulation results, it is confirmed that the proposed architecture can improve energy management performance with the proper trade-off between stability and profitability, compared to dynamic programming (DP)-based and double deep Q-network (DDQN)-based operation.</description></item><item><title>Black Start of Coastline Power Networks From Grid-Forming Ship-to-Grid Services</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10168164</link><description>The expansion of electric ships in the transportation sector, along with environmental advantages, has the potential to enhance the resilience and stability of coastline power grids during blackouts or emergencies through ship-to-grid technology. The power grids located in remote coastal and island communities often face high energy costs and are more vulnerable to blackouts due to their increased risk of natural disasters. Ship-to-grid technology offers an innovative localized solution that enables onshore utilities to avoid the need for installing excessive on-land energy storage capacity to enhance stability and resiliency in the coastline power grid. Electric ships can provide a flexible source to restart power to critical facilities such as hospitals and communication networks. In this paper, a comprehensive scheme for integrating ships into the grid system is proposed, which involves a grid-forming control approach through a DC-link connection. The approach employs a droop-based control strategy, current limiter control, and voltage source grid interface to regulate both voltage and frequency at various stages of the coastline power network restoration. The approach is verified using a 4-zone shipboard power system with grid-forming DC-link connection, for black start of a modified IEEE 30-bus test system during a multi-step black start and re-energization process.</description></item><item><title>Coupling Constraint Behavior and Design Method for Two-Degree-of-Freedom in Series-Parallel Architecture Electric Energy Router</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10174282</link><description>For low-voltage distribution networks (LVDNs), the series-parallel architecture electric energy router (SPA-EER) has two obvious advantages under two-degree-of-freedom (TDF) control, that is, power flexible operation and up to 200% power transmission. However, there are coupling constraint behaviors between TDF, which will mutually limit their operation ranges. To this end, by analyzing simultaneous operation principles of active and reactive powers in SPA-EER, these coupling constraint behaviors are revealed, which is important for specifying the TDF operation ranges and promoting the safe operation for SPA-EER. Additionally, the effects of TDF on the maximum available active and reactive powers output by SPA-EER system are discussed, which can provide a basis for the mode selection of system. Based on the criterion of maximizing the utilization of renewable energy, a mode generator (MG) considering the actual powers of load, DC bus, LVND port, series converter and parallel converter is proposed to determine the suitable values for TDF, and then a MG-based TDF power flow flexible control (TDFPFFC) is developed to respond to demands of different operation modes. Finally, the simulation results are presented to verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed MG-based TDFPFFC.</description></item><item><title>Tracing, Ranking and Valuation of Aggregated DER Flexibility in Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10186453</link><description>The integration of distributed energy resources (DER) makes active distribution networks (ADNs) natural providers of flexibility services. However, the optimal operation of flexible units in ADNs is highly complex, which poses challenges for distribution system operators (DSOs) in aggregating DER flexibility. For example, to maximise the provision of services, flexible units must be strongly coordinated to manage network constraints, e.g., by performing simultaneous flexible power consumption and production in different parts of the network (referred to as power swaps in this work). Furthermore, due to the nonlinearities of aggregated DER flexibility provision, some units may need to rapidly change their outputs to enable the services. To address these challenges, this paper brings together exact AC optimal power flow (OPF) models and a cooperative game formulation and presents a new framework for tracing, ranking, and valuation of aggregated DER flexibility in ADNs. Extensive tests and simulations performed for the 33-bus radial distribution network demonstrate that the framework enables translating complex DER interactions into useful information for DSOs by ranking the criticality of flexible units and performing flexibility valuation based on its cost or economic surplus. Additionally, the framework proposes no-swap constraints and a nonlinearity metric which can be used by DSOs to identify unreliable operating regions with power swaps or rapid changes in flexible unit dispatch.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Operating Envelope-Based Local Energy Market for Prosumers With Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10208161</link><description>This paper presents a new framework for the management of prosumers with electric vehicles (EVs) and photovoltaic (PV) systems in a local energy market (LEM) using the dynamic operating envelope (DOE) that secures the network operation for prosumers&#8217; trading and allows prosumers to manage EVs charge/discharge with PV systems. Prosumers can configure the charge/discharge status of their EVs depending on mobility and determine their net import/export power which will be used to establish DOEs. The proposed framework incorporates a bidding strategy to enable prosumers to participate in the LEM within DOE limits, and peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading is developed to offer economic benefits to prosumers. The framework&#8217;s performance is evaluated with a 100% penetration level of EVs and PV systems on the IEEE 55-node low-voltage European test system. The simulation results demonstrate that DOEs can facilitate prosumers in managing their imports/exports for trading without violating voltage and congestion limits. The proposed framework efficiently manages EV charging/discharging with PV systems and enables prosumers to make optimal bids within DOEs, thereby benefiting from P2P trading in the LEM.</description></item><item><title>A Fully Distributed Privacy-Preserving Energy Management System for Networked Microgrid Cluster Based on Homomorphic Encryption</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10232904</link><description>The networked microgrid cluster (NMGC) integrating multiple heterogeneous microgrids is an effective way to improve the renewable energy utilization. However, the centralized scheduling scheme may be less secure and suffer from privacy concerns. In this paper, we present a fully distributed privacy-preserving energy management framework for secure and fair energy sharing within NMGC. To this end, firstly, a robust energy management model based on generalized Nash bargaining is formulated for proactive energy sharing and fair benefit allocation among microgrids. Then, a fully distributed optimization algorithm combining the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm and distributed consensus protocol is designed for the formulated energy management model. It only depends on flexible peer-to-peer communication without needing any third-party coordinators, potentially preventing a single-point failure. Furthermore, a privacy preservation communication scheme based on homomorphic encryption is designed for the developed distributed optimization algorithm. With the proposed privacy preservation scheme, that is, by using ciphertext instead of plaintext throughout the entire communication and computation process, the privacy of each microgrid can be prevented from being leaked to malicious adversaries and eavesdroppers. Finally, the effectiveness and superiorities of the developed distributed energy sharing mechanism are verified via numerical case studies.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Load Restoration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10236471</link><description>This paper addresses the load restoration problem after power outage events. Our primary proposed methodology is using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning to optimize the load restoration process in distribution systems, modeled as networked microgrids, via determining the optimal operational sequence of circuit breakers (switches). An innovative invalid action masking technique is incorporated into the multi-agent method to handle both the physical constraints in the restoration process and the curse of dimensionality as the action space of operational decisions grows exponentially with the number of circuit breakers. The features of our proposed method include centralized training for multi-agents to overcome non-stationary environment problems, decentralized execution to ease the deployment, and zero constraint violations to prevent harmful actions. Our simulations are performed in OpenDSS and Python environments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using the IEEE 13, 123, and 8500-node distribution test feeders. The results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve a significantly better learning curve and stability than the conventional methods.</description></item><item><title>Grid-Forming and Spatially Distributed Control Design of Dynamic Virtual Power Plants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10239108</link><description>We present a novel grid-forming control design approach for dynamic virtual power plants (DVPP). We consider a group of heterogeneous grid-forming distributed energy resources (DER) which collectively provide desired dynamic ancillary services, such as fast frequency and voltage control. To achieve that, we study the nontrivial aggregation of grid-forming DERs to establish the DVPP, and employ an adaptive divide-and-conquer strategy that disaggregates the desired control specifications of the aggregate DVPP via adaptive dynamic participation factors to obtain local desired behaviors of each DER. We then design local controllers at the DER level to realize these local desired behaviors. In the process, physical and engineered limits of each DER are taken into account. We extend the proposed approach to make it also compatible with grid-following DER controls, thereby establishing the concept of so-called hybrid DVPPs. Furthermore, we generalize the DVPP design to spatially dispersed DER locations in power grids with different voltage levels and  $R/X$  ratios. Finally, the DVPP control performance is verified via numerical case studies in the IEEE nine-bus transmission grid with an interconnected medium voltage distribution grid.</description></item><item><title>DER Capacity Assessment of Active Distribution Systems Using Dynamic Operating Envelopes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10243614</link><description>The increasing deployment of distributed energy resources (DER) within electricity distribution systems can push them outside their safe operational limits. This urges the distribution system operators (DSO) to perform a DER capacity assessment that utilises the network&#8217;s full potential to accommodate more DER while ensuring the network&#8217;s safety. However, this is a challenging task as the DER units are mostly consumer-owned and therefore the DSO does not have control over them. To overcome this challenge, this paper first develops dynamic operating envelopes (DOEs). A DOE is a convex set defining acceptable real and reactive powers exchange with the grid at a consumer connection point without violating any network constraints. We propose a novel methodology to calculate a DOE by applying the right-hand side decomposition technique through which we allocate the network&#8217;s capacity to mutually independent consumers. We then build a hierarchical DER capacity assessment within DOEs that considers the uncertainty of solar power and demand when making investment decisions. In the proposed framework, the consumers are then free to make their decisions as long as they comply with their DOEs.</description></item><item><title>Fairness-Incorporated Online Feedback Optimization for Real-Time Distribution Grid Management</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10251452</link><description>With the increasing penetration of distributed energy resources such as photovoltaics (PVs), frequent voltage and congestion problems are expected to occur in distribution grids. Existing solution approaches based on centralized or distributed offline optimization cannot handle the dynamics of distribution grids in real time, i.e., by the time the computations are finished, the used data are already outdated as the grid loadings evolve so fast. Moreover, the unfair distribution of costs or burdens among end-users to relieve network issues, for example with PV curtailment, has not been sufficiently considered either. To address these issues, a fairness-incorporated online feedback optimization (OFO) approach is proposed. This approach produces implementable intermediate iterates for inverter-based assets using online optimization and suitably integrated measurements, and thus can work with the distribution grid dynamics. Moreover, it addresses the unfairness issue by modifying the voltage sensitivity matrices and leverages the feedback-based nature of OFO to compensate for the resulting modeling inaccuracies. Case studies based on a 96-bus low-voltage grid demonstrate the effectiveness of the fairness-incorporated OFO to handle the distribution grid dynamics and improve fairness, in both static and dynamic cases, with balanced and unbalanced grid models.</description></item><item><title>Successive Convexification Algorithms for Optimizing Power Systems With Energy Storage Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10254570</link><description>Energy storage systems (ESSs) are increasingly used in power system optimization. Different ESS mathematical models are developed that consider nonlinear functions for power losses. However, these models require non-convex constraints to represent the ESS losses, resulting in challenging optimization problems. To reduce the complexity, convex relaxation models are often derived but generate infeasible solutions when the relaxation exactness is violated. To deal with this issue, this work develops two successive convexification algorithms that generate fast and high-quality feasible solutions when the derived solution is not exact. The first algorithm handles general loss functions, while the second algorithm enhances performance when piecewise-linear loss functions are used. Specifically, the algorithms reduce the feasible region of the relaxed ESS models using a tightening box trust region around the current solution in successive iterations. The proposed algorithms are applied to the Unit Commitment and Peak Shaving and Energy Arbitrage problems to investigate their performance considering piecewise-linear and quadratic ESS loss functions. Simulation results demonstrate the impact of the ESSs relaxation violation on the actual system operation and validate the algorithms efficacy to generate high-quality feasible and even optimal solutions with significantly lower execution times compared to problems utilizing exact ESS models.</description></item><item><title>An Inverse Optimization Method for Electric Vehicle Charging and Road Toll Pricing in Coupled Urban Transportation and Power Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10173663</link><description>This is the sequel to our earlier paper on A Decentralized Bi-level Decomposition Method for Optimal Operation of Electric Vehicles in Coupled Urban Transportation and Power Distribution Systems. After presenting the pricing framework, coordinated operation model and bi-level decomposition algorithm to obtain the optimal operation state in the previous work, this paper presents the pricing approach to adjust EVs&#8217; behavior and achieve that expected state. First, the network equilibrium (NE) and social optimum (SO) operation states are defined, based on which the traditional marginal social cost pricing is developed as benchmark. Second, in light of inverse optimization approach, the minimum charge pricing is proposed which adopts road tolls, charging prices and plug-in fees to coordinate the system operation. Different from the traditional pricing approach, the proposed one can align coupled power-transportation network (CPTN) flows from the spontaneously-formed NE with the least-cost SO state, while minimizing extra user charges. Third, various partial pricing schemes are developed to approximate the expected SO state for practical applications. Finally, case studies on a modified real-world urban network verify the effectiveness and performance of the pricing method. It is proven to significantly reduce the extra user charges while attaining the same optimum state.</description></item><item><title>A Coordinated Model for Multiple Electric Vehicle Aggregators to Grid Considering Imbalanced Liability Trading</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10180215</link><description>In the interaction between electric vehicle (EV) and grid, research on the coordinated optimization of different EV aggregators to reduce the adverse effect of EVs uncertainty is of great significance. This paper commits to formulating an imbalanced liability trading cooperation platform among multiple EV aggregators in real-time (RT) market. First, we propose a joint bidding model of multiple EV aggregators in RT market from the individual perspective. Each aggregator optimizes its internal bidding strategy and external imbalanced liability trading simultaneously. Next, considering the self-interest of each EV aggregator, the cooperative model is built based on general Nash bargaining (GNB) theory. To promote EV aggregators to trade but avoid over-dependence, each EV aggregator&#8217;s bargaining power is formulated by both individual trading quantity and trading dependence. Then, we decompose the model into two subproblems and introduce the neurodynamic-based algorithm for distributed solving. Finally, numerical results show that the proposed coordinated model can reduce the adverse effect of EVs&#8217; uncertainties on grid power balance to some extent, and realize cost saving or even profit earning for aggregators.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Machine Learning Forecasting for Online MPC of Work Place Electric Vehicle Charging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10184283</link><description>This work proposes a novel EV forecasting technique that predicts each EV&#8217;s arrival time (AT), energy demand (ED) and plug duration (PD) over the course of a calendar day using a hybrid machine learning (ML) forecast. The ML forecasts as well as persistence forecasts are then input in a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm that minimizes the electricity costs incurred by the charging provider. The MPC with the hybrid ML forecast reduced peak loads and monthly electricity costs over a base case scenario that determined costs for uncontrolled L2 charging: Reductions in weekday mean peak load during a 30 day summer time case study were 46.7% and 2.8% from the base case to ML MPC and persistence to ML MPC, respectively. Reductions in utility costs during the summer case study were 20.9% and 0.1% from base case to ML MPC and persistence to ML MPC respectively. Results are similar for a 30 day winter case study.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Mitigating the Cycle Aging Cost of Vehicle Batteries in Energy Transportation Nexus</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10185627</link><description>There is a critical need to protect batteries from degradation to achieve the benefit of electric vehicles (EVs) in the energy and transportation sectors. However, existing battery degradation models have either failed to reflect the actual battery cycle aging mechanism, or are too complex for practical vehicle energy management. This paper presents a new approach for the efficient integration of battery cycles aging mechanisms into vehicle energy management by a prioritized experience-driven imitative learning (PExp-IL) framework. A prioritized degradation experience pool is constructed by comprehensively analyzing battery cycle aging mechanisms in vehicle standard driving schedules. Battery cycle aging features are mathematically presented by learning the expert experience that characterizes its degradation under different working conditions imitatively. The battery protective target is achieved by integrating the established gradient aging model into a vehicle energy management optimization problem. With the anti-aging policy gradient, battery aging mitigation can be easily incorporated into vehicle energy management scenarios that highly depend on algorithm computation efficiency. Two detailed demonstrative cases are further constructed to realize the anti-aging battery management in hybrid vehicles and grid integration of EVs. This approach provides a new practical solution for improving vehicle total economy by mitigating battery aging costs, which can contribute to net zero in the energy-transportation nexus.</description></item><item><title>Market-Based Coordinated Planning of Fast Charging Station and Dynamic Wireless Charging System Considering Energy Demand Assignment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10197206</link><description>With the rapid growth of electric vehicle (EV) penetration, EV charging demand is becoming greater and diversified. To meet the diverse EV charging demand, we propose a market-based coordinated planning method of fast charging station (FCS) and dynamic wireless charging system (DWCS). Firstly, a bi-level coordinated planning model considering the benefits of charging service provider and EV user group is built. It can make full use of the complementary characteristics of FCSs and DWCSs. Then, the energy demand assignment(EDA) approach that can directly assign energy demand to roads and power nodes is proposed and applied in the inner level of bi-level coordinated planning model. Finally, the cases that consider the impact of differentiated traffic demand and land prices in different regions are proposed. The case studies are formulated based on the 21 power nodes-12 traffic nodes network and the 54 power nodes-25 traffic nodes network. To calculate the optimal solution, the KKT conditions, the McCormick relaxation approach, the optimization-based bound tightening approach (OBBT) and the sequential bound tightening approach (SBT) are employed. Numerical simulation results validate that the proposed method can effectively improve the profits of charging service provider and keep the EV users&#8217; charging cost at relatively low range.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Transient Stability Evaluation of Electric Distribution Networks Dominated by EV Supercharging Stations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10227373</link><description>Accelerated deployment of high-power electric vehicle (EV) supercharging stations is expected to alleviate EV drivers&#8217; range anxiety, while imposing stress on the electric distribution networks (EDNs) and threatening their transient stability. As a powerful transient stability evaluation (TSE) tool, the estimation of region of attraction (ROA) plays a vital role in maintaining situational awareness and stable operation of the emerging EDNs. However, EDNs dominated by EV charging stations typically involve highly nonlinear and complex system dynamics, rendering the model-based approaches for ROA estimation computationally intensive. Thus, solution accuracy is usually compromised due to simplified system modeling. This paper proposes a data-driven approach to ROA estimation of emerging EDNs based on the Koopman operator theory. Numerically stable Koopman eigenfunctions can be learned from the system measured data and then employed to establish a set of linearly parameterized Lyapunov candidate functions. Various trajectory data are then employed to establish a tight feasible polytope. Through efficient sampling and linear optimization, the union of invariant sublevel sets of the determined Lyapunov functions can constitute a tight inner approximation to the actual ROA. The proposed method is evaluated to be computationally efficient and permits real-time ROA estimation. Numerical simulations of a DC EDN interfaced to an AC grid validate the superior performance of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Preserving Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading via Hybrid Secure Computations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10176288</link><description>The massive integration of uncertain distributed renewable energy resources into power systems raises power imbalance concerns. Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading provides a promising way to balance the prosumers&#8217; volatile energy power generation and demands locally. Particularly, to protect the privacy of prosumers, distributed P2P energy trading is broadly advocated. However, severe privacy leakage issues can emerge in the realistic fully distributed P2P energy trading paradigm. Meanwhile, in this paradigm, two-party and multi-party computations coexist, challenging the naive privacy-preserving techniques. To tackle privacy leakage issues arising from the fully distributed P2P energy trading, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving approach via hybrid secure computations. A secure multi-party computation mechanism consisting of offline and online phases is developed to ensure the security of shared data by leveraging the tailored secret sharing method. In addition, the Paillier encryption method based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem is proposed for both the secure two-party computation and the offline phase of the multi-party computation. The random encryption coefficient is designed to enhance the security of the two-party computation and simultaneously guarantee the convergence of the distributed optimization. The feasible range for the encryption coefficient is derived with a strict mathematical proof. Numerical simulations demonstrate the exactness, effectiveness, and scalability of the proposed privacy-preserving approach.</description></item><item><title>Moment-Based Distributionally Robust Peer-to-Peer Transactive Energy Trading Framework Between Networked Microgrids, Smart Parking Lots and Electricity Distribution Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10190171</link><description>This paper proposes a decentralized scheduling framework for peer-to-peer (P2P) transactive energy trading between prosumers and the local electricity market (LEM). In this approach, prosumers are modeled in the form of networked microgrids (NMG) and smart parking lots (SPL), which can exchange energy in a P2P framework. At the same time, each of the prosumers exchanges information and energy with the LEM in a decentralized approach based on the distribution locational marginal price (DLMP). The LEM is modeled by an active radial electricity distribution network (EDN), considering a high penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) and the feeder power losses in a convex optimization model. In proposed P2P transactive energy model, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has been used to achieve the equilibrium point between peers. The distributionally robust optimization (DRO) method has been used to model the uncertain behavior of RES in NMGs, SPLs, and the EDN. In addition, the impact of applying smart charging strategies for electric vehicles (EV) in the proposed P2P transactive energy model has been investigated. To confirm the functionality of the model, 12-bus, 6-bus, and 4-bus networks have been used to model NMGs, while the EDN is embodied by a standard IEEE 33-bus and 123-bus test systems.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Operating Envelope-Enabled P2P Trading to Maximize Financial Returns of Prosumers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10188896</link><description>This paper presents a new dynamic operating envelope (DOE)-integrated peer-to-peer (P2P) trading scheme to increase the exchange of electricity from prosumers to a distribution network without jeopardising the network constraints. First, a DOE computation mechanism is designed to estimate the power export and import limits for prosumers at different time slots. Second, considering the DOE-estimated export and import limits, a network-aware P2P trading framework is developed utilising cooperative game theory. The key properties of the P2P coalition are studied, as well as the incentive-compatibility and stability are also confirmed. Finally, an algorithm is proposed that enables prosumers to form a stable and incentive-compatible network-aware P2P coalition and fairly distribute the total coalition benefit among themselves. With extensive simulations, it is demonstrated that the modelled P2P trading structure allows prosumers to export more electricity to the low-voltage (LV) network safely compared to existing techniques while keeping bus voltages and line loading within acceptable margins. Subsequently, by trading more power locally, prosumers can substantially mitigate their electricity costs.</description></item><item><title>A Federated Byzantine Agreement Model to Operate Offline Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10227349</link><description>Providing equitable and resilient electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) to remote locations with limited access to the Internet infrastructure is one of the paradoxes in the decarbonization plan. In this paper, we develop an electric vehicle (EV) charging management system comprised of offline EVSEs based on a Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) system. To enable offline peer-to-peer (P2P) authentication between the user&#8217;s device (UD) and EVSE stations, we use a distributed certificate management based on Shamir&#8217;s algorithm and blind signing approach using the ring signature. We introduce extended FBA for charge point operator (FBA-CPO) systems and include explicit operational functions to ensure the ledger dissemination and scalability of the network. We specifically employ a pre-authorized mechanism for deferral vouchers using a pre-signed and weighted signing method. In the FBA-CPO network, each charger records all transactions on a local ledger and publicly publishes ledgers through random UD nodes. Under a generalization of the property of the federated quorum system, the proposed approach could provide a reliable network centrality with or without offline EVSEs. Eventually, we examined the performance of the proposed model using a system of real devices and their digital twins. Results show the FBA-CPO satisfies all functional and cross-cutting requirements for a consistent transnational mechanism.</description></item><item><title>Virtual Power Plants Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading in Unbalanced Distribution Networks: A Distributed Robust Approach Against Communication Failures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10229177</link><description>In recent years, virtual power plants (VPPs) have been undergoing a rapid development to aggregate mushrooming distributed energy resources. In this paper, a distributed robust algorithm for VPPs&#8217; peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading is proposed which can improve the robustness against communication failures such as packet losses and computing node failures in the cyber layer. Firstly, a P2P energy trading framework suitable for VPPs located in the unbalanced distribution network managed by the distribution system operator (DSO) is proposed, which is a bi-level problem with the DSO standing at the higher level to solve the power flow model and VPP operators (VPPOs) following at the lower level to decide the bilateral trading quantity and prices. Herein, an enhanced linearized DistFlow model is developed to address the unbalanced distribution network. Then, a distributed algorithm wherein the DSO and VPPOs engage in an iterative negotiation process based on relaxed alternating direction method of multipliers (R-ADMM) is derived, which renders the VPPOs&#8217; parallel computation and preserves privacy. Furthermore, a robust version of the algorithm against communication failures (DRAACF) is developed. The economy, robustness, computational efficiency and scalability of the proposed approach are validated by simulation analyses based on the modified IEEE 13-bus and IEEE 123-bus distribution networks.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Cryptography-Based Architecture to Achieve Secure Energy Trading in Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10179950</link><description>With the advancement of distributed generation and information technology, energy trading in micro grid (MG) becomes popular in recent years. However, due to the lack of authority management in the MG, the traditional energy trading method with trusted system operator (SO) and market operator (MO) is no longer suitable. This paper proposes a novel, secure and privacy-preserving energy trading architecture with the state-of-the-art cryptosystem. Firstly, a zero-knowledge-proof based non-interactive protocol is proposed to authenticate prosumers. Next, a novel energy data evaluation method is proposed to achieve privacy-preserving power pricing and dispatching with the homomorphic encryption. Moreover, a lightweight tree-chained trading book is proposed to protect the transaction information. Then, we analysis the security performance and emphasize the advantages of our proposed architecture. At last, we exam the performance of our proposed methods in the IEEE benchmark systems. We observe that, our proposed architecture could achieve the privacy-preserving and secure energy trading in a low-time-cost but high-accuracy way.</description></item><item><title>Adversarial Dynamic Load-Altering Cyberattacks Against Peak Shaving Using Residential Electric Water Heaters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10197626</link><description>Innovative smart grid technologies such as demand-side management (DSM) and smart home systems promise more optimal energy consumption; however, they expose the grid to load-altering cyberattacks wherein adversaries take control of customers&#8217; connected high-wattage appliances and consequently induce harmful load fluctuations. In this article, we present a novel adversarial machine learning algorithm powered by black-box optimization to synthesize stealthy dynamic load-altering attacks aiming at evading existing intrusion detection measures while maximizing the damage inflicted on the grid. The proposed algorithm is applied on a case study involving peak shaving using direct load control of residential electric water heaters. It is capable of designing stealthy attacks that can increase the detectors&#8217; misclassification probability by up to 44%. It can also be adapted to other load-altering attacks involving different DSM programs or other classes of loads. The algorithm can be used by electric power utilities to evaluate and harden the robustness of their cybersecurity solutions.</description></item><item><title>A General Real-Time Cyberattack Risk Assessment Method for Distribution Network Involving the Influence of Feeder Automation System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10226606</link><description>The power system has become the key target of national cyber confrontation. To enhance the risk management capability of the distribution network (DN) while assessing the cyberattack risk quickly and accurately, this paper proposes a general real-time cyberattack risk assessment method for DN involving the influence of distributed feeder automation systems (DFAs). In particular, to clarify the quantitative relationship between cyberattack intrusion and DN state deterioration, we constructed the quantitative model of the cyber physical distribution network (CPDN) under cyberattack, which involves the influence of DFAs&#8217; behavior. In addition, in order to intuitively demonstrate the cyberattack risk, we developed a novel entropy-like risk assessment system upon the quantitative model of CPDN. The real two-feeder test platform with cyberattack simulation devices is used to verify the correctness and practicality of the proposed method. In this process, a digital cyberattack risk assessment unit is created, contributing to the system-level application of risk management.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Event-Based Resilient Secondary Control for AC Microgrids: A Trust-Reputation Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10210689</link><description>A new resilient distributed secondary control for AC microgrids is studied based on event-triggered mechanisms and trust-reputation evaluation methods. When distributed generators (DGs) in a microgrid are subject to attacks, their transmitted state information would be tampered and thus affect the dynamics of normal generators. In order to isolate possible attacks, two types of trust evaluation metrics with different attack indices and time scales are designed, by which the performance of neighboring DGs can be assessed for specific practical demands. Based on the trust values of each neighbor, a reputation-propagation method is introduced at triggered time instants to determine whether a DG is under attack by comprehensively incorporating the opinion of mutual neighbors. The dynamic updating law of the communication edge weights is utilized with the derived reputation values. Based on this, a distributed Zeno-free event-triggered control protocols for voltage/frequency restoration and active power sharing are proposed. Sufficient conditions for picking proper control parameters are given in the main theorem. Lastly, the simulations are conducted in MATLAB/SimPowerSystems for several scenarios to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Online Recursive Detection and Adaptive Fuzzy Mitigation of Cyber-Physical Attacks Targeting Topology of IMG: An LFC Case Study</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10215089</link><description>Due to the low inertia of inverter-based islanded microgrids (IMGs), these systems require a delicate and accurate load frequency control (LFC) scheme. The deployment of such a control scheme, which preserves the balance between the load and generation, needs a cyber layer on top of the physical system that makes IMGs an appealing target for a variety of cyber-physical attacks (CPAs). Among these CPAs, there is a family of malicious CPAs whose aim is to compromise the LFC scheme by changing the topology of IMG and its parameters. On this basis, an online system identification method is developed to estimate the parameters of IMG using the recursive least square forgetting factor (RLS-FF) approach. Then, based on the estimated parameters, an anomaly-based intrusion detection system (IDS) is developed to identify CPAs and distinguish them from the uncertainties in the normal operation of IMG. Following anomaly detection, a mitigation scheme is proposed to regulate the IMG&#8217;s frequency using an adaptive interval type-2 fuzzy logic controller (IT2FLC). The proposed IT2FLC uses different types of distributed energy resources (DERs)&#8212;i.e., tidal power plants and solar panels which are, respectively, equipped with inertia emulation and droop-based controllers&#8212;to improve the frequency excursion resulting from CPAs. The simulation results verify the performance of the developed detection and mitigation schemes, particularly when the RLS-FF parameters, i.e., forgetting factor, covariance matrix, and reset parameter, are obtained through the grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm. Furthermore, the designed mitigation scheme is corroborated by comparing its performance with several well-known attack-resilient control frameworks in LFC studies, e.g., linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and  $H_{\infty }$ , using real-time simulations.</description></item><item><title>Matrix-Completion-Based False Data Injection Attacks Against Machine Learning Detectors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10231128</link><description>False data injection (FDI) attacks can manipulate power system measurements, leading to system economic losses and security issues. Although machine-learning (ML) detectors can effectively detect FDI attacks, the current methods used to construct FDI attacks do not take into account the presence of ML detectors. To tackle this problem, we propose novel convex matrix-completion-based FDI (MC-FDI) attacks on DC and AC power flow models from an attacker&#8217;s perspective, accounting for the temporal correlation between compromised and historical measurements. The proposed attacks minimize the nuclear norm of the compromised measurement matrix to make the compromised measurement consistent with the historical measurements, and also maximize the L1-norm of the incremental voltage angle to ensure a sufficient negative impact on the power system operation. Moving target defense (MTD) is proposed to detect the proposed MC-FDI attacks from the defender&#8217;s standpoint. The idea is to actively change the line impedance to corrupt the spatial and temporal correlation of the compromised measurements in the MC-FDI attacks. Numerical results on the IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems show the stealthiness of the proposed attacks to both the Chi-square detector and ML detectors as well as the efficacy of MTD in detecting the MC-FDI attacks.</description></item><item><title>Design and Defense of Modal Resonance-Oriented Cyber-Attack Against Wide-Area Damping Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10250853</link><description>Most existing cyber-attacks are steady state-oriented attacks, not dynamic ones. Moreover, dynamic modal interaction between cyber layers and physical layers is not considered in current studies. This paper firstly proposes a novel modal resonance-oriented cyber-attack (MROCA) against wide-area damping control (WADC). MROCA, as a dynamic cyber-attack, analyzes the signal sent to WADC in the cyber layer and then estimates the critical oscillation mode of the physical layer without acquiring the system parameters. Then MROCA is designed to stimulate the open-loop modal resonance between the virtual oscillation mode of MROCA and the critical mode of the physical layer, thereby degrading the stability of cyber-physical power systems (CPPSs). Furthermore, the connection between MROCA and typical cyber-attacks is investigated, and the impact of MROCA on the stability of CPPSs is quantified by the modal movement with respect to the parameters of MROCA. Additionally, the corresponding defense strategy is proposed to inject the signal corresponding to the reverse mode of MROCA, thereby offsetting the negative impact of attacks. Finally, the proposed work is tested in the IEEE 39-bus benchmark system and the practical provincial power system. Simulation results indicate that the proposed MROCA will excite the open-loop modal resonance and reduce the stability of CPPS. The proposed defense strategy can accurately estimate the injected mode signal and ensure system stability when the system is attacked by MROCA.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Source Data Aggregation and Real-Time Anomaly Classification and Localization in Power Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10253676</link><description>This paper proposes a real-time anomaly location and classification framework for power distribution systems to simultaneously determine the type of anomaly (i.e., short-circuit fault, cyber attack, DER switching) and its location. The proposed framework employs the data aggregation module to collect the measurement data from multiple field devices operating at different sampling rates, such as protection relays and D-PMUs. The output of the data aggregation is then fed into a multi-task learning-based long-based short-term memory (MTL-LSTM) to classify the type of anomaly and the location in two separate tasks. The proposed MTL-LSTM approach can be utilized in real-time operation in order to distinguish between normal and several anomalous operations and locate the anomaly. The proposed framework is tested on a modified IEEE 33-bus test feeder benchmark that integrates solar generation and energy storage. The results show that the proposed framework can locate and classify anomalies for several operation conditions with more than 96% accuracy. Further experiments highlight the impact of aggregating multiple sources of data on the performance of the proposed model.</description></item><item><title>Enabling Efficient and Malicious Secure Data Aggregation in Smart Grid With False Data Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10254595</link><description>As the next-generation power grid, the smart grid has significantly improved dependability, flexibility, and efficiency compared with the traditional power grid.

In addition, based on the proposed model, we construct an efficient and privacy-preserving scheme that supports malicious secure smart grid usage data aggregation communication. To our best knowledge, this is the first concrete smart grid solution that concurrently achieves secure aggregation communication, data privacy, and data robustness (e.g., false data detection). Specifically, benefiting from Boolean/Arithmetic secret-sharing methods, our proposed scheme allows home users to report their electricity usage data to the cloud and fogs securely. Besides, a false data detection protocol is proposed to resist false data injection attacks launched by malicious home users. Theoretical analysis and experimental implementation show that our scheme efficiently achieves data security, anonymity, and robustness.</description></item><item><title>Unsupervised Anomaly Detection and Diagnosis in Power Electronic Networks: Informative Leverage and Multivariate Functional Clustering Approaches</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292588</link><description>We propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection and diagnosis algorithm in power electronic networks. Since most anomaly detection and diagnosis algorithms in the literature are based on supervised methods that can hardly be generalized to broader scenarios, we propose unsupervised algorithms. Our algorithm extracts the Time-Frequency Domain (TFD) features from the three-phase currents and three-phase voltages of the point of coupling (PCC) nodes to detect anomalies and distinguish between different types of anomalies, such as cyber-attacks and physical faults. To detect anomalies through TFD features, we propose a novel Informative Leveraging for Anomaly Detection (ILAD) algorithm. The proposed unsupervised ILAD algorithm automatically extracts noise-reduced anomalous signals, resulting in more accurate anomaly detection results than other score-based methods. To assign anomaly types for anomaly diagnosis, we apply a novel Multivariate Functional Principal Component Analysis (MFPCA) clustering method. Unlike the deep learning methods, the MFPCA clustering method does not require labels for training and provides more accurate results than other deep embedding-based clustering approaches. Furthermore, it is even comparable to supervised algorithms in both offline and online experiments. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed unsupervised framework accomplishing anomaly detection and anomaly diagnosis tasks is the first of its kind in power electronic networks.</description></item><item><title>Quantile-Mixer: A Novel Deep Learning Approach for Probabilistic Short-Term Load Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10171210</link><description>As the power grid becomes more complex and dynamic, accurate short-term load forecasting (STLF) with probabilistic information is a prerequisite for various smart grid applications. For doing this, various deep learning models have been proposed, and recent models increase model size and complexity to achieve better accuracy which could also increase the burden on model design, computation time, and resources. To this end, we propose a novel deep learning model for accurate and efficient probabilistic STLF (PSTLF). First, we develop an STLF model utilizing the multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-mixer structure, i.e., MLP-mixer for STLF (MM-STLF), that has an advantage in forecasting accuracy and efficiency compared to the other deep learning models. Then, we propose a random quantile regression (RQR) method that takes a cumulative probability  $\tau $  as an input to the model and is trained on random  $\tau \text{s}$ . By combining MM-STLF and RQR, we develop a novel deep-PSTLF model, namely quantile-mixer (Q-mixer). We evaluate the overall performance of the proposed model with seven load datasets in terms of prediction error, model size, and inference time, respectively. Through experiments, various STLF models and probabilistic forecasting methods are compared, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Q-mixer in load forecasting.</description></item><item><title>A Contextual Bandit Approach for Value-Oriented Prediction Interval Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10185994</link><description>Prediction interval (PI) is an effective tool to quantify uncertainty and usually serves as an input to downstream robust optimization. Traditional approaches focus on improving the quality of PI in the view of statistical scores and assume the improvement in quality will lead to a higher value in the power systems operation. However, such an assumption cannot always hold in practice. In this paper, we propose a value-oriented PI forecasting approach, which aims at reducing operational costs in downstream operations. For that, it is required to issue PIs with the guidance of operational costs in robust optimization, which is addressed within the contextual bandit framework here. Concretely, the agent is used to select the optimal quantile proportion, while the environment reveals the costs in operations as rewards to the agent. As such, the agent can learn the policy of quantile proportion selection for minimizing the operational cost. The numerical study regarding the day-ahead and real-time operation of a virtual power plant verifies the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of operational value. And it is especially evident in the context of extensive penetration of wind power.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Feedback Linearization Control of Distributed Energy Resources Using Sparse Regression</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10190751</link><description>A complex physics-based modeling procedure and the uncertainty and confidentiality of internal parameters of distributed energy resources (DERs) motivate system identification tools for control purposes in smart grids. This paper develops a framework for data-driven nonlinear modeling and control of DERs using sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy). Using the proposed data-driven model for closed-loop control, we demonstrate the effectiveness of a model-free design in stability analysis of DERs in smart grids. Feedback linearization control of DERs was chosen over conventional vector control in this research due to its superior capability of accounting for DER nonlinearities and weak AC grid integration. Compared with existing physics-based designs that heavily rely on knowing the detailed system dynamics or uninterpretable data-driven designs that rely on large historical data, the proposed model-free DER identification and control framework can accurately capture the dynamics of the DERs based on available measurements and provide guaranteed performance for black-start, weak AC grid integration, microgrid integration, and stability analysis. Real-time and offline simulations in addition to a detailed eigenvalue analysis are conducted to compare the effectiveness of the proposed data-driven approach with physics-based controllers.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Joint Regulations of Frequency and Voltage for TSO-DSO Coordination: A Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10208157</link><description>The increasing scale of distributed energy resources (DERs) in the active distribution network (ADN) offers valuable opportunities for distribution system operators (DSOs) to assist transmission system operators (TSOs) in regulating operational issues and reducing overall operational costs. The paper proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based TSO-DSO coordination framework for jointly regulating the frequency and voltage measured at the grid supply point (GSP) of the transmission network (TN) with a sufficient utilization of control flexibility of converter-based DERs. To facilitate MADRL, a simple grid partitioning method is employed for the balanced partitioning of ADNs with the connectivity constraint imposed on each sub-region. On this basis, a MADRL algorithm is designed by combining the QMIX and twin delayed deep deterministic policy (TD3) algorithm for an effective optimization of the decentralized regulation scheme. The proposed QMIX-TD3 is equipped with the graph convolutional network (GCN) for its temporal-spatial learning ability to tackle the challenges of the complicated transmission and distribution (T/D) system dynamics. In addition, a policy smooth regularization (PSR) loss is proposed to damp action oscillations and enhance sample efficiency. Experiments on the integrated T/D system demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively mitigate the impact of system disturbances and therefore benefit the system operation.</description></item><item><title>Receding-Horizon Chiller Operation Planning via Collaborative Neurodynamic Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10217176</link><description>Optimal chiller loading is crucial to reduce energy consumption in chiller operation planning.

Experimental results based on the specifications of two chiller systems are elaborated to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Privacy Preserving User Energy Consumption Profiling: From Theory to Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10251453</link><description>The smart grid benefits and suffers from smart meter data. Proper use of massive data can improve energy services but may raise privacy concerns. For example, user energy consumption profiling, a classic method, can identify energy consumption patterns based on the collected load profiles from users. Thus, the privacy of these individual load profiles needs to be protected. However, most of the existing works focus on data transmission and calculation privacy, and often require additional computation, communication, or platform construction costs. In contrast, noise-injection-based data source privacy-protecting works can avoid such additional costs and provide theoretical differential privacy (DP) guarantee. This paper theoretically analyzes noise-injection-based user profiling mechanisms in terms of both privacy protection and accuracy. Specifically, we establish the privacy-accuracy trade-off. We then propose an optimal user energy consumption pattern estimation method for heterogeneous noise-injection-based data. Finally, we design a valid information ratio-based pricing scheme for noisy data that is independent of downstream tasks and easy to implement. Numerical studies based on field data confirm the effectiveness of our theoretical results.</description></item><item><title>An Intelligently Controlled Charging Model for Battery Electric Trucks in Drayage Operations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375807</link><description>California has set a goal for all drayage trucks operating in the state to be zero-emitting by 2035. In order to achieve this goal, drayage operators would need to transition 100% of their fleets to zero-emission vehicles such as battery electric trucks (BETs). This article presents an intelligently controlled charging model for BETs that minimizes charging costs while optimizing subsequent tour completion. To develop this model, real-world activity data from a drayage truck fleet operating in Southern California was combined with a two-stage clustering technique to identify trip and tour patterns. The energy consumption for each trip and tour was then simulated for BETs with a battery capacity of 565 kWh using a 150 kW charging power level. Home base charging load profiles were generated using the proposed charging model, subject to constraints of the energy needed to complete the next subsequent tour and Time-of-Use energy cost rates. A sensitivity analysis evaluated three scenarios: a passive scenario with a 5% state-of-charge (SOC) constraint after completing the subsequent tour, an average scenario with a 50% SOC constraint, and an aggressive scenario with an 80% SOC constraint. Results indicated that the 80% SOC constraint scenario achieved the lowest charging cost. However, it also yielded the lowest tour completion rate (51%). In contrast, the 5% SOC constraint scenario registered the highest tour completion rate. These results revealed that 96% of the tours could be successfully completed using the intelligently controlled charging model. The remaining tours were infeasible, indicating that the available time at the home base was inadequate for charging the necessary energy for the next tour. In terms of total costs, the scenario with a 5% SOC constraint resulted in an annual cost of approximately $40,000, whereas the 80% SOC scenario nearly doubled that amount.</description></item><item><title>A Fast and Accurate GaN Power Transistor Model and Its Application for Electric Vehicle</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10347531</link><description>In order to overcome the challenge of balancing accuracy with simulation speed of power electronics converters for system-level simulation, the paper proposes a GaN power transistor model that can accurately and rapidly predict power losses, which is suitable for system-level application such as an electric vehicle. The model is based on equivalent circuit and formed by behavioural equations to carefully model both conduction and switching losses. As a novelty, transistor power losses due to dynamic ON-state resistance is also included in the model. By comparison with experimental measurements and other available models of the similar type from the literature, it is shown that our model gives accurate results of the power losses and it helps to reduce the error by more than 70%. To accelerate simulation speed, power loss calculation and simulation time-step is decoupled. The power losses are represented in different levels and in the form of mathematical equations and look-up tables in MATLAB/Simulink. It is shown that our approach is able to reduce the simulation time by almost 18 times and maintain the same accuracy. The proposed GaN transistor loss model is finally implemented into a racing vehicle powertrain, where designers can obtain the power losses and temperature of the used power transistors in an easy and rapid way to optimise power electronics design.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Energy Management Strategy Based on Driving Pattern Recognition for a Dual-Motor Dual-Source Electric Vehicle</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10363666</link><description>This article introduces a novel approach in electric vehicle technology by combining dual-motor coupling with a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) using batteries and supercapacitors. This innovation enhances vehicle performance and prolongs battery life. An energy management strategy (EMS) based on Pontryagin's minimum principle (PMP) is used to optimize power distribution within the HESS. To improve PMP performance, the proposal integrates driving pattern recognition (DPR) and co-state variable ($\lambda $) control. DPR employs an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for real-time pattern recognition. The process involves creating a sample driving cycle, employing subtractive clustering to establish the original fuzzy inference system (FIS), and fine-tuning FIS parameters through neural network training. $\lambda $ values are updated based on recognition results to adapt control actions for various driving styles. Real-time simulations on Opal-RT reveal significant improvements compared to EMS without DPR. Battery current root mean square and standard deviation decrease by 11.4% and 29.4%, respectively, during the unknown in advance Federal Test Procedure (FTP) cycle. This adaptable DPR method offers versatility for various EMSs and clarifies the impact of disturbances like supercapacitor size, state of charge variations, and off-road conditions on HESS performance, aiding researchers in designing more efficient systems.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Torque-Distribution for Dual-Motor Off-Road Vehicle Using Machine Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10411103</link><description>Recently, demand for electric vehicles (EVs) has increased significantly as people are becoming more conscious of the environment and the need to reduce carbon emissions. The introduction of multi-motor systems in EVs has brought new challenges in terms of energy efficiency and performance. This paper presents a Multi-Ensemble Learning (MEL)-based approach to design an Energy Management Strategy (EMS) for a Dual Motor Electric Vehicle (DMEV) where MEL is a new powerful Machine Learning approach implemented using Python programming language. To make our study concrete, we studied a real DMEV that is modeled using Energetic Macroscopic Representation and whose control is simulated using Matlab/Simulink&#8482;. The designed EMS aims to distribute the instant torque between the two electric motors in an efficient manner, with the objective of minimizing energy consumption as much as possible. Contrary to existing EMSs, an important advantage of our designed EMS is that it determines the instant torque distribution in real-time (while the vehicle is running), without knowing in advance how physical parameters (such as the speed and traction force) will evolve during the current trip. The real-time simulation is carried out under unknown driving cycles based on a validated numerical EV model with a significantly lower computational cost while achieving a high degree of accuracy in predicting and allocating torque, and a high degree of performance in terms of energy consumption.</description></item><item><title>Assessing Effectiveness of Integrated Photovoltaic Panels on Light Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10428053</link><description>Light electric vehicles (LEV) are seen as an effective solution for reducing the carbon emissions in the transportation sector thanks to their light weight and low energy requirement. Integrated photovoltaic (PV) panels on LEVs have great potential because a higher portion of the energy demands can be covered by PV panels compared to heavier vehicles. Integrated PV panels on LEVs are constrained by the surface shape and available area, which results in panels facing different angles. In this work, we assess the effectiveness of such integrated PV panels based on simulations with meteorological data and measurements from a real prototype on an electric scooter. It is shown that the measured PV power correlates well with the simulated data. A number of design options such as the number of PV panels and the angle of the panels are evaluated through simulations and we compare seasonal and regional differences. Based on the assessment, we make design suggestions for cost-effective and energy-efficient integrated PV panels on LEVs. Results indicate that with the right design and favorable circumstances, the integrated PV panels can generate more energy over a day than is consumed by the LEV in one day.</description></item><item><title>Application of Wireless Charging at Seaports for Range Extension of Drayage Battery Electric Trucks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10380321</link><description>Even though heavy-duty battery electric trucks (BETs) have become commercially available, their range limitation still hinders widespread adoption. Drayage has been regarded as a suitable application for early BETs due to typically having limited daily mileage. However, drayage operation can vary widely and some form of range extension may still be needed for BETs operating in this application. In this paper, wireless charging at port terminals is proposed for this purpose. Potential wireless charging zones at port terminals are identified, and efficacy of wireless charging to extend BET range in drayage operation is verified by simulating the activity of 20 BETs from a drayage operator serving the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, using a microscopic BET energy consumption model. Furthermore, an optimization problem is formulated for optimal wireless charging zone planning from the port authority's perspective, considering subsets of the identified zones, and charging power options to choose from, for different budget ranges. In this context, zone planning means determining which areas of the port terminals should be selected for installing wireless charging systems, and what level of charging power should be for each selected zone's system. For each budget range, the optimization problem is solved using genetic algorithm to determine an optimal zone plan that provides the maximum amount of energy through wireless charging per unit cost of installation. The results show that wireless charging can aid improving activity completion of the simulated fleet by 5%, and further optimizing the zone plan can achieve similar performance with lower cost.</description></item><item><title>A Flexible Cloud-Based HIL Testing of Batteries for Various Electrified Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10334515</link><description>Power Hardware-In-the-loop (HIL) testing is increasing in the automotive industry for testing subsystems for new vehicles. Usually, the test is located in a unique place (stand-alone (local) HIL). The key-points for a vehicle manufacturer and subsystems suppliers are time and confidentiality. Using the cloud is a way to satisfy the both. Cloud model sharing is developed to spare time and cloud-based real-time simulation limits the access to the models to only certain variables. In this article, a cloud-based power HIL testing is proposed using a cloud of vehicle models. The Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR) formalism is used to organize all the models. It facilitates the interconnections between the simulated and power tested subsystems. Two new batteries are experimentally tested, one for an electric vehicle, the other one for a plug-in hybrid vehicle. The same cloud is used and the power test facilities are located in two different locations. This shows the flexibility of the method.</description></item><item><title>Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Integrated Eco-Driving Strategy for Connected and Automated Electric Vehicles in Complex Urban Scenarios</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10414122</link><description>With vehicle-to-everything (V2X) information, connected and automated vehicle (CAV) eco-driving strategy allows the vehicle to plan its speed and choose the optimal lane based on actual conditions, resulting in improved driving performance. This study presents a novel eco-driving strategy framework based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques for CAVs driving in urban scenarios. This framework integrates longitudinal speed planning with lateral lane change decision-making and aims to co-optimize the energy efficiency, driving safety, and travel efficiency. By leveraging traffic information and multi-objective reward functions, the twin delayed deep deterministic (TD3) algorithm is employed to train the actor-critic (AC) network which generates both longitudinal and lateral control commands based on its estimation for lane preference score. The proposed strategy is tested in a complex urban scenario based on Simulation Urban Mobility (SUMO) which reflects real urban traffic conditions. Experimental results indicate that the longitudinal speed planning module of the proposed strategy can shorten the travel txime by up to 7.94% or reduce the electricity consumption by 18.15%, depending on the degree of importance placed on economy by the TD3 agent. By integrating the lateral lane decision module, the proposed strategy can further shorten the travel time by 5.7% and save 1.75% energy consumption.</description></item><item><title>Online Temperature-Aware Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy for Mild Hybrid Electric Powertrains</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10401959</link><description>In this work, an online energy management strategy for mild hybrid electric vehicles is developed to minimize the fuel consumption while simultaneously preventing battery overheating. Since mild hybrids are typically equipped with a passively cooled battery pack, the energy management strategy design needs to keep the battery temperature below an upper limit, preventing accelerated aging and thermal runaway. To address this issue, the equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) approach is extended to develop a real-time capable controller, termed thermal ECMS (Th-ECMS), that is sensitive to the thermal dynamics of the battery and that can enforce constraints on its temperature. The rationale for our formulation is based on Pontryagin's minimum principle from optimal control theory. The online Th-ECMS is developed on the basis of the offline version of Th-ECMS, introduced in a previous work. Exploiting the a priori knowledge of the driving mission, the offline Th-ECMS calibrates the equivalence factors and obtains the optimal solution, which is compared with the globally optimal dynamic programming solution. This offline calibration method is run on a large number of driving missions and the collected data is used to train a feed-forward neural network that estimates optimal equivalence factors as functions of the battery state of charge, battery temperature, and distance yet to travel. The trained network is then used to populate two look-up tables mapping the equivalence factors, and implementable on the vehicle electronic control unit. Finally, the online Th-ECMS obtains the equivalence factors through the look-up tables in real-time. The online strategy was tested in four different driving missions, achieving a fuel economy remarkably similar to the optimal solution and successfully avoiding battery overheating.</description></item><item><title>Transformer-Based Traffic-Aware Predictive Energy Management of a Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10409570</link><description>The energy economy of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) plays a crucial role in determining their practicality, making the optimization of energy management strategies (EMS) essential. Predictive EMS (PEMS) based on future vehicle speed prediction offers great potential for enhancing EMS performance. However, current PEMS prediction models rely on historical speed data or static traffic information, overlooking the impact of real-time traffic conditions. In this article, we introduce a Transformer-based PEMS (TPEMS) that incorporates real-time predicted surrounding traffic information to improve FCEV operational economy. To better predict vehicle speed by accounting for the complex interactions between the controlled vehicle and surrounding vehicles, we developed a Transformer network-based predictor, which considers the speed and relative distance of six vehicles surrounding the controlled vehicle, generating speed predictions for the next 10 s. We then employ the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method as a downstream optimizer, creating a fully data-driven PEMS. For training the TPEMS, we developed a dataset derived from the NGSIM dataset, consisting of numerous driving profile segments that include temporal-sequential characteristics of the controlled vehicle and surrounding traffic. Furthermore, we utilize the SUMO simulator to generate a traffic information-enabled driving profile for performance evaluation. Experimental results reveal our Transformer-based predictor outperforms existing predictors, i.e., recurrent neural networks (RNN), in processing traffic information and achieving improved predictions. The TPEMS enhances the economic efficiency of FCEVs by 4.6% relative to the current state-of-the-art long short-term memory (LSTM)-based PEMS.</description></item><item><title>Generating Fault Databases Through Simulated and Experimental Multi-Rotor UAV Propulsion Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10387779</link><description>A light-gray-box simulation model is proposed for a multi-rotor propulsion chain designed to inject various faults into the system to generate fault behavior data sets. The model integrates the electrical and thermal characteristics of each component to model the interactions between components when faults are introduced. The simulated model is compared with an experimental test bench incorporating real hardware components, on which various faults can be injected to assess the accuracy of the simulated model. The propulsion chain consists of an Electronic Speed Controller, a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor, and a propeller. The faults considered are introduced on the three components of the propulsion chain. Electronic Speed Controller faults are applied to the power transistors; motor failures are open circuit, overheating and friction; and propeller failures are blade breakage and propeller loss. Using simulation of components with various failures, the model is designed to generate scalable, systematic, and reproducible behavior datasets for the development of fault detection systems which would eliminate the need for real hardware components.</description></item><item><title>Efficiency Evaluation of a Conductive Electric Road System With Respect to Traffic Characteristics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10423084</link><description>Electric Road Systems (ERS) are effective charging infrastructures that allows electric vehicles to receive energy while driving. This energy is used both to propel the vehicle and to charge the battery. Sufficient deployment of ERS implies that charging opportunities become greatly increased, allowing for electric vehicles to have smaller batteries and easing some of the problems associated with static fast-charging such as queues and need for large available areas. In this paper a simulation model for a conductive electric road is introduced and experimentally validated on a conductive electric road demonstrator. Two main ERS deployment cases with corresponding traffic flows are simulated: urban and rural. The results show that the urban simulation case has an efficiency of 96.5% and the rural simulation case has an efficiency of 95.7%. For the urban simulation case the impact of traffic intensity and traffic congestion on the ratio of semiconductor losses and resistive losses is evaluated. This evaluation shows that for this type of ERS design semiconductor losses should be considered in future ERS deployments in urban environment where traffic congestion and queues occur. Finally, a system efficiency comparison between the urban and rural simulation cases and a conventional static charger shows that an ERS can provide equivalent or even greater system efficiency than that of a conventional static charger depending on ERS application, deployment and design.</description></item><item><title>Reliability of Linear Losses-to-Power Scaling Method of Electric Drive Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10417773</link><description>This article assesses the reliability of the linear losses-to-power scaling method of electric drive systems, composed of a permanent magnet synchronous machine and IGBT inverter. The scaling method, which is commonly used in research studies on system-level design, postulates that overall power losses scale linearly to the desired power rating. However, the validity of this assumption is questionable, and it may impact simulation outcomes. To address these issues, the study derives the conditions that must be met for the linear scaling method to be achieved based on the well-known geometric scaling laws of electric machines and information obtained from inverter datasheets. The analysis at component-level indicates that the linear scaling method is effective in predicting efficiency for upscaling cases, with a discrepancy of less than 1%. However, it is found that this method is not appropriate for downscaling scenarios. Despite these limitations, a sensitivity analysis is conducted at system-level to examine the effect of linear losses-to-power scaling on the energy consumption of an electric vehicle, considering power scaling factors of 0.67 and 1.33. The examination compares this effect to different geometric variations of scaled electric machines and different power ratings of inverters, using 12 different standardized driving cycles. The outcomes of the analysis indicate that the difference in terms of energy consumption is within a satisfactory range below 2% for the upscaling and downscaling cases. This demonstrates the feasibility of the method at system-level for fast assessment of energy consumption in the early development phases of electric vehicles.</description></item><item><title>Closed-Form Expression to Estimate the Hydrogen Consumption of a Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicle</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10381787</link><description>Optimizing the design of hybrid powertrains requires co-optimizing their plant and their control, and the complexity of combining a static and a time-varying problem naturally leads to methodologies that optimize both levels in a nested configuration. As an alternative, a method to estimate the fuel consumption over a driving cycle with a closed-form expression is available in the literature, the Fully-Analytical Fuel Consumption Estimation (FACE), reducing the co-optimization to a uni-level problem. This approach was also expanded to Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicles (FCHEV) by introducing theory-based models for the fuel cell system and the electric components, since the latter were oversimplified in the first FACE implementation. However, the resulting expressions were difficult to handle, and the component operating constraints were ignored. This article addresses the problems identified in the first implementation of FACE for FCHEVs, using the 2020 Toyota Mirai as a reference architecture. Simplified models of the powertrain components are introduced, and the steps required for development of a single closed-form expression for the hydrogen consumption are explained. The models are fitted and validated with experimental data obtained with a real vehicle on a roller test bench. The results show that the final model adequately estimates the hydrogen consumption over 5 different homologation cycles in both cold and hot starting conditions, with an overall error RMS of less than four percent.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Preemptive Controller Enabling Electric Driving of a Hybrid Electric Vehicle in a Zero Emission Zone</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10333990</link><description>For carbon neutrality, various regulations on fuel efficiency and exhaust gas of vehicles are being implemented. As one of the exhaust gas regulations, zero emission zone (ZEZ) where the entry of internal combustion engine vehicles is regulated is implemented, and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (P-HEVs) must drive in EV mode to pass through it. Unlike P-HEVs, HEVs have a small battery capacity and need to charge the battery in advance, and in cold weather, engine coolant needs to be heated in advance. If the engine coolant temperature is not sufficiently high, the heating of cabin may be turned off during ZEZ driving. Therefore, We propose a power management control algorithm that satisfies the battery state of charge and engine coolant temperature requirements while maximizing energy efficiency. The proposed controller is divided into a planning part that generates optimal reference based on navigation information and model predictive controller part that calculates optimal control inputs to follow the reference. Based on optimal control, the proposed controller satisfies the requirements and shows superior performance in terms of fuel efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Doppler Aliasing in OFDM Radar: A Method for Reducing the ADC Sampling Frequency Without Losing Range Resolution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10323103</link><description>The orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform is especially suited for joint sensing and communication applications and has raised attention for radar-driven applications as well. For radar applications, the signal bandwidth determines the achievable range resolution, however, a large signal bandwidth also entails a large sampling frequency that is costly in terms of energy consumption and chip area. Hence, methods for reducing the sampling frequency have become an interesting field of research. In this work, a novel method referred to as Doppler aliasing (DA) - OFDM (DA-OFDM) is proposed, which allows for reducing the sampling frequency, while still benefiting from the same range resolution the entire signal bandwidth offers. This is achieved by allowing for systematic aliasing of the originally orthogonal subcarriers due to undersampling in the receiver. However, by properly modulating the transmit signal, these subcarriers become separable in the receiver in the Doppler domain. This work contains the derivation of the DA-OFDM waveform, a detailed analysis, radar measurement results, the derivation of a suitable communication receiver signal processing scheme, and bit error ratio (BER) simulation results. The latter one will verify the suitability of DA-OFDM for joint sensing and communication applications compared to, e.g., stepped-carrier OFDM.</description></item><item><title>Learning-Based Cooperative Mobility Control for Autonomous Drone-Delivery</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10310117</link><description>It has been widely considered that autonomous aerial drone-delivery will play a key role in next-generation logistics. For enabling robust and reliable autonomous multi-drone aerial package delivery services, the proposed algorithm has to mainly consider two objectives, i.e., (i) the maximization of total number of delivered packages and (ii) the efficient energy utilization which is defined as the energy consumption facilitation for increasing the number of delivered packages while avoiding battery exhaustion. This can be formulated as a kind of scheduling optimization problems, after that, this is re-formulated as a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL), in order to convert integer programming-based formulation which is hard to solve in polynomial-time into MADRL-based discrete-time sequential decision making over multiple cooperative drones. For the solution approach of MADRL, a novel communication network (CommNet)-based algorithm is designed for multi-drone cooperation in order to optimally achieve our two objectives. Our performance evaluation results verify that the proposed CommNet-based algorithm achieves desired performance improvements in terms of the maximization of total number of delivered packages as well as the efficient energy utilization.</description></item><item><title>Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Driving in Unstructured Scenarios Based on Deep Learning and Quadratic Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10310161</link><description>Trajectory planning for autonomous driving is challenging in unstructured scenarios such as mining sites. Existing studies mainly resort to a heuristic search-based planner to find a feasible trajectory. In the case of the narrow area, the heuristic function of the planner suffers from over-expansion problems, which may result in heavy computation burden and memory usage as well as potential failure. Therefore, a novel trajectory planning approach, namely learning and optimization-based trajectory planning (LOTP), is proposed, which is featured by a hierarchical structure consisting of two modules: (1) path searching, (2) speed profile generation. Firstly, a path searching method based on deep learning and Monte-Carlo tree search is proposed to generate a coarse path connecting starting and terminal points. Then, the path is smoothed using path optimization and provided to the speed-planning module as the reference. Next, a speed planning method based on quadratic optimization is developed, which allows to seek maximum driving comfort and energy saving. Last, extensive simulation experiments were conducted in the real environment of mining sites. The results verified that LOTP enhances the computational efficiency and success rate of path planning and helps generate an optimal speed profile. Furthermore, LOTP exhibits desirable potential for the practical application of autonomous driving at mining sites. Source implementation will be released as an open-source code.</description></item><item><title>RLoPlanner: Combining Learning and Motion Planner for UAV Safe Navigation in Cluttered Unknown Environments</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10323210</link><description>In this paper, we propose a hierarchical navigation framework named RLoPlanner that combines deep reinforcement learning algorithms and local motion planners, allowing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to perform navigation tasks safely and energy-efficiently in complex and unknown environments. This technique is critical to improve the performance of UAVs in environments without prior maps. Specifically, the framework high-level generates a stochastic policy through a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on maximum entropy, which generates a local target based on raw sensor information. Then the low-level motion planner tracks the local goal to generate a smooth trajectory to the final target. Compared with existing end-to-end navigation methods, the proposed navigation framework generates trajectories that are smoother, more energy-efficient and more dynamically feasible. The framework also overcomes the drawback that the mapping and planning methods tend to fall into local minima. Our experiments in a simulated environment with random obstacles demonstrate that RLoPlanner outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of navigation success rate and kinematically compliant trajectories.</description></item><item><title>Improved Supervisory Controller Design for a Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicle</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10313075</link><description>In this paper, a fuel cell system supervisory controller is developed for a fuel cell-based hybrid electric vehicle to safely control the interactions between powertrain components, maximize efficiency and minimize the degradation of the fuel cell. The proposed fuel cell supervisory controller includes three main elements: a state machine, an optimal setpoint generator and a power limit calculator. The state machine, as the top layer of the supervisory controller, is responsible for coordinating the various subsystems of the fuel cell, including the three subsystems, anode, cathode, thermal, and the dc/dc converter. The primary purpose of the state machine is to ensure global control over these subsystems as well as facilitate communication between the fuel cell system, diagnosis system, and Vehicle Control Unit (VCU). The state machine not only allows for the appropriate transitions between states but also governs the fuel cell system operation in all its different operating states such as Start-up, Shutdown and Run. The optimal setpoint generator is responsible for determining the operating conditions of the fuel cell system that maximizes the system's efficiency. It is designed by taking into account the comprehensive model of the fuel cell stack, considering manufacturing constraints, and incorporating the compressor map which then provides the optimal setpoints for all the subsystems' local controllers. A power limit calculator is also developed to compute the stack available power and feeds this information to the energy management system in the VCU. This information is used by the VCU to split the requested power between the fuel cell and the battery. The experimentally validated stack model and the complex model of the subsystems based on the Inn-Balance project data are used in the simulation. Furthermore, the subsystems' local controllers used in the MATLAB-Simulink were validated in a real vehicle test bench. The Common Artemis 130 km/h Driving Cycle (CADC) for automotive applications is used to verify the proposed fuel cell system supervisory controller in the MATLAB-Simulink environment. The simulation results showed that the proposed control structure functioned properly in the Run mode using this CADC-based load profile.</description></item><item><title>High Performance Sparse Forward-Looking Imaging of Distributed Millimeter-Wave Radar</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10328892</link><description>High performance and high resolution single snapshot imaging technology is one of the keys to empowering radar development. For millimeter-wave radar performance to meet the stringent requirements of forward-looking imaging, conventional processing of a single sensor by straightforward scaling of the radar parameters is often restricted. Here, this paper presents an effective and high accuracy settlement for forward-looking imaging acquisition in spatial distributed radar system. Firstly, we construct a joint angle-range complex signal model for multiple-input multiple-output scheme, and propose the joint Bayesian matching pursuit (jBMP) algorithm to employ sparse sensing-based estimation of unsynchronized nodes. Our primary goal is to find a global minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimator involving Bernoulli-Gaussian variables, and to adopt the general linear fusion rule for the distributed Bayesian structure. The uniqueness of the solution lies in the fact that the associated support set obtained through greedy search is globally shared by all nodes. Finally, a series of simulation and real data obtained from the distributed radar systems is presented to illustrate the validity and robustness of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Learning-Based Model Predictive Control for the Energy Management of Hybrid Electric Vehicles Including Driving Mode Decisions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10319113</link><description>This paper presents an online-capable controller for the energy management system of a parallel hybrid electric vehicle based on model predictive control. Its task is to minimize the vehicle's fuel consumption along a predicted driving mission by calculating the distribution of the driver's power request between the electrical and the combustive part of the powertrain, and by choosing the driving mode, which depends on the vehicle's clutch state. The inclusion of the clutch state in a model predictive control structure is not trivial because the underlying optimization problem becomes a mixed-integer program as a consequence. Using Pontryagin's Minimum Principle and a simplified vehicle model, it is possible to prove that a drive cycle-dependent critical power request $P_\text{crit}$ exists, which uniquely separates the optimal driving mode. Based on this result, a learning algorithm is proposed to determine $P_\text{crit}$ during the operation of the vehicle. The learning algorithm is incorporated into a multi-level controller structure and the working principle of the resulting multi-level learning-based model predictive controller is analyzed in detail using three realistic driving missions. A comparison to the solution obtained by Dynamic Programming reveals that the proposed controller achieves close-to-optimal performance.</description></item><item><title>Joint User Association and Beamforming in Integrated Satellite-HAPS-Ground Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304301</link><description>This article proposes, and evaluates the benefit of, one particular hybrid satellite-high-altitude-platform-station (HAPS)-ground network, where one HAPS connected to one geo-satellite assists the ground base stations (BSs) at serving ground-level users. The paper assumes that the geo-satellite is connected to the HAPS using free-space-optical backhaul links. The HAPS, equipped with multiple antennas, aims at transmitting the geo-satellite data to the users via radio-frequency (RF) links using spatial-multiplexing. Each ground BS, on the other hand, is equipped with multiple antennas, but directly serves the users through the RF links. The paper then focuses on maximizing the network-wide throughput, subject to HAPS payload connectivity constraint, HAPS and BSs power constraints, and backhaul constraints, so as to jointly determine the user-association strategy of each user (i.e., user to geo-satellite via HAPS, or user to BS), and their associated beamforming vectors. We tackle such a mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem using an iterative approach, where the user-association is determined using a combination of integer linear programming and generalized assignment problems, and where the beamforming strategy is found using a weighted-minimum-mean-squared-error approach. The simulations illustrate the appreciable gain of our proposed algorithm, and highlight the prospects of augmenting the ground networks with beamforming-empowered HAPS for connecting the unconnected, and super-connecting the connected.</description></item><item><title>Quantized Phase Alignment by Discrete Phase Shifts for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Assisted Communication Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315225</link><description>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), with its capability of passively beamforming, has aroused a surge of interest in recent years. In this paper, we investigate the joint phase alignment and phase quantization on RIS discrete phase shift designs for RIS-assisted single-input single-output (SISO) system. Firstly, the phenomena of phase distribution in far and near fields of RIS are differentiated. Then, for the purpose of phase alignment, the phase distribution law and its underlying degree-of-freedom (DoF) are analyzed, serving as the guideline of phase quantization strategies. Subsequently, two phase quantization methods, i.e., dynamic threshold phase quantization (DTPQ) and equal interval phase quantization (EIPQ), are proposed to optimize RIS phase shift discretization so as to strengthen the beamforming. DTPQ evidences its capability of achieving the optimal discrete phase alignment with a linear complexity, whilst EIPQ is a simplified method yielding sub-optimal solution yet with a constant complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that both of the proposed methods provide substantial improvements on power gain, stability, and robustness over traditional quantization method. In addition, as a product of RIS beamforming, the path loss (PL) scaling law under discrete phase shifts for RIS channel is unveiled for the first time. The field trials conducted at 2.6GHz and 35 GHz validate the favourable performance of the proposed methods in practical communication environment. This work may provide reference for the beamforming design of RIS-assisted links, especially in the near field.</description></item><item><title>Joint Beam Scheduling and Beamforming Design for Cooperative Positioning in Multi-Beam LEO Satellite Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10323191</link><description>Cooperative positioning with multiple low earth orbit (LEO) satellites is promising in providing location-based services and enhancing satellite-terrestrial communication. However, positioning accuracy is greatly affected by inter-beam interference and satellite-terrestrial topology geometry. To select the best combination of satellites from visible ones and suppress inter-beam interference, this paper explores the utilization of flexible beam scheduling and beamforming of multi-beam LEO satellites that can adjust beam directions toward the same earth-fixed cell to send positioning signals simultaneously. By leveraging Cram&#233;r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) to characterize user Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) positioning accuracy, the concerned problem is formulated, aiming at optimizing user positioning accuracy under beam scheduling and beam transmission power constraints. To deal with the mixed-integer-nonconvex problem, we decompose it into an inner beamforming design problem and an outer beam scheduling problem. For the former, we first prove the monotonic relationship between user positioning accuracy and its perceived signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) to reformulate the problem, and then semidefinite relaxation (SDR) is adopted for beamforming design. For the outer problem, a heuristic low-complexity beam scheduling scheme is proposed, whose core idea is to schedule users with lower channel correlation to mitigate inter-beam interference while seeking a proper satellite-terrestrial topology geometry. Simulation results verify the superior positioning performance of our proposed positioning-oriented beamforming and beam scheduling scheme, and it is shown that average user positioning accuracy is improved by 17.1% and 55.9% when the beam transmission power is 20 dBw, compared to conventional beamforming and beam scheduling schemes, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Joint Beam Alignment and Resource Allocation for Multi-User mmWave Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10316594</link><description>Integrated sensing and communication has been considered as one of the key technologies for the 6th generation mobile networks. To achieve higher beamforming gains, arrays with massive antennas are employed in millimeter wave band. However, the narrowing of the beam will also lead to increasing difficulty in beam alignment while increasing the error and overhead of conventional codebook-based beam sweeping schemes. In this article, a sensing-aided beam alignment scheme and corresponding resource allocation algorithm for the multi-user system is proposed. Specifically, the base station senses the angle of departure (AoD) of each user and performs beam alignment based on obtained AoDs in a time-divisional manner. Then, to reduce the effect of beam misalignment caused by sensing errors, a projected gradient descent algorithm based on Monte Carlo estimation is proposed to solve the non-convex and non-closed optimization problem for power allocation among users. Moreover, aiming to obtain the optimal trade-off between communication and sensing, a method for time interval allocation is developed. The proposed scheme can match the communication power allocated to each user with the estimation accuracy of its AoD, which can improve the achievable sum communication rate in the case of imperfect beam alignment. Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Weighted Sum-Rate Maximization for Multi-STAR-RIS-Assisted mmWave Cell-Free Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10316600</link><description>The cell-free network is regarded as an enabling technology for alleviating inter-cell interference due to its user-centric network paradigm. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are used to assist cell-free networks in improving network capacity at a low cost. However, only half-space coverage can be achieved by RISs. With the unique capability of extending half-space coverage to full-space coverage, simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS) is emerged as an attractive technology. Motivated by this distinctive characteristic, multiple STAR-RISs deployed in millimeter wave (mmWave) cell-free systems to assist users in downlink transmission are investigated in this paper. Our objective is to maximize the weighted sum-rate (WSR) via joint optimization of association indicators, active beamforming vectors at mmWave base stations (MBSs) as well as transmission and reflection beamforming vectors of STAR-RISs, while the limits of STAR-RIS-user association, each MBS maximum transmit power as well as passive coefficients of STAR-RISs ought to be satisfied. To handle the non-convex problem, we develop the Lagrangian dual transform (LDT)-quadratic transform (QT)-based algorithm. To be specific, the LDT and QT are utilized for reformulating the non-convex problem as a more solvable equivalent one, afterwards, the transformed problem is decomposed into five subproblems via the alternating optimization (AO) method. Particularly, the solutions of association indicators, active beamforming vectors, and passive beamforming vectors are obtained through the linear conic relaxation (LCR)-based association scheme, the rank-one relaxation approach as well as the penalty-based norm approximation algorithm, respectively. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method can obtain better WSR performance over benchmarks. Some useful guidances are also provided for mmWave cell-free systems.</description></item><item><title>Delay and Energy Minimization for Cooperative NOMA-MEC Networks With SWIPT Aided by RIS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10319410</link><description>In this article, a cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) mobile edge computing (MEC) network aided by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is considered, where the transmitters offload parts of their computing tasks to the MEC server via a relay and an RIS for enhancing the transmission environment. The goal is to minimize the task delay and energy consumption for the considered networks by jointly designing the RIS's reflection beamforming vector, the power splitting (PS) ratio, the power allocation factors of the relay, as well as the offloading transmit power and the offloading task ratio. To solve the proposed problems, an iterative optimization algorithm based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) method and the penalty method is proposed to decompose the formulated problems into two sub-problems. In particular, we jointly optimize the PS ratio, the power allocation coefficients and the edge computing resource based on the SCA technology, and then the penalty method is used to optimize the RIS's reflecting beamforming vector. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed NOMA-MEC networks aided by RIS and SWIPT are superior to the conventional orthogonal multiple access MEC networks with SWIPT aided by RIS in terms of task delay and energy consumption.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic UAV Swarm Collaboration for Multi-Targets Tracking Under Malicious Jamming: Joint Power, Path and Target Association Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10319327</link><description>In this paper, the multi-target tracking (MTT) with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm is investigated in the presence of jammers, where UAVs in the swarm communicate with each other to exchange information of targets during tracking. The communication between UAVs suffers from severe interference, including inter-UAV interference and jamming, thus leading to a deteriorated quality of MTT. To mitigate the interference and achieve MTT, we formulate an interference minimization problem by jointly optimizing UAV's sub-swarm division, trajectory, and power, subject to the constraint of MTT, collision prevention, flying ability, and UAV energy consumption. Due to the multiple coupling of sub-swarm division, trajectory, and power, the proposed optimization problem is NP-hard. To solve this challenging problem, it is decomposed into three subproblems, i.e., target association, path plan, and power control. First, a cluster-evolutionary target association (CETA) algorithm is proposed, which involves dividing the UAV swarm into multiple sub-swarms and individually matching these sub-swarms to targets. Second, a jamming-sensitive and singular case tolerance (JSSCT)-artificial potential field (APF) algorithm is proposed to plan trajectory for tracking the targets. Third, we develop a jamming-aware mean field game (JA-MFG) power control scheme, where a novel cost function is established considering the total interference. Finally, to minimize the total interference, a dynamic collaboration approach is designed. Different from traditional alternative iteration algorithms, our proposed dynamic collaboration approach triggers the updates of the sub-swarm division and UAV trajectory, and periodically updates the transmission power. Simulation results validate that the proposed dynamic collaboration approach reduces average total interference, tracking steps, and target switching times by 28%, 33%, and 48%, respectively, comparing to existing baselines.</description></item><item><title>Energy Efficiency Enhancement in User-Centric and Cell-Free Millimeter-Wave Massive MIMO Systems With Hybrid Beamforming</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10330153</link><description>Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) is a new and scalable network architecture that can bring antennas closer to users. In addition, hybrid beamforming can greatly reduce the power consumption by limiting the number of radio frequency chains. To achieve higher energy efficiency (EE) of a wireless network, it is of practical interest to incorporate hybrid beamforming into CF-mMIMO systems to fully utilize their combined benefits. Moreover, user-centric scheme is considered so that idle access points (APs) can be turned into sleep mode for energy saving. In this paper, we formulate the EE maximization problem where user-AP association, hybrid beamformers and AP selection are jointly optimized with a realistic power consumption model. Due to the binary variables involved, the formulated problem is a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem. Given this setup, we first exploit the strong coupling between binary variables and continuous beamformers, then a group sparse beamforming method is used to induce group-sparsity of beamformers, and finally the original problem is transformed into a more tractable one. To reduce complexity, we propose another low-complexity method to solve the original problem by using an alternate optimization algorithm. Numerical results indicate the superiority of the two proposed algorithms over some well-known schemes.</description></item><item><title>Analytical Performance Evaluation of STAR-RIS Assisted Terahertz Wireless Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10328394</link><description>This article considers simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) assisted terahertz communications, in which a multi-antenna full-duplex base station serves two half-duplex users (U1 and U2) in the downlink and uplink, respectively. It is assumed that U1 and U2 are located in the reflection and transmission spaces. The STAR-RIS is considered under energy splitting (ES) and mode switching (MS) protocols to provide simultaneous full-space coverage to both users, but at the expense of inter-user interference (IUI). The paper aims to evaluate the impacts of various practical factors on the system performance, including IUI, quantization errors due to discrete phase shifters of the STAR-RIS, beam misalignment due to highly-directive antennas, and random fog. Thus, it derives accurate expressions for the ergodic capacity, outage probability, and symbol error rate. Numerical and simulation results reveal that the system performance is more severely impacted by beam misalignment and random fog than by other factors. It is also observed that the ES protocol outperforms the MS protocol in the downlink, but the situation is reversed in the uplink due to coupled phase shifts. Moreover, in the high-signal-to-noise ratio regime, the system performance is restricted due to IUI signals.</description></item><item><title>How to Minimize the Weighted Sum AoI in Multi-Source Status Update Systems: TDMA or NOMA?</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10329986</link><description>In this paper, the minimization of the weighted sum average age of information (AoI) in a multi-source status update communication system is studied. Multiple independent sources send update packets to a common destination node in a time-slotted manner under the limit of maximum retransmission rounds. Different multiple access schemes, i.e., time-division multiple access (TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), are exploited here over a block-fading multiple access channel (MAC). Constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) problems are formulated to describe the AoI minimization problems considering both transmission schemes. The Lagrangian method is used to convert CMDP problems to unconstrained Markov decision process (MDP) problems, and corresponding algorithms are designed to derive the power allocation policies. Also, a suboptimal threshold-based policy is proposed. On the other hand, for the case of unknown environments, two online reinforcement learning approaches considering both multiple access schemes are proposed to achieve near-optimal age performance. Numerical simulations validate the improvement of the proposed policy in terms of weighted sum AoI compared to the fixed power transmission policy and illustrate that NOMA is more favorable in the case of larger packet sizes.</description></item><item><title>To DASH, or Not to DASH? Optimal Video Bitrate Selection and Edge Network Caching in MEC-Empowered Slice-Enabled Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10305275</link><description>An increasing body of works highlight that Dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH) can negatively impact the user Quality of Experience (QoE) in cache-enabled networks. Besides, network-agnostic DASH cannot fully harness the potential of slice-enabled 5G and Beyond networks, which can promise minimum rate performance for the i) MEC-empowered cellular base station (BS) to user link, and ii) content delivery network (CDN) to MEC-empowered BS link. In this paper, we show that network-agnostic DASH is incompatible with MEC-empowered edge network caching and network slicing in next generation mobile data networks. Accordingly, we propose joint video bitrate selection and edge network caching when specific rate and cache size guarantees can be provided along the end-to-end content delivery path. By formulating the aforementioned problem as a dynamic program (DP), we present an exhaustive (brute-force) search algorithm to optimally solve it and derive an exact algorithm of polynomial time to avoid unnecessary recalculations of previously visited solution branches. Through extensive experimental results we assess the performance of the proposed algorithm and compare it against other solutions, aiming to draw valuable insights for algorithmic design tailored to MEC-empowered slice-enabled mobile data networks.</description></item><item><title>Computation Bits Maximization for IRS-Aided Mobile-Edge Computing Networks With Phase Errors and Transceiver Hardware Impairments</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10306290</link><description>Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a hopeful technique to improve the computation offloading efficiency for mobile-edge computing (MEC) networks. However, the phase errors (PEs) of IRS and transceiver hardware impairments (THIs) will greatly degrade the performance of IRS-assisted MEC networks. To overcome this bottleneck, this paper first investigates the computation bits maximization problem for IRS-assisted MEC networks with PEs, where multiple Internet of Things (IoT) devices can offload their computation tasks to access points with the aid of IRS. By exploiting the block coordinate descent method, we design a multi-block optimization algorithm to tackle the non-convex problem. In particular, the optimal IRS phase shift, time allocation, transmit power and local computing frequencies of IoT devices are derived in closed-form expressions. Moreover, we further study the joint impact of PEs and THIs on the total computation bits of considered systems, where same methods in the scenario with PEs are used to obtain the optimal IRS phase shift and local computing frequencies of IoT devices, while an approximation algorithm and the variable substitution method are used to acquire the optimal transmit power and time allocation strategy. Finally, numerical results validate that our proposed methods can significantly outperform benchmark methods in terms of total computation bits.</description></item><item><title>ESIA: An Efficient and Stable Identity Authentication for Internet of Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10310120</link><description>Decentralized, tamper-proof blockchain is regarded as a solution to a challenging authentication issue in the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs). However, the consensus time and communication overhead of blockchain increase significantly as the number of vehicles connected to the blockchain. To address this issue, vehicular fog computing has been introduced to improve efficiency. However, existing studies ignore several key factors such as the number of vehicles in the fog computing system, which can impact the consensus communication overhead. Meanwhile, there is no comprehensive study on the stability of vehicular fog composition. The vehicle movement will lead to dynamic changes in fog. If the composition of vehicular fog is unstable, the blockchain formed by this fog computing system will be unstable, which can affect the consensus efficiency. With the above considerations, we propose an efficient and stable identity authentication (ESIA) empowered by hierarchical blockchain and fog computing. By grouping vehicles efficiently, ESIA has low communication complexity and achieves high stability. Moreover, to enhance the consensus security of the hierarchical blockchain, the consensus process is from the bottom layer to the up layer (bottom-up), which we call B2UHChain. Through theoretical analysis and simulation verification, our scheme achieves the design goals of high efficiency and stability while significantly improving the IoV scalability to the power of 1.5 (^1.5) under similar security to a single-layer blockchain. In addition, ESIA has less communication and computation overhead, lower latency, and higher throughput than other baseline authentication schemes.</description></item><item><title>Edge Computing Task Offloading Optimization for a UAV-Assisted Internet of Vehicles via Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10314017</link><description>In the context of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted vehicular networking system, more network factors need to be considered to ensure the safe operation of connected vehicles. A large volume of delay-sensitive and computationally demanding tasks necessitate offloading to UAVs or roadside units for processing. And the efficient allocation of various network resources of vehicles, UAVs, and roadside units under constrained conditions determines the efficiency of task offloading. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated its efficacy as an experienced approach for solving such problems. In this article, we delve into the utilization of deep reinforcement learning to design an efficient UAV-assisted vehicular edge computing task offloading strategy. Under the constraints of limited network bandwidth and limited UAV power, the trajectory and the task offloading strategy of the UAV are jointly optimized. The primary objective of our proposed strategy is to achieve a notable reduction in the system delay of the edge computing network. Given the dynamic variability of tasks arrival, we employ a long short-term memory (LSTM) network with the attention mechanism and a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to effectively model the optimization problem as a Markov decision process. This approach can obtain the optimal policy through interactive learning from the UAV and the vehicle environment. The experiment results illustrate that this strategy outperforms other baseline strategies in terms of convergence speed, network delay, and task offloading ratio.</description></item><item><title>Energy-Spectral-Efficient Heterogeneous Cellular Networks: Joint Optimization of Cross-Tier Inter-BS Cooperation and BS Deployment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315021</link><description>This paper enhances the energy/spectral utilization of a large-scale coordinated multi-point (CoMP) enabled two-tier heterogeneous cellular network (HCN) by the joint optimization of the associated cross-tier inter-BS cooperation and BS deployment, where a pair of BSs in different tiers can cooperate to transmit desired signals to the user equipment (UE) supported. We derive the energy-spectral efficiency (ESE) for the large-scale CoMP-enhanced two-tier HCN. Our ESE modeling distinctively includes: 1) The ESE's dependence on the activation degree of cross-tier inter-BS cooperation is quantified, which can be flexibly harnessed for transforming the grave interference-limited situation of the tier-edge UEs into harmonious CoMP-support. 2) Both the BS densities in these two tiers and the large-scale user-behaviors (LSUBs) are explicitly integrated into our ESE modeling. Under this tractable ESE model, we first optimize the network's ESE by choosing a suitable cooperation activation degree based on a specific cellular scenario, whilst satisfying the UE's outage constraint. We continue by formulating the joint optimization problem of the cooperation activation degree and of the BS density for maximizing the ESE, while varying the LSUBs. Our simulation results confirm the accuracy of our ESE modeling and quantify the impact of network parameters on the achievable ESE. We demonstrate that the proposed joint optimization strategy has a significantly higher ESE than its optimization counterpart only considering the cooperation activation degree. Our solution may be expected to pave the way for improving the resource efficiency of large-scale dense HCNs.</description></item><item><title>A Unified Framework for Multi-Hop Wireless Relaying With Hardware Impairments</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10339876</link><description>Relaying increases the coverage area and reliability of wireless communications systems by mitigating the fading effect on the received signal. Most technical contributions in the context of these systems assume ideal hardware (ID) by neglecting the non-idealities of the transceivers, which include phase noise, in-phase/quadrature mismatch and high power amplifier nonlinearities. These non-idealities create distortion on the received signal by causing variations in the phase and attenuating the amplitude. The resulting deterioration of the performance of wireless communication systems is further magnified as the frequency of transmission increases. In this paper, we investigate the aggregate impact of hardware impairments (HI) on the general multi-hop relay system using amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying techniques over a general $\bf H$-fading model. $\bf H$-fading model includes free space optics, radio frequency, millimeter wave, Terahertz, and underwater fading models. Closed-form expressions of outage probability, bit error probability and ergodic capacity are derived in terms of $\bf H$-functions. Following an asymptotic analysis at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), practical optimization problems have been formulated with the objective of finding the optimal level of HI subject to the limitation on the total HI level. The analytical solution has been derived for the Nakagami-$m$ fading channel which is a special case of $\bf H$-fading for AF and DF relaying techniques. The overall instantaneous signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio has been demonstrated to reach a ceiling at high SNRs which has a reciprocal proportion to the HI level of all hops' transceivers on the contrary to the ID.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Task Offloading in Distributed VEC Networks: An Exploration and Exploitation Assisted Contract-Theoretic Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10319112</link><description>In vehicular edge computing (VEC) networks, task offloading is a prospective approach to alleviate the computing burden of vehicles. Most works studied task offloading in centralized scenarios, where centralized infrastructures host the offloading and force vehicles into providing required private information. However, considering the high costs of infrastructure deployment, distributed scenarios without infrastructures are more practical. This paper focuses on a distributed VEC network, where a task vehicle (TaV) offloads tasks to surrounding vehicles (SuVs) with energy harvesting capabilities. In this context, SuVs are self-interested, and how to motivate self-interested vehicles to process offloaded tasks and provide the required information is challenging. To tackle these issues, an exploration and exploitation assisted contract-theoretic (EEACT) scheme is developed, where each SuV is recruited to participate in task offloading, and to accept the contract item designed for its type. The SuV type is related with the SuV's private information, and is partially monotonic. As a result, traditional simplification methods of incentive compatible (IC) and individual rational (IR) constraints in contract theory are not applicable. To address this problem, novel simplification methods are proposed and proved theoretically. Based on the contract design, the TaV determines the task offloading decisions by minimizing the processing cost of tasks, including the computation delay and the energy consumption. A low-complexity algorithm based on SuV types is proposed to obtain the approximately optimal offloading strategy. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme over the baseline schemes in terms of optimality.</description></item><item><title>AoI-Aware Joint Scheduling and Power Allocation in Intelligent Transportation System: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10321738</link><description>In Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), information freshness is a crucial indicator for monitoring road traffic, which is measured by Age of Information (AoI). This paper studies the problem of vehicle data packet scheduling and power allocation for AoI minimization in a Manhattan grid Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) network. The challenge of the problem originates from the dynamic wireless environment and different AoI requirements of vehicles. To solve the above problems, a single-agent Markov Decision Process (MDP) is modeled. And we propose a Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (D3QN)-based Scheduling and Power Allocation Method (SPAM). The D3QN agent is devoted to minimizing the AoI of each vehicle. In addition, Priority Experience Replay (PER) technology is developed to solve the difficulty of obtaining high-value learning experiences. The simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms baseline D3QN approaches in average AoI by 22.6%.</description></item><item><title>Joint Task Offloading Scheduling and Resource Allocation in Air&#8211;Ground Cooperation UAV-Enabled Mobile Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10329934</link><description>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are heavily used in disaster or emergency scenarios.

The corresponding optimization problem, which is a non-convex mixed-integer optimization problem, is formulated. In oder to solve this problem, the formulated problem is decomposed into three Sub-Problems (SP), and an iterative method based on Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) is proposed. Given the UAV location and resource allocation, the 1-st SP (SP1) of task offloading scheduling optimization is solved by greedy strategy optimization methods. Given the task offloading decision, task scheduling order, and resource allocation, the 2-nd SP (SP2) of optimizing the deployment location of UAV is solved by Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) optimization methods. Given the task offloading decision, task scheduling order, and UAV location, the 3-rd SP (SP3) of transmission and computing resources allocating is solved by convex optimization methods. Simulation results show that our proposed method can significantly reduce energy consumption compared to the benchmark schemes.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Resource Allocation for Mobile Edge Computing in Internet of Vehicles: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10330753</link><description>Mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged in recent years as an effective solution to the challenge of limited vehicle resources in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), especially for computation-intensive vehicle tasks.

This paper aims to minimize the energy consumption of the roadside sensors and satisfy the requirement of vehicles for the HDM content freshness by jointly scheduling the edge content updating and the downlink transmission resource allocation of the Road Side Unit (RSU). To this end, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based algorithm, namely the prioritized double deep R-Learning Networking (PRD-DRN). Under this PRD-DRN algorithm, the content update and transmission resource allocation are modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We take full advantage of deep R-learning and prioritized experience sampling to obtain the optimal decision, which achieves the minimization of the long-term average cost related to the content freshness and energy consumption. Extensive simulation results are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our proposed PRD-DRN algorithm, and also to illustrate the advantage of our algorithm on improving the content freshness and energy consumption compared with the baseline policies.</description></item><item><title>Beam Pattern and Reflection Pattern Design for Channel Estimation in RIS-Assisted mmWave MIMO Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10243635</link><description>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a revolutionary technology that can be applied in millimeter wave (mmWave) communications to reduce the high power consumption and propagation loss.

The effects of ICI on radar performance are analyzed according to dynamic range, peak power, and noise floor. To enhance OFDM radar performance, we propose a two-step ICI mitigation method. Coarse compensation partially restores the target's peak power distorted by ICI and estimates actual velocity of each scatterer without ambiguity. Consequently, fine compensation reconstructs the signal from each scatterer as ICI-free signal. The simulation result shows that the proposed method can restore the target's peak power to the level without Doppler shift, and the noise due to ICI effect can be reduced. Since our method is based on OFDM symbols designed for communication systems, it can eliminate ICI effect in OFDM radar without any loss of communication performance, which is preferable for joint radar-communication systems.</description></item><item><title>STAR-RIS Assisted Covert Communications in NOMA Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10306315</link><description>Covert communications assisted by simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems have been explored in this paper.

Then, we investigate a sum-rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and MF-RIS coefficients, subject to the coupled amplitude and phase shift constraints. To address the formulated non-convex problem, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm based on the fractional programming theory.

The analog beamformer design is modeled as a phase alignment problem to harvest the array gain. Given the analog beamformer, the digital beamformer is designed by solving a weighted minimum mean squared error problem. Then based on imperfect CSI, an analog-only beamformer design scheme is proposed, where the design problem aims at maximizing the desired signal power on the current user and minimizing the power on the other users to mitigate the multiuser interference. The original problem is then transformed into a series of independent beam nulling subproblems, where an efficient iterative algorithm using the majorization&#8211;minimization framework is proposed to solve the subproblems. Simulation results show that, under perfect CSI, the proposed scheme achieves almost the same sum-rate performance as the existing schemes but with lower computational complexity; and under imperfect CSI, the proposed analog-only beamforming design scheme can effectively mitigate the multiuser interference.</description></item><item><title>GNN-Based Meta-Learning Approach for Adaptive Power Control in Dynamic D2D Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10319409</link><description>This article proposes a deep learning-based power control method for maximizing the sum rate subject to rate requirements in the interference-limited device-to-device (D2D) communications. Based on the dynamic nature of D2D communications, we consider the environment where system parameters, such as the number of devices, rate requirements, and deployment area, unpredictably change over time. To deal with the low adaptability and scalability issues of the conventional deep learning-based approaches in dynamic environments, we develop an environment-adaptive power control method by leveraging graph neural network (GNN) architecture and meta-learning approach. In the developed method, we design the node feature and state update rule for GNN by taking into account the characteristics of power optimization problem and meta-train model by treating some past environments as meta-tasks. Simulation results demonstrate that the developed method outperforms the conventional GNN-based power control methods in terms of the average sum-throughput achievement ratio and adaptation speed to test environments.</description></item><item><title>Statistical Age-of-Information Optimization for Status Update Over Multi-State Fading Channels</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10328835</link><description>Age of information (AoI) is a powerful metric to evaluate the freshness of information, where minimization of average statistics, such as the average AoI and average peak AoI, currently prevails in guiding freshness optimization for related applications. Although minimizing the statistics does improve the received information's freshness for status update systems in the sense of average, the time-varying fading characteristics of wireless channels often cause uncertain yet frequent age violations. The recently-proposed statistical AoI metric can better characterize more features of AoI dynamics, which evaluates the achievable minimum peak AoI under the certain constraint on age violation probability. In this paper, we study the statistical AoI minimization problem for status update systems over multi-state fading channels, which can effectively upper-bound the AoI violation probability but introduce the prohibitively-high computing complexity. To resolve this issue, we tackle the problem with a two-fold approach. For a small AoI exponent, the problem is approximated via a fractional programming problem. For a large AoI exponent, the problem is converted to a convex problem. Solving the two problems respectively, we derive the near-optimal sampling interval for diverse status update systems. Insightful observations are obtained on how sampling interval shall be tuned as a decreasing function of channel state information (CSI). Surprisingly, for the extremely stringent AoI requirement, the sampling interval converges to a constant regardless of CSI's variation. Numerical results verify effectiveness as well as superiority of our proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>On an Intelligent Task Offloading Model to Jointly Optimize Latency and Energy for Electric Connected Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10319109</link><description>With modern Electric Connected Vehicles (ECVs) becoming more intelligent and entertaining, the Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) servers deployed near the Road Side Units (RSUs) have been expected to not only improve the computing performance, but also alleviate the ECVs' battery burden. However, the uneven spatial and temporal distribution of vehicle arrivals cause that the MEC servers in busy areas are overloaded, which results in degraded computation performance and limited energy alleviation for ECVs. In this paper, we consider the task distribution among nearby MEC servers and propose a novel partial offloading strategy where multiple blocks of the tasks are cooperatively processed by MEC servers in the vehicles' moving directions. After formulating the mathematical model to jointly optimize the computing latency and energy consumption of ECVs, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based task partial offloading strategy is proposed and a Deep Q-Network (DQN) is adopted to make the offloading decision. Simulation results illustrate the significant alleviation of energy consumption and improvement of computation performance compared with conventional methods.</description></item><item><title>The Impact of Hot Injection Reaction Temperature on the Properties of Cu2ZnSnS4 Nanocrystal Thin Films for PV Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10356634</link><description>Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) is a p-type absorber layer semiconductor, which is a promising candidate material for advanced solar cell devices. CZTS nanoparticle thin films were synthesized via the hot-injection spin-coating method. Nanoparticle inks were deposited on soda lime glass substrates. Different reaction temperatures during synthesis were investigated by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), focused ion beam microscopy (FIB-SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Raman spectroscopy, and Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy to study the effects of the synthesis reaction temperature on CZTS thin films. The energy band-gap decreased with increasing reaction temperatures from 1.55 to 1.34 eV for the temperature range 225&#8201;&#176;C&#8211;300&#8201;&#176;C. These energy bandgaps show values close to the optimum for a CZTS solar cell device. XRD confirmed the kesterite structure, which is the preferred structure in CZTS for high efficiency PV device performance. In addition, a clear increasing trend of the scattering domain size with the reaction temperature is found to be in good agreement with the FIB-SEM images. Raman spectra showed no secondary phases. EDS of thin films demonstrated compositions consistent with start-up precursor ratios (Cu-poor Zn-rich composition). And 250&#8201;&#176;C was identified as the most suitable reaction temperature for CZTS devices.</description></item><item><title>The Impact of N-Doped Carbon Quantum Dots on Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells Operating Under Diffused- and Low-Light Intensity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10341340</link><description>This study investigates the double role of N-doped carbon quantum dots (N-CQDs) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) that operate under diffused- and low-light intensity conditions. We demonstrate that the incorporation of N-CQDs leads to a substantial improvement in the performance of DSSCs. Under standard one-sun illumination, the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) achieved with N-CQDs is 2% higher than that of the bare cell. Moreover, we introduce two new metrics, the diffused-light coefficient and the low-light intensity coefficient, to evaluate the performance of DSSCs under nonideal illumination conditions. The diffused-light coefficient is recorded at 1.55, which indicates a notable enhancement in diffused-light PCE with N-CQDs. In contrast, the low-light intensity coefficient shows a significant enhancement factor 2, which highlights the superior performance of N-CQD-based DSSCs under low-light conditions. Our findings demonstrate that N-CQDs play a dual role in DSSCs, by being added to both the commercial dye and the mesoporous TiO2 layer. These results provide valuable insights to develop and optimize DSSCs, especially for applications in indoor or low-light environments. The proposed metrics, the diffused light coefficient, and the low-light intensity coefficient, offer a meaningful assessment of the device's performance under nonideal illumination conditions.</description></item><item><title>Development of Solution-Processed Eco-Friendly Cs2SnI6 Double Perovskite Thin-Film Solar Cell</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10376173</link><description>This article reports a simple and efficient solution-processed method for designing stable Cs2SnI6 double perovskite thin film solar cells utilizing Cesium iodide and SnI4 in a 2:1 ratio. Better crystallinity in a Cs2SnI6 film is typically associated with higher optical absorbance, lower carrier concentration, more carrier mobility, and improved air and thermal stability. This compound contains Sn, which is in the 4+ oxidation state, which makes it significantly more robust against oxidation. The detailed synthetic difficulties in processing these compounds in solutions are the primary concern of this study. The solar cell parameters, structural, morphological, and, optical properties of prepared Cs2SnI6 thin film were investigated using Netport Oriel12A solar simulator, thin film grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GI-XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive X-ray, and photoluminescence spectra (PL-Spectroscopy). Further, utilizing the synthesized Cs2SnI6 thin films as an absorber material, we have fabricated n-i-p configured FTO/TiO2/Cs2SnI6/MoS2/Ni/glass in the ambient condition. The current study will also suggest future research directions for increasing the device performance of air-stable Cs2SnI6 perovskite solar cells.</description></item><item><title>Demonstration of a Monolithically Integrated Hybrid Device for Simultaneous Power Generation and Data Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10430188</link><description>A three-terminal, monolithically integrated InP photovoltaic (PV) device with an InGaAs/InAlAs electroabsorption modulator for simultaneous power generation and data modulation has been designed and experimentally validated. A discrete modulator with a data rate approaching 1 Mbps with an on/off ratio of 1.20 was demonstrated. The InP power generating junction of the monolithic device attained an AM0 efficiency of 14.1% for a 0.25 cm2 area, with the efficiency loss primarily coming from the expected loss in the lateral conduction layer that was designed to minimize fractional power loss in the PV device and to minimize insertion loss at 1.55 $\mu$m. The monolithically integrated device demonstrated the potential for data modulation up to 0.5 Mbps at 1.55 $\mu$m. Simultaneous power generation and data modulation were observed in this monolithic device, and the device has application in areas such as low size, weight, power (SWaP) satellites, debris tagging, medical applications, and high altitude, long endurance unmanned aerial systems.</description></item><item><title>Impact of Additional PV Weight on the Energy Consumption of Electric Vehicles With Onboard PV</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10430388</link><description>Photovoltaics (PV) in onboard vehicle applications adds weight to an electric vehicle (EV), increasing the overall energy consumption. Although the added PV system weight is small compared with the vehicle weight, the power generated by PV is also very small compared with the power needed to propel an EV, making the effect of additional PV system weight on energy consumption a nontrivial topic to analyze. We present a method to study the impact of the vehicle onboard PV weight on the energy balance of EVs for different vehicle-added PV and vehicle-integrated PV configurations. The results are expressed through a newly introduced parameter called &#8220;onboard PV yield factor,&#8221; where positive values indicate a net energy gain and negative values indicate a net energy loss of the onboard PV system. Simulations are carried out to highlight the methodology for the driving phase of a medium and large passenger electric car with onboard PV for a selection of trips. Our method calculates the energy consumption attributable to the added PV system weight and PV energy yield for the selected trips. Our results for these sample simulations for the driving phase show a large range of yield factors, indicating the importance of systematically studying the impact of onboard vehicle PV weight.</description></item><item><title>Perovskite Solar Module Enabled IoT Asset Tracking for Wildlife Conservation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10430371</link><description>Perovskite technology has shown impressive improvement in the last decade. Here, the first global positioning system (GPS)-perovskite-powered application is showcased by integrating flexible perovskite modules (fPSMs) onto an animal tracking collar for powering the Internet of Things (IoT) device that monitors wildlife bison to preserve the species and its habitat. A prototype of a solar-powered collar was designed to be more optimal for monitoring ample wildlife than commercially available asset-tracking devices, so it can provide necessary data to successfully introduce bison to new habitats. The fPSM were fabricated on a plastic substrate and connected in series configuration to generate power of 400 mW. A robust packaging with polycarbonate sheets and mechanical rivets was realized to withstand harsh environmental conditions, validated by conducting scratch and bending tests. The electronics and software system were optimized for ultra-low power mode operation, consuming only 1.9 mWh, which is 200 times less than the energy generated by our modules. The packaged modules in the outdoor testing setup retained over 30% of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) and power after 350 days (8400 h), giving still 60 times more power than necessary over &#8764;1 year of operational condition.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Embedded System for Real-Time Fault Diagnosis of Photovoltaic Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10432772</link><description>In this article, a novel embedded low-cost system for real-time fault diagnosis of photovoltaic (PV) modules is proposed. The idea aims to develop an embedded application to classify certain defects that can frequently occur on PV modules based on infrared (IR) images in different regions (desert and Mediterranean climates). The investigated faults are sand accumulation, dirt on PV modules, degradation, and junction box overheating. After several inspections, these are the most commonly observed defects on PV modules in both regions (south and north of Algeria). A tiny convolutional neural network (TinyCNN) was developed, optimized, and integrated into a low-cost and low-power microcontroller (Arduino Nano 33 BLE sense). In this regard, a database of IR thermography images was built and used. The developed TinyCNN-based model could be run locally, without the need to send the data to the cloud for analysis and processing. Another microcontroller [Arduino Nano 33 Internet of Things (IoT)] was used to remotely monitor the state of the PV modules. Thanks to IoT technology, the results have been visualized and posted online on a dedicated monitoring webpage. The proposed embedded solution could be integrated into an unmanned aerial vehicle for real-time applications. Furthermore, it assists operators in diagnosing their PV modules and making a maintenance schedule. The proposed technique outperforms the existing solutions in terms of cost, consuming power, simplicity, and execution time. Simulation and experimental results clearly report the feasibility of the proposed embedded system, which has an average cost of around 120 US dollars.</description></item><item><title>Planet-Scale Energy Yield Potential of Next-Generation Bifacial, Multiterminal, Perovskite-Silicon Tandem Solar Farms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10400063</link><description>To continue reducing the levelized cost of solar energy, the photovoltaics (PV) industry is developing higher efficiency perovskite-based tandem solar cells. Among the various options, the two-terminal (2T) tandem has traditionally garnered the most interest and is expected to enter the market soon. However, the bifacial 2T perovskite-silicon (PVK-Si) tandem cell, constrained by current-matching requirements, would offer diminished energy gains in large-scale solar farms, especially when subjected to suboptimal albedo conditions. The 3/4T tandems obviate current matching and are expected to outperform 2T-tandem cells. However, the actual location-specific yield potential and relative gain of bifacial 3/4T tandems has not been reported in the literature. In this work, we use a novel end-to-end, multiscale simulation framework to carry out the first planet-scale simulation of single-axis-tracking solar farms employing bifacial PVK-Si 3/4T tandem in various ground albedo conditions. The analysis shows that the 3/4T cells offer up to 5% and 23% mean increase in annual energy yield compared with 2T-tandem and single-junction heterojunction solar cells in Earth's average albedo (${R}_A$ = 30%). Importantly, unlike the 2T tandem, the 3/4T tandem maintains its performance advantage across a wide range of albedo conditions, enabling flexible subcell design. The findings should encourage further research efforts aimed at tackling the recognized challenges associated with 3/4T technologies, such as minimizing optical losses and scaling up cell-to-module processes, to fully realize the potential of PVK-Si tandem technology.</description></item><item><title>Soft-Error-Immune Quadruple-Node-Upset Tolerant Latch Based on Polarity Design and Source-Isolation Technologies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10372497</link><description>A soft-error-immune quadruple-node-upset tolerant latch (SEI-QNUTL) with a low delay and high performance is proposed using 65-nm CMOS technology. The proposed SEI-QNUTL design consists of three soft-error-immune static random access memory (SEI-SRAM) cells. Furthermore, each SEI-SRAM cell employs polarity design and source-isolation technology to reduce the number of sensitive nodes and enhance the reliability of the latch. Compared with state-of-the-art quadruple-node-upset (QNU) tolerant latches [including high-performance and low-cost single-event multiple-node-upsets resilient (HLMR), QNU tolerant latch (QNUTL), and Latch Design and Algorithm-based Verification Protected against Multiple-Node-Upsets (LDAVPM)], the proposed SEI-QNUTL design reduces (on average) the area, delay, and area-power-delay-product (APDP) by 47.0%, 25.0%, 46.5%, and 66.3%, respectively. Extensive variation analysis validates that the SEI-QNUTL design is less sensitive to process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations regarding power consumption and delay. Furthermore, Monte Carlo (MC) simulations show that the proposed latch exhibits high reliability when performing data storage. Compared with the existing latches, the SEI-QNUTL design makes a good tradeoff among delay, power, and area, and it can thus be used in safety-critical applications.</description></item><item><title>ALT: Area-Efficient and Low-Latency FPGA Design for Torus Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10411958</link><description>The homomorphic encryption over the torus (TFHE) is a promising fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme that allows arbitrary homomorphic computations with the programmable bootstrapping (PBS) algorithm. However, PBS suffers from prohibitive computation complexity and latency, which hinders the practical applications of TFHE. To address these challenges, we propose ALT, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) accelerator for PBS that exhibits high area efficiency and low latency. Our approach involves modifying the parameters of the PBS algorithm to strike a balance between the computation complexity and the decryption failure rate (DFR). In addition, we leverage the Chinese residue theorem (CRT) to exploit the inherent parallelism and construct the primes to eliminate the need of CRT process and facilitate fast modular arithmetic. The ALT design comprises several carefully designed computation units, including inverse CRT (ICRT), divide-and-round (DR) operation, and monomial number theoretic transform (MNTT). We employ algorithmic and architectural co-optimization techniques to optimize these units. Notably, ALT features a low-complexity MNTT module, enabling the utilization of the bootstrapping key unrolling (BKU) technique with reduced latency and minimal hardware resources. Furthermore, all submodules of ALT are parameterized and scalable, allowing the entire design to be configurable according to varying requirements across different application scenarios. Experimental results on FPGA demonstrate that ALT significantly outperforms a similar configurable work in terms of latency, throughput, and efficiency. In comparison with the fastest FPGA implementation, ALT can realize lower latency while reducing digital signal processor (DSP) reduction by over 50%, leading to enhanced area efficiency and energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Low-Power Bus Encoding by Ternary LWC and Quaternary Transition Signaling: From Initial Concept to Circuit Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10360434</link><description>This article shows one of the potential applications of multiple-valued logic (MVL) for low-power data transfer in a network-on-chip (NoC). Dynamic power accounts for a large portion of the total chip interconnect power. This article combines ternary limited-weight codes (TLWCs) with quaternary transition signaling (QTS) to present a low-power bus encoding method. By this way, voltage swing and switching activity factor, the two main reasons for dynamic power consumption, are targeted. Not only does the proposed method reduce power, but it also accelerates data transmission because it compacts every four bits of information in only three ternary digits. Full details of the required components, such as a modulator, a demodulator, a quaternary flip-flop, and a quaternary repeater, are given. All circuits are simulated by Synopsys HSPICE and 32-nm CMOS technology. Then, the HSPICE results are applied to the Access Noxim simulator for NoC-level simulations. The results demonstrate that in a 3-D network with  $12\times 12\times4$  nodes, the proposed MVL bus encoding decreases the total energy and the average global delay by at least 9.25% and 31.39%, respectively, compared to when binary minimal encoding is used. Finally, the proposed model reduces the effects of crosstalk noise because it eliminates rail-to-rail transitions.</description></item><item><title>Memory-Efficient Multiplier-Less 2-D DWT Design Using Combined Convolution and Lifting Schemes for Wireless Visual Sensors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10445279</link><description>In this article, the combined convolution&#8211;lifting scheme is explored to address the design issues of 2-D discrete wavelet transform (DWT) structures. We found that the combined convolution&#8211;lifting scheme of type-1 (convolution followed by lifting) is more suitable than convolution or lifting schemes to design 2-D DWT structures with less on-chip memory. Furthermore, the canonic signed digit (CSD)-based multiplier-less designs are presented for convolution-DWT and lifting-DWT using  $9/7$  biorthogonal filters, and they have identical resource requirements for 12-bit coefficients. The proposed multiplier-less designs of convolution-DWT and lifting-DWT are used to derive a 2-D DWT structure to take advantage of the combined convolution&#8211;lifting scheme. The comparison result shows that the proposed combined 2-D DWT structure involves  $24\times $  less area-delay-product (ADP) and  $17\times $  less energy per image (EPI) compared with the best of the existing fractional wavelet transform (FrWT)-based structure and provides reconstructed images of 14 dB higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Compared with the recently proposed approximate lifting (ALF) 2-D DWT structure, the proposed combined 2-D DWT structure involves  $4.5\times $  less ADP,  $2.2\times $  less EPI, less on-chip memory by  $4N$  words and provides reconstructed images of PSNR higher by 7 dB, where  $N$  is the image width or height. Therefore, the proposed combined 2-D DWT structure is a better alternative to the existing 2-D DWT structures for low-complexity and low-memory realization of 2-D DWT especially for the visual sensor node applications.</description></item><item><title>A 0.079-pJ/b/dB 32-Gb/s 2&#215; Half-Baud-Rate CDR Circuit With Frequency Detector</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315076</link><description>A 32-Gb/s  $2\times $  half-baud-rate (THBR) clock and data recovery (CDR) circuit is presented by using a phase detector (PD) and a frequency detector (FD).

The proposed receiver bridge chip consists of a 4-lane D-PHY receiver (RX), a 3-lane C-PHY RX, a digital logic including 8b/10b encoder, and a 3-lane 8.0 Gb/s transmitter (TX) including a clock generator. The MIPI D-PHY RX consists of four data lanes and one clock lane. Each data lane consists of a high-speed (HS) RX with an equalizer and a 1-to-8 de-serializer including a sync word detector. The MIPI C-PHY RX consists of three lanes. Each lane supporting a data rate of 2.8 Gsym/s/lane includes an HS RX, a clock recovery, a de-serializer, and a de-mapper. To serialize and output 8b/10b encoded signals for byte signals, a 1.6 GHz clock with five phases is generated from a clock generator using a charge pump phase-locked loop (CP-PLL) with an  $LC$  voltage-controlled oscillator (LCVCO).

It always leverages a feature learning network (FLN) before backbones to obtain uniform representation from the scattered points. Grid-based FLN (GFLN) that partitions point clouds into uniform grids becomes the main category in recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) works. However, it heavily suffers from significant memory and computation inefficiency associated with high point sparsity and critical data dependency. To address these troubles, we propose FLNA, a GFLN accelerator with algorithm-architecture co-optimization for large-scale point clouds. At the algorithm level, the dataflow-decoupling strategy is adopted to alleviate the processing bottlenecks from pipeline dependency, which also reduces 78.3% computation cost by exploiting the redundancy from inherent sparsity and special operators. Based on the algorithm co-optimization, an effective architecture is designed with efficient GFLN mapping and block-wise processing strategies. It manages to improve on-chip memory efficiency tremendously through diverse techniques, including linked-list-based block lookup table (LUT) and transposed feature organization. Extensively evaluated on representative benchmarks, FLNA achieves 69.9&#8211; $264.4\times $  speedup with more than 99% energy savings compared to multiple GPUs and CPU. It also demonstrates a substantial performance boost over the SOTA point cloud accelerators while providing superior support of large-scale point clouds.</description></item><item><title>An Ultralow-Power Real-Time Machine Learning Based fNIRS Motion Artifacts Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10417024</link><description>Due to iterative matrix multiplications or gradient computations, machine learning modules often require a large amount of processing power and memory. As a result, they are often not feasible for use in wearable devices, which have limited processing power and memory. In this study, we propose an ultralow-power and real-time machine learning-based motion artifact detection module for functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) systems.

To achieve high energy efficiency, this work proposes layer-wise configurable timesteps (LCTs) and channel-regrouped sparse convolution (CRSC) to explore and exploit the redundancy of temporal and spatial dimensions. In the temporal dimension, principal component analysis (PCA) is utilized to analyze redundant information in each layer, and LCT is adopted to balance and eliminate variable redundancies between layers. In the spatial dimension, channels are regrouped by spike activation frequencies to ensure workload balance, and sparse convolution is implemented to further accelerate SNN&#8217;s computation flow. A layer-fuse method that embeds the parameter of batch normalization in leaky integrate-and-fire (BLIF) is also proposed to reduce data movement and processing time. An energy-efficient SNN accelerator integrating the above methods is designed. Compared with the baseline, the hardware equipped with the proposed LCT can achieve  $3.22\times $  acceleration by redundancy elimination. The CRSC and BLIF can also reduce the hardware computation and memory access by  $3.24\times $  during inference. Implemented in TSMC 28 nm technology, this accelerator can achieve an energy efficiency of 36.89 TOPS/W at 650 MHz.</description></item><item><title>A 12.93&#8211;16 Gb/s Reference-Less Baud-Rate CDR Circuit With One-Tap DFE and Semirotational Frequency Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10336769</link><description>A 12.93&#8211;16 Gb/s reference-less and baud-rate clock and data recovery (CDR) circuit with a one-tap speculative decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) is presented.

The 1-bit DSM and digital mixer encode the multi-bit baseband  $I/Q$  input signal into a 1-bit signal for on/off controlling the 1-bit PA to realize the TMM operation. Capacitor arrays are not required in the proposed PA, and redundant power dissipation on charging the capacitor array in conventional switched capacitor PAs (SCPAs) is avoided. Furthermore, a hybrid FIR filter comprising a two-tap digital FIR filter and a two-tap transformer (XFMR) combined semi-digital FIR filter suppresses the DSM quantization noise (QN) to avoid efficiency degradation. The XFMR combined semi-digital FIR filter is insensitive to mismatches, which maintains the high linearity of the 1-bit TMM PA. The proposed TMM PA is fabricated in 65-nm CMOS. Without digital pre-distortion (DPD), it achieves 26.4% power-added efficiency (PAE) with 40-MSymbol/s 64-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signal and 20.9% PAE with 20-MSymbol/s 256-QAM signal at 2.6 GHz.</description></item><item><title>Concurrent Body-Coupled Powering and Communication ICs With a Single Electrode</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433569</link><description>Body-coupled powering (BCP) and body-coupled communication (BCC) utilize the human body channel as the wireless transmission medium, which shows less path loss around the body area. However, integrating both BCP and BCC requires multiple electrodes or alternating the uplink and downlink in the time domain, due to signal interferences and backflow between different paths. To address this issue, we propose a base station (BS) IC and a sensor node (SN) IC with BCP and BCC concurrency. At the BS, the adaptive self-interference cancellation (SI-C) structure suppresses the output signals that are coupled at the data receiver, enabling the concurrent uplink data recovery and downlink power delivery. At the SN, the ground domain of the uplink data path is separated from that of the downlink power/data path to suppress leakage between the paths. For regulated power supply in different ground domains, the cross-ground-domain power converter is designed with 89.1% efficiency. The ICs are implemented in a 40-nm 1P8M standard CMOS process, and BCC + BCP concurrent operations are successfully validated.</description></item><item><title>A Highly Digital 143.2-dB DR Sub-1&#176; Phase Error Impedance Monitoring IC With Pulsewidth Modulation Frontend</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10384697</link><description>This article presents a highly digital impedance monitoring IC that achieves a wide dynamic range (DR) (&gt;140 dB), small area (~0.2  $\text {mm}^{{2}}$ ), and small phase error (&lt; 1&#176;). It consists of a square-wave current stimulator, a pulsewidth modulation (PWM) frontend, and two continuous-time (CT) delta-sigma ( $\Delta \Sigma $ ) modulators. The stimulated signal is encoded using the PWM frontend and the complex impedance information can be extracted by in (I) and quadrature (Q) demodulation. Each output can then be digitized using a second-order digitally controlled oscillator (DCO)-based CT  $\Delta \Sigma $  modulator. This highly digital architecture enhances energy and area efficiencies. The prototype IC occupies only 0.21  $\text {mm}^{{2}}$  in a 65-nm CMOS process. It achieves a DR of 143.2 dB and a resolution of 17.7  ${\text {fF}}_{\text {rms}}$  for capacitance detection within a conversion time of 16 ms. Despite the use of a square-wave stimulator, the PWM frontend allows achieving a small phase error of 0.675&#176;, while consuming only 310.9  $\mu \text{W}$  from a 1.2-V supply.</description></item><item><title>An Impedance-Boosted Transformer-First Discrete-Time Analog Front-End Achieving 0.34 NEF and 389-M&#937; Input Impedance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10418106</link><description>This article presents a transformer-first analog front-end (AFE) for ultra-low-power sensor nodes. The proposed AFE employs a discrete-time transformer based on series&#8211;parallel converters as an input stage. The switched-capacitor (SC) transformer can provide a passive low-noise voltage gain, attenuating the input-referred noise (IRN) of the following continuous-time chain. However, it also degrades the AFE input impedance. As a remedy, this article presents an input-resistance-boosting (IRB) loop that successfully increases the input resistance, sensing the output of a following continuous-time stage. At the same time, we also introduce an input-capacitance-canceling (ICC) loop to improve the input impedance at high frequencies. The proposed AFE achieves 389- $\mathbf {M\Omega }$  input impedance at 1 kHz, which represents a 39 $\times $  improvement compared to prior work. Moreover, it attains superior noise efficiency, with an IRN of  $\mathbf {1.36}~\mathbf {\mu V_{\text {rms}}}$ , while consuming 370 nW. This results in a noise efficiency factor (NEF) of 0.34 and a power efficiency factor (PEF) of 0.1, the lowest reported values to the best of the authors&#8217; knowledge. The impedance-boosted chain consisting of the SC transformer, first continuous-time amplifier (CTA), and the IRB loop achieves an NEF of 0.27 and a PEF of 0.06.</description></item><item><title>Picowatt-Power Super-Cutoff Analog Building Blocks and 78-pW Battery-Less Wake-Up Receiver for Light-Harvested Near-Always-On Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10382471</link><description>Techniques to reduce power well below regular transistor leakage in analog circuits are introduced. Key building blocks with super-cutoff transistor operation (i.e.,  $V_{\mathrm {GS}} &lt; 0$  V) and pW-range consumption are demonstrated.

Addressing the challenge of exponential die area growth associated with higher digital-to-analog converter (DAC) resolution dominating color depth, we propose a three-stage-cascading interpolation design solution. In the first stage, a two-output voltage selector selects adjacent voltages from the global resistor string. The proposed overlap-switch merging (OSM) technique reduces its size by two times compared to conventional two-output selectors. The second-stage interpolation employs a successive-approximation-register (SAR)-interpolating switched-capacitor (SI-SC) DAC, enhanced with bit-adaptive switch-size (BASS) modulation to minimize the switching errors. The proposed SI-SC DAC also features an intrinsic two-output design for further interpolation in the subsequent stage. In the last (third) stage, a super-class-AB operational transconductance amplifier (OTA)-based buffer amplifier performs accurate 1-bit true-dc interpolation with no overhead while driving the final output with a fast slew rate. The prototype chip was fabricated in a 180-nm 1.8/5-V CMOS process.

The primary block is a switched-capacitor dc&#8211;dc converter (SCC), which is reconfigured by parallelizing stages using low-voltage configuration switches. These configuration switches are connected between internally generated dc nodes that do not swing at the SCC switching frequency, thereby avoiding the periodic charging of the corresponding drain capacitances. An efficient pre-charging technique enables this SCC into the ac&#8211;dc converter without breaking down its low-voltage components. In addition to the SCC, a linear regulator is incorporated into the ac&#8211;dc converter, resulting in a  $2\times $  smaller capacitance to buffer the zero crossing. The design also features compact drivers and an efficient resettable capacitive voltage divider for input sensing. The measured power density is 9  $\mathrm { \text {mW/mm}^{{2}}}$  at 55.1% efficiency, advancing the power density of fully integrated state-of-the-art ac&#8211;dc converters by  ${ &gt; }5000\times $ .</description></item><item><title>An Outphase-Interleaved Switched-Capacitor Hybrid Buck Converter With Relieved Capacitor Inrush Current and COUT-Free Operations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10384704</link><description>This article presents an efficient buck converter design using the proposed outphase-interleaved hybrid switched-capacitor (OISC) topology. The outphase-interleaved switched-capacitor (SC) cells significantly extend the  $C_{\mathrm {F}}$  charge-balancing phase without disturbing the inductor volt-second balance (VSB), while doubling the effective inductor switching frequency for reduced current ripple. As a result, it addresses the intrinsic issue of sharply increased flying capacitor ( $C_{\mathrm {F}}$ ) inrush current in existing SC dual-/multi-path (DP/MP) hybrid buck converters under extreme duty ratios, resolving the tradeoff between SC cell conduction loss and inductor dc current ( $I_{L,\mathrm {dc}}$ ) reduction capability. The proposed topology attains three key advantages: 1) relived  $C_{\mathrm {F}}$  hard-charging-induced inrush current; 2) reduced  $I_{L,\mathrm {dc}}$ ; and 3) power stage normal operation without relying on an output capacitor  $(C_{\mathrm {OUT}})$ , resulting in improved conversion efficiency and power density. To enhance the overall power density and mitigate gate-driving path ringing, we propose an area-efficient fully ON-chip gate-driving scheme with a shared charge pump (CP), ensuring proper operations with all-NMOS power switches. Fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS process with 7.63 mm2 chip area, the converter achieves a peak conversion efficiency of 97.3% and an overall peak current density of 585 mA/mm3 at 90.1% efficiency. Supporting a load current ( $I_{\mathrm {LOAD}}$ ) from 0.05 to 3.1 A, it converts 1.8&#8211;3.3 V input to 0.8&#8211;1.8 V output.

The system enables a novel experiment in which swimming rats navigate a water maze guided exclusively by neural stimulation. The system consists of two wirelessly linked application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs): a bidirectional neural interface and an animal-tracking image sensor. The neural interface ASIC features a novel stimulator design with adaptive termination-based charge-balancing and an energy-efficient neural recording front end that rejects stimulation artifacts. The animal-tracking image sensor extracts the swimming features of rats and maps them into stimulation parameters with hardware acceleration. Low-power ultra-wideband transceivers with a custom protocol have been developed to ensure reliable wireless communication between devices with a short latency, which is critical to closed-loop neuromodulation. Wireless power transfer and near-field data communication have been developed to allow a part of the neural interface to be implanted beneath the skin, eliminating the need for through-skin connectors. Both ASICs were fabricated using 180-nm CMOS technology, fully characterized on the bench, and have been successfully used in animal experiments. Through rigorous testing, the system demonstrated consistent success in guiding multiple rats through the water maze using only stimulation.

The ISR-ACT&#8217;s transmitter (TX) sends non-return-to-zero (NRZ) data through a small series capacitor to inject low-swing pulses into the line. These pulses are amplified and latched by a two-stage receiver (RX), where the 1st-stage transimpedance amplifier (TIA) amplifies the pulse data and positive feedback around both stages captures the data and maintains the dc level on the line. Achieving low signal swing through a capacitor divider, the ACT driver consumes less than half the power compared to regular rail-to-rail CMOS drivers while providing dc voltage isolation between the driver and the RX.

However, at low frequencies ( $\leq $ 10 MHz), their performance is limited by the 1/ ${f}$  noise generated by the near-minimum size devices used in their wide-bandwidth input stages. This, in turn, limits their use in radio receivers intended to cover both the AM and FM bands.

The proposed FD radio features broadband SI suppression, cancellers calibrated for enhanced linearity, and the ability to cancel long-delay spread SI. A prototype chip is fabricated in a Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company&#8217;s (TSMC) 40-nm CMOS process and works with a Xilinx RFSoC evaluation kit to complete the calibration loop for the radio analog front end (AFE). The FD AFE chip integrates an electrical-balanced duplexer (EBD) with a tuned impedance matching network ( ${Z}$ Bal), two broadband five complex-tap continuous-time finite impulse response (FIR)-based RF cancellation filters, and a mixed-signal baseband cancellation path operating with a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to complete a long-delay spread ( $\tau =+174$  ns) SI canceller. A fourth-order  ${Z}$ Bal is employed to reduce SI group delay and improves the cancellation bandwidth (BW) when used with complex filters. This work reports a measured SI suppression of 62 dB across +120-MHz BW for delay spreads between 0 and 0.28 ns and SI cancellation of 23 dB across +120-MHz BW for delay spreads between 0.4 and 174 ns.

In addition, it eliminated a single-to-differential amplifier (S2D) and amplifying stage from the analog front-end (AFE). The RS DFE extended the sampling margin without a current source for power saving without bandwidth reduction of the data path. A faster DFE loop delay was achieved with direct feedback from the comparator output to the RS MUX. The proposed receiver is the first work to employ the single-ended CTLE and DFE simultaneously.

The proposed ADC has a 1st order  $\Delta \Sigma $  ADC structure with a 1st-order loop filter and a quantizer. The loop filter consists of a passive lossy integrator, which is OTA-free, energy-efficient, and provides a 1st order noise shaping. The proposed VCO-FDSM as a quantizer also realizes additional 1st order noise shaping. Therefore, the overall structure has 2nd order noise shaping property. The proposed VCO-FDSM employs a linear VCO with negative feedback to improve the linearity. The VCO output frequency is quantized into a multi-bit thermometer digital output code with inherent dynamic element matching (DEM) property by the fully digital FDSM. The FDSM output having DEM property mitigates the mismatch error of the capacitive digital-to-analog converter (CDAC). This highly digital architecture facilitates a trade-off between the supply voltage and the operational bandwidth (BW), which makes the ADC suitable for energy-efficient IoT applications. The test chip fabricated in 65nm standard CMOS technology operates at wide supply voltages ranging from 0.6 V to 1.2 V with a bandwidth range from 1.25 kHz to 5 kHz.

The proposed DMCG combines a dual-path front end and an improved selecting signal generator that addresses the potential phase error and reduces the peak current of the clock-driving circuits by 60%. The DS is proposed to serialize the digital outputs without employing power-hungry inverter-based buffer chains thus reducing the power consumption by 39.2%. The reference-free time skew extraction algorithm (RFA) is presented to mitigate the accuracy deterioration due to selecting the fixed middle channel. These techniques are validated by a prototype 12-bit 10-GS/s TI pipelined successive approximation register (TI-Pi-SAR) ADC. Fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process, the prototype chip occupies an area of 4.4 mm2. The measurement results show that the ADC achieves a 49.8 dB SNDR and 60.0 dB SFDR after calibration at Nyquist frequency, while the total power consumption is 270 mW, leading to the figure of merits of Schreier (FoM $_{\mathrm {S}}$ ) and Walden (FoM $_{\mathrm {W}}$ ) of 152.5 dB and 106.9 fJ/conv.-step, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Inverse Modelling Techniques as Dynamic Digital Pre-Distortion for Broadband Systems for CS-DACs Based on Volterra Series Expansion</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433893</link><description>This paper presents a dynamic digital pre-distortion (DPD) method for a current-steering digital-to-analog converter (CS-DAC). The novel proposed method is based on the inverse modelling of the system with a Volterra series expansion. It uses a memory structure often only used for DPD in power amplifiers (PA). The goal is to find a model to counteract the signal dependent non-linearities of charge injection from the switching activity of the converter with a limited parameter count. A priori knowledge of the non-linear behavior and architecture of the DAC is exploited. The proposed Volterra system consists of a first and third order kernel with a respective memory depth of one. This results in a total number of only 6 parameters that need to be estimated. This is sufficient to significantly attenuate the non-linear distortions and efficient in terms of memory usage and computational complexity. The paper compares three different methods for generating the inverse of the Volterra system and determines the performance difference between them. The evaluation of the proposed DPD is done via Spice simulations of a 14-bit CS-DAC using a lumped circuit model and Spectre simulations of a real 14-bit 16 nm DAC design. Narrow-band and broad-band discrete multi-tone (DMT) signals with a frequency of up to 684 MHz are considered. The results show a performance gain of the missing-tone-power-ratio (MTPR) of up to 8.4 dB for both model-based and circuit-based simulations based analysis, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A 20.3&#956;W 1.9G&#937; Input Impedance Capacitively-Coupled Chopper-Stabilized Amplifier for Bio-Potential Readout</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10404074</link><description>This paper presents a low-power chopper-stabilized capacitively-coupled frontend amplifier with auxiliary-path-based input impedance ( ${Z} _{\mathbf {in}}$ ) boosting. In order to achieve a high  ${Z} _{\mathbf {in}}$ , a low noise and a small chip area, techniques on both system level and circuit level are implemented. On the system level, small capacitors ( ${C} _{\mathbf {in}}$  = 0.5 pF,  ${C} _{\mathbf {fb}}$  = 25 fF) are used with a biased pseudo-resistor ( ${R}$  = 2.5  $\text{G}\Omega $ ) fed back to an amplifier internal node. As a result, a high achievable  ${Z} _{\mathbf {in}}$  and low high-pass corner frequency are achieved. On the circuit level, an input capacitance shielded current feedback (CSCF) topology achieving effective 10 fF  ${C} _{\mathbf {amp}}$  is proposed as the core of the capacitive feedback amplifier in order not to increase the input noise. Moreover, the design space of auxiliary-path-based boosting is explored to obtain the optimal value of buffer bandwidth and auxiliary capacitor size to save power. The amplifier and its  ${Z} _{\mathbf {in}}$  boosting circuit are implemented in a standard 55 nm CMOS process and characterized experimentally. Measurement results show that the proposed amplifier provides an input noise density of 50 nV/ $\surd $  Hz, and an integrated noise of  $0.85~\mu $  Vrms in 200 Hz band. The  ${Z} _{\mathbf {in}}$  is boosted to 1.92  $\text{G}\Omega $  at DC and 1.02  $\text{G}\Omega $  at 50 Hz with only  $1.0~\mu \text{A}$  in each auxiliary path buffer. The amplifier also archives 77 dB CMRR and 76 dB PSRR while consuming  $20.3~\mu \text{W}$  in total.</description></item><item><title>A 1.8&#8211;5.4-GHz GaN MMIC Distributed Efficient Power Amplifier With Reactance Compensation and Adaptive Biasing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10416812</link><description>This article presents an ultra-broadband distributed efficient power amplifier (DEPA) with reactance compensation and adaptive biasing. It is illustrated that the bandwidth of the DEPA can be improved apparently by applying a shunt short-circuited stub at the combining point. The principle of such method is that the back-off impedance variation with frequency can be compensated by the reactance of the shunt stub. Besides, to get over the high gain compression of the conventional DEPA, an adaptive biasing scheme is proposed for the auxiliary PAs. A DEPA is implemented in a 0.25- $\mu \text{m}$  GaN-HEMT process for validation. The shunt stub is realized by a LC tank equivalently for a compact size. The fabricated DEPA achieves a saturated output power of 41.5&#8211;43 dBm and an 8-dB back-off drain efficiency (DE) of 38%&#8211;46.8% from 1.8 to 5.4 GHz with a chip size of  $3.2\times3.2$  mm2. The fractional bandwidth (FBW) is up to 100%. Applying a 100-MHz LTE signal with an 8.5-dB peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), an average DE of 35%&#8211;43% is measured over the entire bandwidth, and adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) is better than &#8722;47 dBc after applying digital predistortion. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed DEPA demonstrates the largest FBW among all reported integrated back-off efficient PAs without using digital techniques or reconfiguration.</description></item><item><title>A W-Band 2 &#215; 2 Phased-Array Transmitter With Digital Gain-Compensation Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10420498</link><description>In this paper, a W-band $2\times 2$  phased-array transmitter with digital gain compensation is proposed to minimize amplitude and angle errors of synthesized beams. The RF phase-shifting architecture is utilized for the phased-array transmitter to reduce circuit blocks and lower system complexity. The high-resolution phase shifting is achieved by a vector-sum phase shifter, which is based on a quadrature-all-pass filter (QAF) with compensation network and Gilbert-type variable gain amplifiers (VGAs) with digital-controlled current digital-to-analog converters (I-DACs). To lower the gain error introduced by the phase shifter in RF phase-shifting architecture, the variable-gain power amplifier (VGPA) is proposed. The gain of the VGPA is finely adjusted to compensate the gain variation of phase shifter in different phase states. Meanwhile, the phase variation of the VGPA under variable gain states is optimized to avoid the influence on phase errors. To verify the aforementioned mechanism, a W-band  $2\times 2$  phased-array transmitter is implemented and fabricated in a conventional 40-nm CMOS technology. Based on the digital gain-compensation technique, the phased-array transmitter exhibits a less than 1.12dB RMS gain error and less than 1.82&#176; RMS phase error. In addition, the fabricated chip achieves 8.13dBm peak saturated output power and better than 9dB power gain with 135mW power consumption for each channel.</description></item><item><title>A 0.14-nJ/b 200-Mb/s 2.7&#8211;3.5-GHz Quasi-Balanced FSK Transceiver With PLL-Based Modulation and Sideband Energy Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10459220</link><description>This paper describes a balanced frequency shift keying (FSK) modulation, namely quasi-balanced FSK (QB-FSK), for energy-efficient high-data-rate communication. Not suffering from data-pattern dependency, the proposed modulation method enables frequency modulation (FM) over 100 Mb/s by utilizing a wideband phase-locked loop (PLL). The QB-FSK signal is generated with the same baseband clock frequency as the non-return zero (NRZ)-coded binary FSK (BFSK) signal, resulting in improved bandwidth efficiency compared to other balanced FSK signals. For demodulation, the receiver employs a sideband energy detection (SB-ED) method. A FM discriminator converts the QB-FSK signal to an on-off keying (OOK) signal. After that, a band-pass filter (BPF) is used to filter out 1/f noise and dc offset. Based on the proposed QB-FSK modulation and the SB-ED method, a prototype FSK transceiver is implemented in 65-nm CMOS for high-data-rate sub-6-GHz proprietary wireless connectivity. The receiver successfully demodulates data at a rate of 200 Mb/s with a sensitivity of &#8211;67 dBm, while the transmitter can achieve a maximum data rate of 400 Mb/s. The 200-Mb/s transceiver achieves an energy efficiency of 0.14 nJ/b.</description></item><item><title>A 1&#8211;8b Reconfigurable Digital SRAM Compute-in-Memory Macro for Processing Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10417860</link><description>This work presents a 1-8b reconfigurable digital SRAM compute-in-memory (CIM) macro, which significantly improves array utilization and energy efficiency under different input and weight configurations compared to previous works. To ensure the array utilization under different configurations, a row-based bitwise-summation-first digital CIM architecture is proposed. In addition, to realize flexible switching between signed and unsigned operations, a complete 2&#8217;s complement encoding method is adopted, which makes the computation of the sign bits consistent with that of the magnitude bits when performing signed operations, thus ensuring that each row of the CIM array can store the sign of the weight. Due to the support of reconfigurable bit width, the proposed CIM macro can be widely used in various neural networks for optimal efficiency. In order to better apply the CIM macro to binarized neural networks, a configurable bitwise multiplier is presented, which supports both AND and XNOR operations. Moreover, since the power consumption of the adder tree occupies a major part of the digital CIM macro, a 4&#8211;2 compressor based adder tree is presented to further improve the energy efficiency. Measurement results based on 55nm CMOS process show that the proposed CIM macro achieves an energy efficiency of up to 2238TOPS/W at 1b/1b and 44.82TOPS/W at 4b/4b MAC operations.</description></item><item><title>A Heterogeneous Platform for 3D NAND-Based In-Memory Hyperdimensional Computing Engine for Genome Sequencing Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10440648</link><description>Hyperdimensional (HD) computing is a promising paradigm for large-scale genome sequencing.

NVMs such as ReRAM have been widely used in CIM. Meanwhile, MRAM has higher read and write cycles, lower device and cycle variation and a lower bit error rate, making it equally attractive for storage. However, the high read current and low on/off ratio result in large energy consumption in MRAM read limiting its large-scale application in CIM. The spiking neural network (SNN) represents the information as sparse spike sequences and facilitates hardware to achieve low-power computing by taking advantage of its spatial-temporal sparsity. To further increase the input sparsity of SNN and reduce the read energy consumption, this paper proposes ADC-free, dual-spike (DS) -CIM macro, a spiking MRAM CIM macro driven by asynchronous dual spikes. Compared to the conventional rate coding, our dual-spike coding method uses only 2 spikes to encode the information without losing accuracy. Moreover, the event-driven feature allows the macro to have sub-nW static power consumption. Our DS-CIM macro achieves comparable or higher accuracy while maintaining very low energy consumption. Specifically, it achieves accuracies of 96.99%, 82.87%, 90.00%, and 85.97% for digit classification, image classification, gesture recognition, and action recognition tasks, with energy consumption of only 8.07nJ, 71.26nJ, 729.3nJ, and 369.82nJ, respectively. These results emphasize the significance of DS-CIM and provide ideas for low-power inference on edge devices.</description></item><item><title>Variation Aware Evaluation Approach and Design Methodology for SOT-MRAM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10437994</link><description>Spin-orbit torque magnetic random access memory (SOT-MRAM), which exhibits sub-nanosecond write speed and high reliability, is a promising candidate for the future high-level cache. However, SOT-MRAM faces the problem of large bit-cell layout area due to its structural characteristics and write performance requirements, therefore it is necessary to explore the bit-cell design with optimal overall performance under the unified bit-cell area. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive variation aware evaluation approach for the area, latency, and energy of SOT-MRAM under the uniform yield standard. Based on this, the mainstream SOT-MRAM bit-cell designs with high-density method and multi-finger configuration are evaluated, meanwhile bit-cell designs with excellent write performance and their optimum area ranges are identified. Moreover, the source line read (SLR) mode with higher robustness against transistor variation is proposed to improve the read performance, and the dual SL (DSL) method is proposed to further reduce the read latency and write energy. With the DSL method, the read latency and write energy of 2-word-line (WL)-type bit-cells can be reduced by up to 36.5% and 12.6%, respectively. In addition, the DSL method can solve the shunt current issue of 1WL-type bit-cells and reduce the read latency and write energy by up to 43.6% and 17.4%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>DQ-STP: An Efficient Sparse On-Device Training Processor Based on Low-Rank Decomposition and Quantization for DNN</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443594</link><description>Due to the bottleneck problems such as scenario-varying application, significant data communication overhead and privacy protection between off-line training and on-line inference, intelligent edge devices capable of adaptively fine-tuning the deep neural network (DNN) models for specific tasks have become the most urgent need. However, the computational cost is intolerable for ordinary on-device training (ODT), which inspires us to explore an efficient ODT processor, named DQ-STP. In this paper, we leverage a series of optimization techniques using software-hardware co-design. On the one hand, the proposed design incorporates SVD-based low-rank decomposition,  $2^{n}$  quantization and ACBN algorithm on the software side. This unifies the sparse computing mode of convolutional layers and enhancing weight sparsity. On the other hand, the proposed design effectively leverages data sparsity on the hardware side through four techniques: 1) The flag compressed sparse row is proposed to compress input feature maps and gradient maps. 2) A unified processing element (PE) array comprising shifters and adders is proposed to expedite forward and error propagation steps. 3) The PE arrays for error propagation and weight gradients generation are separated to enhance throughput. 4) A sparse alignment strategy is proposed to further enhance PE utilization. Through these software and hardware co-optimization, the proposed DQ-STP achieves an area efficiency and peak energy efficiency of 41.2 GOPS/mm2 and 90.63 TOPS/W.

Various neural networks have demonstrated excellent image-reconstruction quality in SR accelerators. However, deploying SR networks on edge devices is limited by resources and power consumption induced by significant algorithm parameters, computation complexity, and external memory accesses. This work explores the hardware algorithm co-design techniques to provide an end-to-end platform with a lightweight super-resolution network (LSR) and an efficient, high-quality SR accelerator HDSuper. For algorithm design, the improved depth-wise separable convolution and pixelshuffle layers are developed to reduce network size and computation complexity by considering the hardware constraints. Also, the improved channel attention (CA) blocks enhance the image reconstruction quality. For hardware accelerator design, we design a unified computing core (UCC) combined with an efficient flattening-and-allocation (F-A) mapping strategy to support various operators with high computational utilization. In addition, we design the patch computing scheme to reduce the external memory access of the hardware architecture. Based on the evaluation, the proposed algorithm achieves high-quality image reconstruction with  $37.44dB$  PSNR. Finally, the FPGA demonstration and ASIC layout under UMC 55nm are achieved with low power consumption ( $2.08 W$  and  $152 mW$ ) under the lowest hardware resources compared to the state-of-the-art works.</description></item><item><title>ESSR: An 8K@30FPS Super-Resolution Accelerator With Edge Selective Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10388489</link><description>Deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) is challenging to implement in resource-constrained edge devices for resolutions beyond full HD due to its high computational complexity and memory bandwidth requirements. This paper introduces an 8K@30FPS SR accelerator with edge-selective dynamic input processing. Dynamic processing chooses the appropriate subnets for different patches based on simple input edge criteria, achieving a 50% MAC reduction with only a 0.1dB PSNR decrease. The quality of reconstruction images is guaranteed and maximized its potential with resource adaptive model switching even under resource constraints. In conjunction with hardware-specific refinements, the model size is reduced by 84% to 51K, but with a decrease of less than 0.6dB PSNR. Additionally, to support dynamic processing with high utilization, this design incorporates a configurable group of layer mapping that synergizes with the structure-friendly fusion block, resulting in 77% hardware utilization and up to 79% reduction in feature SRAM access.

Computing-in-memory (CIM) architectures provide high parallel and energy-efficient solutions to accelerate the multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations in neural networks (NNs). While SRAM-based charge-domain CIM is achieving thousands of TOPS/W energy efficiency, it encounters limitations when dealing with full NN model deployments where both activations and weights are signed. This paper proposes an SRAM-based signed batch normalization (BN) CIM macro for supporting efficient bitwise sparse MAC computation with signed operands and BN operations in deep neural networks. The key features of this macro encompass: 1) a multibit weight unit for the optimization of bitstream sparsity and the sign bit computation, 2) a 2b-serial input configuration to increase throughput and the ADC energy amortization, and 3) a quantization-hardware co-design for the BN implementation. Measurement results show that the proposed 28 nm 64 Kb CIM macro achieves 16.38 TOPS throughput and 4.55 POPS/W energy efficiency, both normalized to 1b operands. The test accuracy of CIFAR10 is 92%, based on the ResNet18 model with co-design BN implementation at signed-8b precision activations and weights.</description></item><item><title>RDCIM: RISC-V Supported Full-Digital Computing-in-Memory Processor With High Energy Efficiency and Low Area Overhead</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10403109</link><description>Digital computing-in-memory (DCIM) that merges computing logic into memory has been proven to be an efficient architecture for accelerating multiply-and-accumulates (MACs). However, low energy efficiency and high area overhead pose a primary restriction for integrating DCIM in re-configurable processors required for multi-functional workloads. To alleviate this dilemma, a novel RISC-V supported full-digital computing-in-memory processor (RDCIM) is designed and fabricated with 55nm CMOS technology. In RDCIM, an adding-on-memory-boundary (AOMB) scheme is adopted to improve the energy efficiency of DCIM.

The results show that the energy efficiency in our design is 16.6 TOPS/W (8-bit) and 66.3 TOPS/W (4-bit). Compared to related works, the proposed RDCIM macro shows a maximum energy efficiency improvement of  $1.22\times $  in a continuous computing scenario, an area saving of  $1.22\times $  in the accumulator, and an area saving of  $3.12\times $  in the input buffer.

While emerging non-volatile memory based analog CIM (ACIM) has been widely studied, its silicon demonstrations are in the mature legacy node (22 nm or above). As an alternative, digital CIM (DCIM) based on static random access memory (SRAM) is recently drawing significant attention, as it enjoys the scaling benefits with the logic process to the leading-edge node (5 nm or below), and does not suffer from the accuracy loss due to process/voltage/temperature (PVT) variations. To assess the potential of DCIM in the future, we release NeuroSim V1.4, a CIM benchmark framework, which supports advanced technology nodes down to 1 nm node. We project the technology parameters (standard cell, transistor and interconnect) using TCAD device simulations, interconnect modeling, and the available industry/IRDS roadmaps. State-of-the-art technology trends such as fin-depopulation, buried power rail, stacked nanosheet, etc are captured in the updated parameters. Technology scaling down to 1 nm enables DCIM to achieve 1.4 $\sim 1.8\times $  and 44.1 $\sim 63.1\times $  higher system-level figure of merit than state-of-the-art 7 nm SRAM-based ACIM and 22 nm RRAM-based ACIM, respectively, for representative workloads such as ResNet18 and ResNet34 inference.</description></item><item><title>A Memristor Emulation in 180-nm CMOS Process for Spiking Signal Generation and Chaos Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10387460</link><description>We present a new CMOS circuit and its successful fabrication of an operational transconductance amplifier (OTA)-CMOS inverter-based memristor emulator and investigate its switching behavior from 5 MHz to 50 MHz. It could be considered the first memristor emulator based on a current mode circuit and an inverter. Primarily, the transconductance of the inverter stage transforms the bias-voltage-dependent transconductance of the OTA into an overall flux-dependent memductance of the memristor. We also demonstrate how performance measures such as frequency response, noise, post-layout simulation, and process corners impact the memristive behavior of the design. The power consumption of the proposed memristor emulator is 2.25 mW. The aforementioned power figure is based on a 1.8 V power supply and calculated on a UMC 180-nm CMOS technology node. Further, using this memristor emulator, we implement a CMOS circuit for spiking signal generation called the Memristive Integrate-and-Fire (MIF) neuron circuit that mimics a biological neuron. As far as we know, a spiking signal generation using a memristor emulator remains unreported. Later on, we went on to realize a MIF neuron based object detection application to bring out the practical significance of the MIF neuron circuit.

Applications such as machine learning have a certain resilience to noisy/erroneous transmitted data. Therefore, approximate communication becomes a promising solution to improving performance by reducing traffic loads under the constraint of the acceptable maximum accuracy loss of neural networks. It is a key issue to balance the result quality and the communication delay for approximate NoC systems. The traditional approximate NoC only considers the node-to-node approximation-based dynamic traffic regulation. However, the dynamically changing traffic patterns across different nodes, different times, and different applications lead to a huge search space, which makes it hard to explore an optimal global approximation solution. In this paper, we propose a quality model for different neural networks, which presents the relationship between the quality loss and the data approximate rate. Then, a hierarchical approximate scheme optimized with reinforcement learning (HAS-RL) is proposed and we reduce the complexity of the HAS-RL by reducing the state space and action space, which will reduce the resource overhead as well. After that, we embed a global approximate controller in the NoC system, in which we deploy a policy network trained with the offline reinforcement learning algorithm to adjust the data approximate rates of each node at run time. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, the proposed scheme reduces the average network delay by 13.5% while their accuracies are similar. The proposed HAS-RL only causes an additional area overhead of 1.24% and power consumption of 0.77% compared with the traditional router design.</description></item><item><title>An Output Voltage Tracking Control Method With Overcurrent Protection Property for Disturbed DC&#8211;DC Boost Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10445021</link><description>In this paper, the output voltage tracking control of DC-DC boost converters is studied. To meet the increasing safety requirements and enhance the control system robustness, overcurrent protection and disturbance rejection are investigated simultaneously. A simple and effective control scheme is proposed to achieve all these three goals, which includes two parts. In the first part, a disturbance observer is constructed to estimate multiple disturbances (including the input voltage fluctuations and the load variations). In the second part, a composite current-constrained controller is proposed by embedding the disturbance estimates and the nonlinear penalty term into the passivity-based control law. Under the novel control scheme, rapid tracking performance and safe overcurrent protection are obtained, even in the presence of multiple disturbances. Rigorous stability analysis is conducted to demonstrate the accomplishment of the output voltage tracking task and the strict guarantee of the current constraint. Simulations and experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.</description></item><item><title>On the Damping of Ringing Affecting Power Transistors by Means of Active Gate Drivers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10418097</link><description>Fast power transistors require a tight control of their switching trajectory to exploit them at full speed, without degrading reliability and delivered electromagnetic emission figures of merit. By using active gate drivers in place of conventional ones, the switching trajectory can be shaped to reduce current and voltage overshoots, as well as the amplitude of oscillations. However, the tuning of such drivers is still an open issue. This paper investigates the damping of oscillations by means of active gate drivers, and proposes a method to tune them a-priori. The target switching waveforms are evaluated by means of non-linear damping elements in simulation, easing the tuning procedure. The proposed method was assessed on a digital active gate driver, providing the initial set-point for the adaptive controller. The convergence time measured experimentally was found to be as low as  $\mathrm {50~ \mu \text {s} }$  for the overall load current range, whilst not affecting the conversion efficiency of the dc-dc converter exploited as test case.</description></item><item><title>A Switched Capacitor Modified Fibonacci Cell Used for a DC&#8211;AC Circuit Supplied by Solar Energy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10403844</link><description>A Fibonacci-type switched-capacitor (SC) cell is modified in order to be suitable for an innovative, breakthrough switched-capacitor multilevel inverter (SCMLI) fitted for photovoltaics powered systems. Characteristic to such a cell, its capacitor voltages follow a Fibonacci series. Thus, with only a very few capacitors, a very large step-up of the input voltage is realized; and the staircase output waveform of a Modified Fibonacci - based inverter would feature a very large number of levels, being very close to a sinusoid. Such an inverter is necessary if its front-end is a green source of energy which provides only a relative low voltage. A common line-load ground two-output SC-based multilevel inverter is then developed, analyzed and designed. This inverter can feed two loads without interference with each other. The common ground (CG) effectively stops the leakage current of the solar cells. In order to get the same voltage step-up and the same number of levels as in a no-common ground inverter with the same structure, the Modified SC Fibonacci circuit is reinvented, by dividing it into two sub-networks, each one with another function. One of them together with the input source supply the positive half-sinusoids voltages of both outputs, thus assuring a permanent non-zero input current, as required by the front-end environmental-friendly sources of energy. The other SC sub-network supplies the negative half-sinusoids to both loads. The novel CG-SCMLI contains the smallest number of components per output among all the common ground SCMLIs able to provide the same number of levels in the output staircase waveform. The idea was implemented on a 400W 15-levels inverter providing two outputs of 220V rms, of a very small total harmonic distortion of 5.2%.</description></item><item><title>Setting Up the State Equations of Switched Circuits Using Homogeneous Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10391066</link><description>This paper discusses a new modeling framework for switched circuits. The core idea is to avoid the distinction between the topologies defined by the short- and open-circuits corresponding to the on- and off-states of each ideal switch. We treat both cases in a uniform manner by describing Ohm&#8217;s law in terms of a single variable  $u$ , via the relations  $i=pu$ ,  $v=qu$ . The parameters  $p$  and  $q$  describe the state of the switch, either ideal or nonideal. An ideal switch is described by the values  $p= p_{\mathrm{ on}}=1$ ,  $q= q_{\mathrm{ on}}=0$  in the on-state and  $p= p_{\mathrm{ off}}=0$ ,  $q= q_{\mathrm{ off}}=1$  in the off-state, whereas nonideal switches are described by nonzero values of  $q_{\mathrm{ on}}$  and/or  $p_{\mathrm{ off}}$ . Regardless of the number of switches, all working states of a given circuit can be described by means of a single model which, in essence, may be set up by conventional methods. This avoids the need to draw different schematics and write down a variety of models depending on the state of each switch, as it is almost invariably done when modeling switched circuits. We use this framework to address the state-space formulation problem for switched circuits. The results are then applied to the analysis of several DC-DC power converters and a multilevel inverter.</description></item><item><title>A 521pW, 0.016%/V Line Sensitivity Self-Biased CMOS Voltage Reference With DIBL Effect Compensation Using Adaptive VGS Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10302323</link><description>This brief proposes an ultra-low-power self-biased CMOS voltage reference (SBCVR) with the drain-induced-barrier-lowering (DIBL) effect compensation to improve the line sensitivity (LS) and low-frequency power supply rejection ratio (PSRR). To reduce the dependence of bias current  $(I_{\mathrm{ B}})$  on the supply voltage  $(V_{\mathrm{ DD}})$  owing to the DIBL effect, the gate-source voltage  $(V_{\mathrm{ GS}})$  of biasing transistor is adaptively regulated by  $V_{\mathrm{ DD}}$ . In this way, the DIBL effect compensation is achieved, while the  $I_{\mathrm{ B}}$  is almost immune to  $V_{\mathrm{ DD}}$ . The presented SBCVR is fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu \text{m}$  CMOS process, while 18 samples have been measured. The results show that its average LS reaches 0.016%/V and has been decreased by almost 85% compared to the one without the DIBL effect compensation. The design can also achieve a PSRR of &#8722;62.5dB at 10Hz. Meanwhile, the average reference voltage  $(V_{\mathrm{ REF}})$  is 317.6mV with a variation of 0.52%  $\sigma /\mu $ . The average temperature coefficient (TC) is 86.6 ppm/&#176;C without trimming from 0&#176;C to 100&#176;C, and the minimum power consumption at 27&#176;C is 521pW. The area of the reported SBCVR with the DIBL effect compensation is only 0.0016mm2.</description></item><item><title>A Fast Transient LDO Regulator Featuring High PSRR Over 100-kHz Frequency Range With Adaptive, Dynamic Biasing, and Current Mode Feed-Forward Amplifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304368</link><description>This brief presents a fast transient LDO with high power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) over 100-kHz based on adaptive biasing, dynamic biasing technique and a current mode feed-forward amplifier (CMFFA). The dynamic biasing improves the load transient response and the adaptive biasing benefits the loop stability. The CMFFA introduces a left-half-plane zero to compensate for the non-dominant pole without large current consumption. Moreover, a impedance adaptive circuit is also used in this design: it ensures the DC gain and pushes a non-dominant pole to high frequency. Through these methods, the proposed LDO is stable over full load range, from 0mA to 150mA, it achieves fast transient response and high PSRR with a low quiescent current. The LDO is fabricated in a 0.6-  $\mu $  m CMOS technology. The output voltage can be regulated from 1.8V to 3.3V and the load capacitance is 1  $\mu $  F. For a 150mA load step and a 3.3V output voltage, the maximum undershoot voltage is 38.6mV. At maximum load condition, a 41dB PSRR is achieved at 100-kHz and the loop gain bandwidth product is 1.9MHz. The DC gain is around 70dB over the full load range. The measured load regulation and line regulation are 0.06mV/mA and 1mV/V, respectively. The LDO has a minimum quiescent current of 9.6  $\mu $  A without load. Finally, the proposed LDO achieves a FOM1 of 16.47ps and a FOM2 of 123.52  $\mu $  V.</description></item><item><title>Input-Independent Array Compensation in Memristor-Arrays-Based Neuromorphic Systems for Input Resistance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10306331</link><description>Neuromorphic systems using memristors as artificial synapses have attracted widespread interest for low-power consumption and low-latency computing applications. However, networks based on the paradox of limited sources and progressively larger array sizes are affected by non-ideal effects, such as input resistance problems due to matrix switches. During vector array multiplication, the input resistance leads to great distortion of the out current and significant degradation of the network performance. Here, an input-independent array compensation (IAC) method for the input resistance effect is proposed, which only require a few known parameters (memristor column average conductance, array size, input resistance) independent of the input information to effectively solves current distortion problems. The simulation and experiment results demonstrate that the current distortion problem can be successfully mitigated and the accuracy of the network computing can be effectively restored by using the proposed IAC method. These results provide a feasible approach for the precise implementation of the neuromorphic system based on memristor arrays.</description></item><item><title>A 480 mVpp Linear Input Range, Low Noise Transconductance Cell for Multi-Input Sensor Interface</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10306268</link><description>This brief proposes a high-linear transconductance cell based on parallel source degeneration and differential flipped voltage followers (FVFs) with balance resistors.

By reconfiguring the transfer function of the SOR with the clock signal, the proposed method achieves ELD compensation, resulting in improved power and area efficiency, as well as enhanced immunity to non-idealities. The proposed SDM is implemented using a single amplifier to realize a third-order resonator, and it employs a single feedback digital-to-analog converter using the proposed TDS ELD compensation method.

Higher order sinc decimation filters are constructed with tap coefficients that have a non-constant change in weight versus time. The magnitude of the chopped offset voltage being processed by the decimation filter does not vary with time. As a result, the chopped offset voltage can yield a time varying residual error that changes in magnitude as a function of the chopping clock phase relative to the start time of the decimation filter and data conversion. Simulation and hardware experiments have been created to help quantify the relationship between the residual offset error magnitude and chopping phase alignment. A 16-bit second order  $\Delta \Sigma $  ADC has been fabricated in a 130 nm technology that utilizes integrator amplifier chopping to reduce the converter offset voltage. The ADC includes a non-interleaved compact third order sinc filter suitable for low cost measurement applications that demonstrates the impact of partial offset cancellation. The results show how to optimize the residual offset error by adjusting the amplifier chopping speed relative to the conversion speed.</description></item><item><title>A Variation-Tolerant Voltage-Mode Transmitter With 3+1 Tap FFE in 28-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10318210</link><description>In this brief, we introduce a voltage-mode transmitter (TX) equipped with a 3+1 tap feed-forward equalizer (FFE).

Its key highlight is the in-sensitivity to the input-referred offset of the error amplifier. This is advantageous compared to the prior work with high  $3\sigma $ -accuracy. In the prior work, the offset of error amplifier affects not only the PTAT current but also the CTAT current. This makes it necessary to greatly reduce the offset of error amplifier, leading to a huge area and power consumption. By contrast, this work proposes a new automatic current-controlled feedback loop, which greatly reduces the influence of the error amplifier offset on the BGR accuracy. As a result, the error amplifier no longer needs to consume large area or power in order to reduce its offset. This effectively reduces the area and power of the entire BGR circuit. For a fair comparison, both the prior work and this work are designed under the same  $0.13~\mu \text{m}$  CMOS process. Post-layout simulation results show that the power of the error amplifier is reduced by about 9 times when compared to the prior work. Furthermore, the total power of the proposed BGR circuit is also reduced by 2.5 times than the prior work.</description></item><item><title>CBRAM-Based Bio-Inspired Circuit for the Emulation and Treatment of the Parkinson&#8217;s Disease</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10342760</link><description>In recent years, the intrinsic neuromorphic properties of memristor devices have led to their extensive use in brain-inspired circuits and systems.

Moreover, the low throughput of the SW technology (caused by its high latency) can be enhanced by wavepipelining which is supported inherently by the SW under the two modes. Therefore, we propose wavepipelined SW based two cascaded Majority gates (SWMGs) circuit and validate it by means of micromagnetic simulations working under CMO and PMO. Our evaluation results indicate that PMO SWMGs circuit consumes 6.7x less energy than CMO SWMGs circuit. In addition, the evaluation shows that the wavepipelined PMO and CMO SWMGs circuit have the same throughput, while they are better than the non-wavepipelined circuit by 2x.</description></item><item><title>A High Dynamic Range Envelop Detector for Heterodyne Receiver Architecture</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304392</link><description>Energy detection (ED) has been of interest for various applications ranging from very low frequency biomedical signal read-out to high frequency wireless communication. The analog implementation of the ED requires circuits with a non-linear transfer characteristics which can be obtained through squaring or rectification.

The power stage of the PA consists of one common-source (CS) and two common-gate (CG) stages. The CS and the first CG stages were designed as stacked structure. In order to minimize the influence of parasitic inductance caused by the power transistor, an optimization method of the gate capacitor of the CG stage was proposed.

Due to the positive feedback path attributed to the complexity of the three-stacked power stage layout, typical capacitive neutralization techniques alone are insufficient to achieve high gain and stability at the same time. To solve this problem, we proposed an LC shunt-feedback technique that can alleviate performance degradation caused by parasitic inductance in the gate node of a power transistor. We designed a PA using a 65-nm RFCMOS process to verify the utility of the proposed structure.

The proposed FTA is composed of three functional parts, i.e., an independent amplitude-phase controlling metasurface (MS) on the top, a polarization-converter on the bottom, and a feeding antenna. Particularly, by using spatially designed amplitude on the aperture of the top MS with the specification of the Taylor distribution, much lower side-lobe levels (SLLs) could be effectively realized. The ray-tracing method is used to reduce the profile height and integrate both the feeding antenna and the polarization converter. The proposed FTA, which is fully integrated and fabricated using low-cost printed circuit board (PCB) technology, is verified by the theoretical analysis, full-wave simulation and experimental measurements of a prototype covering the entire 5G mm-wave n257 bands (26.5 to 29.5 GHz). The measured results show that the proposed FTA has a 3 dB gain bandwidth of 19% from 24.8 to 30 GHz and a peak gain of 21.08 dBi with an aperture efficiency of 18.3%. Especially, compared to traditional FTAs with phase modulations only, the proposed FTA performs an average SLLs reduction of more than 5.0 dB. The simulated and measured results coincide to confirm the feature and effectiveness of the FTA with the excellent performance.</description></item><item><title>A Modified Analog Predistorter Using Tunable Power Divider for Wideband 5G Transmitters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10352953</link><description>Advanced communication system such as 5G demands high data rate and wideband signals. These signals have a high peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR), which drives the power amplifier (PA) to early saturation. This brief proposes an analog predistortion method to linearize the power amplifier (PA) for wideband transmission systems like 5G. It utilizes a rat-race-coupler-based intermodulation generator to generate intermodulation terms, and it uses a Tunable-power divider (T-PD) based on varactor diode-controlled crossover structures to control the characteristics of the predistotered signal. This removes the dependencies on the bulky vector modulator which is frequently used in the conventional APD design. This also reduces the overall footprint. In order to validate the concept, the proposed APD with PA is tested with 64-QAM OFDM test signals of bandwidth 20 MHz and 100 MHz. It achieves a maximum improvement in the adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) and normalized mean square error (NMSE) of 23.67 dB and 18.21 dB, respectively, over that of PA. Though the components are designed at a center frequency of 3.5 GHz, the proposed method is tested in a frequency range of 3 to 3.8 GHz and provides a significant improvement in ACPR and NMSE across the entire frequency range.</description></item><item><title>Optimal IC Task Mapping to Maximize QoS on Heterogeneous Multicore Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304293</link><description>Heterogeneous multicore architectures have become one of the most widely used hardware platforms for embedded systems, where time, energy, and system QoS are the major concerns. The Imprecise Computation (IC) model splits a task into mandatory and optional parts, allowing the trade-off of the above issues. However, existing approaches, to maximize system QoS (Quality-of-Service) under time or energy constraints, use a linear function to model system QoS. Therefore, they become unsuitable for general applications, whose QoS is modeled by a concave function. To deal with this limitation, this brief addresses the Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) problem of mapping IC tasks to a set of heterogeneous cores by concurrently deciding which processor executes each task and the number of cycles of optional tasks (i.e., task allocation and scheduling), under real-time and energy supply constraints. Furthermore, as existing solution algorithms either demand high time complexity or only achieve feasible solutions, we propose a novel approach based on problem transformation and dual decomposition that finds an optimal solution while avoiding high computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves 98% performance of the optimization solver Gurobi, but only with 19.8% of its computation time.</description></item><item><title>Finite-Time Self-Triggered Stabilization for Networked Power System With Deception Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10306282</link><description>This brief investigates the finite-time self-triggered stabilization for networked power system under deception attacks.

Due to networked resource limitations and storage capacity restrictions, the exact information of their neighbors cannot be obtained by the agents. In this brief, it is supposed that the information exchanged between agents is quantized using a quantizer. By utilizing the open-loop estimation approach, an event-triggered control protocol is established, where the information communication with any connected neighbor is made discontinuously. To further reduce energy consumption, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism is designed, wherein a dynamic variable is assigned to each agent to dynamically govern its threshold. It is demonstrated that the presented control scheme can circumvent the Zeno behavior and the consensus control objective can be achieved. The validity of the theoretical analysis is manifested by the simulation results.</description></item><item><title>Deterministic Reinforcement Learning Consensus Control of Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems via Autonomous Convergence Perception</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10345763</link><description>This brief addresses an approximate optimal consensus control problem for multi-agent systems (MAS) using an autonomous perception empowered deterministic reinforcement learning scheme.

However, the low resistance of magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) results in significant power consumption in a conventional crossbar array, making it challenging to construct an efficient logic-in-memory. In this brief, we present a crossbar array of voltage-gated spin-orbit torque (SOT)-MRAM devices and establish a logic-in-memory scheme that implements majority gates in the crossbar arrays for reading operations. The multiple cells of the voltage-gated SOT-MRAM devices are connected in series, and each branch&#8217;s resistance is determined by adding the resistances of all the selected cells on it. In comparison to parallel connection schemes, the effective resistance  $({R_{eff}})$  in series connections are 25 times greater, resulting in lower read currents and improved energy efficiency. A case study of a 1-bit full adder serves as proof of the proposed logic-in-memory based on majority gates. These results indicate that the resistance summation in the voltage-gated SOT-MRAM crossbar arrays with majority gates is a preferred platform for logic-in-memory.</description></item><item><title>A New Design of Low Hardware Cost and Low Power Programmable FIR Filters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10320430</link><description>Programmable Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters (Proakis et al., 2007) are widely used in various fields such as communication, radio, audio, and signal processing.

The reliability of PUF is paramount, and therefore is one of the significant challenges for PUF design. This brief proposes a novel SRAM- and Inverter-based PUF (SI PUF) that can operate as either an SRAM PUF or an inverter PUF, depending on the input configuration signal. A zero-overhead bit configuration strategy (BCS) is proposed to enhance the reliability of PUF. Moreover, the working voltage of the sub-threshold level and the well-designed discharge stage ensure that our SI PUF can operate with low power consumption. The tested results of chips fabricated in 40-nm CMOS show that our SI PUF has only 0.0053% of the worst bit error rate (BER) under working conditions of &#8722;50 to 125&#176;C and 0.75 to 1.5V, with 0.073/0.042 pJ/bit of power consumption.

To solve it, this brief proposes a general method to optimize the aforementioned voltage stresses on the different coupler pairs simultaneously via a voltage vector triangle model. The detailed design principles involving the key parameters of compensation network are also given for four basic compensations. Besides of voltage optimization of coupler pairs, a CPT system is usually required to provide the load-independent constant current (CC) or constant voltage (CV) output under a specified power level. Therefore, the high-order compensation networks are used and analyzed to increase the design freedom of the basic four compensations and achieve controllable CC/CV output, while the voltage characteristics on the coupler pairs still remain. Finally, a 1 MHz LC-LCLC compensated CPT prototype is demonstrated and implemented with load-independent CV output, input zero-phase angle (ZPA), and voltage simultaneous optimization on all coupler pairs.</description></item><item><title>Common Ground Buck Type Five-Level Transformerless Inverter With Less Stress</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10324330</link><description>The presented brief introduces a new switched capacitor-based transformer-less inverter (SC TLI).

In contrast to the approaches available in the literature, the presented ULMFPC approach does not need the state estimation of observers and the mathematical model of the system. This method can independently cope with disruptions injected into the system. The ULMFPC considers the employed plant as a dependent system and utilizes predictive control in a constantly updated linear model to track the reference and control limitation. Unlike other predictive control methods, there is no training data set in the presented control strategy, and only small-scale convex optimization is essential for control computation. The proposed control method performance is evaluated by the Speedgoat real-time emulator and compared with the MPC and distributed economic MPC (DEMPC) methods under sensor and actuator FDI attacks. The experimental results indicate that the proposed ULMFPC technique provides much better dynamic responses compared to other methods.</description></item><item><title>Bifurcation Analysis and Criterion of Voltage Oscillation Induced by Low Voltage Ride Through Control in Renewable Energy Stations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10363634</link><description>The voltage stability issue of renewable energy stations (RES) cannot be ignored. In this brief, for the Voltage Oscillation Instability phenomenon caused by the Low voltage ride through during High active power output of the RES with No faults (VOI-LHN), works on both theory and criterion are conducted. In theory, it is explained that the VOI-LHN corresponds to a High active power output and Low voltage ride through control induced Non-smooth Bifurcation (HLINB). Furthermore, based on theoretical derivation and actual power grid parameters, the boundary between HLINB and Saddle Node Bifurcation (SNB) is obtained. The boundary suggests that in actual power grids, wind farms are more prone to HLINB than SNB. In criterion, a criterion for the occurrence of HLINB is developed, and a threshold calculation method for the criterion is proposed.</description></item><item><title>Robust Active Noise Control: Minimum Output Variance Approach With Least Mean Lp-Norm Algorithm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10330647</link><description>The filtered-x least mean  ${\mathcal {([A-Z]+)}}_{([a-z]+)}$ -norm (FxLMP) algorithm, renowned for its widespread usage, exhibits superior performance over the filtered-x Least Mean Square (FxLMS) algorithm in impulsive noise-afflicted environments. Nevertheless, the FxLMP algorithm experiences performance degradation when confronted with nonlinearity in either the primary or secondary path. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm known as the minimum output variance filtered-s LMP (MOV-FsLMP), which effectively tackles nonlinear active noise control problems by imposing constraints on variance or power. Notably, this proposed algorithm exhibits improved convergence and stability even in impulsive noise environments, all while maintaining lower computational complexity. Extensive simulations validate the efficacy of the proposed MOV-FsLMP method, surpassing that of state-of-the-art alternatives.</description></item><item><title>Efficient 3-D Processor Array Reconfiguration Algorithms Based on Bucket Effect</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10333075</link><description>With the progressive augmentation of the density of 3-D processor arrays, some processor elements (PEs) often fail due to overload or overheating during massively parallel computing operations. Therefore, it is necessary to take effective fault-tolerant technology to ensure the reliability of the system. This article investigates an efficient reconfiguration method to construct 3-D fault-free logical subarray with more fault-free PEs and less interconnection length (interlength). First, we propose a novel method based on the barrel effect to find the bottleneck plane of 3-D processor arrays. Second, an efficient compensation strategy is proposed to replace faulty PEs on adjacent physical planes with fault-free PEs on the bottleneck planes, which leads to more fault-free PEs that can be used to construct the subarray. Then, we propose a heuristic to construct the subarray and optimize iteration redundancy to accelerate reconstruction. Finally, a heuristic optimization algorithm is proposed to reduce the interlength between PEs, which can reduce the dynamic power consumption and communication costs. In addition, we propose a more accurate method to calculate the lower bound of the interlength to better evaluate the performance of the algorithm. Simulation experiments show that, compared to the state-of-the-arts, on  $128\times 128\times 128$  host array, the utilization rate of fault-free PEs can be improved up to 15.6% and the interlength redundancy can be reduced by 78.2% for random faults. On  $64\times 64\times 64$  host array, the average improvement of the two indicators under clustered faults can reach 93.2% and 69.3%. Moreover, for all cases considered, the proposed new lower bound and reconstruction time can be reduced by an average of 18.47% and 76.13%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Silent Data Corruption in Robot Operating System: A Case for End-to-End System-Level Fault Analysis Using Autonomous UAVs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315202</link><description>Safety and resiliency are essential components of autonomous vehicles. In this research, we introduce ROSFI, the first robot operating system (ROS) resilience analysis methodology, to assess the effect of silent data corruption (SDC) on mission metrics. We use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as a case study to demonstrate that system-level parameters, such as flight time and success rate, are necessary for accurately measuring system resilience. We demonstrate that downstream ROS tasks such as planning and control are more susceptible to SDCs than the visual perception stage in the perception&#8211;planning&#8211;control (PPC) compute pipeline. This observation only becomes apparent when we consider the complete end-to-end system-level pipeline, as opposed to isolated compute kernels, as previous work does. To enhance the safety and robustness of robot systems bound by size, weight, and power (SWaP), we offer two low-overhead anomaly-based SDC detection and recovery algorithms based on Gaussian statistical models and autoencoder neural networks. Our anomaly error protection techniques are validated in numerous simulated environments. We demonstrate that the autoencoder-based technique can recover up to all failure cases in our studied scenarios with a computational overhead of no more than 0.0062%. Finally, our open-source methodology can be utilized to comprehensively test the robustness of other ROS-based applications.

With powerful multiply and accumulate (MAC) engines for matrix multiplications, these accelerators show high computing performance. However, because of limited memory resources (i.e., bandwidth and capacity), they fail to achieve optimum system performance during large batch training and inference. In this work, we propose a memory system with high on-chip capacity and bandwidth to shift the gear of AI accelerators from memory-bound to achieving system-level peak performance. We develop the memory system with design technology co-optimization (DTCO)-enabled customized spin-orbit torque (SOT)-MRAM as large on-chip memory through system technology co-optimization (STCO) and detailed characterization of the DL workloads. Our workload-aware memory system achieves  $8\times $  energy and  $9\times $  latency improvement on computer vision (CV) benchmarks in training and  $8\times $  energy and  $4.5\times $  latency improvement on natural language processing (NLP) benchmarks in training while consuming only around 50% of SRAM area at iso-capacity.</description></item><item><title>INDM: Chiplet-Based Interconnect Network and Dataflow Mapping for DNN Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10318183</link><description>Chiplet-based deep neural network (DNN) accelerator is a promising solution to balance the performance and manufacturing cost. However, different from monolithic chips, interconnect network design and architectural partitioning for multiple chiplets would result in a huge design space and make it difficult to keep scalability and high hardware utilization. Moreover, how to efficiently map DNN workloads onto multiple DRAM dies and compute dies is another major challenge. To alleviate the above issues, in this work, we propose INDM, a chiplet-based interconnect network and dataflow mapping co-optimization for DNN accelerators. First, we propose an efficient hierarchical interconnect network composed of a multiring on-die network and a cluster-based interdie network, to facilitate the data reuse and traffic pattern in DNN workloads. Second, architectural partitioning and topology exploration for chiplet-based DNN accelerators are proposed to find the optimal architecture configurations. Third, an interdie communication-aware dataflow mapping is proposed to minimize traffic congestion during DNN layer switching. We implement the proposed chiplet-based interconnect network design and dataflow mapping algorithm for a set of popular DNN models, including VGG-16, ResNet-18, DarkNet-19, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101. Experimental results show that as compared with the state-of-the-art related work, such as NN-Baton and SIMBA, our work achieves 26.00%&#8211;73.81% energy-delay-product (EDP) reduction and 26.93%&#8211;79.78% latency reduction.</description></item><item><title>Counterexample Guided Neural Network Quantization Refinement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10324349</link><description>Deploying neural networks (NNs) in low-resource domains is challenging because of their high computing, memory, and power requirements. For this reason, NNs are often quantized before deployment, but such an approach degrades their accuracy. Thus, we propose the counterexample-guided neural network quantization refinement (CEG4N) framework, which combines search-based quantization and equivalence checking. The former minimizes computational requirements, while the latter guarantees that the behavior of an NN does not change after quantization. We evaluate CEG4N on a diverse set of benchmarks, including large and small NNs. Our technique successfully quantizes the networks in the chosen evaluation set, while producing models with up to 163% better accuracy than state-of-the-art techniques.</description></item><item><title>Error Resilience in Deep Neural Networks Using Neuron Gradient Statistics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10324308</link><description>Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) are deployed across a wide range of applications, from medical robotics to autonomous driving, where safety and reliability are key concerns. The complexity, speed, and low-power operation of the underlying hardware makes them vulnerable to soft errors that corrupt the results of computations and memory accesses. Existing approaches to error resilience are either expensive in terms of overhead, require DNN retraining or applicable to only specific hardware domains. In contrast, we present a novel error resilience approach that does not require DNN retraining and scales across computation as well as weight parameter errors. In the proposed methodology, the statistics of gradients of neuron output values relative to adjacent neurons in an ordering of neurons allow tight theoretically grounded thresholding of neuron outputs to diagnose erroneous neuron outputs. These are then set to zero (suppressed) for error resilience. A low-overhead error diagnosis module is used for this purpose and is designed using gradient statistics collected across the training dataset of the DNN. Our approach is compared against state of the art error resilience techniques and validated on multiple datasets, networks and error scenarios as well a hardware test case.</description></item><item><title>DeltaGNN: Accelerating Graph Neural Networks on Dynamic Graphs With Delta Updating</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10324342</link><description>Graph neural network (GNN) accelerators have achieved prominent performance speedup on static graphs but fallen with inefficiency on dynamic graphs. The reason is that in dynamic graphs, updating on a few vertices will introduce enormous redundant neighbor reaggregation and feature reupdating. Moreover, evolving graph structure makes graph preprocessing impractical and incurs random memory accesses which can only be determined at runtime. In this article, we propose DeltaGNN, an algorithm and accelerator co-design for GNN acceleration on dynamic graphs. In algorithm, we first propose a delta updating algorithm, which identifies the sensitivity of vertices and reduces the aggregation and updating operations of insensitive vertices without accuracy compromise. In hardware, we propose a novel sensitivity remapping cache to satisfy the dissimilar reusability of vertices under different sensitivity without preprocessing requirement. To tackle the workload imbalance, we implement feature-disperse execution to support different feature updating between sensitive and insensitive vertices. Moreover, we introduce vertex feature coalescing to reduce the amount of feature vectors by exploiting the locality within vertex accesses. We then propose lightweight yet effective hardware optimizations to make our design applicable to conventional GNN accelerators. Compared to the state-of-the-art GNN accelerators, our DeltaGNN gains an average of  $1.5\times $ &#8211; $11.8\times $  speedup and  $1.3\times $ &#8211; $8.6\times $  energy efficiency improvement on dynamic graphs.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Processing of MLPerf Mobile Workloads Using Digital Compute-In-Memory Macros</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10318181</link><description>Compute-in-memory (CIM) has recently emerged as a promising design paradigm to accelerate deep neural network (DNN) processing. Continuously better energy and area efficiency at the macrolevel had been reported through many testchips over the last few years. However, in those macro design-oriented studies, accelerator-level considerations, such as memory accesses and processing of entire DNN workloads have not been investigated in-depth. In this article, we aim to fill this gap starting with the characteristics of our latest CIM macro fabricated with cutting-edge FinFET CMOS technology at 4-nm node. We then study, through an accelerator simulator developed in-house, three key items that would determine the efficiency of our CIM macro in the accelerator context while running MLPerf Mobile suite: 1) dataflow optimization; 2) optimal selection of CIM macro dimensions to further improve macro utilization; and 3) optimal combination of multiple CIM macros. Although there is typically a stark contrast between macro-level peak and accelerator-level average throughput and energy efficiency, the aforementioned optimizations are shown to improve the macro utilization by  $3.04\times $  and reduce the energy-delay product (EDP) to  $0.34\times $  compared to the original macro on MLPerf Mobile inference workloads. While we exploit a digital CIM macro in this study, the findings and proposed methods remain valid for other types of CIM (such as analog CIM and analog&#8211;digital&#8211;hybrid CIM) as well.</description></item><item><title>PROBE3.0: A Systematic Framework for Design-Technology Pathfinding With Improved Design Enablement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10322780</link><description>We propose a systematic framework to conduct design-technology pathfinding for power, performance, area, and cost (PPAC) in advanced nodes. Our goal is to provide a configurable, scalable generation of process design kit (PDK) and standard-cell library, spanning key scaling boosters (backside PDN and buried power rail), to explore PPAC across given technology and design parameters. We build on Cheng et al. (2022), which addressed only area and cost (AC), to include power and performance (PP) evaluations through automated generation of full design enablements. We also improve the use of artificial designs in the PPAC assessment of technology and design configurations. We generate more realistic artificial designs by applying a machine learning-based parameter tuning flow to Kim et al. (2022). We further employ clustering-based cell width-regularized placements at the core of routability assessment, enabling more realistic placement utilization and improved experimental efficiency. We evaluate PPAC across scaling boosters and artificial designs in a predictive technology node.</description></item><item><title>Hardware Constructions for Error Detection in WG-29 Stream Cipher Benchmarked on FPGA</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10335912</link><description>WG-29 is a Welch-Gong (WG) stream cipher, implemented in  $GF (2^{29})$  and an 11-stage LFSR, whose polynomial-basis (PB)-based architecture is utilized in diverse applications. This work, for the first time, presents low-cost normal signature, interleaved signature, and Hamming code-based error detection mechanisms for the hardware implementations of PB-based WG-29 stream cipher. The presented schemes are benchmarked on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware platform using Kintex-7 and Spartan-7 FPGA families for area  $(&lt; 40\%)$ , power  $(&lt; 12\%)$ , and delay  $(&lt; 10\%)$  overheads. Using a faulty module to inject stuck-at single bit and multiple bit upsets, the error coverage for these presented schemes is evaluated via simulations performed in Xilinx Vivado for 80 000 faults and shown to be over 99.99%. The overhead and error simulation results for the presented schemes show that they provide high-error coverage with acceptable overheads to make hardware constructions of WG-29 more reliable. Other WG ciphers that have similar underlying primitives can also benefit from the presented work, with slight modifications, for secure hardware implementations.</description></item></channel></rss>
