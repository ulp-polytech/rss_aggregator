This work presents a framework for quantifying passive component performance by reviewing both existing methods and robust device figures-of-merit (FOM). A comprehensive survey yields aggregated data for nearly 700 000 commercial capacitors and inductors of all types. To supplement deficiencies in this data, this work proposes and validates several empirical expressions to estimate passive component energy storage and mass. The estimation of volumetric mass density per component type allows the approximation of component mass from accessible box volume. The estimation of energy-equivalent capacitance in nonlinear Class II ceramic capacitors facilitates the evaluation of stored energy and related energy density FOM. A phenomenological analysis of the comprehensive component data produces several conclusory determinations about peak energy density capabilities&#8212;with respect to volume, mass, and cost&#8212;across capacitor and inductor technologies.</description></item><item><title>Artificial Intelligence Applications in High-Frequency Magnetic Components Design for Power Electronics Systems: An Overview</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478550</link><description>This article provides an overview of how artificial intelligence (AI) is applied in designing high-frequency magnetic components, primarily high-frequency inductors and transformers, for power electronics systems.

However, high-frequency switching can cause overshoots, oscillations, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) issues. Because of a fixed gate driving strength, the traditional gate driver struggles with the tradeoff between overshoot and switching loss (switching speed). To improve the switching performance of the SiC power devices, an active gate driver (AGD) integrated circuit is proposed using a 0.18-&#956;m CMOS HV BCD process is proposed in this article. Instead of requiring a separate programmable logic board, the controller circuits and driving stage are integrated on a chip. The proposed gate voltage sensing technique detects the slope difference of the gate voltage and generates the appropriate gate driving signals without detecting the SiC mosfet ID and VDS information. The area and cost are reduced by removing the high-voltage sensing circuit for ID and VDS detection. The proposed AGD can also attenuate the oscillations of ID and VDS, further reduce the EMI noise induced by high switching speed. In addition, the experimental results show that the proposed AGD can be applied to different SiC power mosfets.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Topology Self-Adjusted Fault Current Limiter for VSC-LVDC Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433796</link><description>The low voltage direct current (LVdc) system effectively integrates renewable energy sources and diverse dc loads. It eliminates unnecessary energy conversion steps between dc distribution units and ac grids, thereby enhancing energy efficiency. In LVdc systems, voltage source converters (VSCs) serve as vital interfaces for converting energy between ac and dc systems, however, their capability on dc fault ride-through is usually lacked. Furthermore, the existing dc circuit breakers struggle to reliably isolate faults before VSCs blocked, thereby compromising VSC safety. To address these issues, this article introduces a novel topology self-adjusted fault current limiter (NSAFCL). In normal operating mode, the impedance of NSAFCL is controlled in a parallel state, and a bias power with adaptable output is designed to bypass NSAFCL, minimizing its influence during normal operation. In fault mode, the impedance of NSAFCL is controlled in a series state, and a current limiting resistor is introduced, shaving the fault current and maintaining the fault voltage. Finally, the simulation and experiment are conducted to verify the feasibility of NSAFCL, and results demonstrate that compared to traditional schemes, the proposed NSAFCL offers extended current limitations, prevents VSC blocking, and reduces the peak fault current by 70%.</description></item><item><title>Unified Small-Signal Impedance Modeling and Analysis of Multi-Pulse Rectifier Units for More Electric Aircraft</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472071</link><description>Moving toward the more electric aircraft (MEA) technology, the power converters, which present as constant power loads (CPL), are increasingly used in the aircraft power system. The CPLs exhibit negative impedance, which may impair the system stability. Since the multipulse rectifier units (MPRUs) are the major secondary power supplies of the MEA variable-frequency ac power system (VFAC-PS), a unified small-signal impedance model of the MPRUs in the d&#8211;q frame is established. On this basis, the terminal characteristics of the MPRUs are analyzed. Then, a case study of a MPRU connected with a motor drive system is carried out to demonstrate the effects of variable-frequency of the ac voltage therein and the MDS&#8217; controller parameters on the system stability. Finally, the accuracy of the unified impedance model and the correctness of the theoretical analysis are verified by the experiments from the hardware-in-the-loop platform of the MEA VFAC-PS.</description></item><item><title>Reconfiguration of Bipolar HVDC System for Continuous Transmission Under DC Line Fault</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10479176</link><description>This article proposes a reconfiguration method for the bipolar high voltage dc transmission (HVDC) system connecting offshore wind power plants (WPPs). Conventional bipolar HVDC systems can continue to transmit half the rated power even if a dc fault occurs at one of the two poles. However, the shutdown of half of the entire WPPs is inevitable because WPPs cannot continue operations on their own. Once the WPPs are shut down, they take a long time to restart. The power transmission decreases during the time and it imposes a negative effect on the onshore ac system. The proposed reconfiguration method immediately removes the dc fault and relocates the converters and WPPs from the faulted pole to the healthy pole by disconnecting switches. Furthermore, the reconfiguration is designed based on the fault ride-through (FRT) capability of the WPPs specified by the existing grid code. As a result, the reconfiguration realizes the continuous operation of the entire WPPs even if a dc line fault occurs. Therefore, the proposed method can improve the supply reliability. The validity of the proposed method is verified by electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations.</description></item><item><title>Study of Voltage Flicker Mitigation Using Emulated Electric Arc Furnace</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478641</link><description>A strategy of the power-electronics-based emulation of the electric arc furnace (EAF) in the laboratory has been developed.

Subsequently, a fast diagnosis method for the open-circuit fault of the inverter switch tube is proposed, the method can accurately locate the fault within several switching cycles by comparing the temporal position relationship between the characteristics waveform of dc voltage and the changes of switching control signal. Finally, the feasibility and accuracy of the method are verified by experiments.</description></item><item><title>In Situ Detection of GaN $C_{\text{oss}}$ Changes Due to Aging for Device State-of-Health Determination in DC&#8211;DC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10492694</link><description>Detecting the power-device state-of-health (SOH) during converter operation can enhance the overall system reliability by predicting imminent failure scenarios. While various aging indicators for gallium nitride (GaN) devices have been demonstrated in the literature, few are practically measurable in an active converter. This article demonstrates that the large-signal device output capacitance ($C_{\text{oss}}$) is a reliable indicator of short-circuit (SC) aging, and proposes an in situ measurement technique to capture its value by leveraging the operational waveforms of soft-switching converters. The method relies only on the converter operating condition along with the switching modulation and does not require direct measurement of the inductor current. Experimental results for three different GaN devices show a 5%&#8211;10% decrease in the large-signal $C_{\text{oss}}$ after 5000 SC cycles, proving the usefulness of this parameter as an SOH indicator. The in situ measurement technique is demonstrated in a synchronous buck converter operating in discontinuous conduction mode, successfully capturing the SC-aging-induced change in $C_{\text{oss}}$. The presented results and proposed measurement technique pave the way for system-level monitoring of power-device SOH and self-calibrating operation.</description></item><item><title>Detection Method of Series Arc Fault in Three-Phase Frequency Converter Load Circuit Under Unknown Working Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10496898</link><description>Accurately detecting the series arc fault (SAF) in power lines and realizing the protection of the circuit are of great significance for effectively preventing electrical fire accidents. However, existing research results are difficult to effectively detect SAF that occurred in three-phase frequency converter load circuit under unknown working conditions. To solve the above problems, a new approach for SAF detection based on real-time training, updating prediction models and predicting residuals was proposed in this article. First, a prediction model based on dung beetle optimization algorithm optimized extreme learning machine was proposed. Second, SAF experiments in three-phase frequency converter load circuit were carried out under commercial power supply condition. The model was trained and updated by using two cycle current signals, so as to predict the next cycle current signal. The SAF detection was realized by combining the mean square error of the prediction residual and a threshold. Finally, the detection performance of the proposed method was tested under three unknown working conditions, which are different power harmonics, operating parameters of the frequency converter, and operating current, respectively. The results indicated that the proposed method can effectively detect the SAF occurred in the frequency converter load circuit under three unknown working conditions.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Comparison of Isolated High-Gain High-Voltage DC/DC Converters for Offshore Wind Farm Collection and Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375110</link><description>With the vigorous development of offshore wind energy, two-stage voltage step-up HVdc transmission has become a better choice compared with other transmission methods due to the lower cost and higher efficiency. It is essential to step-up the medium voltage (MV) level at the collection grid to the high voltage (HV) level at the export line. Therefore, the research on HV dc/dc converters has received widespread attention. This article introduces two modular multilevel dc/dc converters with high gain, HV, and galvanic isolation, which can be applied to connect the MVdc grid and HVdc grid in offshore wind energy systems. The topologies, operation principles, and control strategies of the two converters are illustrated in the article.

The operation principle and control strategy are validated by the simulation results and experiment results. The comparison results in terms of current stresses, costs, and power losses between these two converters and the two representative topologies previously proposed are presented. Then, the overall performance of each topology is evaluated based on the comparison results.</description></item><item><title>Data-Light Physics-Informed Modeling for the Modulation Optimization of a Dual-Active-Bridge Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10473116</link><description>In modulation optimization, power converter modeling is pivotal for performance evaluation. However, mainstream knowledge-based approaches suffer from low accuracy and heavy computation burden, while emerging data-driven methods are data-intensive and opaque black-box models. Even state-of-the-art physics-informed artificial intelligence (AI) is improper for modulation optimization due to resource-intensive retraining for new predictions. Hence, a physics-in-architecture recurrent neural network (PA-RNN), which customizes recurrent neurons to integrate physical laws into the structure, is proposed, tailoring for modulation optimization of power converters. The PA-RNN model reveals diverse circuit insights, exhibiting data-light merit and on-call prediction capability. Modulation optimization via PA-RNN involves two stages. First, PA-RNN constructs converter models in the time domain for direct performance evaluation. Second, an optimization algorithm interacts with the PA-RNN model to minimize current stress while realizing full-range soft switching. Two design cases are presented: first, modeling buck converters; second, optimizing dual-active-bridge converters under a triple phase-shift modulation or a five-degree-of-freedom modulation. Algorithm experiments and 1-kW hardware experiments have comprehensively validated the merits and feasibility of the proposed PA-RNN. Broadly speaking, this article strives to increase the penetration of AI in power electronics.</description></item><item><title>A Single-Switch Trans-Inverse High Step-Up Semiquadratic DC&#8211;DC Converter Based on Three-Winding Coupled Inductor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10480269</link><description>This article introduces a new nonisolated single-switch trans-inverse high step-up semiquadratic dc&#8211;dc converter with low input current ripple for renewable energy generation systems. In the presented topology, a three-winding coupled inductor combined with a quadratic boost converter to achieve high voltage gains. The advanced features of the suggested structure are its ultrahigh voltage conversion ratio, low voltage stress ratio across the switching components, low input current ripple, zero current switching of the semiconductors and also common ground between the input and output sides. Due to the trans-inverse feature in the proposed circuit, higher voltage gains can be achieved without needing large turns&#8217; ratios of the coupled inductor in comparison to the other typical quadratic converters, which decreases the conduction power loss. Furthermore, in this topology, the maximum voltage stress across the power switch is mitigated with the help of a regenerative passive clamp cell. The operating principle, steady-state analysis, theoretical efficiency analysis of the suggested circuit, along with performance comparison with other similar converters are discussed in detail. Finally, to verify the theoretical analysis, a 200 W with 25 V input voltage and 400 V output dc voltage sample prototype is established.</description></item><item><title>A New Quadratic DC/DC Converter With Ultrahigh Voltage Gain</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10493845</link><description>In this article, a new ultrahigh voltage gain coupled-inductor-based dc&#8211;dc converter is proposed for renewable energy generation systems.

The salient features of the proposed topology are its ultrahigh voltage gain, low reverse recovery in diodes, low voltage stress across switching devices, continuous input current, and common ground between the input source and output load. The integrated coupled inductor also minimizes power dissipation in magnetic components by sharing the high dc source current with another input inductor. Moreover, the proposed topology uses regenerative clamp circuits to mitigate voltage stresses across power switches operated in simultaneous switching. The theoretical analysis along with the operating principle, steady-state analysis, and the efficiency study of the proposed topology are discussed in detail. Finally, the performance of the proposed topology is verified using a 200-W, 25-V/400-V laboratory prototype.</description></item><item><title>A Multiport Partial Power Converter for Smart Home Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10497881</link><description>Multiport architectures based on multiwinding transformers allow the connection of multiple electrical components to achieve smart home functionality. However, existing solutions use full-power semiconductor devices or are constrained by the complexity of the multiwinding transformer design. As an alternative, this work proposes a new multiport partial power converter (PPC) architecture. The proposed multiport PPC architecture enables the partial power by using the series resonant converter based dc transformer. In contrast to the prior art solutions, the proposed converter can be built using partial power semiconductor devices, and only a single transformer rated for a part of the overall power is required. The operating principle and design criteria are also described in the article. The effect of partial power utilization is analyzed in detail.

Conventional methods for improving power harvesting, e.g., increasing the volume of the magnetic core, cannot effectively increase the output power density of the MFEH and it increases the burden on the transmission lines. An in-depth investigation reveals that by adding an optimal series-connected capacitor before the rectifier, the output power of the MFEH can be maximized. By reducing the net voltage applied to the magnetizing inductance, the flux accumulation is slower, lengthening the energy harvesting time, and the output power is increased. Furthermore, the output power can be maximized with an optimal series-connected capacitor. The design method of the optimal series-connected capacitor is theoretically analyzed in this article, which is only related to the load characteristics. In addition, the proposed method has a simple structure and can effectively improve the system power density of the MFEH. An experimental prototype is constructed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the results agree well with the theoretical analysis. Compared with the conventional MFEH without a series-connected capacitor, the method presented in this article can increase the harvested power by approximately 50%.</description></item><item><title>Optimized Design and Fast-Dynamic Control for ISOP-Connected Hybrid CLLC-DAB System With Partial Power Processing Property</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10502348</link><description>This article presents new design and control approaches for an input-series-output-parallel (ISOP) connected hybrid converter with partial power processing (PPP) capabilities, which comprises a CLLC converter and a dual-active-bridge (DAB). In this hybrid CLLC-DAB configuration, secondary-side bridges are shared between CLLC and DAB topologies to minimize the number of utilized switches. Incorporating the high efficiency of CLLC with the exceptional control flexibility of DAB, the hybrid configuration transfers the main power through CLLC while enabling DAB to handle partial power flow. The power distribution between CLLC and DAB is optimized, considering system efficiency, dynamic response, etc. Based on the resulting power ratio, system parameters are also optimized, including considerations for soft-switching of all switches in a wide load range, output power capacity, component tolerances, and overall efficiency. Furthermore, the output voltage can be accurately regulated by manipulating the phase shift angle of DAB. To enhance the system's transient performance in scenarios involving varying loads and input voltages, an adaptive fast dynamic response control strategy exhibiting robustness against variations in system parameters is also proposed. Finally, experimental results validate that the hybrid CLLC-DAB system, employing the proposed design methodology and control strategy, attains both high system efficiency and ultrafast dynamic response.</description></item><item><title>Constrained Maximum Power Extraction in PMVG Wind Turbine System With Predictive Rotor Position Bias-Based Current Angle Control for Power Factor Improvement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10505026</link><description>This study aims to present a power factor improvement constrained maximum power extraction for the permanent magnet vernier generator (PMVG)-based wind turbine system (WTS). The PMVG power factor suffers due to design considerations and can be improved by the current angle control (CAC). To do this, a finite angle-rotor position bias (FA-RPB) scheme is proposed by utilizing the principle of model predictive control. The FA-RPB-based CAC scheme is formulated to identify the optimum rotor position bias through cost function optimization and ensures the maximum power factor operation in PMVG. At this time, the electromagnetic torque developed by the generator is modified accordingly due to the introduction of RPB. Consequently, the maximum power extraction of WTS based on the optimum torque control is affected. Therefore, this study aims to enhance the PMVG stator power factor by adapting an RPB-constrained maximum power extraction strategy under CAC through constrained current reference to the control system. Finally, a 5-kW laboratory prototype verifies the enhanced operation of PMVG-based WTSs and the comparative results are summarized.</description></item><item><title>Modeling of High-Efficiency Nonsalient Pole Transmitter in High-Power Dynamic Wireless Charging System for Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268502</link><description>In high-power dynamic wireless charging applications, the bipolar magnetic coupler is continuously developed due to its strong coupling ability. The latest proposed bipolar-non-salient-pole (BNSP) transmitter has shown significant improvements in performance, cost, and modularization. In this article, the efficiency of BNSP transmitter is further analyzed. A quantitative loss model is proposed to reduce the dependence of analysis on finite element simulation. The model of winding loss based on squared magnetic field analysis is introduced, and a concept of flat Litz winding design suitable for BNSP transmitter is proposed, which has lower loss and fewer nonideal loss factors. The model of core loss is established by the magnetic circuit model of BNSP transmitter and Steinmetz formula of the core material. In the experiment of 40 kW power, the proposed loss model is verified to describe loss components in BNSP transmitter accurately. Compared with bipolar-salient-pole transmitter of the same power level, BNSP transmitter is quite smaller in size and more compact in structure, with 28.2% shorter Litz wire and 27.6% smaller volume of cores.

Due to the nonlinear nature introduced by phase-shift control, controllers designed based on specific steady-state small-signal models struggle to maintain closed-loop dynamic performance. In this article, the nonlinearities of the WPT system are implicitly considered by using the Hammerstein model-based identification (HMI) method, so the accuracy of the identified model is guaranteed even if the working point changes, which is unique advantage compared with other methods. In particular, an uncertainty model is precisely established via a frequency-domain analysis approach to introduce the nonlinear characteristics and the statistical properties of identification into the H$\infty$ control problem, which maintains the robustness of closed-loop WPT system. Finally, an experiment is given to verify the effectiveness of HMI method and proposed H$\infty$ robust controller.</description></item><item><title>Simultaneous Wireless Power and Multi-Channel Data Transmission Based on OFDM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472664</link><description>Aiming to meet the demand for multi-channel data communication between the power transmitter and receiver in a wireless power transfer system, a simultaneous wireless power and multi-channel data transmission method based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is proposed. In this method, a dual-LC resonant network is employed in the data transmitting circuits, which can achieve two independent data transmitting with only one data transmitting transformer. By making the power carrier and data carriers orthogonal to each other, the multi-channel data can be demodulated based on OFDM demodulation principle without requiring a filtering circuit and sampling resistance in the data receiving circuits. The power transmission adopts the bilateral LCC topological structure to achieve a load-independent constant current output. The data transmission characteristics are optimized by analyzing the system parameters impact on the data transmission gain. A 40 W experimental platform is built and a 4 &#215; 85 kbps data transmission rate is achieved. Experimental results show that four-channel data in two forward and two backward channels can be transmitted accurately without interference from the power and other data carriers according to the OFDM principle. Moreover, the proposed system exhibits a high data bandwidth utilization.</description></item><item><title>An Investigation of Implantable Capacitive Coupling Intra-body Power Transfer based on Full-band Loss Compensation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475583</link><description>Capacitive coupling intra-body power transfer (CC-IBPT) is a promising technique for powering implantable medical devices (IMDs) due to its flexible transmitter (TX) placement. However, several frequency-dependent capacitive impedances increase the path loss. Traditional methods have only compensated for partial path loss at the initially measured optimal frequency, which limits power transfer efficiency (PTE) enhancement. To address this issue, this article investigates the effect of full-band loss compensation (FBLC) on the transmission characteristics, both through theoretical analysis and implantation experiments to achieve maximum PTE at a system level. In the vector network analyzer-based simulation and measurement, FBLC achieves a higher path gain of 6.6 dB than conventional methods. Furthermore, we establish an implantable CC-IBPT prototype system to demonstrate the effects of FBLC on end-to-end power gain and PTE enhancement. The measured results indicate that with a 1 $ \bf mm^{2}$ square electrode implanted 4.6 cm deep in the pork tissue and positioned 15 cm away from the TX electrode, FBLC enhances PTE to 2.06%, an improvement of 3.55 times compared to 0.58% using conventional methods. This work demonstrates that FBLC achieves a higher PTE than traditional methods and validates the capability of CC-IBPT to achieve a relatively elevated PTE in long-distance wireless power supplies for IMDs.</description></item><item><title>Synthesis and Control of a Three-Port LCL Resonant Wireless Power Transfer System for DC Energy Conversion Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10473154</link><description>This article proposes a three-port LCL resonant wireless power transfer system with hybrid power flow control methods for dc--dc energy conversion applications. Two half-bridge microinverters provide the dual input ports for DC energy sources, while the load port is connected through an LCL--LCL wireless coupling tank loaded with a full-bridge rectifier. The three-port topology allows flexible power transfer between dual input sources while the two sources share one LCL resonant tank to transfer energy to the load without additional components. The control function of this proposed system can be divided into two phases. In phase one, PWM method is employed to implement bidirectional power transfer between dual input sources by controlling the average dc offset current in the LCL resonant tank. In phase two, phase-shift modulation (PSM) method is applied to regulate wireless power output for load. The proposed modulation methods enable the system to take sources with different voltage levels at the dual input ports. Theoretical time domain analysis of the proposed topology and LCL coupling tank is presented in detail. Open-loop simulation is carried out to obtain the power transfer characteristics between the multiple ports, and closed-loop simulation is done to verify the efficiency of the designed control method. A 200 W prototype was built to evaluate the performance of the proposed topology. Experimental results show that the proposed system can achieve a peak efficiency of 93.6% with the load-independent constant current performance achieved.</description></item><item><title>A 24-to-240 W 95.6%-Efficiency &lt;300-&#956;s-Settling-Time Hybrid MCR/PT Wireless Power Transfer System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10480642</link><description>This article proposes a hybrid wireless power transfer (WPT) system working in both magnetically coupled resonance (MCR) and parity-time symmetry (PT) modes to provide a wide dynamic output power range. Theoretically, it can operate with arbitrary coupling coefficients of the coupling coils and loads. More optimization freedoms can be released when comparing with the existing single-mode (i.e., either MCR or PT) WPT systems, such that a wider dynamic output power range and higher system efficiency are achieved simultaneously. Analytical models are developed. The analytical control-to-output transfer function in the PT mode reveals the fact that a complex-pole pair and a right-half-plane zero, which limit the loop-bandwidth of the PT-WPT system, exist in the control loop. Thus, a current-mode modulation scheme for the proposed WPT system in the PT mode is proposed to extend the loop-bandwidth. Driven by a 48-V dc source, the efficiency of the proposed hybrid WPT prototype is 86.5%&#8211;95.6% when the coupling coefficient varies 0.1&#8211;0.3 and output power ranges 24&#8211;240 W. The settling time of the proposed hybrid WPT system ranges 100&#8211;300 &#956;s in the whole output power range due to the use of the developed analytical models to the system design.</description></item><item><title>The Impact of Rectifier Filter Capacitance on Buck Converter Output Voltage in Wireless Power Receiver System With Input Current Source</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10480266</link><description>Wireless power transfer (WPT) technology offers a more convenient and safer alternative to traditional contact-based power supply methods. In many WPT systems, a two-stage receiver configuration, comprising a rectifier and a dc&#8211;dc converter, is commonly used. This article examines how the rectifier filter capacitance affects the output voltage of the buck converter in wireless power receiver system with input current source. Prior research often assumed a large capacitance, leading to a conclusion that the output voltage was unaffected by capacitance changes. However, this is not the case when the capacitance is intentionally reduced, causing the buck converter to switch from continuous voltage mode to discontinuous voltage mode, thereby linking the output voltage to the capacitance. Similar findings can be also observed in other dc&#8211;dc converters, such as the Boost converter.

To fill this gap, this article proposes and implements a segmented-vector pulse frequency modulation (SVPFM) of a half-bridge three-level inverter for WPT systems. Moreover, the sigma-delta (&#931;-&#916;) modulator for the SVPFM-WPT system is proposed, and the modulation range is expanded to [0, 1]. It can achieve wide-range zero-voltage switching (ZVS) without auxiliary circuits and inverter modification, and it suppresses the power losses, further improving the system efficiency of a three-level inverter-based WPT system. In the meantime, a switching state-based capacitor voltage balancing method is proposed to control the half-bridge three-level inverter for the WPT system. It can balance the capacitor voltage of the flying capacitor at the reference value with a small voltage ripple. Software simulation and hardware experimentation are both given to verify the feasibility of the proposed &#931;-&#916; SVPFM of the three-level inverter for WPT systems. The system efficiency can reach 95.2% with the wide-range ZVS operation.</description></item><item><title>A Thermal Black-Box Theory for Scaling Design of Planar Magnetic Coils in Wireless Charging Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10491329</link><description>Thermal management of magnetic coils is essential for the safe and stable operation of high-power wireless charging systems (WCS). Upon a deficiency of detailed thermal analysis, this article presents a thermal model under natural convection featuring both accuracy and simplicity. Analysis shows that the loss distribution between different parts of the coil has little effect on the resultant temperature. This in the context leads to a key conclusion that the maximum allowable power loss density decreases in an m-1/8 relationship with the increasing area gain m, given the coil geometry and natural convective condition. It also indicates that the coil set can be thermally treated as a black-box to predict how the temperature would rise and determine the necessary coil area for heat dissipation. These conclusions provide guidelines for the material and structure choices of the coils as well as for flexible scaling design. The proposed model is verified by simulation and experiment studies on a 5 kW prototype. The maximum error of temperature estimation is shown to be 9.5%.</description></item><item><title>A WPT System With Wide-Range Voltage Gains and Soft Switching via Primary-Side Hybrid Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10494557</link><description>Wireless power transfer systems for electric vehicles require wide-range voltage gains to satisfy battery charging requirements and coupling coefficient variations.

This article is dedicated to examining the radiated EMI, exploring its mechanisms, and proposing approaches for suppression. The frequency-dependent behaviors of capacitors and inductors are thoroughly examined to guide the comprehensive study of the coupler's characteristics. Several factors that impact EMI would couple with each other. To address this challenge, various scenarios are defined to isolate and investigate these potential factors independently, ultimately identifying the most influential ones.

The sensitivity of system characteristics to capacitor deviations is studied to identify sensitive parameters that cause significant uncertainty in the output. The effect of capacitor deviations on output current, power transfer efficiency, and power factor is comprehensively investigated. Interactions between capacitors are considered, and the main effect index S and the total effect index ST are calculated by Sobol&#8217; method. Its results indicate that the output current, power factor, and efficiency are slightly affected by the deviation of the capacitor in series with the receiving coil. Interaction between capacitors has a significant effect on the output current and power factor. Finally, the experimental setups of the three-coil and four-coil WPT systems are built. The experimental results show that when the resonant capacitor on the receiving side is varied within &#177;10%, the fluctuation of the output current is less than 1.5%, the maximum variation in efficiency is less than 2%, and the power factor remains almost above 0.9. The validity of the proposed global sensitivity analysis method is verified.</description></item><item><title>Integration Modulation for Current Ripple and High-Frequency Zero-Sequence Circulating Current Reduction on Two-Parallel Three-Level Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287921</link><description>Realizing simultaneous reduction of zero-sequence circulating current (ZSCC) and current ripple for two-parallel three-level neutral-point-clamped (3L-NPC) converters are always challenging. To overcome this obstacle, this article proposes a carrier-based integrated modulation method, which analyzes and controls the two-parallel 3L converters as an integrated five-level (5L) converter. First, the nearest three vectors are applied in each subsector to minimize the current ripple. Then, the corresponding 5L-vector sequences are optimally distributed into dual 3L-vector sequence combinations with the smallest common-mode voltage differences. A uniform distribution principle is also summarized based on reference signal decomposition and carrier type selection, which allows easy implementation in mainstream microcontrollers. Moreover, quantitative performance comparisons that compare the current ripple and the high-frequency ZSCC between the proposed method and several state-of-the-art strategies are subsequently conducted. Finally, comparative experiments are performed to verify the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>An Exponential Power Rate Discrete-Time Sliding Mode Observer for a Modular Multilevel Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10272033</link><description>Modular multilevel converter (MMC) gained popularity in modern power applications due to its attributes like scalability and modularity. But, the number of submodules of an MMC and its corresponding voltage sensing devices increase with the increase in voltage levels, which makes the design complex, bulky, and expensive. Hence, an observer for estimating the voltages across the capacitors makes the complete design inexpensive, simple, and compact. This article presents an exponential power rate discrete-time sliding mode observer (EPR-DTSMO) for the observation of voltage across the capacitors of the half-bridge submodule of an MMC. In this article, the hybrid nature of an MMC is investigated, and the MMC system is demonstrated to be observable using the $Z(T_{N})$ observability criteria for hybrid systems. The proposed EPR-DTSMO is then designed for the MMC, and its convergence for the observation errors is proved. The proposed observer is validated using an experimental setup after verifying with numerical simulations. Moreover, its performance is compared to other observer techniques present in the literature. Both simulation and experimental results show that the proposed EPR-DTSMO is well suited for the sensor-less operation of MMC without using any voltage sensors for submodule capacitors.</description></item><item><title>Generalized Feed-Forward Sampling Method for Multilevel Cascaded H-Bridge Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10274629</link><description>Multilevel cascaded H-bridge (CHB) converters are usually operated applying a phase-shifted pulsewidth modulation (PS-PWM) method. In this modulation strategy, it is important to define the sampling instants in order to obtain a superior harmonic performance in the CHB output waveforms. Previous approaches to define the PS-PWM method consider a shorter sampling time, becoming even smaller when the number of cells of the CHB is large. In addition, unbalanced operational conditions in the CHB aggravate this issue also degrading the CHB harmonic performance. In this article, both challenges (small sampling time and unbalanced operational conditions) are faced. A feed-forward compensation technique is proposed to face with the unbalanced operating conditions and enlarging the available computational time for control schemes keeping the good CHB harmonic performance. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Fusion Multilevel Hybrid Multi-VSC Topology's m-to-1 Rating Design for Current Sharing With Reduced Capacity and Enhanced Efficiency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10265165</link><description>Cascaded H-bridge (CHB) multilevel voltage source converter (VSC) topologies have been recently investigated for high-voltage applications. Additionally, more and more multilevel VSCs have been applied in parallel as multi-VSCs for high-current applications. In 2022, the concept of fusion topology was proposed to deal with performance, efficiency, and capacity for parallel multilevel hybrid multiconverters. However, the number of voltage levels of the VSC corresponding to the operating voltage of the hybrid VSC is required to be investigated, which can influence the current sharing among fusion topology converters, efficiency, and capacity. Based on the abovementioned issues, an m-to-1 rating design is proposed to reduce the active inverter capacity and power loss in this article for power quality compensation as an example. The comparative hardware experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed design and fusion multilevel multi-VSC. The results show that multilevel L-CHB-VSC and hybrid LC-VSC have the same current injection ability with about 33% lower loss and more enhanced efficiency than the previous cascaded active multilevel multi-VSCs.</description></item><item><title>Period Control Approach Finite Control Set Model Predictive Control Switching Phase Control for Interleaved DC/DC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304404</link><description>The control of interleaved converters is commonly implemented through pulsewith modulation (PWM) techniques. A common element in these implementations is the use of phase shift between carriers to improve the system performance. When working with a balanced system, this phase shift is equally distributed between modules, but for an unbalanced system, this is no longer the best alternative. Changing the phase shift in these controllers requires the implementation of new capabilities in the control platforms, and for the controller to manage more variables of different nature. On the other hand, finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) has shown to be a promising control strategy, especially when managing multiple control objectives of different natures or dynamics. In general, FCS-MPC does not present a fixed switching pattern, but this issue has been recently addressed with the so called period control approach (PCA). This article expands on the PCA-FCS-MPC to achieve the switching phase regulation for interleaved dc/dc power converters. A switching pattern similar to that of PWM techniques is achieved, while keeping the advantages of FCS-MPC and achieving the phase shift required for interleaved operation. Simulation and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A DC Offset Reduction of Neutral Point Voltage Strategy Based on Vector Phase Angle Difference Optimization for Vienna Rectifier With Bipolar DC Bus</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304412</link><description>When Vienna rectifier operates at light load conditions, small load power difference of bipolar dc bus leads to dc offset of neutral point (NP) voltage due to the limitation of dc-link power, increasing the voltage stress on switching devices. To solve this problem, a dc offset reduction of NP voltage strategy based on the vector phase angle difference (VPAD) optimization is proposed. By analyzing the relationship between the magnitude of zero-sequence component and the duty cycles of voltage vectors, the maximum power difference of the conventional strategy is obtained. The proposed strategy illustrates that VPAD can adjust the NP current based on the contour of the NP current, and the maximum VPAD is limited to satisfy the reference voltage and input current have the same sign. To increase the NP current, the VPAD is optimized by introducing the fluctuating reactive current, and the active current disturbance is injected to regulate the change rate of NP current. Therefore, the proposed strategy can significantly reduce the dc offset of NP voltage under light load conditions at the cost of the input current harmonics and the dc-link voltage fluctuation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified on a Vienna rectifier platform.</description></item><item><title>Multiobjective Optimization of High Power Density Outer Rotor PM Starter Generator Considering Electromagnetic and Temperature Characteristics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304356</link><description>This article presents a multiobjective optimization method for a special cooling tooth design in an outer rotor permanent magnet starter generator (ORPMSG), taking into account both the electromagnetic and temperature performances.

In addition, an optimization method considering the power density, efficiency, and temperature rise have been proposed and employed to obtain an optimal overall performance on the ORPMSG design. The comprehensive sensitivity method is conducted based on the random forest algorithm to improve model accuracy. Besides, the random black-hole algorithm is proposed to enhance the convergence rate and approximate Pareto optimal solution. Then, an optimal ORPMSG is obtained using the proposed multiobjective optimization. Besides, the corresponding electromagnetic and temperature characteristics of the optimal and initial machines are compared by finite element analysis to confirm the merits of the optimization method. Finally, a 25 kW prototype is manufactured and tested, which verifies a significant 45.1% current density and 3.2% efficiency improvement for the same condition compared to the traditional cooling method.</description></item><item><title>A Five-Level Inverter Topology With Extended Linear Modulation Range Till Full Base Speed Irrespective of Load Power Factor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287855</link><description>In conventional inverters, the linear modulation range is limited to a maximum voltage space vector radius of 0.866 times the dc link voltage ($\text{V}_\text{dc}$), which corresponds to a maximum peak fundamental phase voltage of 0.577 $\text{V}_\text{dc}$. Beyond this, the inverter enters the overmodulation region, where the operation transitions to a six-step mode causing the voltage space vector to trace a hexagonal locus. This results in phase voltage waveforms with significant lower order harmonic content leading to torque ripples in the motor shaft and undesired harmonic losses. Thus, the achievable speed range of the induction motor in the linear modulation range is effectively limited to 90.5% of its full base speed. In contrast, the proposed five-level inverter topology generates a circular voltage space vector locus with a radius of up to 0.955 $\text{V}_\text{dc}$ resulting in a maximum peak fundamental phase voltage of 0.637 $\text{V}_\text{dc}$. Thus, the linear modulation range is extended to full base speed and is independent of the load power factor. The proposed power circuit is based on two standard three-level neutral point clamped inverters and can be realized by two readily available three-level NPC inverter IC packages. Standard space vector pulsewidth modulation techniques can be employed for switching pulse generation.</description></item><item><title>Improved Model-Free Predictive Current Control Method for SPMSM With an Overmodulation Scheme</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10273616</link><description>Traditional deadbeat predictive current control is an effective control approach, due to its simple concept, easy implementation, and fast dynamic response. However, the parameter mismatch is one of the main problems affecting its wide application. Model-free predictive current control on the basis of the extended state observer (ESO-MFPCC) is an effective solution to the above problem, while the bandwidth limitation in ESO will reduce the control performance. Moreover, because of the voltage limitation of the power converter, in response to load impacts, the motor potentially has poor dynamic performance under the overmodulation region. In order to solve these above problems, model-free predictive current control on the basis of the adaptive sliding mode observer (ASMO-MFPCC) with an overmodulation scheme is proposed. First, the ASMO-MFPCC can preferably improve system parameter robustness without bandwidth limitation. In addition, the vertical method for optimizing dynamic performance in the overmodulation region is proposed, so that the quicker and better dynamic response is obtained between the linear modulation region and the overmodulation region. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the method, carried on a 1-KW surfaced permanent magnet synchronous motor, are verified through the experimental results.</description></item><item><title>A Fault Diagnosis and Fault-Tolerant Control Method for Open-Switch Faults of Converters in DSEM Drive System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287621</link><description>This article proposes a fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control method for open-switch faults of bridge converters in doubly salient electromagnetic motor (DSEM) drive systems. First, the locations of current sensors are reinstalled to detect the dc-link current and its difference with the freewheeling current of diodes in the lower bridge leg, through which the open-switch faults are diagnosed without affecting the control mode of motors. Moreover, a method to process the features of fault current is studied to reduce the calculation load of the diagnosis method. Then, the driving logic of the switches under different fault conditions is developed for fault-tolerant control. Through the analysis of the problem of uncontrolled phase current caused by inheriting the common duty ratio control method of normal operation in fault-tolerant operation, the independent duty ratio control method is further researched to decrease the ripple of phase currents during fault-tolerant operation. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method has superior rapidity and high reliability. In addition, the suppression of current ripple in three-phase DSEM using the converter based on split capacitors is studied to further improve the fault-tolerant control performance. Finally, the experiments on a 12/8 pole DSEM validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Vector-Space-Decomposition-Based Power Flow Control of Single-Stage-Multiport-Inverter-Fed PMSM Drive for Hybrid Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287618</link><description>The single-stage multiport inverter (SSMPI) is one of the high-efficiency power electronic interfaces for hybrid electric vehicles due to its capability of single-stage power conversion from each source to the motor without employing a dc&#8211;dc converter. However, it is cumbersome to design the modulation scheme for the SSMPI since the voltage vectors of the SSMPI are unsymmetrically distributed as the dc-link voltage ratio between the two dc ports varies with the state of the sources, which results in a heavy computation burden in the sector identification and vector synthesis. To this end, this article proposes a vector space decomposition (VSD)-based power flow control scheme to simplify the modulation design for the SSMPI, where the unsymmetrical three-level space vector diagram is decomposed into two separate two-level ones. An intuitive decoupled power flow control for each port without affecting the motor drive control can be easily developed with the proposed VSD strategy. The power distribution capability of the SSMPI with the proposed scheme is also analytically revealed. Experiments are presented to verify the effectiveness and performance of the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Zero Sequence Current Suppression Scheme for Open-Winding Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Based on Model-Free Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10271734</link><description>In open-winding permanent magnet synchronous motors (OW-PMSMs) with a single dc bus, zero sequence current (ZSC) would cause unwanted power loss and negatively affect stability of the system, so it should be addressed. In this article, an improved control scheme is proposed, which can maintain good ZSC performance under varying conditions and reduce the switching action times synchronously. First, an extended state observer that can predict the next instant ZSC and calculate the next instant desired zero sequence voltage (ZSV) is established. In this process, the model-free control principle is applied, which overcomes the problem of dependence on the zero-sequence loop parameters. Second, to reduce the switching frequency in traditional equal distribution modulation strategy, a novel modulation method is illustrated. Zero voltage vector is avoided, and the dwell time of active voltage vectors is redistributed to generate the desired ZSV. As a result, the times of switching actions has reduced from 12 to 8, and this reduction in switching actions is accompanied by effective suppression of ZSC. Finally, to test the effectiveness of the proposed method, several experimental results obtained using existing methods and the proposed method are presented.</description></item><item><title>Parallel Input Series Output Ultra-High Step up DC/DC Converter With Three Degrees of Freedom</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10273005</link><description>In this article, a new high step up dc/dc converter with a very high voltage gain is presented. The proposed converter employs coupled inductors and built-in transformer to achieve an ultra-high voltage ratio with low duty cycle of switches. Interleaved structure of the proposed converter minimizes the input current ripple, and due to the input current sharing, the current stress of switches is reduced. Low voltage stress of switches make it possible to employ low on resistance power mosfets. In the proposed converter, the large output voltage is stored in two series capacitors, which reduces the cost and capacitor losses. The employed clamp circuit not only recycle the energy of leakage inductance but also improve the voltage gain. Thanks to all of these mentioned features, power loss reduces and the circuit performance is improved. In order to verify the validity of theoretical analysis, a 1-kW laboratory prototype circuit converting 26 to 450 V is implemented.</description></item><item><title>Investigation of a PM Flux-Modulated Motor With Mechanical Flux-Weakening Solution for Wide Speed-Range Operation in Traction Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10275789</link><description>In order to achieve wide speed-range operation in traction applications, an investigation of a permanent magnet (PM) flux-modulated motor with a mechanical flux-weakening solution is presented in this article. This PM flux-modulated motor consists of two sets of windings, i.e., windings I and II, and two rotors, i.e., the outer rotor and the inner rotor. The two sets of windings are connected in series. By adjusting the inner rotor position, the phase angle between the two voltage vectors of windings I and II is accordingly changed. Hence, with the speed increasing, even though the magnitudes of the two voltage vectors of windings I and II are increased, the voltage magnitude of the total series-connected windings can be maintained (instead of increased) within the voltage limit. As a result, a mechanical flux-weakening solution for wide speed-range operation is achieved. Differing from conventional electrical flux-weakening solutions, this mechanical solution shows the advantage that the flux-weakening capability is not heavily dependent on the power rating of the motor. A comparative study is conducted between the presented PM flux-modulated motor with the mechanical solution and a conventional interior PM synchronous motor (IPMSM) as well as a surface-mounted PM synchronous motor (SPMSM) with the electrical solution. The results indicate that compared to the IPMSM and SPMSM, the presented PM flux-modulated motor exhibits the advantages of high torque/power density, high torque per PM volume, and high flux-weakening capability. Finally, a prototype of the presented PM flux-modulated motor is fabricated, and experimental validation of the mechanical flux-weakening solution is provided.</description></item><item><title>A Misalignment Tolerant Inductive Power Transfer System With AC Resistance Reduction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10298832</link><description>Misalignment sensitivity is one of the main problems limiting the development of inductive power transfer system. When misalignment occurs, the system output power and efficiency reduce dramatically and cause unstable power supply. Meanwhile, the ac resistance of the inductive power transfer coil increases with the frequency. In medium and high frequency region, it produces large ohmic loss and thermal dissipation, which lead to efficiency-drop and temperature-rise problems. This work proposes a misalignment-tolerant winding pattern to reduce the system horizontal misalignment sensitivity, thermal stress, and coil ac resistance. From the experimental result, the proposed winding pattern reduces the ac resistance maximally by 88% at 2 MHz compared with the conventional winding pattern under the same geometry and wire type. The misalignment tolerance is maximally improved by 46% in terms of the output power with the proposed winding pattern.</description></item><item><title>Harmonic Inclusion and Accurate Modeling and Performance Analysis of the IPT Topologies Under Varying Operating Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315204</link><description>The fundamental harmonic approximation (FHA) is generally used to design and model inductive power transfer (IPT) circuits. However, with coil misalignments, at light load or the rectifier's discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), the IPT circuit must handle higher harmonic content. Moreover, topologies like LCL and LCC have high harmonics at the inverter output and rectifier input side, even during regular operation. The existing two-port network-based harmonic modeling assumes quasi-square rectifier input voltage for the LCC&#8211;LCC topology in DCM condition, thereby leading to significant error. In this article, the rectifier input voltage of LCC&#8211;LCC topology (capacitive filter at load) and the rectifier input current of series-parallel (S-P) topology (inductive filter at load) are modified and improved for the DCM mode. Hence, by including the modified expression, accurate results in extreme conditions, high coupling, light load, and DCM scenarios are achieved. The proposed technique models the output port as a voltage/current source instead of approximating it to be resistive. Furthermore, the proposed study equally applies to continuous conduction mode and DCM conditions for the rectifier. A comparison using the FHA-based analysis, proposed harmonic modeling and simulation is carried out, and experimental validation is done for S-P and LCC&#8211;LCC topologies.</description></item><item><title>A Controller HIL Testing Approach of High Switching Frequency Power Converter via Slower-Than-Real-Time Simulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287918</link><description>The controller hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) simulation is a vital tool to test power electronics controllers in the early development stages to reduce cost and risk and save time. However, the CHIL cannot handle the high-switching-frequency power converters due to the strict computing time constraint imposed on the real-time simulation and the limitation of the digital-analog conversion rate of the I/O interface. To deal with this challenge, in this article, a CHIL testing approach based on the slower-than-real-time simulation (STRTS) is proposed for the power electronics converter with high switching frequency. The operating principles and implementation procedure of the STRTS-based CHIL are presented in detail. By comparing with the real-time simulation-based hardware-in-the-loop (HIL), STRTS-based CHIL is proved to have equivalent controller testing performances.

Nevertheless, a wider soft switching range and a simpler structure are the holy grail for these converters. In this article, an innovative unbalanced dc-link capacitor voltage buck converter with a broad soft switching range has been proposed. The converter uses an auxiliary switch and a small inductor to create an auxiliary network that enables zero voltage switching (ZVS) for the buck switch. The auxiliary switch turns on under zero current switching, whereas the main buck switch operates under ZVS with reduced dv/dt. Unbalanced voltage of a series-connected dc-link capacitor is intended to boost the soft switching range of the buck converter for a broad range of loads by lowering the resonant voltage to less than half the input voltage. LTspice simulations of the converter operating with a power load of 1 kW and a switching frequency of 100 kHz have been demonstrated and the efficiency of the topology based on silicon carbide MOSFET has been discussed. Compared with the traditional hard switching buck converter, the proposed converter reduces total losses by 50% and improves the light-load efficiency to 91.3% from 88.5% and the full-load efficiency to 97.5% from 94.5%. Finally, a 1 kW prototype has been designed and tested to validate the theoretical ideas including the closed-loop control strategy for the converter.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Integrated Magnetic for Wide Voltage Gain ISOP-LLC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286296</link><description>In order to enlarge the voltage gain range and improve the conversion efficiency over the whole load, the combination between ISOP-LLC and configurable rectifier is conducted in this article, which constructed three operation modes.

This article proposes a simple but effective peak current control strategy to achieve dimming operation. Unlike the traditional dimming techniques, no extra switch, pulsewidth modulation controller, or linear current regulator in series with the LED strings is used in the proposed method, resulting in easy implementation and low cost. A 33 W ac&#8211;dc Sepic LED driver prototype, both with power factor correction (PFC) and without PFC, is constructed and tested to validate the proposed peak current control method. Moreover, flicker-free operation of LEDs is necessary for human eye comfort. Therefore, this article also introduces a ripple remover circuit (RRC) to remove low-frequency LED current ripple in ac&#8211;dc LED drivers. At the same time, the output capacitor can be greatly reduced by the critical design of the RRC. Unlike the existing methods, the inclusion of RRC into a driver circuit is straightforward and RRC has no complex structure. The proposed solution is generally suitable for all single-phase ac&#8211;dc LED drivers. Experimental results are presented to validate flicker-free operation by RRC.</description></item><item><title>Ultrahigh Step-Down ZVS Buck Converter With Continuous Output Current</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10266902</link><description>This article proposes a new soft-switched two-phase high step-down dc&#8211;dc converter.

In addition, the proposed converter comprises only two switches and two sets of coupled inductors, all participating in the power conversion process and are responsible for reducing voltage gain. Not only do the coupled inductors decrease the conversion ratio, but also, they cancel out the ripple of each other. Therefore, the continuous low ripple output current is achieved.

The concept of the proposed technique is to inject offset currents into the primary- and secondary-sides of the transformer. If the same offset currents are injected into both sides, dc bias does not occur in the magnetizing current of the transformer. Therefore, the offset current can be used as a new control variable without any adverse effects. When the proposed technique is applied to single phase shift (SPS) modulation, zero voltage switching (ZVS) characteristics can be further improved by realizing the ZVS of two more switches, leading to higher efficiency. Furthermore, the proposed control system can be configured with simple modification of the conventional control system. The optimal SPS modulation with the proposed technique is derived through theoretical loss optimization considering a tradeoff between conduction loss and switching loss. The feasibility of the proposed technique is verified using a 3.3 kW prototype with a 400 V input and 280&#8211;420 V output conditions.</description></item><item><title>Single-Switch Soft-Switched High-Step-Down Converter With Self-Driven Synchronous Rectifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268282</link><description>A new fully soft-switched nonisolated high-step-down converter is presented in this article. The proposed converter utilizes only one switch and a self-driven synchronous rectifier to implement a fully soft-switched pulsewidth modulation high-step-down converter. In addition, the single switch does not require an isolated gate drive, which further simplifies the converter control. The main switch is turned on and off under zero-current-switching and zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) conditions, respectively. The extended duty cycle enables the converter to have a wide input voltage range and reduce the switch current stress. Also, the self-driven synchronous rectifier turns on and off under ZVS condition. These merits have contributed to the improved efficiency of the proposed converter with respect to other counterparts. To verify the converter characteristics, a 150 V to 12 V converter prototype operating at 100 W and 100 kHz is implemented and the results indicate 97% efficiency at full load.</description></item><item><title>Bidirectional Supercascode High-Voltage DC Solid-State Circuit Breaker With Sensorless Current&#8211;Time Configuration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10288149</link><description>This article presents a bidirectional normally-on SiC junction field-effect transistor (JFET) based supercascode high-voltage dc solid-state circuit breaker (BSC-SSCB) with sensorless current&#8211;time configuration. A sensorless detection-driving circuit (DDC) is proposed to detect the current and drive the main switch by directly utilizing the forward voltage of the BSC-SSCB. The DDC only contains a few passive components and a low-voltage MOSFET, whereas no high-voltage input or high-isolation auxiliary power supply is used. In addition, the current&#8211;time tripping response can be configured by only setting two resistors and two capacitors of the DDC without additional controllers. The configurable current&#8211;time tripping response enables the BSC-SSCB to avoid unnecessary breaking-off caused by impulse current. A design procedure for the DDC and the main circuit is carried out. A 4-kV/15-A BSC-SSCB prototype is designed and tested. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed BSC-SSCB can quickly break off the fault current and achieve balanced voltages of all power JFETs. The current&#8211;time tripping curve can be fine-configured, which agrees with theoretical analysis. The results indicate that the proposed BSC-SSCB can be applied to medium-voltage dc for fast circuit breaking.</description></item><item><title>Fixed-Frequency Circulant Phase-Shift Controlled Current-Fed Resonant Converter With Wide Voltage Gain Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10284545</link><description>This article proposes a novel current-fed LLC resonant (CFLLC) converter for wide voltage range applications. For the proposed CFLLC converter, it is obtained by integrating a boost inductor, two series-connected voltage source submodules (VSMs) and a resonant tank. The output voltage can be regulated by the fixed-frequency circulant phase-shift (FFCPS) modulation method. And the switching frequency is fixed at the resonant frequency, which is conducive to the design of magnetic components. Compared with other CFLLC converters, the proposed solution has a simpler single-stage structure and lower voltage stress borne by switching devices over a wide input range, which reduces the number and cost of components. Based on the FFCPS modulation strategy, the proposed CFLLC is characterized by wide voltage range, high efficiency and self-balancing performance of VSM capacitor voltages without introducing the control complexity. In addition, zero-voltage switching of all power devices can be achieved through the collaborative design of the boost inductor and transformer. The main working principle of CFLLC is expounded in more depth. A laboratory prototype is built for experimental verification. The experimental results verify the correctness and feasibility of the theoretical analysis.</description></item><item><title>Alleviation of Leakage Current and Neutral Point Voltage Deviation for Using an Eight-Switch Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10275064</link><description>Due to the less number of switching devices, a coupled eight-switch converter is an attractive topology for reducing cost in photovoltaic generation systems. Nevertheless, the medium vectors are absent in an eight-switch converter compared to the conventional three-level topology, resulting in an undesired performance for leakage current suppression and neutral point voltage (NPV) balancing with existing methods. To overcome such limitations, this article proposes a modulation method without the medium vectors for leakage current suppression and NPV balancing for eight-switch converters. In order to mitigate the leakage current, except for using the low common-mode voltage (CMV) vectors to reduce the amplitude of the CMV, two pairs of sequences are further designed to lower the transitions of the CMV. Simultaneously, the average switching frequency is reduced and the NPV balance can be achieved by changing between sequences. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulations and experiments.</description></item><item><title>Flex-LCC: A New Grid-Forming HVDC Rectifier for Collecting Large-Scale Renewable Energy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10314129</link><description>A new grid-forming (GFM) high-voltage direct current (HVdc) rectifier, named flexible line-commutated converter (Flex-LCC), is proposed in this article to collect the power generated by large-scale islanded or weak-grid-supported renewable energy systems. The Flex-LCC uses a series-connected hybrid valve based on the LCC and full-bridge modular multilevel converter (FBMMC), and adopts a new control. As a result, the Flex-LCC works as a GFM rectifier and retains the same dc voltage and power carrying capacity, dc fault clearing, and power reversal functions as an LCC. Particularly, the Flex-LCC has three salient features: the control of the Flex-LCC is decoupled from the LCC part's firing angle, the internal reactive power allocation is flexible, and the valve-side ac voltage of the FBMMC part has a wide operation range due to the decoupling of dc-port voltage and capacitor voltage. These bring reduced interharmonics, enhanced stability, and a smaller capacity boundary to the FBMMC part for the Flex-LCC. Furthermore, utilizing the reasonable design for the actual capacity and valve-side ac voltage of the FBMMC, the Flex-LCC can effectively balance cost, footprint, and weight, and match the current-carrying capacity between the series-connected LCC and FBMMC. The topology, control, characteristics, and design of the Flex-LCC are analyzed in detail in this article. Simulations and experiments validate the theory.</description></item><item><title>Single-Loop Droop Control Strategy for a Grid-Connected DFIG Wind Turbine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10314133</link><description>When grid-forming droop control strategies are implemented in grid-connected power converters, two control strategies are widely used: the single-loop and multiloop droop controls. However, only multiloop droop control strategies with inner control loops have been implemented in doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbines so far. This article proposes the application of a single-loop droop control strategy to a DFIG wind turbine, which has not been previously explored or implemented. As shown in the article, the application of the conventional droop control without inner control loops to DFIG-based wind power systems does not ensure a stable response. After modeling the system dynamics and evaluating its stability, two causes of instability have been identified: a resonance at the rotor electrical frequency relevant at high slips and a phase margin reduction at low slips. To solve these instability issues two control solutions are proposed: the emulation of a virtual resistor and a phase rotation. The proposed control strategy allows stabilizing the system and achieving a fast and damped dynamic response. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is validated by experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Improved Sliding Mode-Based Controller of a High Voltage Ratio DC&#8211;DC Converter for Electrolyzers Supplied by Renewable Energy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287092</link><description>This article presents a novel control algorithm for a three-level interleaved buck converter (TLIBC) to supply energy to a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer (PEMEL) in the presence of renewable energy sources. It leverages the main advantages of the TLIBC, i.e., a high voltage conversion ratio, low output current ripple, and the ability to operate in case of electrical circuit failures. The new control law, based on nonlinear improved sliding model-based control, offers a significant improvement of the performance for input power variation when renewable energy sources are used. The proposed controller exhibits further benefits, such as a faster dynamic response and greater robustness against parameter uncertainties when compared to traditional PI-based control. Experimental verification is carried out using a PEMEL dynamic emulator to preserve the real PEMEL performance during the tests. The obtained experimental results demonstrated that the proposed control technique overcomes current limitations in terms of performance usually characterized by PI controllers. Particularly, during operating conditions change when considering electrolyzers powered by renewable energy sources, a faster response is obtained. The rise time is imposed by the controller, and it does not depend on the operating point.</description></item><item><title>Self-Excited Three-Port Converter for Photovoltaic Application With Stability Enhancement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10272242</link><description>Reducing the impact of system voltage on the phase-locked loop in weak grid is an effective method to enhance the stability of grid-connected inverters. This article introduces a self-excited three-port converter topology, which utilizes a zigzag transformer to construct a small capacity series ac port on the dc&#8211;dc module of a two-stage photovoltaic grid-connected converter, achieving the goal of adjusting the grid voltage with its power and extending the degree of freedom in the grid-connected converter control. At the same time, an impedance compensation strategy based on the series ac port is proposed to suppress the impact of the grid-connected converter output circuit on the grid voltage and enhance the system stability on the time scale of the phase-locked loop. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed converter topology and control method can significantly improve the stability so that the grid-connected converter can adapt to weak grid. Simulation and 1.6 kW prototype experiments prove that the proposed topology can effectively improve the stability of the converter system in weak grid with short-circuit ratio of 1.49 by compensating the impedance value of the power grid.</description></item><item><title>Economic Operation Optimization Under Real-Time Pricing for an Energy Management System in a Redundancy-Based Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10305280</link><description>DC microgrids (MGs) represent self-contained systems for distributing and managing electricity locally, offering advantages in terms of efficiency and control. This article proposes the optimization of redundancy-based dc MG, emphasizing the integration of an intelligent algorithm to minimize operational costs under real-time pricing conditions and also increase the efficiency operation. The redundancy-based dc MG consists of a cascaded bidirectional Cuk converter (CBC) linked to a cascaded bidirectional boost converter, sharing two battery energy storage system (BESS) units as common inputs. Thereby, two boost converters interface the dc utility and fuel cell (FC) to the dc-link of the CBC. The redundancy-based dc MG operates with a coordinated and decentralized control among the dc utility, FC and two BESS units. The energy management system (EMS) employs a droop control for the dc utility and FC, while BESS units adhere to a state-of-charge (SoC)-sharing function. In addition, the particle swarm optimization dynamically adjusts EMS parameters for optimal real-time performance. Then, a stability analysis determines MG operational boundaries, and the effectiveness of the method is confirmed through experiments using Typhoon HIL and dSPACE setups. Finally, comparative evaluations against traditional SoC-based droop and genetic algorithms demonstrate the cost reduction of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Universal Active Filter With SPV and Battery Support for Standalone Hydroelectric System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10280621</link><description>The number of sensitive loads that require optimal sinusoidal supply voltages for proper operation has increased because of developments in process control, digital electronics, and power converters. Therefore, it is imperative to develop efficient control strategies to address this issue. In this article, a universal active power filter (UAPF) is incorporated with the standalone hydroelectric system to enhance voltage and current qualities simultaneously. This standalone hydropower system includes an induction generator as a primary source, a battery with a dc&#8211;dc converter, and a solar photovoltaic array. The series compensator improves the voltage characteristics. It keeps the harmonics (distortion) free voltage with constant amplitude at the terminals of nonlinear loads, regardless of source voltage variations. Furthermore, UAPF's shunt compensator improves power indices, including power factor, current harmonics, and reactive power. By using an improved low-pass second-order generalized integrator control algorithm, the fundamental elements of nonsinusoidal currents from nonlinear critical loads are estimated. These components are used to generate switching pulses and reference signals, ensuring efficient and effective power quality (PQ) enhancement under various circumstances. Moreover, laboratory prototype validation has ensured the effectiveness in providing PQs of currents and voltages to follow the IEEE std. 519.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Multiple Compensation Circuits for Wireless Power Transfer With Fewer Components</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10275735</link><description>This article proposes a novel approach to designing integrated compensation circuits with fewer components for wireless power transfer (WPT) systems. Our approach utilizes $\Gamma$-circuit and ${\unicode{xA780}}$-circuit to achieve voltage&#8211;current conversion and is applicable for both inductive and capacitive couplers. By incorporating the designed compensation circuits at the primary or secondary side of second-order compensated WPT converters, higher-order compensated WPT converters can be achieved. These converters offer the ability to transform between load-independent constant current (CC) output and constant voltage (CV) output at the same operating frequency, while also possessing desirable properties such as reduced dependence on couplers and an expanded operating range. Moreover, our approach can be extended to increase flexibility on the output side, without compromising the simplicity of design parameter determination. We present the properties of the resulting circuits, enabling the selection of multiple compensation circuits suitable for various application scenarios. Finally, we validate the proposed compensation design's applicability to a WPT system by constructing a laboratory prototype that can produce both CC and CV output forms at a fixed operating frequency.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Model Predictive Control for LCL-Filter Grid-Tied Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10309832</link><description>This article proposes adaptive continuous-control-set model predictive control (CCS-MPC) for three-phase LCL-filter grid-tied inverters in the stationary frame. The proposed control provides stability against the LCL-filter resonance and removes the need for active damping or passive damping. Furthermore, it can track sinusoidal references in the stationary frame close to zero offsets. Inductance variation of a grid is a challenging issue, which can shift the LCL-filter resonance. Even though CCS-MPC generally has good stability for parameter mismatches, the control is optimized for the nominal value of the parameters. A relatively large variation may deteriorate the performance of the control and cause instability in the closed-loop system. To solve this problem, the concept of CCS-MPC is developed to work with a variety of the grid-inductance changes. The controller coefficients are chosen with a sensitivity analysis to provide enough gain margins and phase margins for the whole interval of the presumption grid-inductance variation. Also, this selection guarantees the control robustness against mismatches of the LCL-filter capacitance and inductance. The real-time computation of advanced controllers is a challenging issue. The computation burden of the proposed CCS-MPC is mostly performed offline and just some simple numerical expression is executed in real time. Thus, it does not require a powerful but expensive processor for implementation. The simulation and experimental results prove the performance of the proposed controller for handling the LCL-filter resonance, grid-inductance variations, and tracking sinusoidal references.</description></item><item><title>Online Expansion of Multiple Mobile Emergency Energy Storage Vehicles Without Communication</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10323257</link><description>The extreme weather and natural disasters will cause power grid outage. In disaster relief, mobile emergency energy storage vehicle (MEESV) is the significant tool for protecting critical loads from power grid outage. However, the on-site online expansion of multiple MEESVs always faces the challenges of hardware and software configurations through communications. In order to simplify the on-site operation, the online expansion without communication line is always expected to realize the effect of plug-and-play. For this purpose, this article proposes an online expansion method, which focuses on the voltage coordinate control at two key parts to avoid the circulating current: one is for the system reset after new MEESV is joined, while the other one is for the bus voltage synchronously gradually restored to the rated value. For the former one, a mutual small-signal-based resetting method is proposed, for which the injection and identification of small signal are studied to ensure the safe expansion with acceptable disturbances. For the latter one, event-triggered method is suggested which synchronously restores the bus voltage to nominal value at its specific zero crossings. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated through an experimental platform, with three prototypes online expanded one by one.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Energy Management of Renewable Hydrogen Production Systems Without Communication Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10314039</link><description>With the increasing penetration of renewable generation, producing renewable hydrogen by water electrolysis has become a promising development. For hydrogen production systems integrated with renewable energy sources (RESs), alkaline electrolyzers (AELs), and energy storage devices, its energy management system (EMS) not only controls the RESs&#8217; operating points to capture more renewable energy but also regulates the AELs and energy storage devices&#8217; operating power to achieve dc bus voltage regulation, dynamic power sharing, power regulation of AELs, state-of-charge regulation of energy storage devices, etc. In this article, a decentralized EMS is proposed to achieve the above objectives. The proposed EMS can indirectly improve the system's efficiency and service life by ensuring that the AEL's operating power is always above the minimum recommended operating power and it only absorbs the low-frequency part of renewable power fluctuations. Besides, the proposed EMS can reduce system costs and enhance system reliability by eliminating communication networks. Furthermore, the operational principle of the proposed EMS and the system design and analysis are elaborated. The proposed EMS's effectiveness is verified by hardware-in-the-loop real-time simulations.</description></item><item><title>A Distributed Control Method With Seamless Hot Swap Capability for Generic DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10266904</link><description>This article proposes a distributed secondary control method for droop-controlled dc microgrid (MG) systems with ring or mesh configurations. The control method achieves accurate current sharing and improved load voltage regulation than the conventional droop method by using the bus voltage information of any bus of the dc MG system. The secondary controllers are implemented locally at each converter, thus ensuring a distributed control. The proposed method requires communication of only one signal per communication link and it needs less number of communication links than the state-of-the-art distributed secondary control methods. The method also offers a seamless hot swap capability of a converter as there is no interdependence between the secondary controllers of the converters. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using switching simulations and hardware-based experiments on different configurations of dc MG systems.</description></item><item><title>Virtual Fractional-Order-Inductor Based Second Harmonic Current Suppression Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10274606</link><description>In a two-stage single-phase inverter, the pulsating output power generates a second harmonic current (SHC) at the dc port. Although the conventional virtual-resistor (VR) based control method can suppress the SHC, the SHC reduction performance is limited by its dynamic performance. To address the above issues, based on the unified small-signal model of the dc&#8211;dc converter, a virtual fractional-order-inductor (FOI) based control method is proposed in this article to reduce the SHC and improve the system dynamic performance. The order and magnitude of the fractional-order inductor can be modified arbitrarily. A negative order inductor is constructed in this article to reduce the SHC and improve the system dynamic performance. In addition, the proposed virtual FOI-based control method can improve the stability of both dc&#8211;dc converter and the cascaded system. The comparison of the proposed fractional-order inductor and conventional VR-based control method is given and the design method of key parameters is presented. Finally, an 800-W two-stage single-phase inverter with the upstream boost converter is fabricated and tested in the laboratory to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control method.</description></item><item><title>Weighted DC Virtual Generator Control Scheme for Interlinking Converters in DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292499</link><description>This article proposes a new control strategy for power electronic converters interfacing two dc networks. The proposed control, based on a modification of the dc virtual generator concept, has grid-forming capability in both sides of the converter simultaneously without intermediate energy storage device. Departing from the dc virtual generator control concept, capable of controlling voltage in one of the converter sides while withdrawing the power from the other side, an adaptation is done to make it reversible. A priority weight is assigned to each side voltage control. A weight calculation method, proportional to the voltage deviation from its rated value, is proposed. This weight calculation strategy makes the control system to contribute to the side most in need (using voltage deviation with respect to rated value as an indicator of the neediness). The interlinking converter with the proposed weighted strategy is capable of stable work in grid-forming mode at both sides simultaneously, just requiring a grid-feeding converter with $P/V$ droop to be connected in either side. No control architecture was found in the literature with this capability for dc&#8211;dc interlinking converters. The theoretical discussion has been supported with small-signal analysis and hardware-in-the-loop validation.</description></item><item><title>Minimization of Current Stress for Dual Active Bridge Converters Based on Model Predictive Control With Enhanced ZVS Ability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315245</link><description>Efficiency is a crucial concern for dual active bridge (DAB) converters. Although many studies on novel modulation schemes have attempted to improve the efficiency, achieving the optimal balance between current stress and zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) ability remains challenging. In addition, due to the wide operating range of DABs, small-signal models have to be setup at each equilibrium point to purpose a high performance of liner controllers. Existing works mainly employ the slow-loop to prevent oscillations during transitions, which degrades the dynamic and bandwidth. To address the current state of research, this article proposes a triple-phase-shift modulation combined with model predictive control (MPC) for DABs. Herein, a designed cost function initially calculates shift-angles. Subsequently, a proposed optimization segment for ZVS checks and revises the ZVS ability to select an optimal set of shift angles. The current stress is minimized on the premise that the wide range of ZVS is guaranteed. Meanwhile, the dynamic performance is improved through the nonlinearity of MPC. Finally, a 1.4-kW scaled-down prototype is built, and the experimental comparisons with other schemes verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Federated-Learning-Based Distributed Frequency Control Against False Data Injection Attack</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10305493</link><description>This article proposes the federated-learning-based second-order recurrent neural network (SORNN&#8211;FL) for distributed frequency control of a multimicrogrid (MMG) system. The problem is conceptualized as proportional&#8211;integral derivative consensus control using the Lyapunov function, which depicts the behavior of recurrent neural network (RNN). The parameters of the controller are obtained by deriving the dynamics of energy function to update the state of neurons. During the learning process, FL of weights is adopted to improve the performance of the network by increasing the communication among the neurons. The effectiveness of the developed SORNN&#8211;FL controller is tested for the MMG system, and its performance is compared with those of the MMG system using SORNN, RNN, and the conventional method of tuning. The results obtained reveal that the proposed higher order control gives an improved performance during uncertainties and communication failure. Specifically, we use a differential privacy mechanism to secure the data from false data injection attacks by the invaders. The various extensive cases studied on the MMG system demonstrate that the proposed privacy-preserving-based SORNN&#8211;FL scheme is robust and efficient. Even if a communication failure and a malicious attack occur in the MMG system, our proposed control scheme can regulate the system frequency and maintain system stability. The real-time validation has been demonstrated at the 0.4-kV microgrid test-bed system in the laboratory.</description></item><item><title>A New Macro Dynamic Demand Response Strategy Considering Micro Power Quality Disturbance for Wind-Storage Integrated System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304361</link><description>This article developed a new methodology of macro dynamic demand response (DDR) strategy considering micropower quality disturbance (PQD) for wind-storage integrated systems. A novel idea has been presented in this methodology to eliminate the barrier of PQD and renewable energy dynamic adjustment. At the microlevel for PQD elimination, a filtering strategy of Butterworth&#8211;Wiener filter (Bw-WF) is proposed to deal with the frequency interference PQD in wind-storage integrated system by Bw and the WF. The method connects the macro DDR and the PQD elimination at the microlevel for the stable wind power output after PQD elimination. At the macrolevel for dynamic adjustment, the Hampel&#8211;Savitzky&#8211;Golay macropower filtering method is proposed to calculate the low-frequency power in line with the national standards. Considering all wind power participates in the DDR, the change of DDR and the adjusted power curves are calculated based on the Logistics function, optimistic response, and pessimistic response factors. Through the experimental verification, it is found that the power and state of charge curves of energy storage can be significantly changed by the subtle dynamic changes during an ultra-short period. Also, it is demonstrated that the theoretical method proposed in this article is reliable and promising.</description></item><item><title>Offline Equalization Control of Modular Multilevel Converter-Based Battery Energy Storage System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10323264</link><description>The modular multilevel converter-based battery energy storage system (MMC-BESS) can help the power grid to run safely and stably, which plays an important role in the modern power grid. The inconsistency of cells in BESS may lead to overcharge or overdischarge of cells, which may decrease the operation life of battery packs and cause safety problems. Normally, before the MMC-BESS is connected to the grid, it is necessary to prebalance the system batteries in an offline state. This article analyzes the topology, the mathematical model, and the equalization control model in offline MMC-BESS. According to the analysis, an offline MMC-BESS stepwise balancing control strategy considering the state of charge, state of health, and state of function, is proposed. In this strategy, the state of dischargeable energy is set as the criterion of offline equalization of the system. The balancing of submodules in MMC-BESS would be achieved by controlling the circulating currents and voltages of arms. Finally, the feasibility of the offline equalization control strategy is verified by simulation and experiment.</description></item><item><title>Novel DC-Bus Voltage Controller for Three-Phase Photovoltaic Microinverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10269717</link><description>In this article, a novel fast dc-bus voltage controller is proposed for the application of a three-phase photovoltaic microinverter. A three-phase microinverter, comprising a two-stage power conversion architecture, consists of a small dc-bus capacitor due to the absence of any low-frequency power oscillations. However, conventional voltage controllers used to regulate the dc-bus voltage result in large transient voltage fluctuations that can result in unnecessary interruptions in inverter operation. Therefore, a fast responding voltage controller is proposed that results in reducing the voltage fluctuations in the dc-bus during transients, leading to stable and robust operation of the microinverter. The proposed controller is implemented using a lookup table so that the computational burden of the digital processor does not increase. The theoretical analysis and the superior performance of the proposed control system are verified through a 1.2-kW experimental prototype of a three-phase microinverter.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Dual-LC Resonant DC Circuit Breaker Employing Soft-Switching Technique for Enhanced Performance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10288138</link><description>DC circuit breakers (DCCBs) are crucial equipment to ensure safe and stable operation of the dc systems. Resonant DCCBs (RCBs) have recently gained significant attention due to their ability to generate multiple zero-crossing points for mechanical switches, which leads to high reliability. However, existing solutions either necessitate the use of precharged capacitors or have continuous hard-switching requirements for power electronic devices, which require improvement in terms of both economy and reliability. To address these challenges, this article proposes a dual-LC RCB employing soft-switching technique for enhanced performance. The dual-LC RCB adds an additional LC circuit in parallel with the power electronic devices and oscillate synergistically with the original main LC circuit. This configuration achieves soft-switching on power electronic devices, significantly reducing the potential for damage caused by high junction temperatures. As a result, the dual-LC RCB offers improved reliability. The topology structure and operation principle of dual-LC RCB are first introduced, followed by a complete parameter optimization design method. A 10 kV/10 kA prototype is constructed to verify the interruption capability of the topology structure and the correctness of the parameter design principle.</description></item><item><title>Coordinate Sizing and Control of the Onboard Pulse Power Supply System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10273139</link><description>Onboard pulse power load features a high peak-to-average ratio, which would significantly impact the stable operation of the power supply system (PSS). Specifically, the supply voltage may reduce dramatically and eventually trigger system protection, thus sacrificing reliability. One effective way to address this issue is to connect an active capacitor, which is defined as a capacitor with a bidirectional dc/dc converter, to the power supply's output. However, as the active capacitor is usually used to accommodate all the pulsed load with the conventional control schemes, the power supply's specific power would be limited due to the less optimized system's volume, making its implementation constrained. In this article, a coordinate sizing strategy is first proposed. The system's volume is minimized by using the battery to supply a portion of the pulsed load. Afterward, a simple pulsed current reference generation method is proposed for the active capacitor. The pulse power tracking performance is further improved. A prototype of a pulse PSS with 2.7-kW constant power and 30-kW peak power is designed in the lab. The experimental results verify the validity of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive Stabilization Strategy for Harmonic Oscillation of SAPF Interacted With Nonlinear Load and Grid Impedance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10311351</link><description>A shunt active power filter (SAPF) can interact with the nonlinear load and grid impedance, which may lead to unexpected harmonic oscillation. To describe the interaction, this article builds the interaction model including the source-current-detected SAPF, nonlinear load, and grid impedance. The interaction model reveals that the harmonic oscillation is prone to occur when the passive resonant frequency from grid impedance and nonlinear loads gets close to the harmonic frequency compensated by SAPF. This kind of harmonic oscillation is normally unpredictable because grid impedance and state of the nonlinear load continuously change. To cope with it, this article proposes a harmonic oscillation observation and adaptive stabilization strategy, which is implemented by monitoring and controlling the phase trajectory of the grid harmonic current through adjusting the phase and emergency damping factor of the harmonic resonant controllers in SAPF. This strategy has low requirement on real-time calculation and does not affect the dynamic response of the SAPF. In the end, the effectiveness of the stabilization strategy is verified by experiment results.</description></item><item><title>Feedback Control of Doubly-Fed Generator Connected to Current Source Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10293255</link><description>Doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) system supplied by current source converter (CSC) is considered in this article. The DFIG can work in two independent modes: AC grid connection and stand-alone mode. The DFIG is connected to the ac grid directly through its stator and the CSC links the rotor side. In this mode, the active and reactive powers of the DFIG must be controlled. This article proposes two control system structures for the DFIG working in the generator mode. Both control structures are based on nonlinear transformations but on different state-feedback control variables. The selection of the variables is similar to the input&#8211;output linearization but more complicated due to the CSC and &#8220;voltage control&#8221; involved. Both proposed control structures ensure independent control of the active and reactive powers with different accuracies; as evidenced in the simulation and experimental results. The proposed approach can be named by voltage control of the DFIG because the control variables are the voltage in the dc-link and the angular speed of the output current vector from the inverter. For both proposed control structures, the current in the dc-link is not a constant value, but depends on the dynamic states and values of the controlled powers; thus, it varies accordingly. The proposed control strategy can be applied to low- and high-power DFIG systems. Simulation and experimental results from a 2-kW generator validate theoretical propositions.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Hierarchical Energy Management System With Plug-and-Play Capability for Neighborhood Home Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10288140</link><description>With the increasing adoption of renewable energy sources, researchers are actively engaged in the development of smart grid technologies. This study introduces a home energy management system (HEMS) designed to optimize home microgrid (HMG) operation by integrating electric vehicles (EVs) through a hierarchical three-level distributed control approach. The proposed system governs the power transfer of distributed energy sources through converter control at the primary level, while employing an intelligent optimal power exchange technique for EVs and energy storage (ES) at the secondary level. To achieve optimal energy demand management, the system employs a two-layer strategy, comprising offline and online scheduling, utilizing particle swarm optimization and artificial neural network to reduce computing time. The offline scheduling formulates a deterministic optimization model to minimize HMG operation costs, thereby extending ES lifetime through optimal load-sharing. The online scheduling approach enables real-time performance under uncertainty and accommodates plug-and-play renewable energy sources, HMGs, loads, and batteries. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is tested using MATLAB/Simulink simulations over a 24-h period, affirming its ability to respond promptly to HEMS status changes and adapt decision-making methods to new conditions with improved training time and reduced mean square error. In addition, experimental studies on two laboratory-based HMGs demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed HEMS.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Model-Free Adaptive Control Strategy for Hybrid AC/DC Microgrid With Event-Triggered Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10324405</link><description>A distributed control strategy (DCS) is an efficient way to realize power sharing among distributed generators (DGs) and restore the voltage deviation caused by droop control. However, there are several limitations in the traditional strategy of hybrid ac/dc microgrid (MG), such as the heavy communication burden and sensitivity to the working conditions. In this article, a distributed model-free adaptive control strategy (DMFAC) is proposed with an event-triggered (ET) mechanism. A unified control framework of hybrid MG is established and the ET-DMFAC can operate within it to realize multiple control strategies simultaneously. The dynamic linearization parameters of hybrid MG are estimated online to reflect the working condition, and an ET mechanism is designed to reduce the communication burden. The stability of ET-DMFAC is analyzed with the discrete Lyapunov theory and experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed ET-DMFAC strategy under different operating conditions. The outperformance of ET-DMFAC is demonstrated by comparing it with many existing DCS of hybrid AC/DC MG.</description></item><item><title>Output Current Quality Improvement for VSC With Capability of Compensating Voltage Harmonics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10321720</link><description>Using the voltage source converter (VSC) to compensate for voltage harmonics at the point of common coupling (PCC) is beneficial for the power supply quality in the regional power grid. However, it leads to a significant deterioration of output current quality for VSC. This article aims to develop the design principle and realization method for impedance reshaping in VSC used for compensating voltage harmonics with the minimal sacrifice of the output current quality. By revealing the coupling constraint between the voltage harmonics of PCC and the output current harmonics of VSC, a harmonics impedance design principle for VSC is proposed. This principle indicates that the impedance phase of VSC should be identical to the phase of grid impedance at the frequency of harmonics. Hence, an impedance reshaping strategy based on the variable-phase reduced-order generalized integrator is developed, which can reshape the VSC's impedance to fulfill the harmonics impedance design principle under different grid conditions. Compared to existing studies, the proposed harmonics impedance design principle and realization method meet the same requirement of the voltage quality at PCC with a lower VSC's output current quality sacrifice. Theoretical analysis and experiments are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>A Current Controllable Active Transient-Voltage Compensation Circuit for Voltage Regulator Module</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10311370</link><description>In this article, a novel current controllable active transient-voltage-compensation circuit (CC-ATVCC) is proposed to mitigate output voltage overshoot and undershoot in voltage regulator module (VRM) during load transients. The current difference between the VRM output and the load is compensated by field effect transistors in the proposed CC-ATVCC so that the output voltage spikes are suppressed. In the proposed CC-ATVCC, a high gain analog drive circuit, consisting of an operational amplifier cascaded with a common-source amplification circuit, provides adjustable drive voltage, which flexibly changes the compensation current. Furthermore, a time-domain model is developed in this article to analyze the interaction between VRM and the proposed CC-ATVCC, guiding the circuit design under universal conditions. Finally, the proposed CC-ATVCC has been built and tested in a 12-phase 500 A interleaved buck converter. The results show that the overshoot of the output voltage can be reduced by 34% using the proposed CC-ATVCC and the footprint of CC-ATVCC is only 10% compared with the traditional capacitor-only solution. The proposed CC-ATVCC can reduce the number of output capacitors and greatly increase the power density of VRM.</description></item><item><title>Incentivized Coordinated Heat-Electricity-Gas Dispatch: A Zero Knowledge Proof-Based Solution Considering Privacy and Anti-Forgery</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10183368</link><description>The coordination of multienergy systems has been commonly adopted to improve energy utilization performance. Reallocating profits of all systems is utilized to provide incentives for the coordination. However, some systems might forge their profits to maliciously obtain more reallocated profits. Existing works partially solve this problem by developing privacy-preserving anti-forgery methods that focus on the coordination of two energy systems with linear constraints. This article proposes a coordinated heat-electricity-gas dispatch mechanism that addresses incentive, privacy and anti-forgery issues. The coordination model based on Nash bargaining is decomposed into both a dispatch problem that maximizes the total profit and a profit reallocation problem that provides incentives. The profit reallocation problem is solved using exponential ElGamal encryption to avoid leaking the profit variation of each system before and after coordination. Furthermore, to prevent any system from forging its profit for maliciously obtaining more reallocated profit, we propose a privacy-preserving anti-forgery method based on zero knowledge proof. The method enables each system to prove that its profit variation satisfies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the dispatch problem with nonlinear constraints. The numerical tests show that our proposed method provides incentives for coordination and detects forgery of profit variation without leaking privacy.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Privacy-Preserving Secondary Control for DC Microgrids via State Decomposition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10207776</link><description>In this article, a distributed secondary controller is proposed for an islanded DC microgrid to preserve privacy information of the local power sources, while achieving current sharing among the generators and voltage regulation of the DC bus. Based on the state decomposition mechanism, the original secondary control signal of each generator is decomposed into two parts: one takes over the role of communicating with neighbors, while the other affects the evolution of the former one and is invisible to the neighbors. Besides, random noises are introduced to mask the true value of the transmitted signals. Under the proposed controller, the current data of the local generators can be kept confidential, as well as the associated privacy power information. In this way, the power security risks caused by privacy information leakage can be avoided. Lastly, both simulation and experiment tests are imposed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Reactive Current Optimization Based Onshore AC Fault Ride-Through Strategy for MMC-HVDC Integrated Offshore Wind Farms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10207701</link><description>Onshore AC faults may cause the modular multilevel converter based high voltage direct current integrated offshore wind farms (MMC-HVDC-OWF) to develop surplus power and trigger overvoltage problems. This article proposes a dynamic reactive current optimization (DRO) strategy that combines MMC energy control capability with transient overload capability to achieve onshore AC fault ride-through (ACFRT). Firstly, the decoupling control mechanism and constraints of the active and reactive currents of the onshore gird-side MMC (GSMMC) are analyzed. Furthermore, a dynamic reactive current optimization based ACFRT strategy is proposed based on the current constraints and the energy control capability of MMCs. The main parameters of DRO are set according to the fault characteristic analysis results. Once a fault occurs, the proposed DRO based ACFRT strategy can control the offshore surplus power by controlling the MMC internal sub-module energy. The DRO strategy quickly optimizes the active and reactive power output commands of the GSMMC by collecting and comparing the local power signals. It enables to increase the onshore AC grid voltage and the transient active power output of the MMC-HVDC-OWF. Finally, The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified through comprehensive case studies conducted on the PSCAD/EMTDC.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive PI Control of Wave Energy Converters With Force and Motion Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10207822</link><description>This article presents the application of adaptive PI control design to a point absorber - wave energy converter (WEC) under force and motion constraints. Adaptive PI control has several features that make it attractive for WEC system. In particular, it has a clear physical interpretation. The &#8220;P&#8221; component converts the wave energy into useful energy, while the &#8220;I&#8221; component changes the WEC system natural frequency allowing the absorber to be more in phase with the incoming waves. However, standard adaptive PI control schemes in the literature do not have the ability to incorporate the constraints in the design phase. The main objective of this article is to fill this gap by proposing a new adaptive PI control law that can take the constraints into account. Simulation results show that the new control law can improve the performance while respecting system limitations.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Optimization of Photovoltaic Power With Lifted Linear Decision Rule for Distribution System Voltage Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10214028</link><description>This article proposes a lifted linear decision rule (LLDR) as a photovoltaic (PV) power control strategy for distribution system voltage regulation. First, the active-reactive power control is designed as a linear function in a lifted space of PV power, which is presented as a piecewise linear function without auxiliary integer variables for benefiting the parameter optimization of control functions. Then, a hierarchical central-local voltage regulation framework is designed. In the central control stage, the constant part of LLDR determines the reactive power of PV units, which is also coordinated with other voltage regulation devices. In the local control stage, the adjustable part of LLDR would control the PV power in real time for reducing voltage deviations. Finally, optimization problems and their solution methods are developed to obtain LLDR parameters. In particular, robust optimization (RO) and distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems are designed to obtain the affine coefficients of LLDR considering multiple PV power uncertainty models. The tractable formula of RO is derived based on the convex hull of PV power uncertainty sets in the lifted space, and Benders decomposition is combined with a distribution separation method to solve the DRO problem. The proposed method is tested on distribution systems with actual PV power data, and the results are compared with those of other linear and piecewise-linear control methods to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in diminishing voltage deviations caused by variable PV power.</description></item><item><title>Active Fault Current Limitation for VSC-MTDC Integrated Offshore Wind Farms Participating in Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10218998</link><description>The onshore local grid is facing the challenge to avoid continuously increasing fault current caused by frequency regulation (FR) of broad-scale offshore wind farms (OWFs) integrated by voltage source converter based multi-terminal high voltage direct current (VSC-MTDC) system. To tackle this challenge, an active fault current limitation (AFCL) method is proposed in four aspects: 1) a fault current contribution factor (FCCF) is introduced for grid side VSC (GSVSC) to quantify the incremental degree of fault current caused by FR of GSVSC under different fault types; 2) a current phase angle control (CPAC) strategy based on vector analysis is conducted for GSVSC to actively mitigate the fault current increment; 3) according to FCCF and CPAC, an active and reactive current quantification (ARCQ) strategy is developed for GSVSC to satisfy bilateral demands of AFCL and FR; 4) an adaptive frequency regulation (AFR) strategy, which considers FCCF and the operating conditions of the offshore system (e.g., rotor speed and DC voltage), is formulated for OWFs to quantify and generate the active power required for FR and AFCL. Numerous test results are analyzed to verify the effectiveness and performance of the proposed AFCL method in satisfying system fault current limitation during FR of OWFs.</description></item><item><title>Uncertainty-Aware Procurement of Flexibilities for Electrical Grid Operational Planning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10221712</link><description>In the power system decarbonization roadmap, novel grid management tools and market mechanisms are fundamental to solving technical problems concerning renewable energy forecast uncertainty. This work proposes a predictive algorithm for procurement of grid flexibility by the system operator (SO), which combines the SO flexible assets with active and reactive power short-term flexibility markets. The goal is to reduce the cognitive load of the human operator when analyzing multiple flexibility options and trajectories for the forecasted load/RES and create a human-in-the-loop approach for balancing risk, stakes, and cost. This work also formulates the decision problem into several steps where the operator must decide to book flexibility now or wait for the next forecast update (time-to-decide method), considering that flexibility (availability) price may increase with a lower notification time. Numerical results obtained for a public MV grid (Oberrhein) show that the time-to-decide method improves up to 22% a performance indicator related to a cost-loss matrix, compared to the option of booking the flexibility now at a lower price and without waiting for a forecast update.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Negative-Emission Optimal Energy Scheduling for Off-Grid Integrated Electricity-Heat Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10224346</link><description>This article proposes a distributionally robust chance-constrained (DRCC) negative-emission optimal energy scheduling scheme for the off-grid integrated electricity-heat microgrid (IEHM). A negative-emission operating strategy is designed to regulate the electric power, thermal power, and carbon emission of the off-grid IEHM under uncertainty. The post-combustion carbon capture system (PCCS) and direct air capture (DAC) modeling consider both electric and thermal energy consumption. Besides, the duration of DAC process flow is considered in its model. In the DRCC energy scheduling model for the off-grid IEHM, the negative emission is achieved by scheduling PCCS and DAC, and the negative emission constraint is included considering the uncertainty of carbon emission. The uncertain forecasting errors of wind power are balanced by coordinating the combined heat and power unit and battery storage. DRCC approach under the moment-based ambiguity set is employed to tackle both uncertainties. The DRCC energy scheduling model is reformulated as a tractable mixed-integer second-order cone programming. Evaluation indices are defined from three aspects, i.e., carbon emission, economy, and reserve capacity, to assess the overall performance of the DRCC energy scheduling scheme for the off-grid IEHM. Case studies were carried out on two test systems to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Simulation results demonstrate that the off-grid IEHM can achieve negative emission operation while minimizing the energy cost under wind power and carbon emission uncertainty.</description></item><item><title>Combined Heat and Power Dispatch Against Cold Waves Utilizing Responsive Internet Data Centers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10224307</link><description>The extreme weather disaster is a main threat to the operation of integrated electricity and heat systems (IEHSs), particularly the cold wave, which is prone to cause surges in regional demand for heat and electricity. In IEHSs, Internet data centers (IDCs) consume a huge amount of electricity and generate waste heat. The former can be regulated spatially by migrating workloads in the interconnected data network and interrupted temporally with the equipped backup generators or uninterruptible power supply (UPS), the latter can be captured and supplied to the districts using heat pump facilities. Thus, energy behaviors of IDCs are impressively responsive, which are completely considered and dispatched to enhance the resilience of IEHSs against cold waves in this paper. Firstly, the integrated energy response (IER) meaning responsive electricity consumption and heat production of IDCs is modelled considering workload scheduling and emergency standby power supply. Secondly, the adverse impacts of cold waves on IEHS operation are comprehensively formulated using intervals considering both component outages and sudden energy demand increases. Moreover, a scenario-based stochastic optimization model with interval parameters is constructed incorporating IER formulations, in which both unit commitment plan of IEHSs and IER strategies of IDCs are simultaneously optimized. Furthermore, a two-stage stochastic-interval solution method is proposed to handle the hybrid heterogeneous uncertainties in the model based on the L-shaped algorithm and interval linear programming theory. Numerical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques using a test IEHS composed of IEEE 118-bus system, seven 32-node heating systems, and eight IDCs.</description></item><item><title>Joint Optimization of Production and Maintenance in Offshore Wind Farms: Balancing the Short- and Long-Term Needs of Wind Energy Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10229237</link><description>The rapid increase in scale and sophistication of offshore wind (OSW) farms poses a critical challenge related to the cost-effective operation and management of wind energy assets. A defining characteristic of this challenge is the economic trade-off between two concomitant processes: power production (the primary driver of short-term revenues), and asset degradation (the main determinant of long-term expenses). Traditionally, approaches to optimize production and maintenance in wind farms have been conducted in isolation. In this article, we conjecture that a joint optimization of those two processes, achieved by rigorously modeling their short- and long-term dependencies, can unlock significant economic benefits for wind farm operators. In specific, we propose a decision-theoretic framework, rooted in stochastic optimization, which seeks a sensible balance of how wind loads are leveraged to harness short-term electricity generation revenues, versus alleviated to hedge against longer-term maintenance expenses. Extensive numerical experiments using real-world data confirm the superior performance of our approach, in terms of several operational performance metrics, relative to methods that tackle the two problems in isolation.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Data Center Energy Management With Hybrid Quantum-Classical Multi-Cuts Benders' Decomposition Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10232912</link><description>The flourishing of the data era has led to a higher demand for hyper-scale data centers, resulting in a great energy gap. It is necessary to comprehensively analyze the energy management in data centers to minimize the operation cost. In this article, we first propose a new optimal energy management model for data centers by considering energy consumers such as heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC), server, solar, and battery. Then, inspired by the great computation power of quantum computing techniques, we propose a new hybrid quantum-classical multi-cuts Benders' decomposition algorithm, which utilizes quantum advantages in parallel computing for generating multi-cuts in a single iteration. Finally, experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the novel model and algorithms.</description></item><item><title>A Two-Stage Stochastic Unit Commitment With Mixed-Integer Recourses for Nuclear Power Plants to Accommodate Renewable Energy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10243161</link><description>To provide flexibilities for peak regulations in power systems while addressing renewable energy uncertainties, this article proposes a two-stage stochastic unit commitment model with peak regulation constraints of nuclear power plants (NPPs) under the &#8220;12-3-6-3&#8221; mode. The first stage aims to determine the optimal thermal unit commitment, and the second stage tries to adjust the operation modes of an NPP and thermal unit generation output to cope with different renewable energy scenarios. Due to the discrete adjustments of NPPs, the proposed model is mathematically a two-stage stochastic optimization with mixed-integer recourses. Furthermore, a Fenchel cut based bilevel decomposition is proposed to solve this model, where the inner second-stage subproblem is first relaxed into a linear program and a Fenchel cut is then generated to recover the facet of the convex hull solution. The technique can significantly accelerate the computational speed of the proposed model with a special mathematical structure. Numerical results on a provincial power system verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and method.</description></item><item><title>Sky-Image-Derived Deep Decomposition for Ultra-Short-Term Photovoltaic Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10246013</link><description>Because of the stochastic and nonstationary weather changes, photovoltaic (PV) power exhibits high uncertainty and fluctuation, which severely challenges the operation of power systems. PV variations can be detected by investigating inherent properties and reflections of sky images. However, limited study has focused on the effect of sky image changes on PV inherent properties. Therefore, in this study, a novel sky-image-derived decomposition method was proposed for ultra-short-term PV power forecasting. First, historical PV series were decomposed into seasonal and trend parts with guidance of sky image sequence. The Auto-Correlation mechanism was adopted to enhance the temporal dependencies of seasonal parts. Then, to reduce the model instability in different weather scenarios, the latent features were handled by an improved density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise using a semi-supervised strategy to identify forecasting scenarios. Finally, a rolling scenario-wise decoder was proposed to conduct multi-step forecasting task. The proposed method was compared with various state-of-the-art methods, including empirical mode decomposition and deep decomposition methods. The results validated the high performance of the proposed method in terms of accuracy within forecast horizons of 5 to 30 min.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Management of Hybrid Energy Station Under Exogenous-Endogenous Uncertainties and Bounded Rationality</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10252038</link><description>Hybrid energy station (HES) systems coupling diverse energy sectors can facilitate the low-carbon and sustainable transition by integrating massive wind-solar power and energy conversion technologies. With the proliferation of renewable and flexible demand response (DR), different uncertainties are inevitably introduced into energy systems because of external volatile surroundings and internal consumers' mutable behavior. Moreover, the probability distribution function (PDF) of these uncertainties may be unavailable or ambiguous and even affected by decisions. In this work, we propose a hierarchical optimal framework for HES systems, in which the energy hub plant determines the schedules of generation and trade in different markets (upper-level) and users minimize energy expense by managing facilities operations considering decision-dependent uncertainties (lower-level). A scheme of energy transaction options is also provided under the bounded rationality of user sides. To tackle problems with uncertain PDFs, a tailored chance-constrained distributionally robust method is implemented. In the process, the correlation DR operation pattern and analytic pricing formulation are derived incorporating the property of users. Case studies with comparison tests validate the efficacy of the proposed model in handling uncertainties and pursuing economic profits.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Service Restoration of Distribution Networks With Volt-Var Devices, Distributed Energy Resources, and Energy Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10251925</link><description>The new energy resources in distribution systems have led researchers to consider the operation of such elements during service restoration. Hence, the current state-of-the-art regarding the restoration problem considers the operation of distributed resources in both island and grid-connected modes. Few articles also address the system's restoration capacity changes throughout the time needed to repair the network after an outage, given the variations in the system's demand and availability of energy sources. However, the solutions proposed in the literature converge in proposing a single topology that is feasible throughout the entire repairing time. In this article, we propose addressing the mutable nature of the system's restoration capacity by splitting the repairing time into several time intervals and associating each of them with a specific configuration that minimizes the out-of-service load. Energy storage systems, intermittent and dispatchable generators, and voltage-control devices are also considered. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). The model and its scalability are tested using the 53-, 217-, and 404-node systems, considering different fault scenarios and reliability indices. The results show that the nonsupplied energy during the repairing time decreases when dynamic changes in the system topology are considered. Furthermore, the effects of storage systems operation and their integration with dynamic topology changes are highlighted.</description></item><item><title>Coordinating Multi-Energy Microgrids for Integrated Energy System Resilience: A Multi-Task Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10255302</link><description>High-impact and low-probability events have occurred more frequently than before, which can seriously damage energy supply infrastructures. As localized small energy systems, multi-energy microgrids (MEMGs) can provide a viable solution for the system-wise load restoration of integrated energy systems (IESs), due to their enhanced flexibility and controllability. However, existing literature tends to realize MEMGs as corrective response rather than load restoration resource after extreme events, which cannot fully exploit the benefits of multi-MEMGs on IES resilience. This article introduces a decentralized operating paradigm for the real-time coordination of local multi-MEMGs towards system-wise IES load restoration, while a novel topology-aware multi-task reinforcement learning method with soft modularization is proposed to solve it. The multi-task learning framework enables MEMGs to simultaneously learn scheduling decisions across different network topologies and better adapt to unanticipated contingencies. Additionally, to avoid insecure MEMG operations, a physics-informed safety layer is embedded on top of the multi-task learning framework for action corrections. Case studies have been conducted on two IESs (33-bus power, 20-node gas, and 20-node heat network as well as 69-bus power, 40-node gas, and 62-node heat network) to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enabling effective coordination among multi-MEMGs towards system-wise IES load restoration.</description></item><item><title>Virtual Inertia Scheduling (VIS) for Real-Time Economic Dispatch of IBR-Penetrated Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10264213</link><description>A new concept called virtual inertia scheduling (VIS) is proposed to efficiently handle the increasing penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) in power systems. VIS is an inertia management framework that targets security-constrained and economy-oriented inertia scheduling and generation dispatch with a large scale of renewable generations. Specifically, it determines the appropriate power setpoint and reserved capacity of synchronous generators and IBRs, as well as the control modes and control parameters of IBRs to provide secure and cost-effective inertia support. First, a uniform system model is employed to quantify the frequency dynamics of IBR-penetrated power systems after disturbances. Leveraging this model, the s-domain and time-domain analytical responses of IBRs with inertia support capability are derived. Then, VIS-based real-time economic dispatch (VIS-RTED) is formulated to minimize generation and reserve costs, with full consideration of dynamic frequency constraints and the derived inertia support reserve constraints. The virtual inertia and damping of IBRs are formulated as decision variables. A deep learning-assisted linearization approach is further employed to address the non-linearity of dynamic constraints. Finally, VIS-RTED is demonstrated on a two-machine system and a modified IEEE 39-bus system. A full-order time-domain simulation is performed to verify the scheduling results.</description></item><item><title>Proactive Scheduling of Mixed Energy Resources At Different Grid Levels</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10265110</link><description>The optimal utilisation of distribution grids requires the proactive management of volatilities caused by mixed energy resources installed into different grid levels, such as buildings, energy communities (ECs) and substations. In this context, proactive control based on predictions for energy demand and generation is applied. The mitigation of conflicts between the stakeholders' objectives is the main challenge for the control of centralized and distributed energy resources. In this article, a bi-level approach is proposed for the control of stationary battery energy storage systems (SBES) supporting the local distribution system operator (DSO) at the transformer level, as well as distributed energy resources (DERs) operated by end customers, i.e., EC-members. Model predictive control (MPC)-based and hybrid approaches merging rule- and MPC-based control schemes are evaluated. Simulation studies based on a typical European low voltage (LV) feeder topology yield the performance assessment in terms of technical and economic criteria. The results show an advantage of hybrid approaches with respect to the DSO's cost savings from peak shaving. From the EC's perspective, both hybrid and MPC-based schemes can achieve effective cost savings from proactive energy management.</description></item><item><title>An Anti-Windup Mechanism for State Constrained Linear Control of Wave Energy Conversion Systems: Design, Synthesis, and Experimental Assessment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10266789</link><description>Motivated by the necessity of suitable state constraint mechanisms within linear time-invariant (LTI) energy-maximising control of wave energy converters (WECs), we present, in this article, an anti-windup (AW) scheme for state constraint satisfaction, where the associated unconstrained controller is designed via impedance-matching theory for WEC systems. As in the standard (input) AW scenario, the adopted technique provides a mechanism for &#8216;informing&#8217; the (unconstrained) controller when constraints are active, so that appropriate modifications to future control actions can be taken accordingly. The overall adopted AW technique is tested experimentally, on a prototype of the Wavestar WEC system, available at Aalborg University (Denmark). We explicitly demonstrate that the proposed AW scheme is able to consistently respect the defined state constraints, having a mild impact on overall energy absorption performance when compared to its unconstrained counterpart.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Objective Estimation of Optimal Prediction Intervals for Wind Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268627</link><description>Accurate and reliable wind power forecasting is crucial for efficient operation in a power system. Due to the substantial uncertainties associated with wind generation, probabilistic interval forecasting offers a distinct approach for assessing and quantifying the potential impacts and risks that may arise from the integration of wind energy into a power system. This article proposes a novel multi-objective lower upper bound estimation method to directly construct optimal wind power intervals without the assumption of any specific distribution function. Prediction intervals at a nominal confidence level are formulated through simultaneously optimizing the Winkler loss and coverage probability. The proposed framework is gradient descent-enabled and therefore allows flexible integration of various deep learning algorithms. An evaluation using four wind power datasets is conducted, and the results are analyzed and compared with those from several benchmark models. The findings indicate the proposed method outperforms its counterparts in terms of both reliability and overall performance.</description></item><item><title>Collaborative Response of Data Center Coupled With Hydrogen Storage System for Renewable Energy Absorption</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10269736</link><description>The demand response of data center is considered as an effective flexible method to absorb excessive renewable energy (RE) in the power system, especially for the data center with high-density hydrogen storages. Therefore, this article proposes a collaborative response framework considering regulations of data workload and hydrogen storage. It is expected to further improve the data center flexibility. However, this collaborative response is a high-order and non-convex optimization problem involving the multi-period and complex model. Considering the condition of uncertain RE supply, it is difficult for power optimization dispatch to realize the precise decision in this NP-hard problem. To address this issue, a global interval optimization (GIO) approach is developed. It is to obtain efficient and robust decisions in the collaborative response. This approach deduces an interval optimization model to achieve the global optimality of convergent solution. Furthermore, this article introduces a probability correction into the GIO approach. It is used for improving the decision accuracy in the actual renewable power scenarios. A case study based on the IEEE 24-bus system verifies superiority of the GIO approach. It further validates effectiveness of the collaborative response framework for RE utilization.</description></item><item><title>A Regulation Method Considering Coupled Voltage Violation and Unbalance in Three-Phase Four-Wire Hybrid AC/DC LVDNs With High Penetration PVs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10272708</link><description>Low-voltage distribution networks (LVDNs) have witnessed an increasing penetration of distributed photovoltaics (PVs), which exacerbates the existing voltage violation and voltage unbalance issues. PVs, energy storage systems, and voltage source converters can regulate voltages in hybrid AC/DC LVDNs. To solve the above two voltage problems simultaneously, a partition-based coordinated regulation method is proposed in this article considering the coupling of the two issues and the effect of active power on reactive power in electrical distance calculation. The voltage adjustments in different voltage violation scenarios are obtained based on a graph that describes the coupling of the two issues mathematically. In order to better determine control devices, the equivalent coefficient of active power adjustment on electrical distance calculation is considered in the partition method, in which regulation efficiency, regulation cost, and regulation capability are used as objectives.

However, the cooperation among large-scale prosumers is rarely investigated and there is an urgent need to formulate an appropriate strategy. Hence, a multi-step clustering and generalized Nash bargaining (GNB)-based CSES joint planning strategy for large-scale prosumers is proposed. First, a CSES planning-oriented multi-step clustering algorithm based on nonparametric kernel density estimation (NPKDE) and a modified fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm is proposed to reduce the input data dimensionality of the planning model. Then, taking the optimal construction time sequence into consideration, a bi-level CSES joint planning model is established to minimize the total costs of prosumers. On this basis, a contribution rate index is designed to evaluate prosumers' bargaining power, and a GNB-based allocation strategy is formulated for realizing fair cost allocation. Finally, case studies show that the proposed strategy can help large-scale prosumers effectively deal with the joint CSES planning problem and achieve lower investment and operation costs. It also demonstrates that the proposed cost allocation approach is more efficient and practical than other cooperative game-based methods.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Coordinated Control Strategy for Frequency Regulation of MMC-HVDC Connecting Offshore Wind Farms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10278216</link><description>To solve the problems of weak inertia support and poor frequency regulation capability of power system, a novel coordinated control strategy for frequency regulation of MMC-HVDC connecting offshore wind farms (OWFs) is proposed to improve system frequency stability. In terms of inertia support, based on analyzing the available energy margin of MMC-HVDC, a virtual inertia control method based on decoupling control of DC voltage and capacitor voltage is proposed, which can fully utilize the energy margin of capacitors and improve its inertia support capability. The coupling relationship between the rotor speed of wind turbines and the frequency is directly established through DC voltage, an inertia support coordinated control strategy for MMC-HVDC and OWFs is designed to realize the rational utilization of available energy. In terms of primary frequency regulation, according to the local DC voltage, a primary frequency regulation control strategy is proposed for OWFs based on the variable speed control and pitch angle control. The overall coordination is realized through the reasonable design of control links and parameters, so as to improve the frequency stability of the system. Finally, the simulation model of MMC-HVDC connecting OWFs is built to verify the validity of the proposed control strategies.</description></item><item><title>Neural Networks-Based Inverter Control: Modeling and Adaptive Optimization for Smart Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10283888</link><description>The optimal voltage control of inverter-based resources, especially under the high penetration of solar photovoltaics, is critical to the stability of the distribution power system. However, the computational complexity as well as the coordinated operation performance of the voltage control optimization in the distribution power system limits the real-time applications. To mitigate this issue, a model-free based adaptive optimal control scheme for the smart inverter is proposed to maximize the active power generation, minimize the power loss, and maintain the bus voltages in smart distribution networks. An inverter-based optimization model for coordinated operation is first established, considering the uncertainties of renewable power generation. Subsequently, by collecting the data and control strategies, the neural networks (NNs) based algorithm is proposed to efficiently predict the best possible control strategy. The main objective of this scheme is to accurately predict candidate optimal solutions with near-negligible feasibility and optimization gaps, with the advantage of avoiding complicated iteration-based numerical algorithms. Thereafter, the co-simulation among OpenDSS, MATLAB, and Python is set up to fully take advantage of the three individual software. Experiments are conducted based on different control parameter characteristics and structures of NNs. The results reveal that an average mean squared error of 0.013 and 1 ms response time are achieved, which is lower than some state-of-the-art methods.</description></item><item><title>A Control Method Using Two Electromotive Forces and a Disturbance Observer to Improve the Dynamics of a Virtual Synchronous Machine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10285072</link><description>The modern power grid is facing a significant challenge due to decreasing grid inertia, which is caused by the high penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs). Virtual synchronous machines (VSMs) have been considered as effective solutions to support the grid by providing inertial responses similar to that of traditional synchronous machines. However, fast and flexible dynamic responses to reference inputs, which can be achieved by conventional RES interfacing inverters, are degraded when inverters emulate the behavior of a synchronous machine. In this article, a current-referencing electrified synchronous machine (CURESYM) is proposed as a control method to adjust the dynamics to the reference input regardless of the parameter settings for emulating a synchronous generator. That is, the output current of CURESYM can be regulated with an intended dynamic response to follow the current reference. In addition, the accuracy of the current regulation can be enhanced by virtue of a disturbance observer. The fundamental characteristics of CURESYM are described with laboratory-scale experimental results. Finally, the effectiveness of CURESYM is discussed with practical data from on-site tests that applied the proposed method to a battery energy storage system in an actual island microgrid.</description></item><item><title>Day-Ahead PV Power Forecasting Model Based on Fine-Grained Temporal Attention and Cloud-Coverage Spatial Attention</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292906</link><description>With the increase of grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) power plants, measuring the uncertainty of PV output forecast due to multiple meteorological factors has become an important method to ensure the stable operation of the power system. However, the manual similar days' extraction methods of historical power features and cloud motion features, which are commonly used for PV spatial-temporal prediction, are inefficient and coarse-grained. In this paper, focusing on automatic attention of the local similar sequences in daily features, we improve the attention scoring method of the original transformer to increase the calculation accuracy of the similarity of PV power sequences. We construct an end-to-end PV power prediction framework using an encoder-decoder architecture. Based on the spatial-temporal similarity characteristics of PV output, the fine-grained temporal and cloud-covered spatial attentions embedded in the prediction framework are proposed using the improved similar sequence attention module. Among them, fine-grained temporal attention can dynamically position and utilize similar historical PV power sequences for the predicted period; cloud-coverage spatial attention automatically captures the neighbor site's matching PV power sequences. Experiments were conducted on a real PV dataset, and the root mean square error was reduced by 21.34% on average compared to the baseline model. The results proved the effectiveness of the proposed model.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Wind Power Scenario Generation Based on Conditional Latent Diffusion Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10296015</link><description>Quantifying short-term uncertainty in wind power plays a crucial role in power system decision-making. In recent years, the scenario generation community has conducted numerous studies employing generative models. Among these generative models, diffusion models have shown remarkable capabilities with excellent posterior representation. However, diffusion models are seldom used to quantify renewable energy uncertainty. To fill this research gap, this manuscript proposes a novel conditional latent diffusion model (CLDM) adapted for short-term scenario generation. CLDM decomposes the wind power scenario generation task into deterministic forecasting and forecast error scenario generation. The embedding network is used to regress deterministic forecasts, which reduces the denoising complexity of diffusion models. The denoising network generates forecast error scenarios in a latent space. Subsequently, the wind power scenarios are reconstructed by combining deterministic forecasts and forecast error scenarios. The case study compares with existing state-of-the-art methods, CLDM demonstrates superior evaluation metrics and enhances the denoising efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Periodic Allocation Mechanism for Allocating Demand Response Reserves Deployed by Multiple Ancillary Services</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10296534</link><description>High penetration of renewable energy resources poses technical and economic challenges to system operation. Utilizing demand response to provide ancillary services is beneficial to the security of the grid, but for this, an adequate level of reserves to support possible ancillary services is required. Reasonable allocation of the demand response reserves (DRREs) deployed by different ancillary services can guarantee performance and participant profits during ancillary service provision. An allocation mechanism that periodically allocates DRREs for various ancillary services considering uncertainty and demand response resource (DRR) sufficiency is proposed to address this problem. The participants include purchasers and providers of DRRs. First, K-means clustering is used to obtain the occurrence characteristics of different ancillary service events. Second, the utility functions of the participants in the allocation process are modeled while fully considering the uncertainty in periodic allocation. Then, different types of Stackelberg games are formulated to determine the DRREs deployed by different ancillary services under different DRR sufficiency situations. Finally, an intraday scheduling method is presented to optimize the use of the allocated DRREs and achieve the expected regulation performance. Simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed allocation mechanism in terms of achieving a win-win situation for all participants.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Incentive Pricing on Charging Stations for Real-Time Congestion Management in Distribution Network: An Adaptive Model-Based Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10298595</link><description>This paper concerns the pricing strategy for real-time distribution network congestion management, aiming at maximizing the total social welfare while eliminating congestion. The difficulty lies in dealing with the complex time-varying relationship between price and charging demand in the integrated power system and transportation network, and ensuring the safe application of the proposed method with limited real historical data. To address these challenges, we first model the EV user charging decision-making process to indirectly reflect the unquantifiable price and demand relationship, and then formulate the pricing problem as a bi-level model with a constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). After that, we propose a model-based safe DRL framework and develop an adaptive model-based safe deep reinforcement learning (AMSDRL) algorithm to solve the CMDP problem. AMSDRL learns the environment transition model and uses a strict and adaptive cost constraint to offset potential modeling errors. Compared to the state-of-the-art safe DRL methods, AMSDRL can be deployed with security guarantees by training on limited historical data, which is more practical for applications. The numerical results on modified IEEE 33-bus and 118-bus systems and a transportation network with real-world EV data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Autonomous Energy Management Strategy for Multi-Paralleled Hybrid Energy Storage Systems in the DC Microgrid With Mismatched Line Impedance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10298785</link><description>In this paper, a decentralized P-V$^{2}$ droop-based energy management strategy for the hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs), including multiple batteries/supercapacitors (SCs), in the DC microgrid is proposed. By using the output voltage of the SC converter as the unified feedback voltage in each HESS, the impacts of non-negligible and mismatched line impedance on the power allocation performance and bus voltage tracking are eliminated. Compared with the I-V droop-based method, the adopted P-V$^{2}$ droop technique improves the stability of the HESS, especially considering the constant power loads (CPLs). In addition, the state-of-charge (SoC) recovery is considered for the SCs to prolong the service life of the HESSs. Finally, the experiment and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations have been carried out for the studied system to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.</description></item><item><title>A Bayesian Hierarchical Model to Understand the Effect of Terrain on Wind Turbine Power Curves</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10301539</link><description>This paper is concerned with explicitly modeling the effect of terrain on wind power curves. Terrain characteristics are spatially-varying but temporally constant, whereas other power curve-affiliating variables such wind speed, temperature, and wind power vary both spatially and temporally. In order to effectively model such two modes of variation in the data, we employ a Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) that connects the terrain characteristics with the parameters in a power curve. BHM jointly models the data from all turbines on a wind farm for attaining the turbine-specific, terrain-incorporating power curves. Our analysis shows that, out of the three terrain variables available in our data, ruggedness has the strongest effect on the power curve. We also evaluate the applicability of using the resulting power curve model for turbines on a different terrain and find that incorporating terrain information explicitly is beneficial. The specific BHM mechanism of using terrain information leads to 7&#8211;10% improvement over the group averaging approach.</description></item><item><title>A Stochastic Charging Station Deployment Model for Electrified Taxi Fleets in Coupled Urban Transportation and Power Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10306294</link><description>Metropolitansworldwide are increasingly adopting electric taxis (ET) to address concerns about transportation-related emissions. However, the widespread deployment of electric taxis presents challenges in terms of increased electricity demand and changing demand profiles. This transition impacts both the urban transportation network (TN) and the electricity power distribution network (PDN), highlighting the interdependence between these two systems. In this paper, we propose a two-stage stochastic programming planning model that aims to optimize both the TN and PDN, enabling efficient deployment of charging stations and grid upgrades. Our model seeks to strike a balance between meeting ET drivers' charging preferences, minimizing the costs associated with infrastructure deployment and grid expansion, and harmonizing the coordination between the TN and PDN. Additionally, we explore the potential benefits of utilizing an autonomous ET fleet to enhance overall system performance.</description></item><item><title>Low-Voltage Survivability of Islanded Microgrids With Mixture of Single-Phase and Three-Phase DGs under Harmonic Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308631</link><description>Unbalanced low-voltage survivability of islanded microgrids under three-phase nonlinear load conditions in terms of primary control of distributed generations (DGs) is a research gap. This paper bridges the gap by proposing dynamic-sliding mode controller (SMC) for the voltage control loop and a novel current limiting strategy (CLS) based on the sliding-discrete Fourier transform (DFT) algorithm. The proposed sliding-DFT-based CLS separates fundamental and harmonic components of the reference value of inverter current and only restricts its fundamental component to a value less than the threshold value. The proposed dynamic-SMC, which presents robust performance with low chattering phenomenon, in combination with the sliding-DFT-based CLS prevents DG's output voltage distortion. This feature is favorable for supplying local and sensitive loads. Moreover, single-phase washout filter-based power sharing method has been implemented to ensure precise active power sharing and frequency regulation of the microgrid with mixture of single-phase and three-phase DGs during asymmetrical short-circuit faults as well as better fault clearance dynamics than the conventional three-phase droop control method. The offline and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation results also confirm the effectiveness of the proposed CLS and voltage controller applied to the control structure of DGs operating in the grid-forming mode in comparison with existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Secondary Control With an Event-Triggered Consensus-Based Observer for Energy Storage Systems in Islanded DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10306326</link><description>This paper proposes a distributed secondary control strategy with an event-triggered consensus-based observer. Firstly, a voltage-shifting term is introduced in the proposed control strategy to ensure accurate current sharing, faster state-of-charge (SOC) balancing and bus voltage restoration. Since the SOC balancing speed becomes very slow when the difference in SOC between battery energy units (BEUs) is small, and SOC balancing of BEUs with low power is difficult. Therefore, an adaptive SOC balancing factor to improve the balancing speed is proposed in this control strategy. In addition, communication delay can lead to large errors in traditional consensus-based observers, and continuous communication can bring a significant burden. Considering these issues, the event-triggered consensus-based observer is proposed. This observer can achieve accurate average consensus under communication delay and greatly reduce communication burden. The convergence of the proposed observer under communication delay is theoretically proven, and the Zeno behavior is excluded. At last, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy has been verified in MATLAB/Simulink and RT-LAB experiments.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Agent Graph Reinforcement Learning Method for Electric Vehicle on-Route Charging Guidance in Coupled Transportation Electrification</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10310266</link><description>This paper proposes a multi-agent deep graph reinforcement learning-based EV on-route charging guidance strategy, aiming at minimizing the charging cost for EV drivers in an uncertain and complex environment. First, a real-time online EV charging guidance framework with bi-timescales coupled transportation electrification is proposed. On the slow timescale, the distribution locational marginal pricing of the node where the charging station is located is solved by the power purchase cost optimization of the power distribution network. On the fast timescale, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning is used to solve real-time EV requests. Second, charging stations are considered as agents, and the potential competition for future charging demand at charging stations is considered. A multi-agent actor critic algorithm with embedded graph attention networks is proposed to optimize charging decision-making of EV drivers, which exploits the interactions between agents&#8217; observations using graph attention networks. Case studies are carried out in a practical area of Xi'an, China. We analyze the necessity of model components. The effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing charging cost and its applicability in PV-equipped scenarios is verified. The convergence performance and scalability are verified by the comparison with SAC and MADDPG algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Committed Carbon Emission Operation Region for Integrated Energy Systems: Concepts and Analyses</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10313074</link><description>A novel concept called the committed carbon emission operation region (CCEOR) of integrated energy systems (IESs) is proposed in this paper, which provides a powerful tool for low-carbon operation analyses (LCOA) of IESs. The CCEOR of IESs is first defined, and a CCEOR model is then proposed by considering the uncertainty of renewable power outputs and the characteristics of low-carbon sequential operation. Based on the nonlinear constraint transformation method and distributionally robust chance-constrained (DRCC) approach, a reformulation method is developed to convert the proposed uncertain nonlinear CCEOR model into a deterministic mixed-integer convex CCEOR model. The characteristics of the CCEOR are investigated. Based on the transformed CCEOR model, the CCEOR is a high-dimensional and bounded region composed of finite convex sub-regions. A region approximation method is then presented to construct the CCEOR. The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed CCEOR model and method are validated by numerical simulation on three test systems. Simulation results indicate that the proposed CCEOR can characterize the low-carbon feasible space (LCFS) visually, the visual coupling relationships between observation variables and LCFS, and the comprehensive low-carbon operation information of operation points.</description></item><item><title>Joint Sizing Optimization Method of PVs, Hybrid Energy Storage Systems, and Power Flow Controllers for Flexible Traction Substations in Electric Railways</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10313989</link><description>Flexible traction substation (FTSS) integrates PVs, energy storage systems (ESSs), and railway power flow controllers (RPFCs) into the existing split-phase traction substation. It is a vital solution in advancing electric railways towards a low-carbon, efficient, and grid-friendly future. To improve the techno-economic performance of FTSSs, this paper proposes a sizing method to jointly size PV, RPFC, and battery-ultracapacitor hybrid ESS (HESS). Firstly, a flexible operation model of FTSS is established. It fully uses the capacity of RPFCs for improving the three-phase voltage unbalance and average power factor, thus, reducing the capacity requirements of RPFCs. Next, a linearized approach is developed for estimating battery aging affected by battery cycles, depth of discharge, state of charge, and calendar time. It facilitates obtaining battery sizing with relatively accurate life evaluation in sizing optimization. Then, a joint sizing optimization model of PV, HESS, and RPFC is established to minimize the total annualized investment and operation cost of an FTSS, and it is formulated as mixed-integer second-order programming. Finally, case studies show that the proposed method can optimize the total annualized cost of FTSSs while ensuring efficient energy utilization and improvements of the three-phase voltage unbalance and average power factor.</description></item><item><title>Novel Black Start Control Strategy With Power Boundary Analysis for PMSG-Based Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10319342</link><description>A novel power boundary analysis-based black start control (PBBC) strategy of PMSG-based wind turbines (WTs) is proposed in this paper to reduce the outage time of WTs and improve the reliability of wind power supply. The active power-rotor speed maximum boundary is quantified to estimate the kinetic energy (KE) reserve limit and the power response capability of the WTs during the black start period. In the power boundary analysis, the power response capability will collapse as the rotor speed increases to maximum. To achieve the trade-off between high KE reserve and power response capability, an overloaded power response control method during the black start period is developed, which can fully utilize the reserved KE. Moreover, the dc-bus capacitor charging model of WTs with initial KE is constructed, which can accurately represent the required KE of the WTs black start. The WTs are coordinated to achieve black start with the minimum backup power supply for the safety devices and auxiliary load according to the capacitor charging model. The proposed PBBC strategy can maximize the KE reserve of the WT and improve the power response capability, as well as reduce the backup power cost during the black start period.</description></item><item><title>Low Carbon Planning of Multiple Integrated Energy Systems Considering Trans-Regional Battery Logistics Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10323512</link><description>With the emergence of integrated energy system (IES) paradigm, planning and control of multiple interconnected IESs starts to draw attention in academia.

Based on these, a low-carbon planning model is formulated for the multi-IES, which aims at minimizing the system's annual cost while satisfying a set of operational constraints. A CPLEX-based numerical optimization approach is developed for solving the proposed planning model and extensive numerical case studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving the energy efficiency and promoting decarbonization for multiple IESs.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Fault Ride-Through and Voltage Support Capability for MMC-HVDC Integrated Offshore Wind Farms Based on Multi-Mode Matching</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10336519</link><description>To cope with onshore AC faults in modular multilevel converter based high voltage direct current integrated offshore wind farms (OWF-MMC-HVDC), this paper proposes a multi-mode matching control (MMMC) approach. Mode I is active energy control. It is activated at high fault levels, when the reactive power output capability of the MMC is weak. Mode I uses the MMC sub-module energy to maximise the absorption of offshore surplus power to mitigate DC overvoltage problems. Mode II is dynamic reactive current optimization (DRO) control. It is activated at medium fault levels. It dynamically optimises the MMC active and reactive current command values within the permitted current margins. This simultaneously enables voltage support to the onshore grid and maximises offshore active power output, reducing offshore surplus power. Mode III is energy coordinated synchronous (ECS) control. It is activated under more mild faults. It allows simultaneous adjustment of the energy absorption rate of the wind farm-side MMC (WFMMC) and the grid-side MMC (GSMMC). This allows the energy margin of the MMCs to be utilised more fully to improve support to the onshore grid while maintaining fault ride-through capability. Finally the correctness and validity of the proposed method was verified by the PSCAD/EMTDC.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Objective Optimization Based Voltage Injection Technique for Minimizing Imbalance and Harmonics in AC Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10347373</link><description>Negative-sequence components and harmonics are generated in the current and voltage of an islanded AC microgrid under unbalanced and nonlinear loading conditions. Without any external controller or feedback signal filter, such components give power-sharing errors and develop voltage distortion at the output of participating inverters associated with particular sources. This paper proposes a decentralized inverter control scheme with an advanced voltage injection technique that minimizes the voltage unbalance factor (VUF) and reduces voltage total harmonic distortion (THD) in a low-voltage AC microgrid using Pareto multi-objective optimization (PMOO). It has a mean function with a second-order filter to minimize the DC offset and distortion in the feedback signal. It manages power sharing in a multi-bus distribution network with an advanced angle droop control. It also accounts for the line impedance, i.e., connecting the inverter unit to the network and the effect of zero sequence components. The simulation is tested on a modified CIGRE LV multi-bus distribution system with four wire configurations and experimentally validated on a two DG, single-bus resistive distribution model.</description></item><item><title>Data Driven Decentralized Control of Inverter Based Renewable Energy Sources Using Safe Guaranteed Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10354415</link><description>The wide integration of inverter based renewable energy sources (RESs) in modern grids may cause severe voltage violation issues due to high stochastic fluctuations of RESs. Existing centralized approaches can achieve optimal results for voltage regulation, but they have high communication burdens; existing decentralized methods only require local information, but they cannot achieve optimal results. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based methods are effective to deal with uncertainties, but it is difficult to guarantee secure constraints in existing DRL training. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes a projection embedded multi-agent DRL algorithm to achieve decentralized optimal control of distribution grids with guaranteed 100% safety. The safety of the DRL training is guaranteed via an embedded safe policy projection, which could smoothly and effectively restrict the DRL agent action space, and avoid any violation of physical constraints in distribution grid operations. The multi-agent implementation of the proposed algorithm enables the optimal solution achieved in a decentralized manner that does not require real-time communication for practical deployment. The proposed method is tested in modified IEEE 33-bus distribution and compared with existing methods; the results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving decentralized optimal control with guaranteed 100% safety and without the requirement of real-time communications.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Objective Stochastic Optimization Approach for Planning a Multi-Energy Microgrid Considering Unscheduled Islanded Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10354526</link><description>The multi-energy microgrid (MEMG) improves the energy supply economy through a multi-energy coupling operation. However, due to faults or maintenance, outages may occur in the main grid, forcing the MEMG switch to the islanded mode, which heavily impacts the energy supply reliability. To solve this problem, a multi-objective stochastic optimization approach for planning the MEMG considering unscheduled islanded operation is proposed in this paper. This method aims to optimize the planning decision, improve the operation economy in the grid-connected mode and enhance the energy supply reliability in the islanded mode. A planning-operation co-optimization model is established with two objective functions: the minimum total planning cost and the minimum expected economic loss caused by islanded operation. The model incorporates equipment capacity allocation constraints, operation constraints in two operation modes and load curtailment constraints in the islanded mode. In addition to considering the uncertainties of load and renewable energy, the model of the uncertain islanded mode is established using four correlated random variables, and the scenario tree is used for islanded scenario generation. The adaptive weighted sum (AWS) method is used to solve the multi-objective model and obtain an optimal and evenly distributed Pareto frontier. On this basis, the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) is employed to determine the final planning scheme. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which makes a trade-off between planning economy and energy supply reliability.</description></item><item><title>Grid-Forming Control of Offshore Wind Farms Connected With Diode-Based HVdc Links Based on Remote Active Power Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10361591</link><description>The connection of offshore wind farms (OWFs) via diode rectifier-based- high-voltage direct current (DR-HVdc) transmission requires the use of wind turbine (WT) converters with grid-forming (GFM) capability. However, active and reactive power coupling and oscillation issues have been revealed in WTs employing reactive power frequency (Q/f) droop-based control schemes. This paper proposes a GFM control for OWFs based on remote active power regulation. The proposed scheme remotely regulates the active power of the DR-HVdc link by adjusting the dc voltage of the onshore modular multilevel converter (MMC). As a result, the voltages of offshore point of common coupling and WT converters are freed from being controlled for active power. On this basis, the WT converters can be equipped with classical GFM control schemes that incorporate active power frequency (P/f) and reactive power voltage (Q/V) droop relationships. The offshore frequency acts as an indication of the OWF active power balance and it is measured and transmitted to the onshore MMC through a communication channel to close the remote active power control. Comparative studies of power coupling characteristics and stability reveal that the proposed control scheme can achieve efficient decoupling control of active and reactive power in WT converters, prevent oscillation risks, and significantly enhance the system's stability. The feasibility and advantages of the proposed control scheme are verified through comparative time-domain simulations.</description></item><item><title>Incentivizing the Collaboration Between Travelers and Power-Traffic Network Operators: An Asymmetric Nash Bargaining Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10363682</link><description>With the proliferation of electric vehicles and the deepened interdependence between power and traffic networks, tariff- and subsidy-based monetary incentives have been leveraged by network operators to shape vehicular&amp;amp;charging flow distributions to more closely align with network-level objectives. Travelers and network operators are generally regarded as two self-interested entities. As a result, the conflict between the system- and user-optimality usually forces travelers to bear an extra expenditure (either tariff payment or detour time) or requires network operators to dispense overmuch subsidies, both resulting in social welfare losses. The present work bridges this gap by designing a Cooperative Game based operation scheme that facilitates the collaboration between the two entities, in which collaborative travelers follow the social routing advice and then receive a certain level of reimbursement from network operators. To ensure a fair benefit allocation, we quantify the individual contribution as the difference of the path travel cost before and after the collaboration, then adopt the asymmetric Nash bargaining theory to settle the dispense of reimbursement. Numerical results on case studies indicate that the proposed model outperforms the subsidy-based non-cooperative Stackelberg Game in terms of promoting a win-win situation for both entities.</description></item><item><title>Wave Energy Optimal Control Structure With Second-Order Sliding Mode Tracking: Hardware-in-the-Loop Assessment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10363673</link><description>This article presents a hardware-in-the-loop assessment of a moment-based optimal controller including a robust super-twisting tracking term. The aim of the overall control structure is to maximise the energy extracted by a flap-type wave energy converter. An experimental assessment is performed via hardware-in-the-loop testing, which allows experiments in a controlled environment and repeatable conditions. Key aspects of the control structure are analysed in the results, with particular focus on the behaviour of the second-order sliding mode tracking term. Robustness against modelling uncertainties and finite-time convergence are evaluated, initially for a single sea state, and then across three different sea conditions. Excellent tracking performance is observed for all considered operating conditions. Finally, the super-twisting algorithm in the tracking loop is compared with the performance of a linear controller synthesised based on Youla-Ku&#269;era parametrisation, observing that the former presents better tracking capabilities, also outperforming in terms of energy extraction.</description></item><item><title>Fuzzy Adaptive Frequency Support Control Strategy for Wind Turbines With Improved Rotor Speed Recovery</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10365243</link><description>With the large-scale integration of wind power, the frequency stability of the power system is facing a significant challenge due to the wind power generation system typically operating in maximum power point tracking (MPPT) mode. Traditional frequency support control methods for wind turbines (WTs) do not consider the state of WTs and the frequency changes simultaneously. This article proposes a fuzzy adaptive frequency support control strategy for WTs with improved rotor speed recovery. Based on fuzzy logic control, the proportional gain is adaptively adjusted using the rotor speed and frequency deviation to support the grid frequency. It can fully utilize the frequency support capability of WTs with more available rotor kinetic energy while averting the over-deceleration of WTs with low rotor speed. Moreover, as the frequency deviation increases, the output power of WTs is increased by a larger proportional gain to alleviate the excessive frequency degradation. In response to the shortcomings of traditional rotor speed recovery methods, an improved rotor speed recovery method is presented by integral control, which can restore the rotor speed in stages without affecting the frequency support performance of WTs and can avoid secondary frequency drop (SFD). Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Fault-Tolerant and Attack-Resilient Cooperative Control in an Offshore Wind Farm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10366828</link><description>Modern wind farms promise increased capacity, sustainability, and efficiency through the integration of information technology with the existing wind energy technologies. However, this integration creates a new category of cyber-physical vulnerabilities stemming from physical faults and/or cyberattacks potentially leading to devastating physical impacts and catastrophic consequences. The large scale and high complexity of a wind farm, in addition to its growing connectivity, control functionality, and wind intermittency and variability make the task of cyber-physical protection particularly challenging. This paper introduces novel approaches for guaranteeing the safety, security, and reliability of a modern wind farm under simultaneous occurrence of faults and attacks using an advanced cyber-physical health monitoring scheme, defined as &#8220;intrusion detection and fault diagnosis system&#8221;, as well as fault-tolerant/attack-resilient control strategies at different levels. The proposed fault-tolerant control strategy is based on adaptive model predictive control at turbine level, enhanced with a control reallocation mechanism at farm level. The attack-resilient control strategy is based on an automatic signal correction (ASC) technique that is applied at network operator level. The effectiveness of the suggested approaches is demonstrated using an offshore wind farm model under wind turbulences, measurement noises, and realistic physical fault and cyberattack scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Dual Current Control of Renewable Energy Sources for Recent Grid Code Compliance and Reliability Enhancement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10373073</link><description>Inverter-interfaced renewable energy sources (IIRESs) are controlled to follow low-voltage ride-through requirements during different fault conditions to support grid voltages and enhance stability. However, these requirements could result in improper operation of conventional protection functions, e.g., phase selection, that are designed based on the fault current characteristics of conventional power systems. In this paper, a dual-current controller (DCC) is designed for IIRESs to allow precise operation of the conventional phase selection method (PSM) while following the positive- and negative-sequence reactive current generation (RCG) requirements imposed by recent grid codes (GCs). First, the negative-sequence current reference is designed to comply with GC requirements and inject the minimum value of negative-sequence-active current that secures a correct operation of phase selection. Subsequently, the positive-sequence-reactive current is designed to comply with RCG requirements and allow injecting the maximum combination of the positive-and negative-sequence currents without hindering the proper operation of PSM or RCG requirements. Comprehensive time-domain simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed DCC in meeting both PSM and recent RCG requirements during different fault types, resistances, and locations.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive BESS Controller for Stability Enhancement of Islanded Low Voltage Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10376028</link><description>Battery energy storage system (BESS), as grid-forming unit, can quickly regulate voltage and frequency for a 100% inverter-based islanded low voltage microgrid. However, due to some inherent characteristics of this network, such as: (a) coupling among voltage and frequency dynamics, (b) dynamics of dc source, and (c) timescale coupling among converter and network, small-signal stability is a major concern. This paper proposes an adaptive feed-forward compensation scheme for each BESS unit to reduce dynamic interactions among converters and network/load parameters. Additionally, the proposed scheme can enhance system damping capability for a wide range of operating conditions without the need for any prior/ continuous generation/network information or additional sensors. This technique can preserve the voltage/frequency regulation capability of the traditional ($\omega -P/V-Q$) droop control scheme for any low voltage networks. The existing small-signal model is modified to include dc-source, dc link, and proposed feed-forward dynamics, which assists in analyzing the impact of dc-side, ac-side, and network parameters on system small-signal stability. The system performance is analyzed with extensive case studies conducted on a CIGRE TF C$6:04:02$ benchmark system. The proposed model is validated using a real-time digital simulator with hardware-in-loop setup.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Power Imbalance Time Series With Solar Power Penetration: Butterfly Curve</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443304</link><description>Variable renewable energy (VRE) is known to be highly influenced by weather events and may ramp up or down abruptly. Therefore, increasing penetration of solar power will cause fundamental and structural changes to power system operation regimes. In this letter, we conduct an analysis of a 1-minute temporal resolution dataset from 6 Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) in the US during 2018 and 2019. By examining day-ahead power exchange and real-time power imbalance time series characteristics, distinct patterns can be observed: the day-ahead power exchange time series curve looks like the canyon, while the real-time power imbalance time series curve looks like a butterfly shape, which becomes bigger as solar penetration level increases. This letter will provide some scientific evidence for the reform of the day-ahead power exchange and real-time power balance operation in response to high solar power penetration.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Voltage Control for Microgrids Against Time-Varying Communication Delay Interference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268641</link><description>In islanded microgrids, the state-of-the-art distributed controller will suffer from control errors under the interference of time-varying communication delay. Towards this end, a distributed average consensus estimator is proposed to track the dynamic signal averages regardless of time-varying delay. On this basis, a distributed voltage controller resisting time-varying delay interference is proposed to precisely achieve average voltage recovery and the proportional reactive power sharing, and to constrain the voltage over-limit by introducing an additional signal, which is not possible with state-of-the-art distributed controllers. Also, the inaccurate estimation of the delay upper bound will lead to the improper parameter design, and then the controller is at risk of losing dynamic performance or instability. For this problem, the stochastic network calculus (SNC) is used to derive the tight upper bound of time-varying delay, and then the delayed discrete matrix is constructed to solve multi-delay transcendental equation, by which a parameter design algorithm is presented. Finally, the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimental platform is built, and the performance of the proposed controller is tested jointly with OPNET. Compared to the state-of-the-art controller, the proposed controller has the advantages of high control accuracy, superior stability, fast convergence and no voltage crossing under the time-varying delay.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Preserving Distributed Economic Dispatch for Microgrids Based on State Decomposition With Added Noises</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10283857</link><description>This paper devotes itself to the issue of privacy-preserving distributed economic dispatch (ED) of microgrids. The desired algorithm in a distributed way not only ensures a balance between power supply and demand for the entire microgrid system at minimal cost but also effectively safeguards the confidentiality of sensitive information. To this end, both state decomposition and Laplace noises are embedded into a distributed optimization algorithm in the framework of consensus to improve the privacy-preserving capability. Then, both a sufficient condition about the strength of consensus coupling and the convergence accuracy induced by added noises are disclosed for the proposed algorithm via the Lyapunov stability theory and stochastic analysis. Furthermore, the privacy level is discussed in the framework of differential privacy and the lower bound of the convergence accuracy is found for the given privacy level and noise distribution. Finally, the effectiveness and correctness of our approach are demonstrated by applying an IEEE 39-bus system.</description></item><item><title>Intelligent Multi-Functional Fault Current Limiter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10288269</link><description>This paper proposes an intelligent multi-functional fault current limiter (IMFCL) designed for protection against bidirectional faults using an almost lossless fault energy strategy in medium-voltage applications. The proposed circuit incorporates a symmetrical double-sided combination of a voltage source converter (VSC), isolating transformers, and bidirectional switches. The design allows both series and shunt configurations for the transformers, enabling protection for both, downstream and upstream sides of a network. Moreover, the structure can also function as a dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) or even as a unified power quality coordinator (UPQC) and unified power flow controller (UPFC), addressing additional power quality issues in the grid. The control segment employs the maximal overlap discrete wavelet packet transform (MODWPT) for time-frequency analysis, leveraging it to estimate the network&#8217;s impedance and pinpoint the fault&#8217;s location and nature. To this end, an interharmonic high-frequency signal is fed into the grid using VSCs, facilitating swift downstream or upstream impedance determination in FCL or DVR modes. Additionally, a new algorithm is deployed to simultaneously measure both voltage and current magnitudes, determining fault type or voltage sag/swell occurrences in real-time. Simulation and Real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) results substantiate the proposed IMFCL&#8217;s feasibility and efficacy.</description></item><item><title>Virtual Impedance Control for Load Sharing and Bus Voltage Quality Improvement in Low-Voltage AC Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287544</link><description>Due to the mismatched feeder impedances in a resistive feeder AC microgrid, it&#8217;s challenging to accurately share harmonic and active power while promising a low bus voltage distortion rate.

This research presents a two-stage robust model for microgrid planning, considering mixed decision-dependent and decision-independent uncertainties. We design a modern time-of-use (ToU) pricing scheme to optimize the identification of peak $/$ off-peak time periods, as well as the pricing for individual load buses. The operational constraints of the recourse problem are characterized using a second-order conic AC power flow model.

In this configuration, the dc MG naturally experiences a second harmonic current injection caused by the double-frequency component of the ac side instantaneous power. This paper proposes a new decentralized control method by utilization of the injected harmonic for power sharing. The proposed method enables accurate power sharing among dc sources and precise global power sharing among dc and ac sources without imposing any dc side voltage deviation. In this method, each dc source adjusts its power based on the frequency of the harmonic component. Additionally, the IC ensures that the voltage level of the dc MG remains at the rated value. Capacitive virtual impedances are integrated into the dc sources to facilitate second harmonic current sharing among them and prevent the circulation of harmonic current flow between the dc sources and the IC&#8217;s dc side capacitor. To fulfill the objectives, each dc source simultaneously regulates the second harmonic voltage of its output filter capacitor and the dc component current of its output filter inductor. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated through time-domain and frequency-domain simulations.</description></item><item><title>Systematic Controller Design for Inverter-Based Microgrids With Certified Large-Signal Stability and Domain of Attraction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10310265</link><description>Inverter-based resources (IBRs) introduce fast dynamics and high non-linearities to microgrids, degrading their stability and complicating the design of effective controllers. To address the arising vulnerability and non-linearities, this paper presents a systematic controller design approach that ensures large-signal stability and domain of attraction (DOA) for islanded microgrids. First, the nonlinear electromagnetic transient model of inverter-based microgrids is developed in the rotating dq reference frame, which is then transformed to a homogeneous-like system with nonlinear terms acting as superimposed parameter uncertainties. Next, the stability conditions, including certified stability, certified DOA, and their combination, are derived to rigorously guarantee a designated range to be a subset of DOA. The designated region is customized and flexible enough to cover microgrids&#8217; normal or emergency operational ranges, such as low- and high-voltage ride-through (L/HVRT) conditions. Then, a systematic method for identifying the candidate control parameter set is developed by integrating the analytical stability conditions. This approach is further exemplified in the droop controller design to improve microgrid stability and resilience. Finally, the proposed systematic controller design is verified through numerical simulation and power hardware-in-the-loop experiments to ensure large-signal stability and DOA of microgrids in emergency L/HVRT conditions.</description></item><item><title>More Efficient Energy Management for Hybrid AC/DC Microgrids With Hard Constrained Neural Network-Based Conversion Loss Surrogate Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10354442</link><description>Conversion loss modeling plays a crucial role in hybrid AC/DC microgrid (MG) energy management (EM). However, accurate calculation of the conversion losses is often very costly. Additionally, existing surrogate models typically rely on fixed-voltage DC buses, leading to excessive voltage magnitudes. To overcome these limitations, we propose surrogate models based on piecewise linear neural networks (NNs) that estimate conversion losses using converter power and variable-voltage DC buses. These NNs employs the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, allowing reformulation into linear constraints. During NN training, additional hard constraints are enforced via the augmented Lagrangian method to enhance feasibility. To limit the computational cost of the reformulated NN constraints, weights sparsity and ReLU stability regularizations are applied to the NN training process. The efficient energy management is implemented as a two-stage stochastic unit commitment (UC) problem with integer recourse. To solve this UC problem, we propose a finite iteration convergent Benders decomposition algorithm with several acceleration techniques, which reduce the computational burden significantly. Our case study demonstrates that: 1) the proposed surrogate model accurately approximates conversion losses while satisfying hard constraints, 2) optimizing the DC bus voltage leads to more efficient system operation, energy savings, and better overall performance, and 3) combining the NN weight optimization with Benders decomposition acceleration techniques significantly reduces the computational associated with the NN surrogates.</description></item><item><title>Risk-Aware Flexible Resource Utilization in an Unbalanced Three-Phase Distribution Network Using SDP-Based Distributionally Robust Optimal Power Flow</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10250821</link><description>The variability caused by the proliferation of distributed energy resources (DERs) and the significant growth in unbalanced three-phase loads pose unprecedented challenges to distribution network operations. This paper focuses on how a distribution system operator (DSO), taking over the distribution grid and market operations, would develop a risk-aware flexibility market to mitigate uncertainties in an unbalanced three-phase power distribution network. First, a distributionally robust chance constraint (DRCC) method is devised to solve the unbalanced three-phase optimal power flow using a semidefinite programming (SDP) model. The DSO can apply the proposed solution to jointly clear energy and flexibility markets. Then, the DRCC model accuracy is improved by an information-sharing mechanism characterized by spatially-correlated uncertainties in the distribution grid. Further, a novel system-wide response function is derived to make the DRCC model tractable. Using the duality theory, the paper further investigates the physical composition of the DSO&#8217;s cleared flexibility prices to guide the unbalanced distribution network operation. Finally, the effectiveness of the risk-aware flexibility market is verified in a modified three-phase IEEE 34-node system. Results demonstrate that the flexibility market can quantify the impact of spatially correlated uncertainties and facilitate the utilization of flexible resources to mitigate uncertainties across the network.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Terminal Current Differential Protection Setting Method for Fully Weak-Infeed Distribution Networks Based on Restricted Enumeration Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10266989</link><description>With the high penetration connection of inverter-interfaced distributed generators and the increasing application of large-capacity energy routers, fully weak-infeed distribution networks consisting entirely of power-electronized weak-infeed power sources are set to become one of the fundamental forms of future distribution networks. For fully weak-infeed distribution networks, multi-terminal current differential protection is considered an optional or even preferred line protection scheme. In this paper, a multi-terminal current differential protection setting method for fully weak-infeed distribution networks is proposed based on the restricted enumeration method. To address the impact of data synchronization errors and measurement errors of multi-terminal current on differential current, the problem of determining the maximum differential current superimposed with the multi-terminal current phasor errors is transformed into a high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem. The distribution law of the global optimal solution in the non-convex constraint space is deeply studied and analyzed, and a restricted enumeration method is proposed that can quickly solve the protection setting value, thereby solving the problem of multi-terminal current differential protection setting. The accuracy and rapidity of the proposed method are verified by comparing the calculation accuracy and time consumption of the restricted enumeration method and the exhaustive search. It is shown that the proposed multi-terminal differential protection setting method exhibits sufficient reliability and sensitivity in fully weak-infeed distribution networks, as verified through simulation analysis using a fully weak-infeed distribution network model built in PSCAD/EMTDC.</description></item><item><title>Transactive Energy-Based Sequential Load Restoration of Distribution Systems With Networked Microgrids Under Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292442</link><description>Natural disasters such as hurricane would cause damages in distribution systems (DSs), resulting in large-scale blackouts. In order to reduce socioeconomic losses under blackouts, it is critical to enhance resilience of DSs through a series of restoration means. Microgrids (MGs) are considered as viable and critical sources to provide emergency power support, and can facilitate restoration of DSs when properly coordinated with the utility-owned control measures. Instead of direct coordination control, this paper proposes a transactive energy (TE) framework for load restoration of DSs, under which the distribution system operator (DSO) organizes a TE market with MGs to trade emergency energy through price signals. Moreover, in order to consider renewable generation uncertainties, a distributionally robust optimization (DRO)-based sequential load restoration model is formulated under the TE framework to maximize the expected restored load with respect to the worst-case probability distribution. Case studies were conducted on the modified IEEE 123 node system. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy can effectively coordinate MGs scheduling to assist in load restoration. Moreover, as compared to the conventional stochastic programming model, the proposed DRO model is less sensitive to the number of scenarios modeled and can produce a more robust solution against out-of-sample scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Genetic Algorithm With k-Nearest Neighbors for Radial Distribution Network Reconfiguration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10285485</link><description>Distribution network reconfiguration (DNR) is to control switches to reduce system losses, alleviate overloads, and mitigate voltage fluctuations. DNR is challenging due to nonlinear power flow equations and the inclusion of integer variables representing switch states. Besides, radial distribution networks require a forest structure, imposing a challenging constraint on the switch state variables. Genetic algorithm is one of the commonly used methods to solve the problem. However, to derive radial solutions, it is necessary to either continue iterating until a radial solution emerges or apply slow and complex encoding techniques that compromise the similarity between chromosomes and real topologies. In this study, we introduce a k-nearest neighbors (kNN) structure that replaces the original chromosome with the best-performing radial topology closest to the chromosome based on the L1 norm, creating a population consisting of radial solutions at each iteration. We also propose a graph-based method to find the nearest neighbor. By utilizing the proposed kNN structure, radiality can be guaranteed with simple encoding. The proposed method has been tested on two test feeders including both balanced and unbalanced networks. The results demonstrate that our approach consistently yields superior performance gains, effectively showcasing the advantages of integrating the kNN structure into the genetic algorithm framework.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Linear-Time-Variant MPC Method for Voltage and Power Regulation in Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287147</link><description>This paper proposes a data-driven voltage and power regulation method based on model predictive control (MPC) for active distribution networks (ADNs), which doesn&#8217;t rely on accurate system model parameters. To approximate the system model from data with a good balance between simplicity and expressiveness, we propose a new piecewise linear (PWL) regression method combing the support vector linear regression (SVR) model, which overcomes the issues of measurement outliers and data collinearity in the traditional PWL regression method. With the PWL model trained offline, a novel data-driven voltage and power regulation method based on the linear time-varying MPC scheme is proposed in this paper, which can effectively coordinate fast and slow regulating resources with a low computational burden. The convergence of the proposed data-driven MPC based scheme is also theoretically clarified. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated via numerical simulations using several distribution systems.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Volt/Var Control for Unbalanced Distribution Networks With Human-in-the-Loop Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10335935</link><description>This paper proposes a human-in-the-loop deep reinforcement learning (HL-DRL)-based VVC strategy to simultaneously reduce power losses, mitigate voltage violations and compensate for voltage unbalance in three-phase unbalanced distribution networks. Instead of fully trusting DRL actions made by deep neural networks, a human intervention module is proposed to modify dangerous actions that violate operation constraints during offline training. This module refers to well-designed human guidance rules based on voltage-reactive power sensitivities, which regulate PV reactive power to sequentially address local voltage violation and unbalance issues to obtain safe transitions. To efficiently and safely learn the optimal control policy from these training samples, a human-in-the-loop soft actor-critic (HL-SAC) solution method is then developed. Different from the standard SAC algorithm, an online switch mechanism between action exploration and human intervention is designed. The actor network loss function is modified to incorporate human guidance terms, which alleviates the inconsistency of the updating direction of actor and critic networks. A hybrid experience replay buffer including both dangerous and safe transitions is also used to facilitate the learning process towards human actions. Comparative simulation results on a modified IEEE 123-bus unbalanced distribution system demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in voltage control.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Scale Spatial&#8211;Temporal Graph Neural Network-Based Method of Multienergy Load Forecasting in Integrated Energy System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10251987</link><description>Accurately predicting multi-energy loads is essential for optimizing the dispatch and economic operation of integrated energy systems (IES). However, existing multi-energy load forecasting methods have two main limitations: (1) they fail to consider the complex correlations between multi-energy loads and auxiliary features; (2) single time-scale feature extraction methods can result in the loss of critical temporal feature information. Therefore, multi-energy load forecasting remains a challenging task. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel multi-energy load forecasting method based on a multi-scale spatio-temporal graph neural network (MS-STGNN). Specifically, the proposed continuous graph learning module quantifies the correlations between multi-energy loads and auxiliary features using an adjacency matrix, while the graph convolution module aggregates feature information among neighboring nodes through the same matrix to improve the correlations between multi-energy loads and auxiliary features. The model&#8217;s robustness is further enhanced by the feature attention module. Moreover, to mitigate temporal feature information loss, we develop a multi-scale convolution module that uses filters of various sizes to extract multi-dimensional temporal features of different time steps. Extensive experiments show that the MS-STGNN method has higher prediction accuracy and better generalization ability than existing methods on the IES dataset at the Tempe campus of Arizona State University. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/nuist-cs/MS-STGNN.</description></item><item><title>Restoration of a Multi-Energy Distribution System With Joint District Network Reconfiguration via Distributed Stochastic Programming</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10258416</link><description>Extreme events like floods, tsunamis, hurricanes, etc., can threaten the normal operation of district power and thermal networks in multi-energy distribution systems (MDSs). Exploiting the reconfigurable properties of the combined network can provide a cost-effective solution to enhance the MDS resilience level and operation flexibility by redistributing multi-energy loads. In this paper, a resilient restoration approach is proposed for a MDS to coordinate multi-stage dispatch decisions in a distributed manner. First, the MDS operation is modelled with the power and thermal network constraints. As the district thermal network model is nonlinear, massive auxiliary flow variables are introduced to make the reconfiguration problem tractable, which significantly reduces the computational burdens. Second, to handle diverse uncertainties from the outcomes of disasters, loads, and renewable generation, both the pre-restoration and real-time stage measures are coordinated via a two-stage stochastic programming method. To further save the solution time, a distributed algorithm named progress hedging is used to decompose the original large problem into several small sub-ones. At last, case studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to other traditional restoration benchmarks.</description></item><item><title>Analytical Dynamic Energy-Carbon Flow Model and Application in Cost Allocation for Integrated Energy Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10294255</link><description>Energy indicators on the demand side, such as consumers&#8217; total carbon emissions and energy costs, nodal energy carbon emission intensity (CEI) and energy price (EP), describe the impact of consumers&#8217; energy consumption on system carbon emissions and costs, helping consumers with energy consumption decisions. In this paper, an analytical dynamic energy-carbon flow model of integrated energy system (IES) is proposed, which allocates energy and carbon emissions from supply side to demand side. This method is also applied to cost allocation, resulting in accurate energy indicators for consumers. Firstly, a dynamic energy flow model for an IES is established based on the superposition characteristics of subsystems. Then, a dynamic energy flow tracing (DEFT) method that considers pipeline packing, transmission loss and time delay is proposed first to estimate an analytical energy relationship between sources and loads. Combined with the CEI of sources, a dynamic carbon flow model is proposed to allocate the carbon emissions and form CEI on demand side.

To address the problem, an optimal scheduling strategy of mobile energy storage capable of variable-speed energy transmission is proposed. Firstly, by analyzing the hydrogen-carrier vessel (HCV)&#8217;s variable speed-spatiotemporal characteristic mapping mechanism and the ability to supply hydrogen and electricity, an interisland energy variable-speed transmission model is developed. On this basis, an island energy microgrid (EMG) operation model compatible with variable-speed transmission energy is established, in order to reconcile HCV with hydrogen balance, power flow and frequency response. Additionally, considering the impact of uncertainties on the energy output, energy demand, frequency stability, and especially energy transmission sequencing, a stochastic dispatching strategy of the island energy microgrid groups (EMGG) is designed. This model is first linearized as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) problem, and then is solved quickly by a two-layer algorithm, where the upper layer finely manages the possible optimal EMG power reserve that ensures the frequency security, and the lower layer optimally coordinates the inter-island variable-speed energy transmission and island EMG operation. Finally, case studies on Island groups in the South China Sea verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Day-Ahead Scheduling and Online Dispatch of Energy Hubs: A Flexibility Envelope Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10333081</link><description>Energy hub is a micro energy system in industrial park or residential area. It makes full use of renewable resources through multi-energy integration. Proper coordination among generation units, battery and thermal storage devices provides additional flexibility to cope with volatile renewable power. Due to the lack of accurate predictions, the operator uses an interval estimation for day-ahead scheduling and makes online decisions in response to real-time observations without future renewable output values. This paper proposes an envelope-based approach which offers a thorough coordination between day-ahead scheduling and real-time dispatch. In the day-ahead stage, a flexibility envelope for admissible renewable power and action envelopes for controllable devices are determined from a convex quadratic program. In the real-time operation stage, online actions for generation facilities and storage devices are determined by a partial-quantile policy based on the current renewable output and those envelopes. Since the flexibility envelope intentionally caters to the interval estimation of renewable output, the online decisions would be less myopic. Test results demonstrate that the proposed method has an optimality gap smaller than 5% compared to the hindsight optimum, which is comparable to the model predictive control (MPC) method with exact predictions in the next 4&#8211;5 hours.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Stage Adaptive Stochastic-Robust Scheduling Method With Affine Decision Policies for Hydrogen-Based Multi-Energy Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10354055</link><description>Zero-carbon clean energy such as hydrogen has been developed rapidly to reduce carbon emissions, gradually promoting them as the main energy supply for multi-energy microgrids (MEMGs), which motivates the deployment of hydrogen-based MEMG (H-MEMG). The main difficulty of the H-MEMG scheduling problem is how to handle source/load uncertainties for ensuring the solution feasibility and economics in the actual operation. To this end, this paper proposes a novel multi-stage adaptive stochastic-robust optimization (MASRO) approach, which combines the ideas of stochastic programming and multi-stage robust optimization. The established model has the objective of the expected operation cost and ensures the solution feasibility by designed constraints rather than the &#8220;min-max&#8221; structure. Specifically, first, affine policies are adapted to describe the complex relationship between decision variables and uncertainty realizations; Second, an affine policy-based solution approach is proposed for the MASRO H-MEMG scheduling model. Then, the complex conversion relationship and coupling constraints are reformulated, and a tractable mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is established; Third, based on the solved affine functions, the real-time rolling and non-rolling economic dispatch models are proposed to respectively pursue the economic and computational requirements, and both can guarantee solution robustness and nonanticipativity. Numerical tests are implemented on a real H-MEMG, verifying that the proposed method could guarantee the feasibility and economic efficiency of actual H-MEMG operations.</description></item><item><title>A Game Bidding Model of Electricity and Hydrogen Sharing System Considering Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10412692</link><description>The uncertainty of renewable energy source (RES) and load may bring huge challenge to the operation of power systems. In order to meet the balance of supply and demand, a game bidding strategy considering uncertainty is proposed for the electric-hydrogen shared energy storage system (SESS). Firstly, based on Wasserstein distance in extreme scenarios, a reduced scale fuzzy set is constructed for the uncertainty of supply and demand. Secondly, Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism is introduced to deal with the misreporting and valuation behavior of microgrids (MGs). Then a two-stage distributed robust optimization (DRO) game model is designed for SESS&#8212;MGs through game bidding. The aim of Stage I can maximize the benefits of SESS, while the social welfare of each microgrid (MG) may be maximized in Stage II, which can achieve a unique Stackelberg equilibrium. So the DRO model is transformed into a solvable mathematical model by taking advantage of dual theory and adaptive McCormick algorithm. Finally, the case studies are simulated by using the IEEE 33 node power grid together with a 20 node hydrogen network, which can validate the effectiveness of the proposed model.</description></item><item><title>Computation-Power Coupled Modeling for IDCs and Collaborative Optimization in ADNs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10271137</link><description>The batch and online workload of Internet data centers (IDCs) offer temporal and spatial scheduling flexibility. Given that power generation costs vary over time and location, harnessing the flexibility of IDCs&#8217; energy consumption through workload regulation can optimize the power flow within the system. This paper focuses on multi-geographically distributed IDCs managed by an Internet service company (ISC), which are aggregated as a controllable load. The load flexibility resulting from spatial load regulation of online workload is taken into account. A two-step workload scheduling mechanism is adopted, and a computation-power coupling model of ISC is established to facilitate collaborative optimization in active distribution networks (ADNs). To address the model-solving problem based on the assumption of scheduling homogeneity, a model reconstruction method is proposed. An efficient iterative algorithm is designed to solve the reconstructed model. Furthermore, the Nash bargaining solution is employed to coordinate the different optimization objectives of ISC and power system operators, thereby avoiding subjective arbitrariness. Experimental cases based on a 33-node distribution system are designed to verify the effectiveness of the model and algorithm in optimizing ISC&#8217;s energy consumption and power flow within the system.</description></item><item><title>A Distributed Coordinated Framework With Fair Comfort Level Sharing for Inverter Air Conditioner in Auxiliary Services</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10269097</link><description>As a flexible resource, inverter air conditioners (IACs) have significant potential for demand response. However, due to the diverse characteristics of users, it is challenging to consider users&#8217; internal temperature requirements fairly while controlling IACs power. This paper aims to find a feasible solution to this problem. First, the concept of &#8220;comfort state&#8221; is utilized to describe the operating state of IACs with different reference temperatures and allowable internal temperature deviations. Then, a distributed leaderless coordinated framework is designed for IACs to ensure the tracking of reference aggregated power and the achieving of fair comfort level sharing. The proposed framework does not require the aggregator to manage all IACs in a centralized manner and also avoids the need of periodic re-issuance of aggregated power deviation. The feasibility of the proposed framework and the impact of time-delay is rigorously analyzed. Besides, a specific implementation method for the proposed framework in the primary frequency support is developed. Numerical studies show that the proposed coordinated framework can effectively mitigate the drastic variations in system frequency when loads fluctuate.</description></item><item><title>Power Reliability Service Provision and Pricing in Distribution Power Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10314417</link><description>For distribution utilities, it is important to match the power reliability service with the demand of users. However, since there are partial overlaps in the power supply paths of different nodes, the reliability of different nodes has the inherent coupling relation based on the network topology. The improvement of reliability level on individual nodes can hardly be separately controlled without causing any influence on other nodes. To solve this problem, this paper aims to study the co-optimization method of reliability service provision and pricing for the distribution utility. First, a joint placement method of common devices for reliability enhancement is presented. The coupling relationship between the load recovery states of different load nodes under the same fault is conveniently expressed. Second, a service menu design approach is introduced to determine the level and price of candidate reliability services. It considers that users have differentiated evaluations of service and select the service in the menu according to their profit maximization. Third, to overcome the free-riding issue that users receive unnecessarily high-reliability service, the load-shedding compensation method is proposed to exactly match the reliability level received by users to the service level selected by users. After the model transformation, the optimization model is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem. An acceleration algorithm with convergence guarantee is developed to mitigate the computational burden.</description></item><item><title>Incorporating Data-Driven Demand-Price Uncertainty Correlations Into Microgrid Optimal Dispatch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315234</link><description>A growing number of microgrid (MG) systems ipate in market trading as prosumers to improve their own operation profits, as well as the flexibility of power supply. To handle the MG dispatch problem with uncertainties in both load demands and electricity prices, this paper provides a data-driven robust optimization (RO) approach. Firstly, the correlations between the uncertainties of demands and prices are verified via the analysis of historical monitoring data from a real-world case. Based on the data-fitting for the rectangular and ellipsoidal intervals, a new data-driven demand-price uncertainty set with correlations is built to eliminate these unreasonable scenarios effectively. Secondly, a two-stage RO dispatch model is established considering multiple uncertainties of renewable-load power and prices in MGs. The bilinear objective term brings huge obstacles to the solution of the RO model, therefore a novel nested iterative algorithm is further exploited. The bilinear terms of power and price in the objective function are linearized by a binary expansion approach. Besides, to avoid the enumerations of numerous binary recourses in problem solving, the block coordinate descent (BCD) theory is adopted to co-optimize different types of variables, thereby enhancing the computational tractability. Numerical simulations indicate the validity and superiority of the developed RO model and the solution algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Frequency-Responsive Refrigerator Switching Controller</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10330137</link><description>Future low-inertia power systems will introduce challenges to system operators to maintain essential grid services such as fast frequency control (FFC). Hence, there is a need for efficient solutions that can provide the desired FFC capability and arrest high rate-of-change-of-frequency (RoCoF). Recent advancements in information and communication infrastructure within the smart grid concept have created new opportunities to optimally control and utilize the immense potential of thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs), such as refrigerators. However, modeling and controlling different types of TCLs to deliver a precise collective FFC response is challenging. In this regard, this paper develops an adaptive decentralized autonomous fuzzy-temperature-frequency (FTF) control strategy to enable refrigerators to alter their power consumption according to variations in the grid frequency. The ability of the proposed FTF controller to modify the power consumption of a population of refrigerators in accordance with a reference power profile is demonstrated through a set of simulations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller through a strong improvement in the frequency security parameters, i.e., RoCoF and frequency nadir, and with a negligible impact on the thermodynamic performance of refrigerators.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Practical Evaluation of AC&#8211;DC Solid-State Transformer With Electric Spring Functions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10330006</link><description>Power electronics (PE) devices have become ubiquitous in the modern power system. Their potential in participation in grid supporting has been gathering growing attention. PE-based electric spring (ES) technology has recently evolved from the low-voltage ac mains to the medium-voltage distribution network. When equipped with ES functions, solid-state transformers (SSTs) can be associated with energy storage and smart loads to absorb power fluctuations arising from renewable energy sources. Unlike previous studies in which PE systems are generally simplified as  ${V}$ ,  $\theta $ ,  ${P}$ ,  ${Q}$ , or represented by the simplest power converter topology, this paper implements and examines the grid-supporting functionality of a practical ES enabled-SST (ES-SST) system. The dynamic model of the ES-SST is presented and simulated, including both the circuit and control loops. Experimental results obtained from a scaled-down power system are also included to confirm the validity of the dynamic model in a microgrid environment. This dynamic model will facilitate smart-grid researchers to evaluate the use of a large group of distributed ES-SSTs in large power systems in future studies.</description></item><item><title>Novel Autonomous Control of Grid-Forming DGs to Realize 100% Renewable Energy Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10273620</link><description>The grid-forming distributed generators (GFM-DGs) have attracted much attention as a key technology for realizing 100% renewable energy grids. This paper presents a novel control strategy to ensure the reliable operation of a renewable energy source (RES)-based GFM-DG even during weather variations. The GFM-DG connects a RES to the grid via source- and grid-side converters, with the converters&#8217; common DC-link voltage  $V_{DC}$  indicating the power balance between the RES and the grid. We begin by identifying the limitation of conventional strategies in maintaining  $V_{DC}$  against severe weather. To address the limitation, we propose a coordinated strategy for both source- and grid-side converters to regulate  $V_{DC}$  cooperatively, ensuring GFM-DG stability even in adverse weather conditions while also achieving decentralized power sharing and contributions to frequency inertia and damping. The proposed strategy is applicable to photovoltaic- and wind turbine-based generators, as well as energy storage systems. A guideline for control parameter design and stability margin analysis for weather conditions are also provided. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated via small-signal analysis and simulation case studies under various conditions of 100% renewable energy grids, characterized by severe weather, load demand changes, actual line impedances, and a grid fault.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Preserving Operational Decision Making for Networked Autonomous Microgrids Based on Bilevel Mixed-Integer Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10285433</link><description>This paper presents a privacy-preserving operational decision-making approach for autonomous microgrids networked via a power distribution system, where the distribution system operator (DSO) and microgrid master controllers (MMCs) make independent decisions as different stakeholders. First, the scheme of bilevel optimization (i.e., the Stackelberg leader-followers game) is applied to investigate the sequential interactions between DSO and MMCs. Then, given the coexistence of continuous and binary variables in the lower-level problems, an exact strong-duality-based reformulation and decomposition framework is customized to cope with the nonconvex nature of the bilevel mixed-integer optimization. Meanwhile, a fast-enhanced Benders decomposition algorithm is proposed to realize local privacy-preserving decision-making, where multiple unified Benders cuts are generated once and the strongest one is selected back to Benders mater problem. Mathematically, the proposed algorithm will not change the equilibrium point and corresponding optimal solution after finite iterations. Finally, through numerical experiments on a simplified two-bus test system and a modified IEEE 123-bus system, we demonstrate the effectiveness of privacy preservation, as well as the robustness and scalability of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>A Marginal Cost Consensus Scheme With Reset Mechanism for Distributed Economic Dispatch in BESSs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10302354</link><description>Battery energy storage systems (BESSs) are often integrated into the smart grid as the key equipment for valley filling and peak suppression. However, the internal power consumption and capacity degradation of battery cells can not be ignored. In addition, there are certain electric trading between the owner of the grid-connected BESSs and the electric company (EC). Therefore, an expenditure function for grid-connected BESSs is constructed in this paper, in which internal power consumption, capacity degradation and power trading are covered while meeting the balance of power supply and demand. On this basis, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition of the function is summarized as the consensus problem of marginal cost (MC) converging to time-phased electricity price. Thus, we plan to design a distributed MC consensus scheme for economic dispatch (ED) in BESSs based on multi-agent systems (MASs) on a small-time scale. In view of the low control accuracy and response speed of the existing distributed proportional protocol, this paper proposes a distributed ED (DED) scheme with reset mechanism based on a proportional integral (PI) control. When the proportional term encounters zero crossing, the integral term of the control scheme is reset to 0, which ensures that the signs of the two are aligned, thus accelerating MCs convergence and restraining overshoot. Parameter conditions for consensus, regularity and Zeno-free behavior are given through the relevant theoretical analysis. Several simulation cases are designed to verify the designed DED algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchically Distributed Energy Management in Distribution Systems: An Error-Tolerant and Asynchronous Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10302370</link><description>Distribution systems are becoming more complex with the integration of numerous distributed energy resources (DERs), such as distributed generators (DGs), distributed energy storages (DESs), and controllable end-users (EUs). Aggregators (Aggs) are emerging to bridge the gap between the distribution system operator (DSO) and EUs. This creates a hierarchical &#8220;DSO-Agg-EU&#8221; architecture that requires effective and efficient coordination among massive agents. However, this architecture faces challenges such as communication asynchrony and solution inexactness among different agents, which may undermine the performance of energy management or even cause unexpected failures. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an error-tolerant and asynchronous algorithm based on dual decomposition for hierarchically distributed energy management (HDEM). The algorithm is theoretically guaranteed to converge to a near-optimal value and can be further accelerated by Nesterov&#8217;s method. The algorithm is tested on the IEEE 123-bus distribution system and demonstrates high effectiveness and efficiency under asynchrony and inexactness.</description></item><item><title>Identifying Secure Operating Ranges for DER Control Using Bilevel Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10305207</link><description>Active distribution grids are accommodating an increasing number of controllable electric loads and distributed energy resources (DERs). A majority of these DERs are managed by entities other than the distribution utility, such as individual customers or third-party aggregators, who control the loads and DERs without consideration of any distribution grid constraints. This makes it challenging for a distribution system operator (DSO) to allow third-party aggregators and transmission operators to fully exploit the flexibility offered by these resources while also ensuring that distribution grid constraints such as voltage magnitude limits are not violated. In this paper, we develop a bilevel optimization-based framework to determine the aggregate power flexibility that can be obtained from an unbalanced distribution grid while ensuring that there is no disaggregation solution that leads to grid constraint violations. The results are a set of constraints and operating rules that are easy to communicate, and which provide the entities that procure flexibility from DERs (e.g., transmission operators or third-party aggregators) with the ability to freely implement their own disaggregation strategy without intervention from the DSO. The proposed approach is tested on two unbalanced distribution feeders and our simulation results indicate that it is possible to determine a wide range of aggregate power flexibility, as long as a simple set of rules for DER control activation are followed.</description></item><item><title>An Edge Intelligence-Based Framework for Online Scheduling of Soft Open Points With Energy Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10312803</link><description>Edge intelligence (EI) is an emerging interdiscipline to advance the coordination of artificial intelligence and edge computing. EI sinks the computation and decision-making process from centralized clouds to the edge node in proximity to terminal devices, which is robust to the unacceptable communication delay or disconnection. In this paper, we propose an EI-based framework for online scheduling of soft open points with energy storage (ES-SOPs), a novel power electronic device, to enhance both spatial and temporal flexibility in power distribution networks. The proposed framework empowers the edge computing via hybrid deep reinforcement learning (HDRL), which seamlessly combines advantages of both data-driven deep neural networks and physics-based ES-SOPs model. Inside the edge computing node, a deep neural network first learns a set of parameters from the historical data and ES-SOPs local status. Then, the outputs of the deep neural network are fed into a physics-based ES-SOPs model to construct its objective function, where rigorous operation constraints are included. Finally, this model is solved to obtain near-optimal ES-SOPs online scheduling. Case studies on a modified IEEE 33-node system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework under different levels of uncertainties and its superiority over safe DRL and model predictive control-based methods.</description></item><item><title>Optimized Energy Dispatch for Microgrids With Distributed Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315028</link><description>The increasing integration of renewable energy resources (RES) introduces uncertainties in modern power systems and makes the dynamic energy dispatch (DED) problem challenging. Uncertainties lead to dynamic grid control, which needs to be addressed for the optimized DED. Moreover, since energy usage and power generation are distributed, multiple parties can be involved in the DED problem. Thus, DED should be optimized in a distributed way for efficiency and privacy. With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning technology, various data can be gathered and analyzed to achieve intelligent energy management, and the dynamics of power grids should be considered for optimality. For this purpose, we investigate how reinforcement learning can be used to solve the DED problem for a dynamic microgrid (MG) environment. The objective is to determine the optimal power generation for each generator using fossil fuels at each time slot, to minimize the cumulative cost of power generation in a given time period. To achieve this goal, we first model the MG with the practical impact of batteries, photovoltaic (PV) panels, and load banks (external grids). Then we formulate the optimization problem of minimizing the total generation from fossil fuels. To solve this problem, we propose a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm to reduce communication costs and improve data privacy. In the proposed scheme, each generator is considered as an agent, which shares a global state and only obtains its own local loss. Then, different agents work jointly to minimize the global cost. Theoretical analysis is provided to prove the convergence of the proposed algorithms, which are also tested with real-world datasets. Results show that the policy learned from the proposed algorithms can balance the production and consumption in the MG for both fully and partially observable MG environments while simultaneously reducing the total generation cost from fossil fuels.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Objective Interval Optimization Dispatch of Microgrid via Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10345718</link><description>This paper presents an improved deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for solving the optimal dispatch of microgrids under uncertaintes. First, a multi-objective interval optimization dispatch (MIOD) model for microgrids is constructed, in which the uncertain power output of wind and photovoltaic (PV) is represented by interval variables. The economic cost, network loss, and branch stability index for microgrids are also optimized. The interval optimization is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP). Then, an improved DRL algorithm called triplet-critics comprehensive experience replay soft actor-critic (TCSAC) is proposed to solve it. Finally, simulation results of the modified IEEE 118-bus microgrid validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Day-Ahead Electricity Consumption Prediction of Individual Household&#8211;Capturing Peak Consumption Pattern</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315236</link><description>Day-ahead electricity consumption forecasting for individual residential consumers, especially the peak consumption time forecasting, is essential for home energy management system. However, it is considerably challenging since the single household consumption is highly volatile and stochastic and dependent on the underlying human behaviour. Further, the difficulties of accurately capturing the occurrence time of peak consumption in a house can limit the performance of existing machine learning-based load forecasting methods. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for day-ahead single-household electricity consumption forecasting by learning the peak consumption patterns of users. Instead of attempting to obtain the electricity consumption curve for the future 24 hours, the prediction of electricity consumption is achieved by combining the predicted base consumption, the predicted peak consumption occurrence time and the predicted amount of peak consumption within each time interval. The proposed framework can be used for both deterministic and probabilistic load forecasting of individual households. Case studies are conducted on hundreds of households from two different datasets. The results demonstrate that the performance of different deterministic load forecasting algorithms and probabilistic load forecasting algorithms can be improved after being integrated into the proposed framework.</description></item><item><title>Robust Co-Modeling for Privacy-Preserving Short-Term Load Forecasting With Incongruent Load Data Distributions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10454597</link><description>Short-term load forecasting (STLF) can support strategies for power retailers. Training based on aggregate load datasets can yield more precise STLF models. In real scenarios, however, retailers can only access the consumer information they serve. The aggregation of their data for centralized forecasting requires access to private local data, which may lead to potential security concerns. This paper proposes a method namely Privacy-Preserving  ${k}$ -means Federated Learning (PPK-Fed), to facilitate STLF co-modeling among retailers. Federated Learning (FL) is founded on the assumption of data consistency, which does not necessarily exist in real datasets. PPK-Fed incorporates  ${k}$ -means clustering together with convolutional neural networks into FL. PPK-Fed is proven to reduce the impact of potential data incongruence embedded in retailer local datasets. Besides, to address the sensitivity of the  ${k}$ -means prototype to the potential anomalies in the real dataset, PPK-Fed fuses density-based anomaly detection into  ${k}$ -means clustering under FL to improve robustness. For further model security, a secure multi-party computation (SMPC) scheme is designed in PPK-Fed. The model validity, privacy-preserving features, and robustness to anomalies have been verified using a real load dataset.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Energy Dispatch of Grid-Connected Electric Vehicle Considering Lithium Battery Electrochemical Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10256087</link><description>The grid-connected electric vehicles (EVs) serve as a promising regulating resource in the distribution grid with Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) facilities. In the day-ahead stage, electric vehicle batteries (EVBs) need to be precisely dispatched and controlled to ensure high efficiency and prevent degradation. This article focuses on considering a refined battery model, i.e., the electrochemical model (EM), in the optimal dispatch of the local energy system with high penetration of EVs which replenish energy through V2G-equipped charge station and battery swapping station (BSS). In this paper, to utilize the EM efficiently, recursive EVB constraints and a corresponding matrix-based state update method are proposed based on EM power characterization. The charging EV state distribution is profiled and a multi-layer BSS model along with binary aggregation is proposed, in order to overcome the computation complexity of combining the refined battery constraints with the mixed integer optimization. Finally, a local energy system scenario is investigated for evaluation. The efficiency and effectiveness of EM consideration are assessed from the perspective of both the system and battery.</description></item><item><title>Load Forecasting of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations: Attention Based Spatiotemporal Multi&#8211;Graph Convolutional Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268505</link><description>The charging load forecasting is of significant importance to the economic operation of charging stations and the stable operation of power systems. The charging stations couple power systems with transportation systems. Their charging loads are not only affected by the driver&#8217;s driving and charging behavior simultaneously, but also by the above two networks. There is much literature reporting load forecasting combined with historical charging loads in temporal dimension. However, the spatial data of charging stations in the neighboring areas is helpful for load forecasting, as they share common conditions, including traffic and weather factors. This paper proposes load forecasting of electric vehicle charging stations based on the spatiotemporal multi-graph convolutional networks (STMGCN). STMGCN contains three components: gated dilated causal convolution, spatiotemporal attention mechanism, and multi-graph convolutional layer. Firstly, the load model based on graph structure is established according to the historical load and geographical information of charging stations. Then, a load forecasting method of multiple charging stations is proposed, which can effectively share spatiotemporal relationships among stations. Finally, experiments on real-world dataset illustrate that STMGCN is capable of improving the accuracy of charging stations load forecasting compared with the baselines, which shows the effectiveness of the model.</description></item><item><title>Stochastic Optimization of Coupled Power Distribution-Urban Transportation Network Operations With Autonomous Mobility on Demand Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287171</link><description>Autonomous mobility on demand systems (AMoDS) will significantly affect the operation of coupled power distribution-urban transportation networks (PTNs) by the optimal dispatch of electric vehicles (EVs). This paper proposes an uncertainty method to analyze the operational states of PTNs with AMoDS. First, a PTN operation framework is designed considering the controllable EVs dispatched by AMoDS as well as the uncontrollable driving behaviors of other vehicle users. Then, a bi-level power-traffic flow (PTF) model is proposed to characterize the interaction of power distribution networks (PDNs) and urban transportation networks (UTNs). In the upper level, a social optimum model is established to minimize the operating cost of PDNs and UTNs embedded with controllable EVs. In the lower level, a stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) model is established to minimize the operating cost of uncontrollable EVs and gasoline vehicles (GVs) in UTNs. Finally, a probabilistic PTF analysis method is developed to evaluate PTN operations under environmental and human uncertainties. A regional sensitivity analysis method is proposed to identify the critical uncertainties and quantify the impacts of their distribution ranges on PTN operations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the PTN consisting of a 21-bus PDN and a 20-node UTN.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Vehicle Charging in Bilevel Power-Traffic Networks via Charging Demand Function</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10293190</link><description>Electric vehicle (EV) charging couples the operation of power and traffic networks. Specifically, the power network determines the charging price at various locations, while EVs on the traffic network optimize the charging power given the price, acting as price-takers. We model such decision-making processes by a bilevel program, with the power network at the upper-level and the traffic network at the lower-level. However, since the two networks are managed by separate entities and the charging expense term, calculated as the product of charging price and charging demand, is nonlinear. Solving the bilevel program is nontrivial. To overcome these challenges, we derive the charging demand function using multiparametric programming theory. This function establishes a piecewise linear relationship between the charging price and the optimal charging power, enabling the power network operator to manage EV charging power independently while accounting for the coupling between the two networks. With the derived function, we are also able to replace the nonlinear charging expense term with a piecewise quadratic one, thus guaranteeing solution optimality. Our numerical studies demonstrate that different traffic demands can have an impact on charging patterns and the power network can effectively incentivize charging at low-price nodes through price setting.</description></item><item><title>A Capacity-Based Regulation Method for Coordinating Electric Vehicle Charging Flows in Coupled Distribution and Transportation Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10295993</link><description>The proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) is bringing additional challenges to power distribution network (PDN) operations. Traditional regulation methods incentivize EVs to charge at expected places via price signals, which cannot guarantee a secure PDN operation due to uncertain responsiveness of EVs to charging prices. This paper explores the use of available EV charging station (EVCS) capacities as signals and proposes a regulation method to coordinate EV charging flows in coupled power and transportation networks. First, the proposed bi-level model optimizes the available charging capacities and schedules the least-cost power generation at the upper level, while assigning the traffic flows by user equilibrium and navigating the EV charging at the lower level. The adverse impact of EV charging behaviors on PDN operations is eliminated by the proposed model. Second, a branch price and cut-based decomposition algorithm is proposed to tackle the computational intractability and infeasibility brought about by the capacity regulation. Third, the inverse optimization technique is exploited to yield an enhanced regulation strategy that alleviates the impact of system adjustments on EV users. Finally, case studies are carried out on a practical network, which demonstrate the merits of the proposed capacity-based method over the traditional price-based method.</description></item><item><title>EV-EcoSim: A Grid-Aware Co-Simulation Platform for the Design and Optimization of Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10342763</link><description>To enable the electrification of transportation systems, it is important to understand how technologies such as grid storage, solar photovoltaic systems, and control strategies can aid the deployment of electric vehicle charging at scale. In this work, we present EV-EcoSim, a co-simulation platform that couples electric vehicle charging, battery systems, solar photovoltaic systems, grid transformers, control strategies, and power distribution systems, to perform cost quantification and analyze the impacts of electric vehicle charging on the grid. This python-based platform can run a receding horizon control scheme for real-time operation and a one-shot control scheme for planning problems, with multi-timescale dynamics for different systems to simulate realistic scenarios. We demonstrate the utility of EV-EcoSim through a case study focused on economic evaluation of battery size to reduce electricity costs while considering impacts of fast charging on the power distribution grid. We present qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the battery size in tabulated results. The tabulated results delineate the trade-offs between candidate battery sizing solutions, providing comprehensive insights for decision-making under uncertainty. Additionally, we demonstrate the implications of the battery controller model fidelity on the system costs and show that the fidelity of the battery controller can completely change decisions made when planning an electric vehicle charging site.</description></item><item><title>When Mobile Energy Meets Active Distribution Networks: A Security&#8211;Economic Coordination Perspective</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10342820</link><description>This article explores the interaction between active distribution networks (ADN) and mobile energy, specifically mobile charging robots (MCRs) and electric vehicles (EVs). We introduce the concept of MCR operator, who acts as a mediator between EVs and the ADN. To realize the interaction among the three parties, a cloud-edge-terminal control framework is formulated considering the coupling factors with the transportation systems. On this basis, the interaction between MCRs and EVs is achieved based on the game theory, which is implemented in a fully distributed manner to protect the data privacy. To reduce the computation complexity, the game-based interactive problem is further decomposed into a charging price bargaining problem and a charging decision and power regulation problem. Furthermore, the power quality of the ADN is guaranteed through incentivizing the charging/discharging behaviors of MCRs, which is formulated as a coordination between the ADN operator and the MCR operator, and the topology switching is also taken into consideration, thus the voltage regulation ability of the ADN and the economics of the MCR operator can be enhanced at the same time. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach, which also indicate that mobile energy and the ADN can achieve a win-win situation by benefiting all parties: Improving the utility for the EV aggregator by 35.48% (reducing the charging cost for EV owners), increasing the charging revenue for the MCR operator by 12%, and addressing the voltage issue for the ADN with a 100% voltage security rate.</description></item><item><title>Online Electric Vehicle Charging Strategy in Residential Areas With Limited Power Supply</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10345701</link><description>Electric vehicle (EV) demand is considerably increasing, aided by battery technology development and government policy support. Therefore, it is necessary to consider various charging infrastructures and secure sufficient power to support this. In several cities or countries, a large population lives in a small area, and the supply of large residential complexes such as apartments is common. Given that old apartments may not have sufficient power capacity, it is challenging to secure additional power for charging EVs. In particular, power shortages can intensify during high power usage, such as the summer season, and may become an obstacle to the spread of EVs. Therefore, an efficient charging strategy for residential complexes must be established under the condition of limited power supply. This study proposes two scheduling methods to optimally charge EVs in residential complexes considering limited power supply. The proposed scheduling algorithms are thoroughly examined through extensive simulations with parking data collected from real situations and are demonstrated to be effective for online EV charging systems.</description></item><item><title>Joint Trading and Scheduling Among Coupled Carbon-Electricity-Heat-Gas Industrial Clusters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10293189</link><description>This paper presents a carbon-energy coupling management framework for an industrial park, where the carbon flow model accompanying multi-energy flows is adopted to track and suppress carbon emissions on the user side. To deal with the quadratic constraint of gas flows, a bound tightening algorithm for constraints relaxation is adopted. The synergies among the carbon capture, energy storage, power-to-gas further consume renewable energy and reduce carbon emissions. Aiming at carbon emissions disparities and supply-demand imbalances, this paper proposes a carbon trading ladder reward and punishment mechanism and an energy trading and scheduling method based on Lyapunov optimization and matching game to maximize the long-term benefits of each industrial cluster without knowing the prior information of random variables. Case studies show that our proposed trading method can reduce overall costs and carbon emissions while relieving energy pressure, which is important for Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG).</description></item><item><title>A Decentralised Transactive Energy Market Considering Physical System Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10314804</link><description>Local energy markets leveraging direct Peer-to-Peer (P2P) trading have been proposed as a solution, which can increase prosumer participation in lower cost and more reliable supply of energy to consumers. Many approaches have been proposed to determine the optimal dispatch of distributed resources; however, existing approaches either provide inadequate representation of the physical layer or insufficient handling of infeasibilities for a continuous pricing mechanism. Hence, a gap remains in the research to date on efficiently allowing for prosumer decision autonomy while ensuring that the physical layer of the power system is considered. This paper addresses these issues with a proposed decentralised transactive solution that retains prosumer negotiation and decision autonomy, while using market determined prices to allocate limited system resources for a feasible system state. This is achieved through a transaction fee mechanism for prosumer interactions that considers the network characteristics such as topology and line congestion, and a congestion-clearing process to ensure efficient allocation of network resources. Previously reported distribution networks are used to compare the economic performance and transaction decisions of the proposed solution with existing approaches.</description></item><item><title>A Gradient-Based Wind Power Forecasting Attack Method Considering Point and Direction Selection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304287</link><description>Machine learning methods have been prevailing in wind power forecasting, while these data-driven based methods are susceptible to cyberattacks. Typical attack methods inject malicious data into influence factors according to the gradient direction of the forecasting model to randomly increase or decrease forecasting results, ignoring the number of attacks and attack effect. In this paper, an attack sample selection model is proposed to select vulnerability sample points for attack in order to reduce the number of attacks. At the same time, an attack direction judgment model is developed to launch the attack in the correct gradient direction to maximize the attack effect. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated on two public wind power datasets and nine typical machine learning based forecasting models such as ANN, ENN, RNN, LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, BiGRU, CNN and TCN. Compared with the existing gradient-based attack methods, the proposed attack method increases MAPE values of the nine models by about 9% on average while improving the attack concealment.</description></item><item><title>Complex-Value Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks and Its Applications to Electric Power Systems AI</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10317877</link><description>The effective representation, processing, analysis, and visualization of large-scale structured data over graphs, especially power grids, are gaining a lot of attention. So far most of the literature considered exclusively real-valued graph signals. However, graph signals are often sparse in the Fourier domain, and more informative and compact representations for them can be obtained using the complex envelope of their spectral components, as opposed to the original real-valued signals. This is the case for the AC carrier, and motivates its complex phasor representation. Focusing on applications in power systems, in this paper we generalize graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) to the complex domain, incorporating a complex-valued graph shift operators (GSO) based on the admittance matrix of power grids in the definition of graph filters (GF) and process complex-valued voltage phasor graph signals (GS). The theory developed is generalized to handle spatio-temporal complex network processes. We prove that complex-valued GCNs can be stable with respect to perturbations of the underlying graph support, by bounding of the error propagation through multiple NN layers. The paper showcases the benefits of complex GCN relative to several benchmarks, in power grid state forecasting and cyber-attack detection and localization.</description></item><item><title>Lyapunov-Based Resilient Cooperative Control for DC Microgrid Clusters Against False Data Injection Cyber-Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10319320</link><description>With the high penetration of renewable energy sources in power systems, DC microgrid clusters are widely installed and employed that can interface several types of renewable energy sources to different types of loads. However, being highly dependent on communication networks, DC microgrids are exposed to cyber-attacks. Therefore, in this paper, a resilient cooperative control method is proposed for DC microgrid cluster systems, that is able to achieve both the voltage regulation and power sharing in the presence of cyber-attacks. Firstly, a comprehensive microgrid cluster model is developed taking the grid forming converters, grid feeding converters, loads and line impedances into account. Based on the Lyapunov-based stability analysis, a design guideline for controller that depends only on parameters of the local microgrid is then presented. Next, steady state analysis is carried out showing that the controller is capable of eliminating the impact of cyber-attacks on the microgrid. Finally, the resilience performances of the provided control scheme are validated by experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Bayesian GAN-Based False Data Injection Attack Detection in Active Distribution Grids With DERs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10335615</link><description>Advancements in information and communication technologies have revolutionized monitoring and control capabilities within smart grids. However, it also brings new vulnerabilities to data acquisition systems and state estimation functions, which attackers can subtly tamper with the measurement data through compromising the communication network. Moreover, the high penetration of renewable energy sources with the inherited characteristics of uncertainty and variability further complicates the design of effective intrusion detection systems. In this paper, a Bayesian deep learning-based approach is developed to detect cyber attacks and maintain the security of smart grids. Our method specifically addresses the prevalent issue of imbalanced data in real power systems, which arises from the predominance of normal system operations over compromised or attacked states. Employing a novel Bayesian GAN-based technique, our approach successfully discriminates between secure and compromised measurement data, even in scenarios with significant data imbalance. Furthermore, the proposed method accommodates various practical application factors, ensuring accurate intrusion detection despite the presence of measurement noise. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed detection mechanism are validated by testing on IEEE 13-node and 123-node test systems. Simulation results and comparisons with literature methods demonstrate the superiority of proposed cybersecurity solutions.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Modeling and Mitigation of Cascading Failures in Power Grids With Interdependent Cyber and Physical Layers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10336916</link><description>Modeling and prevention of cascading failure in power systems are important topics of research. We propose a dynamic cascading failure model that considers realistic interdependencies between power and communication networks used for system monitoring and control in power grids. In this model, power line outages do not immediately disconnect communication links, whereas communication nodes have battery backup that starts depleting after considerable load shedding in the collocated bus or bus outage. When a communication node&#8217;s battery is fully depleted, the node disconnects from the cyber layer, potentially reducing the observability and controllability of the power grid. A centralized optimal preventive controller (OPC) to minimize load shedding is proposed for cascade mitigation, which is applied selectively on fully observable and controllable islands. The OPC considers AC power flow equations, multiple hard constraints, and treats overloading of lines as soft constraints. The results of Monte-Carlo simulations on the IEEE 118-bus and the 2,383-bus Polish systems demonstrate that the proposed OPC is effective in mitigating cascading failures. Finally, we demonstrate that our recently proposed Backward Euler method with Predictor-Corrector can reduce the average simulation time by approximately 9&#8211;26-folds compared to the Trapezoidal method with acceptable accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Training a Dynamic Neural Network to Detect False Data Injection Attacks Under Multiple Unforeseen Operating Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10345789</link><description>As a cyber-physical attack targeting power systems, False Data Injection Attack (FDIA) has raised widespread concern in recent years. Many FDIA detection approaches in the literature train learning models using historical data to distinguish attacked measurements from normal ones. These approaches typically suffer from severe generalization problems. Although they can achieve good detection performance when the data has a similar distribution in the offline training and online application phases, they often perform poorly when an online operating condition is unforeseen during offline training. To address this problem, this paper proposes a two-layer Dynamic Neural Network (DyNN) framework for FDIA detection. The lower layer is like a traditional FDIA detection model, which uses a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network to extract latent features, and employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to make detection decisions based on the extracted features. However, unlike traditional approaches where the internal parameters of the learning model are fixed after training, the internal parameters of the MLP are dynamically generated according to the online data by an upper-layer DyNN adapter. An interactive co-training mechanism is also proposed to coordinate both layers and ensure that the dynamically generated MLP parameters are best suited for FDIA detection in the current operating condition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the two-layer DyNN framework can achieve satisfactory FDIA detection performance even though the training and test data are collected under completely different operating conditions. In the most extreme cases, the average accuracy and F1 score of the proposed DyNN-based FDIA detection framework are 4.91% and 4.24% higher than that without DyNN, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Coordinated Defense Strategy for Time-Sensitive Networking Enabled Cyber&#8211;Physical Power System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10398470</link><description>Cyber-physical power system (CPPS) stability is severely affected by the communication network performance due to cyber-physical interdependence. Thus, uncertain cyber-physical coordinated attacks (CPCA) pose more significant threats to CPPS than physical attacks. However, the defense strategies in recent works assume real-time and reliable transmission under an ideal cyber-attack, leading to inaccurate cyber-physical interdependence modeling. Therefore, the strategies are ineffective against uncertain CPCA. This paper proposes a hierarchical CPPS network architecture that integrates time-sensitive networking (TSN) to improve resilience against uncertain CPCA. To model the uncertain CPCA, a coordinated N-K ambiguity set is proposed considering all possible link failures on both cyber and physical layers. For the cyber layer, we propose a joint routing-scheduling model of TSN-based network to support deterministic and reliable data transmission, which improves the accuracy of cyber-physical interdependence. A distributionally robust coordinated defense (DRCD) strategy integrated with cyber-physical interdependence is then proposed to mitigate the priority-based load shedding considering the uncertainties of CPCA. The formulated DRCD strategy is linearized and transformed into a tri-level optimization problem which is efficiently solved by C-CG algorithm. Case studies indicate that the DRCD strategy has superiorities in improving the resilience of CPPS compared with other conventional models.</description></item><item><title>Stochastic Dynamic Power Dispatch With Human Knowledge Transfer Using Graph-GAN Assisted Inverse Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304374</link><description>This paper proposes a novel approach for dynamic economic dispatch (DED) of distribution networks, based on graph-generative adversarial network (Graph-GAN) assisted inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) with human knowledge transfer via demonstration. Firstly, the proposed method utilizes graph convolutional network (GCN) to capture the complex and nonlinear relationships between dispatch decision and system state. Secondly, a GAN-based approach is proposed to imitate the reward function from expert demonstration data, which avoids the need for manually designed reward functions. The trained policy network is then used for decision-making in real-time optimal dispatch of distribution networks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional IRL methods and achieves supply-demand balance. Computation efficiency of the proposed method is thoroughly analyzed and shows that it is practically scalable to large-scale distribution networks. Overall, the proposed approach presents a promising alternative by incorporating human knowledge into reinforcement learning for DED of distribution networks.</description></item><item><title>Stabilizing an Islanded Microgrid via Tie Switch Controls</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10409554</link><description>In contrast to the traditional power control viewpoint, this letter explores the problem of islanded microgrid stabilization from the topological control perspective: How to stabilize an islanded microgrid through tie switch controls?

A realistic channel model is a prerequisite for designing ISAC systems. Most existing channel models independently generate the communication and sensing channels under the same framework. However, due to the multiplexing of hardware resources and the same environment, signals enabled for communication and sensing may experience shared propagation scatterers. This practical sharing feature necessities the joint generation of communication and sensing channels for realistic modeling, where the shared clusters (contributed by the shared scatterers) should be reconstructed. In this paper, we first conduct communication and sensing channel measurements for an indoor scenario at 28 GHz. The power-angular-delay profiles of multipath components are obtained, and the shared scatterers by communication and sensing channels are intuitively observed. Then, a stochastic ISAC channel model is proposed to capture the sharing feature, where shared and non-shared clusters by the two channels are defined and superimposed. To extract those clusters from measured ISAC channels, a KPowerMeans-based joint clustering algorithm is novelly introduced. Finally, stochastic channel characteristics are analyzed, and empirical simulations validate that the channel Sharing Degree (SD) increases with more shared clusters. The proposed model can realistically capture the sharing feature of ISAC channels and is able to evaluate and simulate the channel SD values, which is valuable for the design and deployment of ISAC systems.</description></item><item><title>3D Non-Stationary Channel Measurement and Analysis for MaMIMO-UAV Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10347533</link><description>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained popularity in the communications research community because of their versatility in placement and potential to extend the functions of communication networks. However, there remains a gap in existing works regarding measurement-verified stationarity analysis of the air-to-ground (A2G) Massive Multi-Input Multi-Output (MaMIMO) channel which plays an important role in realistic UAV deployment. In this article, we first design a UAV MaMIMO communication platform for channel acquisition. We then use the testbed to measure uplink Channel State Information (CSI) between a rotary-wing drone and a 64-element MaMIMO base station (BS). For characterization, we focus on multidimensional channel stationarity which is a fundamental metric in communication systems. Afterward, we present measurement results and analyze the channel statistics based on power delay profiles (PDPs) considering space, time, and frequency domains. We propose the stationary angle (SA) as a supplementary metric of stationary distance (SD) in the time domain. We analyze the coherence bandwidth and RMS delay spread for frequency stationarity. Finally, spatial correlations between elements are analyzed to indicate the spatial stationarity of the array. The space-time-frequency channel stationary characterization will benefit the physical layer design of MaMIMO-UAV communications.</description></item><item><title>LOS-to-NLOS Channel Transition Measurements, Analysis and Characterization for the 90 GHz Band</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10373938</link><description>Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems can employ a large amount of spectrum, and can consequently offer large data rates, e.g., multi-Gigabits-per-second. These systems employ directional antennas to enable acceptable link distances. Directional receiver antennas hence rotate in azimuth to capture the strongest received signal in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) regions. In this paper, we present our measurement results for the 90 GHz band for three different scenarios: indoor, outdoor, and an unusual environment: an airport maintenance hangar. We address line-of-sight (LOS), NLOS, mixed, and LOS-to-NLOS transitions. We used a 500 MHz bandwidth chirp signal and estimate parameters for the close-in free space reference distance path loss model using both simulated (ray-tracing software) and measured data. Path loss exponents are 1.6 for outdoor and 1.8 for indoors, smaller than for free space. We also estimate channel delay dispersion, and statistical stationarity distance for some channel transitions. We observed rapid path loss changes in the LOS to NLOS transition regions, 13 dB for indoor and 17 dB for outdoor. Abrupt changes of the strongest-component angle of arrival, up to 60 degrees over a few cm were observed. We also quantify path loss and root-mean square delay spread (RMS DS) for LOS, NLOS and mixed environments in an airport maintenance hangar. This hangar contains various aircraft, and multiple metallic objects whose positions changed over the measurement time. The maximum path loss exponent was 3.14 for these mixed environments. The RMS DS was a maximum of 16.23 ns in the NLOS region. Rotating the receiver antenna to capture the maximum-power signal from a reflecting object decreased the RMS DS by approximately 4 ns (25%). We observed a small minimum stationarity distance, i.e., six wavelengths in NLOS and a large minimum stationarity distance, approximately six hundred wavelengths in LOS.</description></item><item><title>A State of Charge Planning Method of a Plug-in Hybrid Electric Truck With Readily Available Navigation Signals</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10328889</link><description>Optimal energy management for electrified vehicles can be achieved with a prior understanding of the velocity profile, whose prediction accuracy is influenced by the stochastic uncertainty of real driving cycles. This article proposes a new state of charge planning method for plug-in hybrid electric trucks. The strategy eliminates the need for velocity prediction and relies solely on some readily available signals, such as estimated remaining distance and travel time. This exemption from velocity prediction avoids expensive computational costs, making it possible to use a more affordable processor. To test the strategy, four random driving cycles representing two different vocational uses are selected. The results show that the proposed strategy only increases fuel consumption by 1.3% for unknown urban and long-haul delivery cycles compared to the optimal strategy. Additionally, a sensitivity study reveals the robustness of the method on inaccurate navigation signals. These findings demonstrate that the proposed method is efficient and adaptive, making it suitable for existing truck applications without the need for additional hardware.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Release Time Assignment Method for Backup Tasks in Real-Time Standby-Sparing Driverless Vehicle Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10334042</link><description>Reliability is the primary goal of driverless vehicle design. Redundant system design is the key to ensure the safety and reliability of driverless vehicles, so some driverless vehicles adopt standby-sparing system. The standby-sparing system is a kind of computer systems that solves the fault tolerance problem by using two processors: a primary processor and a spare processor. The primary processor is responsible for executing main tasks. The spare processor is responsible for executing backup tasks. The release time assignment for backup tasks, as a part of task scheduling, is an important technology in real-time standby-sparing systems. The selective scheduling for tasks with $(m,k)$-constraint (MKSS) is the state-of-the-art scheduling method for real-time tasks in standby-sparing systems. However, this method is inefficient in release time assignment for backup tasks. In this work, we propose an efficient release time assignment method that can reduce the number of inspecting points and terminate the enumeration once there appears a special inspect point. Theoretical analysis results show that the new method can improve the execution efficiency of the release time assignment without sacrificing the energy-saving effect of MKSS. A set of experiments is conducted to evaluate the execution efficiency of the new method, and the results show that, compared with the MKSS method, the new method can reduce about 98.7% time overhead for assigning release time for tasks.</description></item><item><title>Resilient Virtual Coupling Control of Automatic Train Convoys With Intermittent Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10345793</link><description>Railways around the world are facing ever-increasing demands from booming passenger and freight transportation. Constructing new railways is not always possible due to the high cost and the lack of space. Virtual coupling (VC), which enables multiple trains to run cooperatively and closely on the same track, stands out as a major technological enabler for improving the existing railway network capacity and operational flexibility. This, however, relies on a feasible longitudinal spacing controller for each train such that the entire virtually coupled train convoy can function smoothly, safely, and efficiently. The design of such a spacing controller is intrinsically challenging as the train-to-train (T2T) communications, the primary enabling component for VC, may be interrupted by malicious cyber attacks. This paper addresses a resilient VC control problem for multiple automatic trains subject to intermittent T2T communications. First, an intermittent data transmission paradigm is presented to account for the effects of attack-incurred sporadic T2T communications. Then, a resilient distributed longitudinal spacing control method is developed to preserve the desired stability of the resultant train control system, while simultaneously guaranteeing attack resilience as well as driving safety and comfort requirements for the train convoy. It is shown that the proposed method is also effective in empowering a better trade-off analysis between traffic efficiency and safety than some traditional methods. Finally, numerical case studies using data from a realistic urban rail transit line substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>MultiRuler: A Multi-Dimensional Resource Modeling Method for Embedded Intelligent Systems of Autonomous Driving</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10354401</link><description>With the development of vehicular technology, autonomous driving has experienced explosive growth, making it an important and popular research field. In autonomous driving scenarios, autonomous driving tasks are often neural network-based intelligent tasks with different levels of complexity. These intelligent tasks usually have different requirements for hardware resources such as computational performance, memory capacity and power consumption. Additionally, the evaluation becomes even more challenging due to the different system architectures and resource configurations of hardware devices from different manufacturers. It is crucial to accurately estimate the resource requirements of different intelligent tasks on different hardware platforms in advance.To address this issue, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional resource modeling method based on deep learning techniques and constructs an evaluation model to predict the consumption of three resources: computing performance, memory usage and power consumption.Experiments demonstrate that for the performance, memory and power metrics, the evaluation model built using this method for predicting seven mainstream neural networks achieves average error rates of 6.78%, 8.86% and 7.89% respectively on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier platform, and the average error rates for the same metrics are 8.05%, 9.25% and 3.67% respectively on the Cambricon MLU220 platform.</description></item><item><title>Event-Triggered Distributed Adaptive Fixed-Time Formation Control of QUAVs With Input Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10372127</link><description>This paper considers the distributed fixed-time formation control problem of multiple quad-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (QUAVs) subject to input constraints. With an emphasis on resolving the &#8220;explosion of complexity&#8221; problem, the fixed-time command filter is constructed. Aiming at eliminating the impact of filtering errors, the error compensation signals based on fractional-power are designed. Additionally, the problem of singularity is skillfully addressed with the help of the piecewise function. To compensate for the influence of input constraints, the auxiliary signal with fixed-time convergence is devised. By incorporating the event-triggered control mechanism into the command filtered backstepping design process, an event-triggered distributed adaptive fixed-time formation control algorithm for multiple QUAVs is developed. It is strictly proved that all closed-loop signals are fixed-time bounded and the formation tracking errors are driven into a small neighborhood of the origin within a fixed time. Finally, two simulation examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fixed-time formation control scheme.</description></item><item><title>Meta-Learning-Based Predictive Energy Management for 4WD Battery Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10349947</link><description>The predictive energy management (PEM) of four-wheel drive (4WD) battery electric vehicles (BEVs) requires high accuracy in the driving information forecast of velocity and road gradient. In this article, a meta-learning-based driving information prediction (DIP) method is proposed aiming to improve the performances of real-time PEM of 4WD-BEVs with a dual-electric machine (EM) driving system in each wheel. The proposed meta-learning-based DIP method is demonstrated to have higher accuracy, better robustness and faster computation speed by testing on collected real-world driving cycles. Then, a novel PEM method is proposed based on the model predictive controller (MPC), the reference projection of which is generated by the proposed meta-learning predictor. Our PEM strategy applies dynamic programming (DP) to solve the optimal control problem. The practicability of the proposed PEM method is analyzed in regard to the model accuracy, robustness to disturbances, generalization ability and real-time applicability. The proposed PEM method takes both the power distribution between the front and rear axles and that between two motors in each wheel into consideration. The simulation results reveal that the state-of-charge (SOC) declination of the proposed PEM method is better than the benchmark by 2.66% to 3.64%.</description></item><item><title>Enhanced On-Off Keying Modulation for Wireless Power Transfer Systems to Improve Efficiency Over a Wide Load Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10366863</link><description>Maximum efficiency point tracking (MEPT) is a key concept to improve the ac-ac efficiency of the wireless power transfer (WPT) systems by controlling the equivalent load impedance with a dc-dc converter or an active rectifier. The on-off keying (OOK) modulation can reduce the switching losses of the converters to achieve MEPT but generates relatively large dc voltage ripples. In order to solve this problem, this article proposes an enhanced on-off keying (EOOK) modulation method by adding a half-bridge mode based on OOK modulation for WPT systems. By combining the three operation modes, both the inverter and the active rectifier can operate in full-bridge-half-bridge mode or half-bridge-zero mode to adapt to different power levels and achieve MEPT simultaneously. Meanwhile, the ZVS condition and the low voltage ripple are achieved as well. The circuit model of the proposed method is analyzed to derive the equivalent load resistance, the output voltage gain, and the output power with respect to the modulation of EOOK. The reason for output voltage ripples and the power losses on both the transmitting and receiving sides are also revealed. An experimental prototype is built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method can maintain constant voltage output and achieve MEPT as well as ZVS operation, with high efficiency of up to 94.761% over a wide range of load conditions.</description></item><item><title>Wideband Via-Less Reconfigurable Reflection and Transmission Linear-Circular / Linear-Cross Polarizer for Vehicular Satellite Communication Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10366851</link><description>This work proposes a novel wideband reconfigurable via-less Frequency Selective Surface (FSS) based linear-circular, linear-cross polarizer in both reflection and transmission modes. The design consists of top and bottom FSSs on either side of the Taconic TLY-5 substrate. PIN diodes mounted on the back FSS turn the polarizer transmissive and reflective in different states. For a linearly polarized wave incidence, the transmitted wave would be circularly polarized with a 3 dB Axial Ratio (AR) from 8.03&#8211;16.30 GHz (67.98%) and 30.05&#8211;31.70 GHz (5.34%). In reflection mode, this design performs linear-circular conversion in 9.38&#8211;10.49 GHz (11.17%) and 15.14&#8211;30.27 GHz (66.64%). On the other hand, the unitcell behaves as a reflective linear-cross converter with a minimum 90% Polarization Conversion Ratio over 11.43&#8211;13.43 GHz (16.09%) and 31.67&#8211;34 GHz (7.10%). Multiple surface plasmonic resonances are the reason behind the different conversions. The unitcell periodicity (0.150&#955;L &#215; 0.123&#955;L) is the compact and low-profile thickness of 0.043&#955;L. The proposed work's novelty lies in the miniaturized architecture of the linear-circular polarization converter, covering the lower frequency (X/Ku) in transmission mode and higher frequency (Ku/K) in the reflection mode, which made this polarizer a suitable candidate for vehicular satellite communication applications.</description></item><item><title>BIO-SD: A Blockchain-Empowered Intelligent Resource Management for Symbiotic Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10334622</link><description>Symbiotic communication (SC), exploiting the analogy of biological ecosystem to establish communication device ecosystems, can enable cooperative service/resource exchanges across heterogeneous devices thus realizing the complementarity among different communication resources. However, considering unstable wireless links, high network dynamics, and complex electromagnetic interference in such an ecosystem, it is difficult to perform service/resource exchanges without securing a trusted environment. Moreover, multi-dimensional service/resource exchange demanded by massive symbiotic devices (SDs) in the ecosystems exposes additional challenges for exchange decision-making. To deal with the above difficulties, in this article, we propose a blockchain-empowered intelligent coevolution for symbiotic devices (BIO-SD). Specifically, to guarantee the trustworthiness of service/resource exchange and resist malicious attacks, a direct acyclic graph (DAG)-based blockchain architecture is applied to the BIO-SD scheme. Furthermore, a modified multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) approach is adopted to make service/resource exchange decisions under this trusted environment. The simulation results show that the proposed BIO-SD scheme outperforms some conventional solutions in terms of transmission rate and transmission latency under both non-attack and malicious attack scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Assisted Mobile Target Tracking With Agile Phase Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10336533</link><description>As a typical demand of the next-generation wireless networks, numerous emerging applications impose stringent requirements on the timely and accurate sensing of the dynamical channel and the moving target. And radar with massive arrays could satisfy these requirements, imposing large power consumption and complexity. To this end, thanks to the energy-efficient and cost-effective characteristics, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been considered as one of the most promising candidates for assisting environment sensing owing to its ability of manipulating the impinging signal. Inspired by this, we investigate a novel application of RIS for target tracking in high-mobility and three-dimensional scenario. Specifically, we consider a RIS-assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system where a RIS is deployed at the base station (BS) side. Exploiting the proposed predictive phase design strategy and collected echoes, the RIS tries to estimate the motion parameters of the potential targets. In particular, to fulfill the goal of precise and timely target tracking, we adapt a particle filtering (PF) based and an extended Kalman filtering (EKF) based state estimation algorithms, where both the observations at RIS side and the inherent state evolution information are well exploited. Furthermore, numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed predictive phase design strategy in various scenarios. The performance of EKF scheme is superior to the PF about 15% averagely with lower computational complexity.</description></item><item><title>Robust Beamforming for Massive MIMO LEO Satellite Communications: A Risk-Aware Learning Framework</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10336551</link><description>This paper proposes a robust beamforming algorithm for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) low earth-orbit (LEO) satellite communications under uncertain channel conditions. Specifically, a risk-aware optimization problem is formulated to optimize the hybrid digital and analog precoding aiming at maximizing the energy efficiency of the LEO satellite while considering the required quality-of-service (QoS) by each ground user. The Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is used as a risk measure of the downlink data rate to capture the high dynamic and random channel variations due to satellite movement, achieving the required QoS under the worst-case scenario. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based framework is developed to solve the formulated stochastic problem over time slots. Considering the limited computation capabilities of the LEO satellite, the training process of the proposed learning algorithm is performed offline at a central terrestrial server. The trained models are then sent periodically to the LEO satellite through ground stations to provide online executions on the transmit precoding based on the current network state. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in achieving the QoS requirements under uncertain wireless channel conditions.</description></item><item><title>Multiple RISs for Enhancing the Secrecy Performance of NOMA Systems Over Realistic Nakagami-$m$ Fading Channels</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10337740</link><description>In this article, we utilize multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) to improve the secrecy performance of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. In particular, multi-RIS is exploited to aid two legitimate NOMA users under the existence of colluding eavesdroppers. We successfully derive the mathematical expressions of the secrecy outage probabilities (SOPs) and ergodic secrecy capacities (ESCs) of the proposed systems under realistic Nakagami-$m$ channels recommended for the fifth and beyond generation (5 G &amp; B5G) wireless networks. Numerical results confirm the enormous benefits of the proposed systems compared to the classical NOMA systems with multiple eavesdroppers and without RISs. More specifically, compared to the classical NOMA systems, the SOPs of the proposed systems are considerably lower, while the ESCs are dramatically higher. In addition, the transmit power to obtain the lowest SOPs of the proposed systems is lower than that to get the lowest SOPs of the classical NOMA systems. On the other hand, the effects of many crucial parameters, such as the carrier frequencies of Wi-Fi systems, the fading order, and the distances between transmitter-receiver, are thoroughly examined to obtain the behaviors of the proposed systems. Finally, Monte-Carlo simulations are provided to validate the derived expressions.</description></item><item><title>Minimizing Energy Consumption in MU-MIMO via Antenna Muting by Neural Networks With Asymmetric Loss</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10342748</link><description>Transmit antenna muting (TAM) in multiple-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) networks allows reducing the power consumption of the base station (BS) by properly utilizing only a subset of antennas in the BS. In this paper, we consider the downlink transmission of an MU-MIMO network where TAM is formulated to minimize the number of active antennas in the BS while guaranteeing the per-user throughput requirements. To address the computational complexity of the combinatorial optimization problem, we propose an algorithm called neural antenna muting (NAM) with an asymmetric custom loss function. NAM is a classification neural network (NN) trained in a supervised manner. The classification error in this scheme leads to either sub-optimal energy consumption or lower quality of service (QoS) for the communication link. We control the classification error probability distribution by designing an asymmetric loss function such that the erroneous classification outputs are more likely to result in fulfilling the QoS requirements. Furthermore, we present three heuristic algorithms and compare them with the NAM. Using a 3GPP-compliant system-level simulator, we show that NAM achieves about 73% energy saving compared to the full antenna configuration in the BS while achieving around 95% QoS guarantee. Furthermore, NAM is around 1000 times and 24 times less computationally intensive than the greedy heuristic algorithm and the fixed column antenna muting algorithm, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Cost-Aware Computation Offloading and Resource Allocation in Ultra-Dense Multi-Cell, Multi-User and Multi-Task MEC Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10352968</link><description>When many users offload computation tasks to edge servers in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks, how to economically utilize edge nodes with limited computation resources to ensure users' quality of experiences (QoEs) is a vital issue, especially for an ultra-dense multi-cell, multi-user, and multi-task framework. To minimize the task processing cost of all users, we try jointly optimizing computational offloading decisions, task offloading proportion, and allocation of communication and computation resources in this paper. Herein, the task processing cost is mainly caused by local energy consumption, wireless communication, and edge computing. Although the proposed optimization problem is non-convex, we design an efficient algorithm to find its optimum solution. Specifically, by taking advantage of both the improved artificial fish swarm algorithm (IAFSA) and the improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO), a hierarchical algorithm used for computation offloading (HACO) is designed. Then, the convergence, complexity, and parallel implementation of such an algorithm are analyzed. Finally, compared with other existing algorithms through simulation experiments, it is verified that the designed algorithm may achieve better performance in reducing the task processing cost under strict delay constraints.</description></item><item><title>A Flexible Resource Allocation Scheme for NR V2X Based Vulnerable Road User Protection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375790</link><description>New Radio (NR) Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) based Vulnerable Road User Protection (VRUP) can effectively reduce traffic accidents, making it a promising application in intelligent transport systems. However, considering the scarcity of radio resources and the inefficiency of resource allocation, the performance reduction caused by resource collisions may restrict its development in the V2X network. In this paper, we propose a flexible resource allocation scheme, namely Zone cluster Resource Reuse (ZRR), to reduce resource collision and achieve a better delivery performance of NR V2X based VRUP. We then develop a theoretical framework based on stochastic geometry to efficiently characterize the VRUP message delivery process under ZRR, taking into account the specified factors of NR V2X. With the help of the framework, we are able to derive two important performance metrics, namely message delivery probability and the User Equipment (UE) transmit power, and we can further search for the optimal parameter setting of ZRR. Extensive simulation and theoretical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of ZRR and the framework. Under the optimal parameter setting, ZRR is very desirable for VRUP message delivery, especially in the resource-constrained and access-intensive scenario.</description></item><item><title>Irregular Repetition Slotted ALOHA Scheme With Short Packets Under Rayleigh Fading Channels</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10354435</link><description>Irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA) has attracted widespread attention as a promising modern access protocol for machine-type communications (MTC). Since IRSA is a typical short-packet transmission scheme, the decoding error probability caused by finite block-length is not negligible. In this paper, we establish an IRSA-based uplink access model considering the impact of finite block-length transmission. In particular, assuming Rayleigh fading channels, a detection-oriented power allocation strategy is employed to enable the AP to identify collision-free slots based on the power of received signal. We then perform detailed analysis of three performance metrics, i.e., system throughput, user invalid probability, and device energy efficiency, to investigate the optimal behavior of IRSA under the proposed model. It is validated that by carefully setting the two controllable parameters, i.e., fading threshold and packet length, a good compromise between throughput and user invalid probability can be achieved while maintaining appreciable energy efficiency. Furthermore, we derive a new upper bound on the maximal load that the system can support for IRSA, which is a generalization of the existing benchmark and much tighter in erasure scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Channel Interpolation of Fading Channels and the Pilot Density Required for Predictor Antennas</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10361559</link><description>Predictor antennas (PAs) are a potential solution to severe channel aging that can occur at high vehicular velocities in non line-of-sight (NLOS) environments. Channel aging reduces the performance of many advanced communication schemes based on channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). Although PAs have been shown to work in combination with dense pilots in time and space, prediction performance can be reduced when channel estimates are sparse. This paper answers how densely pilots must be placed for PAs to be feasible when performing basic interpolation between channel estimates. This is important, especially for establishing upper limits on the length of the downlink (DL) frames required in a time-division duplex (TDD) system with PAs. Nearest-neighbor, linear, and spline interpolation are analyzed when applied to stochastic radio channels. A theoretical expression is derived for the power of the expected interpolation error for any interpolation method that can be expressed as a linear function of a set of measured values. The interpolation methods are evaluated on three theoretical channels with Rayleigh, flat, and Rician fading, and on two sets of channel measurements. The results indicate that linear and spline interpolation can be used with down to five and three samples per wavelength, respectively, without affecting the PA-based prediction NMSE. At two samples per wavelength, the prediction NMSE is still at a level that can be useful for precoding design in massive multiple-input multiple-output (M-MIMO) systems.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Task Offloading and Trajectory Planning Algorithms for Collaborative Video Analytics With UAV-Assisted Edge in Disaster Rescue</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10365400</link><description>Researchers have designed UAV-enabled edge servers (UES) to assist smart cameras (ECs) and optimize video analytics performance. However, most prior research neglects the impact of ECs' battery constraint on the system performance, especially in disaster scenarios. In this study, we introduce a novel time-slot-based UES-assisted system that aims to conserve energy and extend the overall lifetime of EC networks. Our proposed system operates in discrete time slots, wherein the UES alternates between hovering and serving ECs, or flying to a new position within its coverage area to provide better assistance. To minimize the computational overhead of ECs during hovering and serving within a time slot, we present a new task offloading scheme based on the differential evolutionary algorithm. For optimizing the UES's flying trajectory, we formulate the UES movement as a Markov decision process, taking into account system state changes. Subsequently, we design an efficient UES trajectory planning algorithm using double deep Q-learning. This algorithm optimizes energy consumption, feedback reward, and the overall system overhead, resulting in a doubling of the system's lifetime. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed task offloading algorithm exhibits high accuracy and fast convergence compared to four other state-of-the-art strategies. Moreover, the UES trajectory planning algorithm doubles the system's lifetime while reducing energy consumption and total system overhead.</description></item><item><title>NOMA-Assisted Symbiotic Backscatter: Novel Beamforming Designs Under Imperfect SIC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10365545</link><description>Optimal beamforming designs under imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding for a symbiotic network of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) primary users and a secondary ambient tag have been lacking. We address that issue here. The primary base station (BS) serves NOMA users and a passive tag simultaneously in this network. We develop two transmit beamforming designs to meet the user and tag requirements while mitigating the effect of imperfect SIC. Specifically, we design optimal BS transmit beamforming and power allocation to either maximize the weighted sum rate of NOMA users and the tag or minimize the BS transmit power under the minimum rate requirements while satisfying the tag's minimum energy requirement. Because both these problems are non-convex, we propose algorithms using alternative optimization, fractional programming, and semi-definite relaxation techniques. We also analyze their computational complexity. Finally, we present extensive numerical results to validate the proposed schemes and to show significant performance gains while keeping the tag design intact. For example, the proposed digital beamforming increases the harvested power and data rate by $2.16\times 10^{3}\%$ and 314.5% compared to random beamforming.</description></item><item><title>Cooperative Caching, Rendering, and Beamforming for RIS-Assisted Wireless Virtual Reality Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10368344</link><description>Wireless virtual reality networks(WVRNs) provide seamless connectivity between virtual reality devices with colossal application and commercial value. However, the main problem restricting its development is the high energy and computational consumption in 3D video rendering on VR devices. To address this issue, we propose a novel coordinated multi-point (CoMP) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) assisted system, where the video is rendered by multiple collaborative mobile edge computing (MEC) servers simultaneously. Besides, BSs associated with these MEC servers are formed as a CoMP cluster to achieve a high data rate. This paper aims to minimize long-term power consumption by jointly optimizing the video caching and rendering at the MEC servers and the beamforming for both BSs and RIS. We propose an online, hybrid learning framework that combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for video caching and rendering, and an alternating optimization for the beamforming of all BSs and the RIS. In particular, the reward of each action in the DRL algorithm is calculated by the proposed alternating optimization problem, thus reducing the action space and accelerating convergence speed. Numerical results and comparison experiments show that our proposed method can effectively reduce the long-term average power consumption of the system, satisfy the requirement of 3D video transmission with low computational complexity, and outperform that without CoMP and RIS techniques.</description></item><item><title>Estimation of Signal and Array Parameters in the Orientational Beamforming System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10368327</link><description>In this paper, the direction of arrival (DOA) and orientation of array (OOA) estimation problems in the recently proposed orientational beamforming (OBF) system are investigated. We show that existing DOA estimation methods can be directly applied to estimate the DOA information in the OBF system. Therefore, this paper mainly focuses on the OOA estimation problem. Three OOA estimation methods are first proposed based on the assumption of accurate DOA estimation. In each method, the OOAs of different transmitting arrays are estimated individually by searching in the one-dimensional parameter space. If the power spectral density (PSD) of the source signal emitted from a transmitting array is known, the OOA of the transmitting array can be estimated by the proposed PSD-based least squares method. Otherwise, the electronical rotation-based OBF (ER-OBF) and single-source-array OBF (SSA-OBF) methods are proposed. In both methods, the OOA of a transmitting array is estimated by detecting the peak in its corresponding orientational beampattern obtained by electronically rotating the receiving array. The electronical rotation of the receiving array is achieved by appropriately delaying received signals according to the DOA of the source signal. Based on the proposed ER-OBF method, the SSA-OBF method further proposes to use a transform matrix to suppress the mutual interference between signals from different transmitting arrays. Simulation results show that the probability of successful estimation of the proposed methods increases as the signal bandwidth and array aperture size increase. Moreover, observing that the DOA estimation error impacts the performance of the proposed OOA estimation methods, a modified random search method is developed to achieve OOA estimation in the presence of DOA estimation error.</description></item><item><title>Lightweight Differential Frameworks for CSI Feedback in Time-Varying Massive MIMO Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10372108</link><description>Channel state information (CSI) is vital for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to provide high channel capacity and energy efficiency. However, the massive antennas will lead to high feedback overhead in frequency division duplex (FDD) MIMO systems. To leverage the temporal correlation of the channel in CSI feedback, recent applications of recurrent neural networks have demonstrated promising results but with tremendous complexity. The MarkovNet reduces the overall complexity but owns the high complexity at the user equipment (UE), which is not suitable for practical deployment. In this work, we aim to improve the reconstruction performance and reduce the complexity of the UE. Leveraging the channel temporal correlation, we propose two differential frameworks called DIFNet1 and DIFNet2 to improve feedback accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, we explore the real part and imaginary part correlations of channel differential terms to reduce the complexity. Finally, we unfold the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) to provide excellent reconstruction performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed frameworks improve the reconstruction performance while greatly reducing the complexity of UEs.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Overhead Dynamic Formation Method for LEO Satellite Swarm Using Imperfect CSI</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10373866</link><description>In 6G systems, non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) are poised to address the limitations of terrestrial systems, particularly in unserved or underserved areas, by providing infrastructure with mobility that enhances reliability, availability, and responsiveness. Among various types of mobile infrastructures, low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SATCOM) has the potential to offer extended coverage that supports numerous devices simultaneously with low latency. Consequently, LEO SATCOM attracts significant attention from academia, government, and industry. The dynamic formation problem must be solved to form a swarm connecting to the ground station with the most appropriate satellites to achieve LEO SATCOM systems with higher throughput. Existing solutions use computationally demanding methods to solve the NP-hard problem and cannot be employed for SATCOM systems with short coherence time. Furthermore, precise channel state information (CSI) between the ground station and all candidate satellites is required for formation designs, resulting in significant signaling overheads. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a learning-based dynamic formation method for real-time dynamic formation capability. Specifically, motivated by the channel features of LEO SATCOM, we develop a CSI estimation method to provide coarse CSI (i.e., imperfect CSI) solely based on available geometrical information of LEO SATCOM and without any signaling overhead. Then, our approach can utilize the obtained coarse CSI as inputs and provide valuable guidelines as priorities to access specific satellites for fine-grained CSI (i.e., precise CSI). The prediction results are validated using a small-scale brute force method to determine the final formation. Our intensive simulation results suggest that the proposed method can aid current LEO SATCOM by providing real-time formation results, particularly in low-transmit power regions. Specifically, the proposed method can achieve 90% of full capacity with only 32% signaling overhead to build high-throughput LEO SATCOM.</description></item><item><title>UxNB-Enabled Cell-Free Massive MIMO With HAPS-Assisted Sub-THz Backhauling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10387578</link><description>In this article, we propose a cell-free scheme for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) base stations (BSs) to manage the severe intercell interference between terrestrial users and UAV-BSs of neighboring cells. Since the cell-free scheme requires enormous bandwidth for backhauling, we propose to use the sub-terahertz (sub-THz) band for the backhaul links between UAV-BSs and central processing unit (CPU). Also, because the sub-THz band requires a reliable line-of-sight link, we propose to use a high altitude platform station (HAPS) as a CPU. At the first time-slot of the proposed scheme, users send their messages to UAVs at the sub-6 GHz band. The UAVs then apply match-filtering and power allocation. At the second time-slot, at each UAV, orthogonal resource blocks are allocated for each user at the sub-THz band, and the signals are sent to the HAPS after analog beamforming. In the HAPS receiver, after analog beamforming, the message of each user is decoded. We formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of users by finding the optimum allocated power as well as the optimum locations of UAVs. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme compared with aerial cellular and terrestrial cell-free baseline schemes.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Intelligent Receiver for OTFS Communication in Internet of Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375127</link><description>With the continuous maturity of fifth-generation (5G) mobile communication technology, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has become a key scenario for future intelligent transportation system. One of the vital challenges of the IoV is how to provide reliable wireless communication in high mobility scenarios. Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) is widely concerned due to its robustness in high-speed mobile scenarios at high carrier frequency, which is particularly suitable for IoV communication. This paper proposes a data-driven intelligent receiver from the perspective of signal processing for OTFS communication. The proposed intelligent receiver utilizes the designed efficient MobileNet (EMNet) to jointly optimize all signal recovery modules of OTFS receiver, which complete end-to-end information recovery process. Meanwhile, the lightweight structure of EMNet reduces the computing power and storage capacity of hardware devices required for model deployment. In order to verify the system reliability of the intelligent receiver in IoV, the performance of the traditional receiver and the intelligent receiver for OTFS communication are compared and analyzed under different conditions. Simulation results show that, compared with the traditional receiver, the proposed intelligent receiver can recover information with a lower bit error rate and improve the reliability of wireless communication in the IoV.</description></item><item><title>Physical Layer Security Optimization With Cram&#233;r&#8211;Rao Bound Metric in ISAC Systems Under Sensing-Specific Imperfect CSI Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375133</link><description>The integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) endows the next generation of wireless networks with the new paradigm to the security communication. In this paper, the dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) with the property of spectral and energy efficiency is considered to strengthen the physical layer security (PLS) under the channel state information (CSI) uncertainty of the eavesdropper, where satisfies the tolerate sensing requirement and the minimum secrecy rate for each legitimate user. Specifically, we propose the PLS optimization model which employs the Cram&#233;r-Rao bound (CRB) as the sensing metric, and characterize the sensing-communication trade-off under the PLS enhancement. The efficiency closed-form solution composed of the generalized eigenvector and the power budge is derived for the case of single legitimate user with the perfect CSI of the eavesdropper. Considering the general case of multiple users, we first propose the novel sensing-specific imperfect CSI model to construct the inherent integration between the sensing capacity and the norm bound of the imperfect CSI. Further, the infinite uncertainty is handled by the S-procedure, and we propose the block coordinate descent (BCD) iterative algorithm to solve the PLS optimization problem comprising with the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and the successive convex approximation (SCA) to address the non-convexity. Simulation results demonstrate the performance gain and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in the average secrecy rate over other baseline schemes.</description></item><item><title>UAV-Enabled Federated Learning in Dynamic Environments: Efficiency and Security Trade-Off</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375744</link><description>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be deployed as flying base stations to provide wireless communication and machine learning (ML) training services for ground user equipments (UEs). Due to privacy concerns, many UEs are not willing to send their raw data to the UAV for model training. Fortunately, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an effective solution to privacy-preserving ML. To balance efficiency and wireless security, this paper proposes a novel secure and efficient FL framework in UAV-enabled networks. Specifically, we design a secure UE selection scheme based on the secrecy outage probability to prevent uploaded model parameters from being wiretapped by a malicious eavesdropper. Then, we formulate a joint UAV placement and resource allocation problem for minimizing training time and UE energy consumption while maximizing the number of secure UEs under the UAV's energy constraint. Considering the random movement of the eavesdropper and UEs as well as online task generation on UEs in practical application scenarios, we present the long short-term memory (LSTM)-based deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm (LSTM-DDPG) to facilitate real-time decision making for the formulated problem. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed LSTM-DDPG algorithm outperforms the state-of-arts in terms of efficiency and security of FL.</description></item><item><title>Improving Physical Layer Security for multi-UAV Systems Against Hybrid Wireless Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10329444</link><description>Multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems are increasingly used in civilian and military applications. However, due to the open and broadcast nature of wireless communications, the control and non-payload communication (CNPC) between UAVs and ground control stations (GCSs) is vulnerable to physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layer wireless attacks, such as eavesdropping, jamming, and spoofing. In this paper, we investigate the secure remote control (RC) issue in multi-UAV systems from a physical layer security (PLS) perspective. We propose a secure RC mechanism based on John Boyd's OODA loop and introduce cooperative jamming (CJ) from UAVs to safeguard control data from GCS. To quantify the uncertainty of wireless attacks from aerial and terrestrial potential attackers, we first introduce the Nakagami-m fading model and a mixed line-of-sight (LoS) / non-line-of-sight (NLoS) probability model to characterize hostile air-to-ground (A2G) channels. We then derive the conditions for successful attacks including passive/active eavesdropping, jamming and spoofing, and formulate the risks of each attack and the overall CJ efficiency based on secrecy outage probability (SOP). To optimize the trade-off between risk costs and CJ power consumption for various situations, we propose three levels of control schemes (centralized, partially centralized, and distributed) applicable at GCS or UAVs, and design three decision-making methods with differing complexities. Through simulations, we evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism under a general scenario that provides diverse physical conditions, threat levels, and security requirements.</description></item><item><title>Computation Offloading and Trajectory Planning of Multi-UAV-Enabled MEC: A Knowledge-Assisted Multiagent Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10339866</link><description>Compared with centralized cloud computing, mobile edge computing (MEC) enables Internet of Things (IoT) devices to offload computation-intensive tasks to the edge of the network closer to them for processing, which can effectively save energy consumption of IoT devices and alleviate network congestion and high latency problems. However, the traditional terrestrial MEC system cannot adapt to scenarios such as rapid network recovery after disasters and emergency rescue due to its poor flexibility and high deployment cost, and assembling edge servers to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to assist in rapidly building mobile edge networks is a feasible solution. Therefore, this paper considers a multi-UAV-enabled MEC network with the optimization objectives of maximizing the processing success rate of computational tasks and fairness of system, while minimizing the processing delay of computational tasks. We investigate the computation offloading problem and the trajectory planning problem from the perspectives of IoT devices and UAVs, respectively. Then model them as Markov decision processes (MDPs) and propose a joint optimization scheme based on expert knowledge-assisted multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has significant advantages over baseline algorithms in terms of processing success rate and delay of computational tasks as well as fairness of the system.</description></item><item><title>Construction of Ad-Hoc Public Safety Communications Networks Using EVs as Base Stations in Disaster Scenarios</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10354373</link><description>Recently, mobile traffic has increased and is expected to increase further. Therefore, the deployment of high-density networks with many small-cell base stations within the coverage area of the macro-cell base station is being considered as a network that can increase the capacity of mobile networks. The open-radio access Network (O-RAN), which divides the functions of the radio access network, has also attracted attention. However, in the networks, the function of the base station stops presumably because of power outages or failures in the event of disasters, resulting in the failure of user equipments (UEs) to communicate with external networks. Then, use of Electric Vehicles (EVs) with base station functionality as alternatives to base stations during disasters is being considered. Therefore, this study examines networks using the aforementioned EVs and highlights the problems caused by inoperable EVs on UEs that cannot communicate with external networks and the need for power consumption by network operation and movement during disasters. Furthermore, we propose a method to rebuild networks by considering the power consumed by network operation and movement. In the proposed method, we model the system, express each power consumption mathematically, and optimize the placement of EVs and transmission power. In addition, the results of the experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in various environments. The reduction in the power consumed by the network operation and movement improved the feasibility of these networks.</description></item><item><title>Beam Tracking Assisted High Mobility V2I Communications With Extremely Large Lens Antenna Array</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10356727</link><description>Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenarios commonly demand both high-accuracy positioning and high-rate communication. In this study, we consider the base station equipped with an extremely large lens antenna array (ExLAA) that serves the vehicles located in the near field region. To overcome the challenges posed by the &#8220;window&#8221; type array response, we propose a novel direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation based on sparse Bayesian inference (SBI). In this method, we treat the distance factor in window function as a nuisance parameter which is estimated by the classical matched filtering (MF) due to the sensing ability. Moreover, we develop an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based closed-loop tracking strategy to assist communication links. This scheme fully exploits the beam tracking capabilities and its energy-focusing characteristics of ExLAA, resulting in a substantial reduction in communication overhead for high mobility scenarios. Numerical results demonstrate that our approach achieves good parameter estimation performance while establishing stable communication links for mobile vehicles.</description></item><item><title>Mobile Power Allocation Intelligent Optimization Algorithm for Cooperative NOMA Network Based on CBAM-BiLSTM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10356833</link><description>The non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology can greatly improve the spectral efficiency of wireless communication systems. The incorporation of NOMA technology into a 5G mobile communication network has the potential to significantly improve communication performance. First, we establish an mobile cooperative NOMA multi-user network. The exact outage probability (OP) expressions are then derived, and the effect of the power allocation on OP performance is investigated. Finally, we design a CBAM-BiLSTM network and propose an intelligent power allocation optimization algorithm based on system efficiency and user fairness. The CBAM-BiLSTM network is a structure based on convolutional block attention mechanism (CBAM) and bidirectional long short term memory network (BiLSTM). CBAM performs feature selection and weights the spatial and channel dimensions of feature maps to improve the network's classification accuracy. BiLSTM can fully utilize contextual information and handle long-term dependencies, thereby providing more comprehensive and accurate modeling capabilities and predictive performance. Simulation results indicate that, compared with the Transformer, ShuffleNetV2, and YOLOv5 algorithms, the CBAM-BiLSTM can obtain more accurate power allocation coefficients and improve system performance. Compared to ShuffleNetV2, CBAM-BiLSTM reduces mean square error (MSE) by 42.8%.</description></item><item><title>Optimizing Task Offloading and Resource Allocation in Vehicular Edge Computing Based on Heterogeneous Cellular Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10368331</link><description>5G is a promising technology for improving the Quality of Service (QoS) in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) applications, including Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC).

To address this issue, we propose a VEC architecture based on heterogeneous cellular networks, in which vehicles can select the appropriate communication network by classifying tasks according to their maximum tolerable latency. In order to further enhance the overall performance of the VEC system, we developed an efficient scheme that optimizes task offloading decisions and computation resource allocation in the proposed architecture.

Within the network, a scheme enabling information and energy cooperation among APs is proposed to realize data transmission among cells as well as mitigate the risk of energy supply-demand imbalance. Based on such cooperation scheme, APs with surplus energy can share energy with other APs with deficient power supply, and the energy efficiency maximization problem is studied for the considered network of two practical scenarios including APs with energy-storage devices (ESDs) and without ESDs. To solve the optimization problems, a novel distributed scheme is designed to jointly the optimize energy cooperation strategy and time allocation, where each AP communicates only with neighboring APs to independently update its own optimal decision. Different from the centralized methods requiring global parameters such as all channel status information (CSI) that may be unavailable, APs in the developed distributed scheme jointly undertake the computational tasks without knowing all CSI. This results in faster convergence and higher scalability for multicell networks compared to the centralized schemes. Finally, simulation examples of two scenarios are presented to validate the performance of the proposed distributed scheme.</description></item><item><title>Pareto-Optimal Aerial-Ground Energy Minimization for Aerial 3D Mobile Edge Computing Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10372106</link><description>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are a crucial integrated component in mobile edge computing (MEC) for extending service coverage, where UAVs' and devices' energy consumption are two fundamental problems. In this paper, we consider a UAV-enabled three-dimensional (3D) MEC network and study the Pareto-optimal aerial and ground energy minimization problem by jointly optimizing offloading time allocation, resource allocation, and UAV 3D trajectory. We first investigate the problem of minimizing energy consumption for the UAV, and then shift our focus to minimize the energy consumption of the devices. To tackle them, we propose two efficient alternating optimization algorithms with different outer and inner structures to address the two optimization problems. To be specific, we split the original problem into two subproblems in the outer structure. The inner structure addresses the subproblems with difference-of-convex (D.C.) framework and successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. Based on the energy consumption lower bounds for the UAV and devices obtained by these two aforementioned original problems, a Pareto-optimal solution is proposed, in which the aerial-ground energy tradeoff can be balanced. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme and reveal two insightful tradeoffs for 3D UAV-enabled MEC networks, i.e., aerial-ground energy tradeoff and altitude-related angle-distance tradeoff.</description></item><item><title>Joint Task Offloading and Resource Allocation in Multi-User Mobile Edge Computing With Continuous Spectrum Sharing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10373153</link><description>This paper investigates the joint task offloading and communication/computation resource allocation in a multiuser mobile edge computing (MEC) system. In particular, we consider the multi-channel scenario, in which there are multiple channels each at a different frequency band, and the spectrum of each channel is shared by one or more mobile users (MUs) for offloading continuously. Our objective is to minimize a weighted sum of the energy consumption at MUs, by jointly optimizing the offloading time duration, the offloaded task data bits, the bandwidth allocations of different MUs at these channels, and the computing frequencies at both MUs and edge servers. Because the formulated problem has coupled optimization variables, it is non-convex and difficult to get the optimal solution. To address the challenge, we propose to decompose the formulated problem into two levels. For the lower-level problem with given offloading time duration, we employ the block coordinate descent framework to optimize two groups of optimization variables iteratively, for each of which the optimal solution is obtained in well structures with low complexity. For the upper-level problem for optimizing the offloading time duration, we find the optimal solution by performing variable manipulations and transforming the problem to a standard monotonic optimization problem. Numerical results show that our proposed method is effective in achieving the global optimality of the energy minimization problem and its advantages over other benchmark schemes.</description></item><item><title>UAV-Aided Secure Communication With Imperfect Eavesdropper Location: Robust Design for Jamming Power and Trajectory</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375787</link><description>This paper exploits the mobility of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to improve the physical layer (PLS) security against potential eavesdropping scenarios, where the sensitive data transmitted from a ground base station (GBS) to multiple information receivers (IRs) is easily eavesdropped by multiple non-colluding eavesdroppers (Eves). Specifically, the UAV is employed as a friendly jammer to transmit artificial noise to degrade the wiretap channels. By leveraging the UAV's mobility and the possibility of establishing line-of-sight links, the UAV can move close to the Eves and opportunistically jam them. Especially, two practical factors, namely, the imperfect location information of Eves and the existence of no-fly zones are considered. Since only the partial position information of the Eves can be known, as the worst case, the minimum average secrecy rate of IRs is robustly optimized by jointly designing the trajectory and jamming power of the UAV, and the transmission power of the GBS to ensure the security of all IRs. However, the formulated problem with coupled variables is non-convex and intractable. As such, an efficient alternative iterative suboptimal algorithm is proposed to solve this problem by applying the block coordinate descent, successive convex approximation, slack variables, and $\mathcal {S}$-Procedure. Numerical results reveal that the proposed robust algorithm can substantially improve the max-min average secrecy rate, and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is further verified by comparing it with three benchmark schemes.</description></item><item><title>RL-Based Cargo-UAV Trajectory Planning and Cell Association for Minimum Handoffs, Disconnectivity, and Energy Consumption</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10347516</link><description>Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a promising technology for last-mile cargo delivery. However, the limited on-board battery capacity, cellular unreliability, and frequent handoffs in the airspace are the main obstacles to unleash its full potential. Given that existing cellular networks were primarily designed to service ground users, re-utilizing the same architecture for highly mobile aerial users, e.g., cargo-UAVs, is deemed challenging. Indeed, to ensure a safe delivery using cargo-UAVs, it is crucial to utilize the available energy efficiently, while guaranteeing reliable connectivity for command-and-control and avoiding frequent handoff. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel approach for joint cargo-UAV trajectory planning and cell association. Specifically, we formulate the cargo-UAV mission as a multi-objective problem aiming to 1) minimize energy consumption, 2) reduce handoff events, and 3) guarantee cellular reliability along the trajectory. We leverage reinforcement learning (RL) to jointly optimize the cargo-UAV's trajectory and cell association. Simulation results demonstrate a performance improvement of our proposed method, in terms of handoffs, disconnectivity, and energy consumption, compared to benchmarks.</description></item><item><title>Exploiting Faster-Than-Nyquist Signaling for MIMO Covert Communications: A Low-Complexity Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10336559</link><description>In this article, we present an investigation into the use of faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) covert communications with a multi-antenna warden. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the covert rate subject to the covertness and transmit power constraints. Due to the dimensional expansion of variables, solving the formulated problem by conventional convex optimization method incurs unaffordable computational overhead. To circumvent this issue, we propose a low-complexity linear precoding and equalization method to nullify the energy leakage towards the warden while decoupling the MIMO FTN signaling into independent substreams simultaneously, and allocate the power by a new scaled water-filling approach. Numerical results validate the superiority of FTN signaling in MIMO covert communications over the Nyquist counterpart, and also show the effectiveness of our proposed scheme, which merely causes minor performance loss compared to the optimal baseline.</description></item><item><title>A Microsecond Energy-Efficient LoRa Time Synchronization Based on Low-Layer Timestamping and Asymmetric Time Translation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10342787</link><description>High-precision time synchronization is chased by thriving Long Range (LoRa) research due to its significance for accurate monitoring, detection, and network collaboration. Only a few LoRa time synchronization methods could achieve microsecond-level accuracy, however, at the expense of extensive synchronization message exchanges. In this article, we propose a microsecond time synchronization for the LoRa network based on low-layer timestamping and asymmetric time translation. Note that, the proposed time synchronization does not induce synchronization message transmissions at the LoRa end nodes, therefore, achieves high energy efficiency. Experimental results on a real LoRa testbed demonstrate that the proposed method achieves microsecond-level synchronization accuracy with significantly fewer synchronization message transmissions compared to the state-of-the-art.</description></item><item><title>EMF-Aware Energy Efficient MU-SIMO Systems With Multiple RISs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10345757</link><description>In this article, we consider an uplink transmission of a multi-user single-input multiple-output (SIMO) system assisted with multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). We investigate the energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem with an electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure constraint. In order to solve the problem, we present a lower bound for the EE and adopt an alternate optimization problem. Then, we propose the Energy Efficient Multi-RIS (EEMR) algorithm to obtain the optimal transmit power of the users and phase shifts of the RISs. Moreover, we study this problem for a system with a central RIS and compare the results. The simulation results show that for a sufficient total number of RIS elements, the system with distributed RISs is more energy efficient compared to the system with a central RIS. In addition, for both the systems the EMF exposure constraints enforce a trade-off between the EE and EMF-awareness of the system.</description></item><item><title>Secrecy Energy Efficiency Enhancement of Active IRS Aided MISO Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10361603</link><description>Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is widely used to enhance physical layer security recently. However, the double-fading attenuation caused by IRS reflection often limits its security performance. The employment of active IRS could improve this situation but incurring more energy consumption. In this correspondence, we consider an active IRS-assisted multiple input single output (MISO) downlink system and aim to maximize the secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) to achieve the suboptimal trade-off between the secrecy rate and energy consumption. To solve this non-convex joint beamforming problem, an alternating optimization algorithm is proposed, which jointly optimizes the reflecting matrix of active IRS and beamforming vector at the base station using the successive convex approximation and dual Lagrange method, respectively. Simulation results show the superior SEE performance of active IRS, especially when the eavesdropping channel is stronger.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid NOMA Assisted Integrated Sensing and Communication via RIS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10364958</link><description>This paper investigates the optimization of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) in an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. To meet the demand of growing number of devices, power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is considered. However, traditional NOMA with a large number of devices is challenging due to large decoding delay and propagation error introduced by successive interference cancellation (SIC). Thus, OMA is integrated into NOMA to support more devices. We formulate a max-min problem to optimize the sensing beampattern with constraints on communication rate, through joint power allocation, active beamforming and RIS phase shift design. To solve the non-convex problem with a non-smooth objective function, we propose a low complexity alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, where a closed form expression for the intra-cluster power allocation (intra-CPA) is derived, and penalty and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods are used to optimize the beamforming and phase shift design. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of improving minimum beampattern gain (MBPG) compared with other baselines. Furthermore, the trade-off between sensing and communication is analyzed and demonstrated in the simulation results.</description></item><item><title>Achievable Rate Analysis of Intelligent Omni-Surface Assisted NOMA Holographic MIMO Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10381741</link><description>An intelligent omni-surface (IOS) assisted holographic multiple-input and multiple-output architecture is conceived for $360^\circ$ full-space coverage at a low energy consumption. The theoretical ergodic rate lower bound of our non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme is derived based on the moment matching approximation method, while considering the signal distortion at transceivers imposed by hardware impairments (HWIs). Furthermore, the asymptotically ergodic rate lower bound is derived both for an infinite number of IOS elements and for continuous aperture surfaces. Both the theoretical analysis and the simulation results show that the achievable rate of the NOMA scheme is higher than that of its orthogonal multiple access counterpart. Furthermore, owing to the HWIs at the transceivers, the achievable rate saturates at high signal-to-noise ratio region, instead of reaching its theoretical maximum.</description></item><item><title>Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Assisted Uplink NOMA for eMBB and URLLC Coexistence</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10373954</link><description>In fifth-generation (5G) and next-generation mobile communication systems, one of the main design objective is to support different types of devices with disparate requirements. While a non-orthogonal coexistence of different services on the radio interface may potentially yield higher spectral efficiency, a significant performance bottleneck is set by the mutual interference between heterogeneous devices. Interference management strategies of different complexity &#8211; ranging from treating interference as noise to successive interference cancellation &#8211; may be implemented at the base station to address this problem. In this context, this work investigates the role that intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) may play in shaping the interference between enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) devices. Specifically, we investigate the joint design of power allocation and IRS reflection matrix, and draw conclusions on the relative advantages of decoding strategies at the base station by accounting for the interference management capabilities of an IRS-aided uplink.</description></item><item><title>Device Scheduling for Relay-Assisted Over-the-Air Aggregation in Federated Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10373941</link><description>Federated learning (FL) leverages data distributed at the edge of the network to enable intelligent applications. The efficiency of FL can be improved by using over-the-air computation (AirComp) technology in the process of gradient aggregation. In this article, we propose a relay-assisted large-scale FL framework, and investigate the device scheduling problem in relay-assisted FL systems under the constraints of power consumption and mean squared error (MSE). we formulate a joint device scheduling, and power allocation problem to maximize the number of scheduled devices. We solve the resultant non-convex optimization problem by transforming the optimization problem into multiple sparse optimization problems. By the proposed device scheduling algorithm, these sparse subproblems are solved and the maximum number of federated learning edge devices is obtained. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme as compared with other benchmark schemes.</description></item><item><title>Active-RIS-Aided Covert Communications in NOMA Systems With Cooperative Jamming</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10374265</link><description>In this paper, cooperative jamming is employed to enhance the covert communication performance of active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system. Taking into account the constraints of the active-RIS power budget and covertness requriments, we formulate the covert rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the transmit power allocation, jamming power allocation, and active-RIS beamforming. To tackle the highly coupled non-concave covert rate maximization problem, the optimal solutions for the decoupled sub-problems of the transmit power allocation, jamming power allocation, and active-RIS beamforming are derived, respectively. Specifically, closed-form expressions for the transmit power and jamming power optimization sub-problems are derived and a penalized Dinkelbach transform approach is proposed to optimize the rank-1 constrained active-RIS beamforming. Finally, the enhanced covert communication performance of our proposed scheme is demonstrated and corroborated by numerical results.</description></item><item><title>Channel Estimation for Backscatter Communication Systems Under Circuit Sensitivity Constraint</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375798</link><description>Backscatter communication (BC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling energy-efficient and low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) systems. However, one practical constraint that is often neglected in BC studies is the circuit sensitivity of the backscatter device (BD), which sets the minimum signal strength required to activate it for signal reflection. In this paper, we address the channel estimation (CE) problem in the BC system with a circuit sensitivity constraint. Specifically, we propose three channel estimators for the receiver in the BC system that is unaware of the activation states of the BD, namely the maximum likelihood (ML), linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE), and maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimators. We derive both the Cram$\acute{\text {e}}$r-Rao bound (CRB) and Bayesian Cram$\acute{\text {e}}$r-Rao bound (BCRB) to evaluate the performance of the proposed estimators. Finally, we provide simulations to validate our analysis. Our results demonstrate that the proposed LMMSE and MAP estimators outperform traditional estimators that neglect the circuit sensitivity constraint.</description></item><item><title>Review of Mono- and Bifacial Photovoltaic Technologies: A Comparative Study</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10464335</link><description>This article reviews the recent works on bifacial and monofacial photovoltaic (PV) technologies. Furthermore, the effectiveness of bifacial PV technologies over that of monofacial technologies is examined. Unlike monofacial PVs, bifacial PVs have light sensitivity on both the front as well as the rear surface and, therefore, have higher PV yield compared to monofacial PVs. However, because of higher energy output, thermal and electrical behavior are critical in bifacial PV, which needs to be optimized for bifacial PV cells to maintain the optimum cell efficiency. Studies show that bifacial thin-film Si-heterojunction PV cells have the maximum laboratory efficiency. Surface area, the fraction of light reflected, geographical location, economy, and efficiency are key contributing factors that govern the selection of bifacial PV systems. The dual use of land gives an edge to bifacial PV systems over monofacials. The dual use of land cases, such as agri-PVs with bifacial, vertical bifacial, and floating-PVs with bifacial, are unique systems where monofacial PV modules are less effective.</description></item><item><title>Coupled Process/Device Modeling and Point Defect Engineering of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 Solar Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10460087</link><description>Point defects directly impact solar cell device performance by limiting the carrier lifetime.

The LPCs convert efficiently both high-power and low-cost laser light of 800&#8722;1000 nm in wavelength and eye-safe laser light of &#8764;1500 nm to electricity. Furthermore, the LPCs operate as highly efficient SCs. Thus, the proposed dual-wavelength (DW) LPCs fulfill the functions required for LPCs used for optical wireless power transmission to driving electric vehicles; the solar-cell function charges the secondary batteries anywhere during daytime. I designed the electronic band structures of the DW-LPCs and calculated the limiting conversion efficiencies, revealing that the DW-LPCs equipped with the QRs potentially yield high conversion efficiencies for each light competitive with those of the conventional single-function devices dedicated. However, new IB materials must be developed to realize the high efficiency, because the required electronic band structures are significantly different from those of previously reported IB-SC materials.</description></item><item><title>TCAD Modeling and Simulation of Dark Current-Voltage Characteristics in High-Periodicity InGaN/GaN Multiple-Quantum-Wells (MQWs) Solar Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10473022</link><description>Gallium nitride (GaN) based high periodicity indium/GaN multiple quantum wells solar cells have recently been proposed for different applications: from operation in harsh environments, like space applications, to their use in concentrator solar harvesting system and wireless power transfer system. In this article, we extensively investigate the mechanisms, which influence the in-dark current-voltage characteristics of these device under no excitation by means of experimental measurements and numerical simulations performed with the technology computer-aided design (TCAD) Sentaurus suite from Synopsys. Two different nonlocal models are introduced: the first one considers intrabarrier tunneling, which was found to be the dominant conduction mechanism for voltages above the main diode turn-on; the second model considers trap-assisted tunneling, implemented through traps uniformly distributed in space and energy, to reproduce the current flow in the sub turn-on region. A good matching is obtained between the experimental and simulated electrical characteristics, by considering these nonlocal models in addition to the thermionic escape.</description></item><item><title>Evaluation and Enhancement of Laser Power Transfer Efficiency in the Presence of Atmospheric Turbulence</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10473035</link><description>Laser-based wireless power transfer (LWPT) technology has attracted more and more attention in the field of long-range wireless power transfer (WPT). In practical applications, the light intensity distribution of the laser beam at the receiving end has a crucial impact on the efficiency of the power transfer system. In this article, the optimization of photovoltaic (PV) array configuration is explored in an atmospheric turbulent environment under the irradiation of Gaussian (GS) and flat-top (FT) laser beams. By comparing the photoelectric conversion efficiency of 3&#215;3 PV arrays under the irradiation of GS beams and three different orders of FT beams, we conducted a comprehensive investigation on the impact of GS beam and FT beams as light sources on the performance output of PV arrays. We develop a model of atmospheric turbulence and analyze its effects on laser power transmission. Further numerical simulation was performed to evaluate the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the two laser beams when irradiated by the PV array after experiencing atmospheric turbulence. The results indicate that the FT beam exhibits superior characteristics compared to the GS beam in most cases. FT beams with orders 2, 5, and 10 exhibit an over 8% increase in power compared to a GS beam upon direct irradiation. After passing through weak turbulence for a distance of 2 km, the power enhancement exceeds 9% for all three FT beams. These findings highlight the potential advantages of FT beams in LWPT and offer new insights into the design and optimization of long-range WPT systems.</description></item><item><title>Simultaneous Photovoltaic Power Generation and Electroluminescence in Three-Terminal Tandem Solar Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478732</link><description>Optical wireless power transmission (OWPT) using 2-terminal single-junction solar cells or light-emitting diodes is limited because it cannot generate photovoltaic power while transmitting light signals. In this study, we determine the feasibility of using a three-terminal tandem (3TT) solar cell for OWPT with two-way optical wireless communication (OWC). Accordingly, we perform fundamental experiments on simultaneous photovoltaic power generation and electroluminescence in the 3TT solar cell, which comprises a top GaAs and bottom InGaAsP subcells. The results indicate that the top cell can be operated for electroluminescence, whereas the bottom cell can be simultaneously operated for power generation under solar or near-infrared laser irradiation. These results imply that a 3TT solar cell can be utilized as an OWPT/OWC device, particularly for small Internet of Things sensors, such as in implantable bioelectronics. In future studies, we will focus on the tradeoff between the optical communication and power generation performances.</description></item><item><title>Photovoltaic Cell Defect Detection by Lock-In Thermography Using 2-D Gaussian Profile</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10438520</link><description>The electrical energy produced by photovoltaic systems can be critically affected by a variety of factors. In order to detect defective photovoltaic cells, several monitoring techniques, such as lock-in thermography, have been widely used alongside some analytical methods that avoid subjectivity. This article proposes a method with low computational cost that provides a simple and easily implementable way to quantifiably discern if a photovoltaic cell is defective or not. A two-dimensional Gaussian fit is applied to images generated by fast Fourier transform and principal component analysis algorithms on thermographic data from lock-in thermography tests. The considered coefficient of determination ${R}^2$ was found to be a good measure of fitting quality. Additionally, the method highlighted the potential of its application on first principal component, with ${R}^2$ between 0.944 and 0.986, and magnitude images, with ${R}^2$ between 0.965 and 0.985, in order to identify and distinguish nondefective cells from defective ones.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Inclination and Azimuth Angles of a Photovoltaic Module With Load Patterns for Improved Power System Stability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10488860</link><description>Globally, large-scale photovoltaic (PV) systems are being installed to achieve maximum power generation efficiency. However, this often results in severe power fluctuations, impacting the stability of the power system. To enhance the power system stability, it is crucial to effectively distribute the times of maximum power output. This can be achieved by making changes to the inclination angle and azimuth of PV modules at power plants. The modeling results indicate a prediction error of 3.65% relative to the actual measurements. To assess system stability based on each installation method, new concepts called demand gradient (DG) and demand gradient average (DGA) were introduced and analyzed using the load pattern in Metropolitan Seoul. The electricity usage was categorized into four divisions: residential (dwelling), public, service, and manufacturing. The analysis revealed that optimal inclination angles for the dwelling, public, service, and manufacturing sectors were 60&#176;, 30&#176;, 30&#176;, and 15&#176;, respectively. As for installation azimuths, the optimal values were 0&#176;, 80&#176;, 160&#176;, and 230&#176;, respectively. When both the inclination angle and azimuth were varied simultaneously, their optimal installation methods included inclination angles of 60&#176;, 60&#176;, 35&#176;, and 50&#176;, and azimuths of 330&#176;, 210&#176;, 230&#176;, and 190&#176; for the dwelling, public, service, and manufacturing sectors, respectively. Among the various scenarios, the most significant improvement in grid stability was observed in the existing south-facing installation of DGA in the dwelling sector, demonstrating a remarkable 77% reduction from 0.1 to 0.057.</description></item><item><title>A Comprehensive Shade Resilient Approach for Enhanced PV Array Performance Under Irradiance Mismatch Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10474027</link><description>This article proposes a comprehensive shade-resilient approach to enhance the overall productivity of the two most widely used photovoltaic (PV) configurations: total-cross-tied (TCT) and series-parallel (SP), under irradiance mismatch conditions (IMCs). The proposed generalized panel rearrangement strategy (GPRS) for TCT and SP-GPRS for SP arrays is applicable to arrays of any dimensions, including PV arrays with odd, even, and mixed numbers of rows and columns. An extensive performance evaluation is conducted, comparing the proposed approach with various contemporary reconfiguration methods, using both simulation and hardware setups. In the simulation analysis, a 9 &#215; 9 PV array is exposed to four unique shading cases. Comparative performance assessment, utilizing prominent performance indices, demonstrates that the proposed GPRS reduces mismatch loss (ML) by up to 75.4% compared to a TCT PV array of comparable dimensions. Additionally, SP-GPRS yields up to 35.6% lower ML than the SP arrangement. Efficiency enhancements of up to 15.18% and 10.03% are achieved by optimizing the module positions in a 9 &#215; 9 PV array within the TCT and SP frameworks using the proposed GPRS and SP-GPRS, respectively. Experimental implementation of the proposed approach reveals significant power augmentation, with improvements of up to 31% and 16.1% for TCT and SP arrangements, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Power Prediction of PV Modules Contaminated by Bird Droppings via an Image Thresholding Process</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443925</link><description>Environmental factors that influence marine photovoltaic (PV) systems differ considerably from those affecting overland PV systems. The bird dropping, which is one of them, is a main cause of marine PV power reduction. The power prediction of a PV module contaminated by bird droppings is hard because light could pass through the bird dropping depending on the thickness of it unlike hard shading condition. This article shows differences between a bird-dropping shading and hard shading of the contaminated modules, and suggests a prediction model considering a transmittance of a bird dropping using image processing (IP). First, the shading rate (SR), which is the PV module surface ratio covered by bird droppings, is calculated using IP technologies. The accuracy of the SR is verified through an experiment creating artificial hard shading on the module using black masking tape. It has an error rate of 3% compared to our targeted benchmark SRs. Subsequently, an equivalent step methodology, which combines IV curves from individual cells to yield an IV curve for the entire PV module, was adopted to predict the power. The accuracy of this methodology is confirmed, and it showed a 5% error. However, in the case of real bird-dropping shades, discrepancies up to 15% are observed. In this article, the light penetration through bird droppings by a transmittance function was considered to predict the output of modules contaminated by the bird droppings. Errors fluctuate between 1%&#8211;20% based on the quantification of light interferences.</description></item><item><title>Layer-Sensitive Neural Processing Architecture for Error-Tolerant Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10458963</link><description>Neural network (NN) operation has high requirements for storage resources and parallel computing, which bring huge challenges to the deployment of NNs in Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Consequently, this work proposed a low-power NN architecture, comprising an energy-efficient NN processor and a Cortex-M3 host processor to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) end-to-end inference at the edge. The innovations of this article are as follows: 1) to minimize the bit width of the weight while keeping the loss of accuracy within a small range, cross-layer error tolerance has been analyzed, and mixed precision quantization has been adopted for cross-layer mapping; 2) dynamic reconfigurable tensor processing unit (DR-TPU) with approximate computing has been proposed, which brings  $1.45\times $  computing energy reduction within 0.46% accurate loss in ResNet-50; and 3) a customized input feature map (IFM) reuse and over-writeback strategy has been adopted, eliminating the recurrent fetching from the on-chip and off-chip memories. The times of on-chip storage access can be reduced by 25%&#8211;60%, and the capacity of on-chip memory can be reduced to half of the original. The processor has been implemented at 28-nm CMOS technology.

An 8-kb SRAM macro is used to implement the synapses of the neurons to enable analog computing in memory (ACIM) operation and produce current-type dendrite signals of the neurons. A novel low-leakage 8T (LL8T) SRAM cell is proposed for implementing the SRAM macro to reduce the read leakage currents on the read bitlines (RBLs) when performing ACIM. Each neuron&#8217;s soma is implemented with low-power analog circuits to realize the SOLIF model for processing the dendrite signals and generating the final analog output spikes.

The innovative  $LC$ -QNUTL latch is primarily composed of three soft-error-immune (SEI) static random-access memory (SRAM) cells and a triple-level C-element (CE) unit, which includes five two-input CE and a clock-gating (CG)-based two-input CE. The SEI SRAM cell utilizes polarity hardening technology and source-isolation technology, significantly reducing the number of sensitive nodes and enhancing the latch&#8217;s stability. By using the high-speed transmission gate (TG) technology and stacked structures, the proposed latch offers minimal overhead in terms of delay and power consumption, yielding an improved power delay area product (PDAP). When compared to contemporary quadruple node upset (QNU)-tolerant latch designs (including HLMR, 4NUHL, and LDAVPM), the new design offers substantial improvements&#8212;29.53% less delay, 80.09% reduced power consumption, 58.52% smaller silicon area, and 433.43% improved comprehensive PDAP on average. Furthermore, simulation results demonstrate that the  $LC$ -QNUTL latch exhibits reduced sensitivity to process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations, thus providing superior reliability, which makes it an ideal choice for safety-critical applications.</description></item><item><title>On the Resiliency of Protected Masked S-Boxes Against Template Attack in the Presence of Temperature and Aging Misalignments</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10473706</link><description>Profiling side-channel analysis (SCA) attacks have received a lot of attention in the recent years. To perpetrate these attacks, the adversary creates a profile of a sensitive device at her disposal, and uses it to model a target device with a similar implementation to extract its key. Template attacks are recognized to be the most powerful profiling attacks when the measurement noise is Gaussian. To tackle SCA attacks, different countermeasures have been proposed in the literature, among which masking schemes have received the utmost attention. By adding randomness to the circuit, masking schemes prevent the adversary from relating the power consumption to the evaluated data, thus making the attack more difficult. In this article, we study the protection provided by several masking schemes against template attacks. More precisely, we investigate how the success of the template attack is changed when there is a misalignment between the target and profiling devices in terms of temperature and process variations. As another innovative analysis angle, we extensively study the impact of device aging on the template attack and demonstrate quantitatively how aging misalignments in side-channel traces, between the profiling and the target devices, do hinder the attack. The main objective of this study is to get accurate and numerous results allowing the designer to compare different implementations of masking and accordingly choose one which corresponds to the best compromise among complexity, security, and sensitivity to temperature and aging. We target the S-Box module of the unprotected PRESENT cipher along with its five masking variants including global lookup table (GLUT), rotating S-Box masking (referred to as RSM-LOG hereafter), RSM with read-only memory (RSM-ROM), Ishai-Sahai&#8211;Wagner masking (ISW), and threshold implementation (TI). The unprotected circuit gets impacted by such aging misalignments with  $\approx 12.5$ % increase in the number of traces needed to reach 80% success rate (SR) in the course of 20 weeks of aging at 105 &#176;C. Such increase is 23.3%, 37.19%, and 38.24% for ISW, GLUT, and RSM-LOG, respectively. For RSM-ROM such increase is 193.37% for ten weeks of aging. Interestingly, TI is not much affected by aging in this regard.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Power 0.68-Gbps Data Communication System for Capacitive Digital Isolator With 1.9-ns Propagation Delay</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10374088</link><description>In this brief, we present a data communication system for the capacitive digital isolator capable of sustaining a breakdown voltage of 1.27 kVrms. A pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) strategy is implemented as a signal transmission scheme for capacitive coupling for the first time. It enables a data rate of 0.68 Gbps using a smaller number of ON-chip isolation elements and physical links compared with other circuits. In addition, this scheme allows our design to work at low-frequency operations without the need of additional large-area capacitors. Moreover, a propagation delay of 1.9 ns has been measured with a total jitter (TJ) of 333 ps, and a 46.8-pJ/bit energy consumption at 1 Mbps is obtained. The achieved performance ensures the design integration capability with a wide range of power control applications, particularly industrial sensor interfaces.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Digital-Controlled Current-Mode Single-Inductor-Multiple-Output Buck Converter With Individual Output Overload Protection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10374387</link><description>This brief presents an innovative digital current-mode control technique for single-inductor multiple-output (SIMO) buck converters in continuous-conduction mode. Additionally, it first introduces an overcurrent protection (OCP) method for each output channel of the SIMO converter. As a supplement, since previous research could not or could only protect the input, the OCP proposed in this brief makes SIMO more valuable for industrial applications. The proposed approach effectively reduces cross-regulation by distributing currents shared by the inductor among all branches in a reasonable manner. Moreover, the OCP control can detect overloads in any branch and limit the peak current without affecting other branches. Simulation results demonstrate that the cross-regulation between each channel for overcurrent protection is less than 100 mV, even during an overload.</description></item><item><title>A Wideband Input Buffer Based on Cascade Complementary Source Follower</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10399378</link><description>A highly linear input buffer is crucial for high-speed and high-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) since it isolates the kickback noise and package inductance. Several important factors affecting the linearity of the input buffer are analyzed in this brief, and a wideband input buffer with high linearity based on cascade complementary source follower (CCSF) is proposed. This cascaded input buffer is composed of a pMOS source follower (PSF) and an nMOS source follower (NSF). Compensation capacitor, assisted operational amplifier (opamp), bootstrapped-capacitor level-shifting circuit, current amplifier, and optimization strategies are utilized to extend the bandwidth and reduce distortion. Designed in a 65-nm CMOS, the CCSF input buffer achieves the spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) and a signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) of 76.6 and 58.1 dB with 1.9-GHz input frequency, respectively.

This brief demonstrates a DPWM that utilizes a single clock and a Matrix shift array, allowing it to be scaled to any frequency and reducing the effects of clock skew. It has a clock gating technique that selects a specific row of DFFs based on the required % duty cycle. The DPWM design has a dead time generator to prevent shoot-throughs. The DPWM has been fabricated using UMC 180-nm CMOS process. The performance and functionality of the DPWM have been verified through the measured comparisons of % duty ratio, dead time ( $T_{dt}$ ), and output frequency ( $f_{\text {out}}$ ) at input clock frequency ( $f_{\text {clk}_{\text {in}}}$ ) equal to 10 $\sim $ 100 MHz. The DPWM design has a maximum % duty ratio of 90.6%,  $T_{dt}$  = 1.8 ns, and  $f_{\text {out}}$  = 6.25 MHz with 3.4-mW power consumption at  $f_{\text {clk}_{\text {in}}}$  = 100 MHz.</description></item><item><title>A 28 nm CMOS Dual-Band Concurrent WLAN and Narrow Band Transmitter With On-Chip Feedforward TX-to-TX Interference Cancellation Path for Low Antenna-to-Antenna Isolation in IoT Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10412084</link><description>A dual-band, concurrent 2.4G wireless local-area network (WLAN) and 2.4G narrow band (NB) transmitter (TX) with on-chip feedforward TX-to-TX interference cancellation path for low antenna-to-antenna isolation in internet of things (IoT) devices is proposed. The on-chip cancellation path generates a replica signal of the same magnitude but 180&#176; out-of-phase with respect to the &#8220;aggressor&#8221; TX signal appearing at the &#8220;victim&#8221; TX output. An on-chip third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD3) calibration engine carries out the cancellation calibration across all channel combinations in NB and WLAN using an over-the-air antenna-to-antenna channel, and the measured IMD3 product is reduced by 25 dB. Additionally, the maximum output power during concurrent transmission, while meeting the FCC out-of-band emission specification, improves from 10 to 17 dBm across all WLAN channels in a certified FCC out-of-band emission test. With this proposed architecture, the issue of TX-to-TX interference in multiradio coexistence is finally addressed, opening the door to future high-power concurrent multiband TXs in reconfigurable IoT devices.</description></item><item><title>A Broadband Four-Way Parallel&#8211;Series Doherty Power Amplifier for 5G Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10335684</link><description>This article presents a four-way hybrid parallel&#8211;series Doherty power amplifier (PA) architecture that supports broadband operation and deep power back-off (PBO) efficiency enhancement for next-generation wireless communication. Most existing load modulation PAs are limited in bandwidth due to the large impedance transformation ratios (ITRs) needed for load-pull matching at deep PBO. The proposed technique achieves wide carrier bandwidth by exploiting different frequency-dependent active load modulations of the parallel/series Doherty combiners and PA path biasing reconfiguration, while the deep PBO efficiency enhancement is realized by the optimum turn-on sequences of the four PA paths. The behavior of the implemented PA load modulation network is mathematically described at different PBO levels corresponding to the output power levels at which each efficiency enhancement occurs. As a proof-of-concept design, a 26&#8211;40-GHz PA is implemented in the GlobalFoundries 45-nm CMOS SOI process. The PA measures 22.5&#8211;23.9-dBm OP textsubscript 1dB, 26.2%&#8211;38.2% PAE textsubscript OP1dB, 18.1%&#8211;34.5% PAE textsubscript 6dB PBO, and 10.7%&#8211;22.1% PAE textsubscript 12dB PBO. Note that the PBO levels are referenced from OP textsubscript 1dB. Compared to a normalized ideal class-B PA, this design achieves 1.3&#8211;1.8 $\times $  power-added efficiency (PAE) boost at 6-dB PBO and 1.6&#8211;2.3 $\times $  boost at 12-dB PBO. With a 100-MHz fifth-generation (5G) new radio (NR) frequency range 2 (FR2) 1-CC 64-QAM signal, this PA achieves 9.26&#8211;16.9-dBm average output power and 9.9%&#8211;25.5% average PAE at an rms error vector magnitude (EVM) of -25 dB for 26&#8211;40 GHz. With a 1-CC 400-MHz 16-QAM signal, the PA achieves 12.95&#8211;17.4-dBm average output power and 12.5%&#8211;27% average PAE at an rms EVM of -20 dB for 26&#8211;40 GHz.</description></item><item><title>A Band-Shifting Millimeter-Wave T/R Front-End Using Inductance-Mutation Transformer Technique for Multiband Phased-Array Transceivers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10415461</link><description>This article introduces a band-shifting transmit/receive (T/R) front-end (FE) using the inductance-mutation technique for multiband phased-array transceivers. The proposed inductance-mutation transformer technique enables variable inductances and features insignificant performance deterioration during the wideband frequency shift, compared to the typical capacitance-based frequency shift method. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique, a band-shifting T/R FE prototype is designed and fabricated in a standard 28 nm bulk CMOS process. The T/R FE circuit contains a differential power amplifier (PA) with a cascade output stage, a two-stage cascade low noise amplifier (LNA), and a dual-resonance T/R switch. Both the PA and LNA employ the proposed inductance-mutation technique in the interstage matching network. The compact dual-resonance T/R switch at the antenna interface is embedded to support the wideband time-division uplink/downlink. It is demonstrated in the measurement results that the 3-dB operation band of the FE can be shifted between a low-frequency (LF) band of 24.1&#8211;38.8 GHz and a high-frequency (HF) band of 35.4&#8211;43.5 GHz for the transmitter (TX) mode, and shifted between 23.9&#8211;35.3 and 29.2&#8211;43.7 GHz for the receiver (RX) mode. Meanwhile, the PA achieves the measured peak gain of 19.1/17.2 dB and the measured OP1dB of 17.8/15.0 dBm for the LF/HF bands, and the LNA in the LF/HF bands has the peak gain of 21.3/18.3 dB and the minimum noise figure of 5.1/5.8 dB. In the system-level modulation measurement, the TX mode realizes &lt; &#8722;25 dB EVM for 400 Msym/s 64-QAM wireless communication with &gt;9 dBm average output power across the frequency of interest. Combining the LF and HF bands, the proposed T/R FE can cover multiple operating bands of 5G NR, such as n257&#8211;n261. Thanks to the band shift feature, an extra 24-dB image rejection for the HF signals converted from a potential intermediate frequency signal of 10 GHz is provided by the T/R FE.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Noise Dual-Path Self-Interference Cancellation Architecture for Watt-Level TX Power Handling in Simultaneous Transmit and Receive</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10426744</link><description>Mitigating self-interference (SI) is vital for advancing simultaneous transmit and receive (STAR) systems. The noise and linearity of the canceller impose limitations on SI power handling. This article proposes a novel dual-path SI cancelling scheme for high-power SI handling. The proposed approach breaks self-interference cancellation (SIC) tradeoffs between operating frequency, SI power handling, and canceller noise/distortion by using a frequency-translated (FT) SI canceller and an auxiliary FT noise-cancelling (NC) path that cancels the noise/distortion from the primary canceller. This approach can work well for both full-duplex (FD) and frequency-division duplex (FDD) schemes. The 65-nm CMOS implementation achieves ~45-dB SIC for 12-dBm receiver (RX) SI peak power (9-dBm avg.) with only 4-dB noise figure (NF) degradation and 207-mW power consumption at 600 MHz. The SIC approach enables a blocker-1 dB with respect to SI of &gt; 16 dBm ( $8\times $  higher than prior work) while operating from 0.5 to 1.3 GHz. Therefore, this implementation can support watt-level SI power handling with transmitter (TX)&#8211;RX isolation &gt; 15 dB. This is demonstrated through measurements that show 30-dBm TX power handling with 22-dB initial isolation from the circulator.</description></item><item><title>Compact mm-Wave Ultra-Wideband and Low-Noise Phase Alternately Distributed Quasi-Circulators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10423725</link><description>This article presents ultra-wideband and low-noise distributed active quasi-circulators (QCs) fabricated using a 28-nm CMOS process. The proposed active QCs use a differential two-stage distributed amplifier (DA) design, where the electrical length of the input and output transmission lines is 90&#176; at 28 GHz. For the ultra-wideband distributed active QC (UWQC), the differential outputs of the amplifier in the second stage are cross-connected to the differential outputs of the amplifier in the first stage, resulting in ultra-wideband isolation regardless of the frequency. In addition, an interstage inductor is inserted in the amplifiers to maintain the frequency response of the input and output transmission lines identically. For the low-noise distributed active QC (LNQC), the resistive termination at the input transmission line of DA is eliminated by using input-matched amplifiers, resulting in a low antenna (ANT) -to-receiver (RX) noise figure (NF). In addition, the LNQC with the input-matched amplifiers allows a 3-dB higher transmitter (TX)-to-ANT gain compared to conventional distributed QC. Moreover, the transistor size and bias condition of the input-matched amplifiers can be selected to achieve low noise and high power handling capability of the QC within a given tradeoff. The measured results demonstrate that the UWQC achieves 20.5&#8722;35.5-GHz wideband operating bandwidth with TX-to-ANT gain of 4.5 dB, ANT-to-RX insertion loss of 3.6 dB, and &gt;21-dB TX-to-RX isolation, only occupying a die area of 0.07 mm2. The LNQC achieves ANT-to-RX NF of 8.9&#8722;11.1 dB, which is around 10 dB lower than the conventional distributed QC. The measured TX-to-ANT output power 1-dB compression point is 14.3 dBm with a dc power consumption of 28.6 mW, occupying a die area of 0.25 mm2.</description></item><item><title>A 10.8&#8211;14.5-GHz Eight-Phase 12.5%-Duty-Cycle Nonoverlapping LO Generator With Automatic Phase-and-Duty-Cycle Calibration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10439148</link><description>A 10.8&#8211;14.5-GHz eight-phase 12.5%-duty-cycle nonoverlapping LO generator is proposed for 60-GHz eight-path-filtering subsampling receivers.

The generator prototype measures minimum phase errors of ~0.1&#176; and maximum fourth-harmonic output power of &#8722;5 dBm with &gt;30-dB improvement while consuming 77.8 mW from a 1-V supply over the entire frequency tuning range from 10.8 to 14.5 GHz.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Loss Passive D-Band Phase Shifter for Calibration-Free, Precise Phase Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10419196</link><description>A low-loss passive phase shifter is presented for calibration-free, precise phase control at  $D$ -band. The proposed topology manipulates time delay by controlling propagation distance in a trombone-like structure formed with two parallel transmission lines periodically connected via switch networks. The proposed phase control exploits only one switched signal transition for all phase states, significantly lowering insertion loss and keeping loss variation small over phase states. A detailed analysis of the design tradeoff between insertion loss and phase resolution is also presented. A prototype 5-bit digital phase shifter that operates with 11.25&#176; steps over 360&#176; tuning range at 140 GHz was implemented using a 45-nm RF silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology and occupies only 0.04  $\text {mm}^{2}$ . On-wafer measurements report an rms phase error of 1.2&#176; without calibration, which is the lowest among published phase shifters in similar frequency bands. The prototype IC achieved the measured insertion loss of 11.5 &#177; 0.8 dB and IP1dB of &gt;12.9 dBm with no dc power consumption.</description></item><item><title>A 400-GHz Efficient Radiator and OOK Transceiver for Multi-Gb/s Wireless Communication in Silicon</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10414477</link><description>This article introduces an efficient high-power radiator at 400 GHz and a fully integrated transceiver supporting OOK modulation for high-speed wireless communication using 90-nm SiGe BiCMOS. The reverse recovery of silicon p-i-n diodes is used to design a frequency quadrupler that generates high power efficiently at 400 GHz. By mutually interlocking and combining the power from two such quadruplers, we design a 400-GHz radiator. The proposed design achieves a peak effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of +20.6- and &#8722;5.8-dBm radiated power at 398 GHz with 0.2% dc-to-THz radiation efficiency. This is the highest reported efficiency, and THz power radiated per element above 320 GHz. Using the p-i-n diode quadruplers as the LO, we design a 400-GHz OOK transmitter and receiver with on-chip antennas. The transmitter uses a multiplier-last approach and has an EIRP of +17 dBm while consuming 84-mW dc power. The receiver uses fundamental-driven passive mixer architecture to achieve a noise figure (NF) of 25 dB while consuming 184 mW of dc power. This is the lowest reported NF above 320 GHz. Over-the-air (OTA) measurements are performed for a 5-cm link with OOK modulation. The stand-alone transmitter supports a data rate of 10 Gb/s (8 pJ/bit), and the transmit&#8211;receive system supports a data rate of 5 Gb/s (36.8 pJ/bit for the receiver). This is the first demonstration of a fully integrated multi-Gb/s wireless transceiver above 320 GHz in silicon.</description></item><item><title>Design of a Noncoherent 100-Gb/s 3-m Dual-Band PAM-4 Dielectric Waveguide Link in 28-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10418931</link><description>This work details the design of a plastic fiber link in 28-nm CMOS, operating in two adjacent bands centered on 117.5 and 152.5 GHz. Each band supports multilevel (PAM-4) intensity-modulated signaling, which can be detected noncoherently, obviating the need for carrier recovery and phase alignment. A rectification-based detector is proposed to support linear noncoherent demodulation. A manifold diplexer is designed on-chip to increase the level of integration. The dual-band link achieves data rates up to 100 Gb/s over a fiber length of 3 m at a power consumption of 574 mW and a bit error rate (BER) better than 2.2e-4, corresponding to the standardized KP4 forward error correction (FEC) threshold. With only the low-band (LB) circuitry active, the link reaches up to 50 Gb/s over a distance of 7 m at a degraded BER of 2.2e-3 and up to 10 Gb/s over 11 m at a BER of 1e-6, representing the highest reported data rates for these link lengths. An energy efficiency reaching as low as 0.8 pJ/bit/m is reported for the 7-m case.</description></item><item><title>A Monolithic O-Band Coherent Optical Receiver for Energy-Efficient Links</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10356093</link><description>A 1310-nm (O-band) coherent optical Link is demonstrated for short-range optical interconnects that operate to 56-GBd symbol rate (SR) (112 Gbps) with FEC-acceptable BER.

The transmitter operates at 5.9-pJ/bit energy efficiency (EE) while the receiver achieves 0.73 pJ/bit and, to our knowledge, is the best EE reported for a coherent optical receiver.</description></item><item><title>A Four-Channel BiCMOS Transmitter for a Quantum Magnetometer Based on Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10409187</link><description>Quantum sensors based on solid-state defects, such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, offer very good room-temperature sensitivity, long-term stability, and the potential for calibration-free measurements. However, most quantum sensors still suffer from a bulky size and weight, low energy efficiency, and high costs, prohibiting their widespread use. Here, we present custom-designed chip-integrated microwave (MW) electronics for a miniaturized, low-cost, and highly scalable quantum magnetometer based on NV centers in diamond. The presented electronics include a quadrature phase-locked loop (QPLL) chip to generate the required local oscillator signal at around 7 GHz with a wide tuning range of 22% and a low phase noise (PN) of &#8722;122 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset from a 7-GHz carrier for broadband low-noise magnetometry. In addition, the magnetometer electronics comprise a 4-channel transmitter chip, which can provide currents up to 412 mApp into a custom-designed inductor over a wide frequency range from 6.4 to 8 GHz. In combination with a custom-designed coil, manufactured on a glass substrate for optical transparency, which features a large active area of ( $\pi { \times } 180 { \times }180~\mu \text {m}^{2}$ ), this current is sufficient to produce strong MW magnetic fields up to  $B_{{1}} = (1/2) \cdot B_{\text {ac}} = 170~{\mu \mathrm {T}}$ , enabling pulsed optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) experiments. In proof-of-concept ODMR experiments, the presented chip-based spin control system produces fast Rabi oscillations of 5.49 MHz. The measured dc and ac magnetic field limits of detection (LOD) of the presented magnetometer are 32 nT/Hz $^{\text {1/2}}$  and 300 pT/Hz $^{\text {1/2}}$ , respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Cryo-CMOS DAC-Based 40-Gb/s PAM4 Wireline Transmitter for Quantum Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10441816</link><description>Addressing the advancement toward large-scale quantum computers, this article presents the first four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM4) wireline transmitter (TX) operating at cryogenic temperatures (CTs). With quantum computers scaling up toward thousands of quantum bits (qubits), but having too limited fidelity for robust operation, continuous rounds of quantum error correction (QEC) are necessary. However, QEC requires a large amount of data to be transferred from a cryogenic controller at 4K to a classical processor at room temperature (RT). To bridge the gap, a high-speed data link between the quantum processor at CT and the classical counterpart at RT is needed. The proposed PAM4 TX architecture integrates a low-power 64:4 serializer structure, a high-speed 4:1 current-mode logic (CML) multiplexer, and a linear 6-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC). Considering the challenges and benefits of CMOS operating at CTs, the TX architecture and circuitry are designed to exploit the maximum speed, while maintaining sufficient linearity. The fabricated 40-nm CMOS chip achieves a data rate of 40-Gb/s (36-Gb/s), an energy efficiency of 2.46 pJ/b (2.47 pJ/b), and 97.8% (96.6%) ratio of level mismatch (RLM) at CT (RT). While demonstrating an energy efficiency comparable to prior-art TXs in more advanced CMOS nodes at RT, the broad operating temperature of the proposed TX enables the required high-speed wireline link for large-scale quantum computers.</description></item><item><title>A Fast Back-to-Lock DPLL-Based 192&#8211;210-GHz Chirp Generator With +5.9-dBm Peak Output Power for Sub-THz Imaging and Sensing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10264917</link><description>A fully integrated high-efficiency phase-locked sub-terahertz (THz) radiator is reported in this article, implemented in a 55-nm SiGe BiCMOS process.

We propose the simultaneous energy transferring SIBO (SETSIBO) converter, which generates bipolar outputs with only a two-phase operation and does not require additional switching. The hybrid power stage with a flying capacitor and two-phase operation reduces the dc value of the inductor current, which mitigates conduction losses and output ripples; moreover, the hybrid power stage allows the high-voltage switches in the conventional converters to be replaced by low-voltage switches. The inductor current reduction and the low-voltage power switch use improve the PCE. This article analyzes the proposed converter&#8217;s output ripple reduction and the PCE improvements; furthermore, the load imbalance is effectively compensated with the proposed SETSIBO converter.

The iSCS system adopts a fast inductor-based charger with level-adaptive duty modulation and charging range detection that can efficiently charge capacitors from any residual voltage levels to the target voltages up to 3 V. The offset-control charge balancing (OC-CB) adaptively reduces the mismatch between cathodic and anodic charges. The iSCS prototype can charge 1- $\mu \text{F}$  capacitor from 0 V (1.5 V) to 3 V within 50  $\mu \text{s}$  (28  $\mu \text{s}$ ), achieving 90% (92.7%) capacitor charging efficiency. The iSCS system efficiency was measured up to 92%, which is &gt;10% higher than state-of-the-art works. The iSCS also achieved higher stimulus efficacy thanks to its decaying exponential waveform. In vivo experiments for ocular muscle stimulation using the iSCS system resulted in a 20% increase in eye movement distance while consuming 13% less energy compared to the current-controlled stimulation system. This ensures higher system efficiency and enhanced stimulus efficacy.</description></item><item><title>A High-Efficiency Wide Output Range Reconfigurable Capacitive-Sigma DC&#8211;DC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10278205</link><description>A 5-to-0.4 $\sim $ 1.2-V reconfigurable capacitive-sigma dc&#8211; dc converter with 98.4% peak efficiency is presented.

This work achieves the following features. First, much higher efficiency, by using capacitive power links instead of low-quality micro-transformers and switching at a relatively lower frequency near resonance. Measurement shows a 68% peak efficiency, which is 15% higher than state-of-the-art miniature designs and is higher over almost the entire loading range. Second, RX local voltage and TX global power regulations are achieved with through-power-link feedback, neither using an extra pair of capacitors nor transformers. Third, the voltage-mode hysteretic control achieves a much faster transient response compared with previous works, with a simpler system complexity and neither small-signal bandwidth limitation nor stability concerns. Fourth, a two-layer &#8220;analog-keying&#8221; and &#8220;error-recovery&#8221; common-mode transient (CMT) immune strategy is introduced, achieving a &#177;8-kV CMT immunity (CMTI) measured in closed-loop operation.

In prior current-mode converter designs, there exists undesired output DC error caused by control loop delays and mismatches between the RC current sensing network and the DC resistance (DCR) of the power inductor. Circuit delay is also an obstacle in achieving higher switching frequency and multi-phase operation. To address these issues, ratioed sensing RC network and digital output DC calibration are proposed. To reduce the efficiency degradation caused by imbalanced phase current, digital current balancing (CB) calibration is also developed. To maintain a high efficiency with a wide output load range, digital active-phase-count (APC) function was also introduced, with burst mode (BM) to improve transient responses at fast load current steps. The proposed converter has been fabricated in 180-nm CMOS process and measured at 10 and 25 MHz with 18-to-100-nH miniature 0402 inductors, converting 1.8-V supply ( $\text{V}_{\mathrm{ IN}}$ ) to 0.6&#8211;1.5-V output with 93.9% peak efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Battery-Input Three-Mode Buck&#8211;Boost Hybrid DC&#8211;DC Converter With 97.6% Peak Efficiency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10281380</link><description>This article presents a three-mode non-inverting buck&#8211;boost hybrid converter (3M-BBHC) suitable for mobile devices powered by lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. The proposed 3M-BBHC can work in buck, boost, or buck&#8211;boost mode, and it can switch the operation mode smoothly with a small ripple as the input voltage changes. Compared with the conventional non-inverting buck&#8211;boost converter (CBBC), the proposed 3M-BBHC still has only four power switches with a flying capacitor ( $C_{F}$ ) added. The number of switches conducting current in series with the inductor is reduced from 2 (in CBBC) to 1 (in 3M-BBHC) to decrease the conduction and switching losses. The inductor connects to the input terminal, which means the 3M-BBHC has a continuous input current and thus low electromagnetic interference (EMI). Besides, in buck mode, the inductor current is always smaller than the output current, which decreases the inductor dc resistance (DCR) conduction loss. The 3M-BBHC was fabricated in a standard 0.18- $\mu \text{m}$  CMOS process, using only 3.3-V devices to further reduce the losses. A 97.6% peak efficiency is measured by using a 2.2- $\mu \text{H}$  inductor with 110- $\text{m}\Omega $  DCR, a 10- $\mu \text{F} C_{F}$ , a 10- $\mu \text{F}$  output capacitor ( $C_{O}$ ), and a 2-MHz switching frequency. Its input voltage ranges from 2.7 to 4.2 V, and it can deliver an output current of 100&#8211;800 mA at 3.3-V regulated output voltage.</description></item><item><title>Parallel Versus Serial: Design of an Optical Receiver With Integrated Blue Photodetectors and Digitally Tunable Low-End Cutoff Frequency for MicroLED-Based Parallel Interchip Communication</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286829</link><description>This article first analytically compares the energy efficiency of a serial optical link with a parallel link with the same data throughput and bit error rate for interchip communication. The analysis predicts that more than  $10\times $  energy efficiency improvement is feasible at both TX and RX in a parallel optical link compared to the fastest serial link, depending on the technology. Next, the article presents the design of an optical receiver integrated with on-chip blue photodetectors for the parallel interchip communication. The blue light allows using high-speed microLEDs and enables CMOS compatible photodetector structures that have extremely low capacitance per unit area. This along with a transimpedance-to-noise optimization approach results in a highly energy efficient and compact analog front-end for the receiver, paving the way for dense and energy efficient parallel links. Besides, a digital offset cancellation technique is proposed for offset compensation that can provide a low-end cutoff frequency down to a few hertz with a compact area. As a proof of concept, a 32 elements optical receiver array is fabricated in a low-cost 130 nm CMOS SOI process, with each element occupying only 50  $\times $  50  $\mu \text{m}$  in area. Free space optical measurement results of a single receiver array element show a sensitivity of &#8722;19.3 dBm with a bit error rate of 10&#8722;12 at a data rate of 2 Gbps and an energy efficiency of about 0.5 pJ/bit.</description></item><item><title>Design of Direct 48-V/1-V Three-Path Four-State Switching Power Converter With Adaptive VCF Rebalancing and Dual-Edge tdead Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10254540</link><description>This article presents a new power converter capable of direct 48-V/1-V dc&#8211;dc conversion with high efficiency. The proposed three-path four-state (3P4S) hybrid switching power stage enables high switching frequency ( $f_{\mathrm {SW}}$ ) operation and minimizes power passives by significantly reducing power switch voltage stress. To address the issues of power delivery path imbalances and potential device breakdown, an adaptive flying capacitor voltage ( $V_{\mathrm {CF}}$ ) rebalancing technique is introduced that improves design robustness and eliminates the need for direct floating  $V_{\mathrm {CF}}$  sensing. Additionally, a dual-edge deadtime ( $t_{\mathrm {dead}}$ ) modulation with elastic  $t_{\mathrm {dead}}$  control at switching nodes optimizes converter efficiency across different input voltage and load conditions. An IC prototype of the design was fabricated and tested with input voltage  $V_{\mathrm {IN}}$  ranging from 12 to 48 V, delivering up to 4 W of power at 1-V  $V_{\mathrm {O}}$ . It achieves peak efficiency of 90.7% and 85.6% for 12-V/1-V and 48-V/1-V power conversion, respectively, at an effective switching frequency of 4.5 MHz, which is based on a three-phase operation with each phase at 1.5 MHz. The adaptive  $V_{\mathrm {CF}}$  rebalancing technique reduces  $V_{\mathrm {CF}}$  imbalance error by up to 65.1%. Overall, the proposed 3P4S hybrid switching power converter offers an efficient and robust solution for direct dc&#8211;dc conversion with a wide  $V_{\mathrm {IN}}$  range.</description></item><item><title>A 44.2-TOPS/W CNN Processor With Variation-Tolerant Analog Datapath and Variation Compensating Circuit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10299653</link><description>Convolutional neural network (CNN) processors that exploit analog computing for high energy efficiency suffer from two major issues. First, frequent data conversions between the layers limit energy efficiency. Second, computing errors occur from analog circuits since they are vulnerable to process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. In this article, a CNN processor featuring a variation-tolerant analog datapath with analog memory (AMEM) is proposed so that data conversion is not needed. To minimize the computing error, both AMEM and ANU are designed in such a way that their performance is not affected by PVT variations. In addition, a variation compensating circuit is also proposed. Prototype implemented in 28-nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) achieves energy-efficiency of 437.9 TOPS/W in the analog datapath, 44.2 TOPS/W in the total system and maintains its classification accuracy to within 0.5%p across variations of  ${\pm }10\%$  in supply voltage and &#8722;20 &#176;C to 85 &#176;C in temperature.</description></item><item><title>An Energy-Efficient Computing-in-Memory NN Processor With Set-Associate Blockwise Sparsity and Ping-Pong Weight Update</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10299656</link><description>Computing-in-memory (CIM) chips have demonstrated the potential high energy efficiency for low-power neural network (NN) processors. Even with energy-efficient CIM macros, the existing system-level CIM chips still lack deep exploration on sparsity and large models, which prevents a higher system energy efficiency. This work presents a CIM NN processor with more sufficient support of sparsity and higher utilization rate. Three key innovations are proposed. First, a set-associate blockwise sparsity strategy is designed, which simultaneously saves execution time, power, and storage space. Second, a ping-pong weight update mechanism is proposed for a higher utilization rate, enabling simultaneous execution of CIM and write operations. Third, an efficient CIM macro is implemented with adaptive analog-digital converter (ADC) precision for better sparsity utilization and performance-accuracy trade-off. The 65-nm fabricated chip shows 9.5-TOPS/W system energy efficiency at 4-bit precision, with 6.25 $\times $  actual improvement compared with a state-of-the-art CIM chip. Besides, this work supports high CIM execution accuracy on the ImageNet dataset.</description></item><item><title>Guest Editorial: Special Issue on Learning, Optimization, and Implementation for Circuits and Systems Driven by Artificial Intelligence</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10510358</link><description>Circuits and systems, such as multidimensional and nonlinear ones, large-scale integration circuits, and power networks, play a significant role in the whole spectrum of science and technology, from basic scientific theories to various real-world applications.

Traditionally, network robustness is determined by attack simulations, which is very time-consuming and even incapable for large-scale networks. Network Robustness Learning, which is dedicated to learning network robustness with high precision and high speed, provides a powerful tool to analyze network robustness by replacing simulations. In this paper, a novel versatile and unified robustness learning approach based on the customized graph transformer (NRL-GT) is proposed, which consists of a particularly designed backbone and three branches to accomplish the tasks of robustness curve learning, overall robustness learning and synthetic network classification simultaneously. Numerous experiments show that: 1) NRL-GT is a unified learning framework for controllability robustness and connectivity robustness, demonstrating a strong generalization ability to ensure high precision when training and test sets are distributed differently; 2) It is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated the proposed graph transformer layer is capable of outperforming classical graph neural networks. Compared to the cutting-edge methods in network robustness learning, NRL-GT can simultaneously perform network robustness learning from multiple aspects and obtains superior results in less time on both synthetic and real-world networks, especially circuit networks and power networks; 3) It is worth mentioning that with the transferability of the proposed backbone, NRL-GT is able to deal with complex networks of different sizes for different tasks efficiently and effectively.</description></item><item><title>Knowledge Transfer Framework for PVT Robustness in Analog Integrated Circuits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10362966</link><description>Process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations in chip fabrication or operation pose a significant challenge to the robustness of analog integrated circuits. Existing design techniques for mitigating PVT variations involve analyzing offsets of DC operating points, but this approach often leads to compromises in circuit performance. To address this challenge, we developed a &#8216;PVT-Transfer&#8217; framework to facilitate knowledge transfer with evolutionary design. Specifically, by cross-operating the circuit parameters under variations, design knowledge is transferred through parameter migration, thus enhancing the robustness of the resultant circuit. In addition, we leverage data-driven learning to discover potential similarities among PVT variations, thereby mitigating negative knowledge transfer. The PVT-Transfer Framework is evaluated on three integrated voltage references and compared with four state-of-the-art circuit sizing methods. Based on post-layout Monte-Carlo simulations, this framework is verified to offer superior performance to existing methods, yielding a 60% reduction in power consumption, an 80% increase in temperature resilience, and up to  $70\times $  enhancement in the figure of merit. Further, it leads to a 60% reduction in the number of required circuit simulations and is suitable for parallel computation.</description></item><item><title>Optimized and Automated Secure IC Design Flow: A Defense-in-Depth Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443689</link><description>The globalization of the manufacturing process and the supply chain for electronic hardware has been driven by the need to maximize profitability while lowering risk in a technologically advanced silicon sector. However, many hardware IPs&#8217; security features have been broken because of the rise in successful hardware attacks. Existing security efforts frequently ignore numerous dangers in favor of fixing a particular vulnerability. This inspired the development of a unique method that uses emerging spin-based devices to obfuscate circuitry to secure hardware intellectual property (IP) during fabrication and the supply chain. We propose an Optimized and Automated Secure IC (OASIC) Design Flow, a defense-in-depth approach that can minimize overhead while maximizing security. Our EDA tool flow uses a dynamic obfuscation method that employs dynamic lockboxes, which include switch boxes and magnetic random access memory (MRAM)-based look-up tables (LUT) while offering minimal overhead and being flexible and resilient against modern SAT-based attacks and power side-channel attacks. An EDA tool flow for optimized lockbox insertion is also developed to generate SAT-resilient design netlists with the least power and area overhead. PPA metrics and security (SAT attack time) are provided to the designer for each lockbox insertion run. A verification methodology is provided to verify locked and unlocked designs for functional correctness. Finally, we use ISCAS&#8217;85 benchmarks to show that the EDA tool flow provides a secure hardware netlist with maximum security while considering power and area constraints. Our results indicate that the proposed OASIC design flow can maximize security while incurring less than 15% area overhead and maintaining a similar power footprint compared to the original design. OASIC design flow demonstrates improved performance as design size increases, which demonstrates the scalability of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Skew-CIM: Process-Variation-Resilient and Energy-Efficient Computation-in-Memory Design Technique With Skewed Weights</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10473213</link><description>In analog-mixed-signal (AMS) compute-in-memory (CIM) systems, the two&#8217;s-complement (2SC) format provides better area efficiency than the sign-and-magnitude (SNM) one. However, the 2SC format exacerbates the challenges of AMS-CIM systems, suffering from significant DNN accuracy drop under process variations and high computation currents from activating multiple WLs. In the 2SC format, &#8216;0&#8217; and &#8216;1&#8217; are nearly balanced for all logical-order bits, unlike &#8216;0&#8217;-skewed higher-order bits in the SNM format. Consequently, the 2SC-based AMS-CIM systems have much more on-cells than the SNM-based counterpart, deteriorating the above challenges. We propose Skew-CIM, a software-hardware co-design technique to relax these challenges. Our proposed weight skewing (WESK) breaks the &#8216;0&#8217; and &#8216;1&#8217; balance at the software level. The potential accuracy drops resulting from WESK are successfully compensated by retraining DNNs. The offsets caused by WESK can be easily corrected using online hardware-level processing. Our Skew-CIM technique can be applied to most AMS-CIM systems with memories showing large on-off cell current ratios. As an example, we use it in a custom-designed 8T-SRAM-based CIM device, demonstrating a significant reduction in the DNN classification error by 7.6 times compared to the 2SC-based AMS-CIM without our Skew-CIM technique. Furthermore, our Skew-CIM markedly enhances energy efficiency by up to 39.9%, outperforming conventional SNM-based AMS-CIM systems.</description></item><item><title>BFP-CIM: Runtime Energy-Accuracy Scalable Computing-in-Memory-Based DNN Accelerator Using Dynamic Block-Floating-Point Arithmetic</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10348028</link><description>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are known for their exceptional performance in various applications; however, their energy consumption during inference can be substantial. Analog Computing-In-Memory (CIM) has shown promise in enhancing the energy efficiency of CNNs, but the use of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) remains a challenge. In analog CIM-based accelerators, ADCs convert analog partial sums from CIM crossbar arrays to digital values, with high-precision ADCs accounting for over 60% of the system&#8217;s energy consumption. To prevent ADCs from damaging the energy efficiency benefits of CIM, researchers have explored quantizing CNNs to use low-precision ADCs, trading off accuracy for energy efficiency. However, these approaches often necessitate data-dependent adjustments to minimize accuracy loss. Instead, we observe that the first most significant toggled bit indicates the optimal quantization range for each input value. Accordingly, we propose a range-aware rounding (RAR) method for runtime bit-width adjustment, eliminating the need for pre-deployment efforts. RAR can be easily integrated into a CIM accelerator using dynamic block-floating-point arithmetic. We also seamlessly incorporate a bit-level zero-skipping mechanism by dynamically forming input blocks. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods maintain accuracy while achieving up to  $1.81 \boldsymbol {\times }$  and  $2.08 \boldsymbol {\times }$  energy efficiency improvements on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, respectively, compared with state-of-the-art techniques.</description></item><item><title>An Energy-Efficient, Unified CNN Accelerator for Real-Time Multi-Object Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Vehicle</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10391059</link><description>An energy-efficient, unified convolutional neural network (CNN) accelerator is proposed with a lightweight RGB-D network to achieve real-time, multi-object semantic segmentation in autonomous electric vehicle system.

State-of-the-art methods leverage approximate multipliers to execute NNs reducing the inference energy without heavily affecting the accuracy. However, previous works usually require a specialized hardware accelerator and are limited to fixed multipliers or reconfigurable ones with few approximation levels. This paper introduces MARLIN, a framework to deploy layerwise approximate NNs on PULP, a microcontroller with a RISC-V core. A multiplier architecture, with runtime selection of 256 approximation levels, is developed and integrated into the PULP cluster cores, enabling runtime configuration through control status register (CSR) instructions embedded within the code. The PULP toolchain is adapted to incorporate the approximation level selection within the instruction flow seamlessly. MARLIN leverages the genetic algorithm NSGA-II to search for the best configurations among thousands of approximate NNs. The framework is validated by simulating an approximate NN trained with the MNIST dataset on PULP. Moreover, MARLIN is used to optimize and approximate six ResNet models trained with the CIFAR-10 dataset. In particular, for ResNet-56, the most complex NN used in the experiments, the multiplication energy is reduced by 23.9% while retaining 99% of the accuracy of the exact model.</description></item><item><title>A Lightweight DRDPG-Based RL DVFS for Video Rendering on CPU-GPU Integrated SoC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10403858</link><description>Reinforcement learning (RL) based dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is an effective approach to balance performance and power consumption for video rendering applications. To approximate the &#8220;God&#8217;s eye view&#8221; regulation, the CPU-GPU should be fine-grained regulated and the SoC have to be fully observed by a RL-based DVFS governor. Fine-grained regulation with traditional value-based RL governor suffers action space explosion and it is impossible to have a fully observable SoC. To address these two issues, a governor based on deep recurrent deterministic gradient (DRDPG) governor is proposed. The governor is based on Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm with embedded recurrent neural network (RNN). The DDPG algorithm guarantees fine-grained power regulation without action space explosion and the RNN-FC network topology mitigates the partial observability issue. Evaluated on the Nvidia Jetson NX platform, the proposed DRDPG governor achieves over 19% better regulation efficiency compared with Linux default governors and shows superior regulation efficiency to other RL-based state-of-the-arts. Implemented in a 55-nm CMOS process, the proposed governor draws merely 2.16-mA from a 1.2-V supply at 1-MHz clock occupying a silicon area of 0.075mm2.</description></item><item><title>Joint Resource Allocation for RIS-Assisted Heterogeneous Networks With Centralized and Distributed Frameworks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10301152</link><description>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a radical and cost-efficient technology to improve energy efficiency and mitigate interference in the heterogeneous network. In this paper, the resource allocation problem of sub-channels, transmit power and RIS coefficients is investigated in the RIS-aided heterogeneous network. To solve the formulated mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, a two-step centralized resource allocation algorithm and a two-step distributed resource allocation algorithm are proposed based on the alternating optimization method. In the centralized algorithm, the sub-channel allocation, transmit power and RIS coefficients are optimized by the macro base station solely, where the non-convex power optimization problem is transformed into a convex one based on the convex approximation method. In the distributed algorithm, which aims to alleviate the computational burden of the macro base station, the sub-channel allocation and transmit power are optimized by using the cooperation of all the small base stations and the macro base station. Finally, numerical results are presented to demonstrate the convergence of the proposed algorithms and the effectiveness of the sub-channel transfer. More importantly, it is shown that the centralized algorithm can achieve the higher total throughput, while the distributed algorithm greatly decreases the resource allocation time.</description></item><item><title>A Proximal ADMM-Based Distributed Optimal Energy Management Approach for Smart Grid With Stochastic Wind Power</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10324387</link><description>In this paper, we address a novel and comprehensive social welfare maximization (SWM) problem for the optimal energy management in a smart grid. The objective is to maximize the total social welfare of dispatchable devices in the smart grid while satisfying certain constraints. Each device in the smart grid is required to meet its local power constraints, and the system as a whole maintains supply-demand balance, taking into account transmission losses and stochastic output power. To facilitate distributed algorithm design, we initially transform the SWM problem into an equivalent dual problem, which is a distributed composite optimization problem. Subsequently, a novel fully distributed proximal alternating direction method of multipliers (PADMM) is proposed, where each agent can autonomously select non-coordinated step size parameters based solely on local information, independent of other agents and the network structure. Detailed convergence analysis is provided, and a worst-case  $\mathcal {O}(1/k)$  convergence rate is established in the non-ergodic sense. Finally, several numerical experiments are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Energy Management for Networked Microgrids via Distributed Neurodynamic</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10410427</link><description>Optimal energy management of a power system enables the economic operation of grids. However, traditional centralized methodologies face limitations when dealing with large-scale power systems. To overcome these challenges, an optimal energy management model is developed for networked microgrids (NMGs), and a distributed neurodynamic optimization algorithm is proposed for the optimization model. Before facilitating power exchange between neighboring microgrids (MGs), a strict priority scheme for power distribution is outlined. Distributed power generation takes precedence in meeting load requirements, followed by charging and discharging operations.

These sub-10cm drones represent the next generation of unobtrusive robotic helpers and ubiquitous smart sensors. However, nano-UAVs face significant power and payload constraints while requiring advanced computing capabilities akin to standard drones, including real-time Machine Learning (ML) performance and the safe co-existence of general-purpose and real-time OSs. Although some advanced parallel ULP MCUs offer the necessary ML computing capabilities within the prescribed power limits, they rely on small main memories (&lt; 1MB) and  $\mu $ controller-class CPUs with no virtualization or security features, and hence only support simple bare-metal runtimes. In this work, we present Shaheen, a 9mm $^{\textbf {2}}~200$ mW SoC implemented in 22nm FDX technology. Differently from state-of-the-art MCUs, Shaheen integrates a Linux-capable RV64 core, compliant with the v1.0 ratified Hypervisor extension and equipped with timing channel protection, along with a low-cost and low-power memory controller exposing up to 512MB of off-chip low-cost low-power HyperRAM directly to the CPU. At the same time, it integrates a fully programmable energy- and area-efficient multi-core cluster of RV32 cores optimized for general-purpose DSP as well as reduced- and mixed-precision ML. To the best of the authors&#8217; knowledge, it is the first silicon prototype of a ULP SoC coupling the RV64 and RV32 cores in a heterogeneous host+accelerator architecture fully based on the RISC-V ISA. We demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed SoC on a wide range of benchmarks relevant to nano-UAV applications including general-purpose DSP as well as inference and online learning of quantized DNNs. The cluster can deliver up to 90GOp/s and up to 1.8TOp/s/W on 2-bit integer kernels and up to 7.9GFLOp/s and up to 150GFLOp/s/W on 16-bit FP kernels.</description></item><item><title>ACE-CNN: Approximate Carry Disregard Multipliers for Energy-Efficient CNN-Based Image Classification</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10457067</link><description>This paper presents the design and development of Signed Carry Disregard Multiplier (SCDM8), a family of signed approximate multipliers tailored for integration into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Extensive experiments were conducted on popular pre-trained CNN models, including VGG16, VGG19, ResNet101, ResNet152, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, and ConvNeXt-T to evaluate the trade-off between accuracy and approximation. The results demonstrate that ACE-CNN outperforms other configurations, offering a favorable balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. In our experiments, when applied to VGG16, SCDM8 achieves an average reduction in power consumption of 35% with a marginal decrease in accuracy of only 1.5%. Similarly, when incorporated into ResNet152, SCDM8 yields an energy saving of 42% while sacrificing only 1.8% in accuracy. ACE-CNN provides the first approximate version of ConvNeXt which yields up to 72% energy improvement at the price of less than only 1.3% Top-1 accuracy. These results highlight the suitability of SCDM8 as an approximation method across various CNN models. Our analysis shows that the ACE-CNN outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy, energy efficiency, and computation precision for image classification tasks in CNNs. Our study investigated the resiliency of CNN models to approximate multipliers, revealing that ResNet101 demonstrated the highest resiliency with an average difference in the accuracy of 0.97%, whereas LeNet5 Inspired-CNN exhibited the lowest resiliency with an average difference of 2.92%. These findings aid in selecting energy-efficient approximate multipliers for CNN-based systems, and contribute to the development of energy-efficient deep learning systems by offering an effective approximation technique for multipliers in CNNs. The proposed SCDM8 family of approximate multipliers opens new avenues for efficient deep learning applications, enabling significant energy savings with virtually no loss in accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Low Complexity Deep Learning Augmented Wireless Channel Estimation for Pilot-Based OFDM on Zynq System on Chip</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10461569</link><description>Channel estimation (CE) is one of the critical signal-processing tasks of the wireless physical layer (PHY). Recent deep learning (DL) based CE have outperformed statistical approaches such as least-square-based CE (LS) and linear minimum mean square error-based CE (LMMSE). However, existing CE approaches have not yet been realized on system-on-chip (SoC). The first contribution of this paper is to efficiently implement the existing state-of-the-art CE algorithms on Zynq SoC (ZSoC), comprising of ARM processor and field programmable gate array (FPGA), via hardware-software co-design and fixed point analysis. We validate the superiority of DL-based CE and LMMSE over LS for various signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and wireless channels in terms of mean square error (MSE) and bit error rate (BER). We also highlight the high complexity, execution time, and power consumption of DL-based CE and LMMSE approaches. To address this, we propose a novel compute-efficient LS-augmented interpolated deep neural network (LSiDNN) based CE algorithm and realize it on ZSoC. The proposed LSiDNN offers 88-90% lower execution time and 38-85% lower resource utilization than state-of-the-art DL-based CE for identical MSE and BER. LSiDNN offers significantly lower MSE and BER than LMMSE, and the gain improves with increased mobility between transceivers. It offers 75% lower execution time and 90-94% lower resource utilization than LMMSE.</description></item><item><title>VLSI Architectures and Hardware Implementation of Ultra Low-Latency and Area-Efficient Pietra-Ricci Index Detector for Spectrum Sensing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10477673</link><description>The Pietra-Ricci index detector (PRIDe) has been recently proposed as one of the simplest techniques for centralized, data-fusion cooperative spectrum sensing, attaining robustness against time-varying signal and noise levels, constant false alarm rate, and high detection power. In this paper, we propose the design and implementation of the PRIDe detector, targeting field programmable gate array (FPGA) and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) solutions. Novel approaches are proposed for computing the PRIDe&#8217;s test statistic, including the absolute value of complex quantities, the complex multiplier-accumulator, and the spectrum occupancy decision. The absolute value operation, which is critical to the PRIDe test statistic computational cost, applies the coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) algorithm as a low latency and resource-efficient option. Register transfer level (RTL) and Monte Carlo simulations show that the resulting ultra-low latency PRIDe detector architectures attain no performance loss with respect to floating-point simulations. One of the two proposed ASIC design versions of the PRIDe sensor occupies 34.9% lower area compared to the most area-efficient sensor reported in literature, whereas the other one is  $5.7\times $  faster than the fastest state-of-the-art sensor. In a nutshell, the proposed detector architecture delivers the highest area and power efficiencies, considering the scaled values of area-time product (ATP) and power-delay product (PDP) metrics, in comparison to implementations reported to date.</description></item><item><title>A 3.0 &#956; Vrms, 2.4 ppm/&#176;C BGR With Feedback Coefficient Enhancement and Bowl-Shaped Curvature Compensation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472895</link><description>This paper demonstrates a low-noise, offset and temperature coefficient (TC) bandgap reference for the portable biopotential signal monitoring system.

The ranging extraction circuit mainly consists of nonlinear histogram, the FIR with adaptively coefficient adjustment algorithm, and receiving photon adaptive conditioning circuit. The nonlinear histogram is proposed to collect the distribution characteristics of the photons received by the Reference SPAD array and Return SPAD array, which can enhance the equivalent trigger probability of the SPAD array for laser echo. The coefficients of the FIR filter are obtained by normalizing the histogram collected by the Reference SPAD array. By adjusting the number of the enabled SPADs of Reference SPAD array, the envelope of the histogram collected by Reference SPAD array will be changed to match different measurement signal-to-background noise ratio (SBR) for Return SPAD array, which can improve the measurement precision of the ISPRS. The laser power meets the safety of the human eye while effectively improving the measurement range based on the proposed ranging extraction circuit and receiving photon adaptive conditioning circuit.

Three key features of the proposed approach are 1) a simple and efficient one-path self-startup circuit, 2) a pulse-counting fractional open-circuit voltage (FOCV)-based maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controller, and 3) a fixed-duty pulse frequency modulation (PFM) controller. The one-path self-startup achieves fast startup by simplifying the switch and control circuit for inductor sharing while incurring negligible loss during the main converter operation. The MPPT controller is based mainly on digital implementation, making it suitable for nanometer-scale CMOS design. This approach allows a significant size reduction of the sampling capacitor (~50 fF). The PFM controller uses a fixed-duty approach, suitable for tracking the source resistance ( $R_{\mathrm {S}}$ ) range of TEGs in wearable applications. To achieve converter operation using a small source voltage ( $V_{\mathrm {S}}$ ), the converter is self-sustained through three modes (self-startup, auxiliary boost, and main boost modes). The converter system is fabricated using a 28-nm CMOS process supporting transistors with four threshold voltages. Measured results show fast self-startup (&lt; 50 ms) at a relatively low input ( $V_{\mathrm {IN}}$  = 200 mV). A conversion efficiency of 88.9% is achieved when delivering an output power of  $582~\mu \text{W}$  using  $V_{\mathrm {S}}$  = 200 mV. The tracking efficiency is higher than 90% for  $V_{\mathrm {S}}$  values ranging from 50 mV to 200 mV. The peak efficiency of 99.2% is achieved using  $V_{\mathrm {S}}$  = 200 mV and  $R_{\mathrm {S}}$  =  $2~\Omega $ , confirming the accurate operation of the MPPT controller. An end-to-end efficiency of 87.6% is achieved using  $V_{\mathrm {S}}$  = 200 mV. All the functions of the IC are realized with only 818 nW.</description></item><item><title>A 521pW, 0.016%/V Line Sensitivity Self-Biased CMOS Voltage Reference With DIBL Effect Compensation Using Adaptive VGS Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10302323</link><description>This brief proposes an ultra-low-power self-biased CMOS voltage reference (SBCVR) with the drain-induced-barrier-lowering (DIBL) effect compensation to improve the line sensitivity (LS) and low-frequency power supply rejection ratio (PSRR). To reduce the dependence of bias current  $(I_{\mathrm{ B}})$  on the supply voltage  $(V_{\mathrm{ DD}})$  owing to the DIBL effect, the gate-source voltage  $(V_{\mathrm{ GS}})$  of biasing transistor is adaptively regulated by  $V_{\mathrm{ DD}}$ . In this way, the DIBL effect compensation is achieved, while the  $I_{\mathrm{ B}}$  is almost immune to  $V_{\mathrm{ DD}}$ . The presented SBCVR is fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu \text{m}$  CMOS process, while 18 samples have been measured. The results show that its average LS reaches 0.016%/V and has been decreased by almost 85% compared to the one without the DIBL effect compensation. The design can also achieve a PSRR of &#8722;62.5dB at 10Hz. Meanwhile, the average reference voltage  $(V_{\mathrm{ REF}})$  is 317.6mV with a variation of 0.52%  $\sigma /\mu $ . The average temperature coefficient (TC) is 86.6 ppm/&#176;C without trimming from 0&#176;C to 100&#176;C, and the minimum power consumption at 27&#176;C is 521pW. The area of the reported SBCVR with the DIBL effect compensation is only 0.0016mm2.</description></item><item><title>A Fast Transient LDO Regulator Featuring High PSRR Over 100-kHz Frequency Range With Adaptive, Dynamic Biasing, and Current Mode Feed-Forward Amplifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304368</link><description>This brief presents a fast transient LDO with high power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) over 100-kHz based on adaptive biasing, dynamic biasing technique and a current mode feed-forward amplifier (CMFFA). The dynamic biasing improves the load transient response and the adaptive biasing benefits the loop stability. The CMFFA introduces a left-half-plane zero to compensate for the non-dominant pole without large current consumption. Moreover, a impedance adaptive circuit is also used in this design: it ensures the DC gain and pushes a non-dominant pole to high frequency. Through these methods, the proposed LDO is stable over full load range, from 0mA to 150mA, it achieves fast transient response and high PSRR with a low quiescent current. The LDO is fabricated in a 0.6-  $\mu $  m CMOS technology. The output voltage can be regulated from 1.8V to 3.3V and the load capacitance is 1  $\mu $  F. For a 150mA load step and a 3.3V output voltage, the maximum undershoot voltage is 38.6mV. At maximum load condition, a 41dB PSRR is achieved at 100-kHz and the loop gain bandwidth product is 1.9MHz. The DC gain is around 70dB over the full load range. The measured load regulation and line regulation are 0.06mV/mA and 1mV/V, respectively. The LDO has a minimum quiescent current of 9.6  $\mu $  A without load. Finally, the proposed LDO achieves a FOM1 of 16.47ps and a FOM2 of 123.52  $\mu $  V.</description></item><item><title>Input-Independent Array Compensation in Memristor-Arrays-Based Neuromorphic Systems for Input Resistance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10306331</link><description>Neuromorphic systems using memristors as artificial synapses have attracted widespread interest for low-power consumption and low-latency computing applications. However, networks based on the paradox of limited sources and progressively larger array sizes are affected by non-ideal effects, such as input resistance problems due to matrix switches. During vector array multiplication, the input resistance leads to great distortion of the out current and significant degradation of the network performance. Here, an input-independent array compensation (IAC) method for the input resistance effect is proposed, which only require a few known parameters (memristor column average conductance, array size, input resistance) independent of the input information to effectively solves current distortion problems. The simulation and experiment results demonstrate that the current distortion problem can be successfully mitigated and the accuracy of the network computing can be effectively restored by using the proposed IAC method. These results provide a feasible approach for the precise implementation of the neuromorphic system based on memristor arrays.</description></item><item><title>A 480 mVpp Linear Input Range, Low Noise Transconductance Cell for Multi-Input Sensor Interface</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10306268</link><description>This brief proposes a high-linear transconductance cell based on parallel source degeneration and differential flipped voltage followers (FVFs) with balance resistors.

Higher order sinc decimation filters are constructed with tap coefficients that have a non-constant change in weight versus time. The magnitude of the chopped offset voltage being processed by the decimation filter does not vary with time. As a result, the chopped offset voltage can yield a time varying residual error that changes in magnitude as a function of the chopping clock phase relative to the start time of the decimation filter and data conversion. Simulation and hardware experiments have been created to help quantify the relationship between the residual offset error magnitude and chopping phase alignment. A 16-bit second order  $\Delta \Sigma $  ADC has been fabricated in a 130 nm technology that utilizes integrator amplifier chopping to reduce the converter offset voltage. The ADC includes a non-interleaved compact third order sinc filter suitable for low cost measurement applications that demonstrates the impact of partial offset cancellation.

An analysis of transistor periphery selection is provided in order to fulfil linearity parameters concurrently targeting other design constraints such as switch isolation and size. It is shown that a trade-off between the contrasting goals of switch power handling (expressed in terms of 1dB compression point) and switch isolation should be addressed. The proposed linear versus nonlinear performance analysis is uncommon in the open literature since high power analysis is seldom treated in multi-bit phase and amplitude control circuits and even more valuable considering the relatively higher targeted operating bandwidth than previously published material.

Its key highlight is the in-sensitivity to the input-referred offset of the error amplifier. This is advantageous compared to the prior work with high  $3\sigma $ -accuracy. In the prior work, the offset of error amplifier affects not only the PTAT current but also the CTAT current. This makes it necessary to greatly reduce the offset of error amplifier, leading to a huge area and power consumption. By contrast, this work proposes a new automatic current-controlled feedback loop, which greatly reduces the influence of the error amplifier offset on the BGR accuracy. As a result, the error amplifier no longer needs to consume large area or power in order to reduce its offset. This effectively reduces the area and power of the entire BGR circuit. For a fair comparison, both the prior work and this work are designed under the same  $0.13~\mu \text{m}$  CMOS process. Post-layout simulation results show that the power of the error amplifier is reduced by about 9 times when compared to the prior work. Furthermore, the total power of the proposed BGR circuit is also reduced by 2.5 times than the prior work.</description></item><item><title>CBRAM-Based Bio-Inspired Circuit for the Emulation and Treatment of the Parkinson&#8217;s Disease</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10342760</link><description>In recent years, the intrinsic neuromorphic properties of memristor devices have led to their extensive use in brain-inspired circuits and systems.

The power stage of the PA consists of one common-source (CS) and two common-gate (CG) stages. The CS and the first CG stages were designed as stacked structure. In order to minimize the influence of parasitic inductance caused by the power transistor, an optimization method of the gate capacitor of the CG stage was proposed.

Due to the positive feedback path attributed to the complexity of the three-stacked power stage layout, typical capacitive neutralization techniques alone are insufficient to achieve high gain and stability at the same time. To solve this problem, we proposed an LC shunt-feedback technique that can alleviate performance degradation caused by parasitic inductance in the gate node of a power transistor. We designed a PA using a 65-nm RFCMOS process to verify the utility of the proposed structure.

The proposed FTA is composed of three functional parts, i.e., an independent amplitude-phase controlling metasurface (MS) on the top, a polarization-converter on the bottom, and a feeding antenna. Particularly, by using spatially designed amplitude on the aperture of the top MS with the specification of the Taylor distribution, much lower side-lobe levels (SLLs) could be effectively realized. The ray-tracing method is used to reduce the profile height and integrate both the feeding antenna and the polarization converter. The proposed FTA, which is fully integrated and fabricated using low-cost printed circuit board (PCB) technology, is verified by the theoretical analysis, full-wave simulation and experimental measurements of a prototype covering the entire 5G mm-wave n257 bands (26.5 to 29.5 GHz). The measured results show that the proposed FTA has a 3 dB gain bandwidth of 19% from 24.8 to 30 GHz and a peak gain of 21.08 dBi with an aperture efficiency of 18.3%. Especially, compared to traditional FTAs with phase modulations only, the proposed FTA performs an average SLLs reduction of more than 5.0 dB. The simulated and measured results coincide to confirm the feature and effectiveness of the FTA with the excellent performance.</description></item><item><title>A Modified Analog Predistorter Using Tunable Power Divider for Wideband 5G Transmitters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10352953</link><description>Advanced communication system such as 5G demands high data rate and wideband signals. These signals have a high peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR), which drives the power amplifier (PA) to early saturation. This brief proposes an analog predistortion method to linearize the power amplifier (PA) for wideband transmission systems like 5G. It utilizes a rat-race-coupler-based intermodulation generator to generate intermodulation terms, and it uses a Tunable-power divider (T-PD) based on varactor diode-controlled crossover structures to control the characteristics of the predistotered signal. This removes the dependencies on the bulky vector modulator which is frequently used in the conventional APD design. This also reduces the overall footprint. In order to validate the concept, the proposed APD with PA is tested with 64-QAM OFDM test signals of bandwidth 20 MHz and 100 MHz. It achieves a maximum improvement in the adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) and normalized mean square error (NMSE) of 23.67 dB and 18.21 dB, respectively, over that of PA. Though the components are designed at a center frequency of 3.5 GHz, the proposed method is tested in a frequency range of 3 to 3.8 GHz and provides a significant improvement in ACPR and NMSE across the entire frequency range.</description></item><item><title>Optimal IC Task Mapping to Maximize QoS on Heterogeneous Multicore Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304293</link><description>Heterogeneous multicore architectures have become one of the most widely used hardware platforms for embedded systems, where time, energy, and system QoS are the major concerns. The Imprecise Computation (IC) model splits a task into mandatory and optional parts, allowing the trade-off of the above issues. However, existing approaches, to maximize system QoS (Quality-of-Service) under time or energy constraints, use a linear function to model system QoS. Therefore, they become unsuitable for general applications, whose QoS is modeled by a concave function. To deal with this limitation, this brief addresses the Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) problem of mapping IC tasks to a set of heterogeneous cores by concurrently deciding which processor executes each task and the number of cycles of optional tasks (i.e., task allocation and scheduling), under real-time and energy supply constraints. Furthermore, as existing solution algorithms either demand high time complexity or only achieve feasible solutions, we propose a novel approach based on problem transformation and dual decomposition that finds an optimal solution while avoiding high computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves 98% performance of the optimization solver Gurobi, but only with 19.8% of its computation time.</description></item><item><title>Finite-Time Self-Triggered Stabilization for Networked Power System With Deception Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10306282</link><description>This brief investigates the finite-time self-triggered stabilization for networked power system under deception attacks. Compared with event-triggered protocol, the extra hardware is not required to monitor the system state in the adopted self-triggered protocol, and only the latest samples and plants information are used to predict the next triggered instant, which effectively avoids the resource waste. Subsequently, a mathematical model is developed for finite-time self-triggered control with deception attacks. Taking the transient performance of power system into account, sufficient criteria to realize the underlying power system with prescribe  $H_{\infty }$  performance are obtained by means of finite time bounded theory. Furthermore, based on the linear matrix inequality framework, the expected solvability is constructed for finite-time controller.

Due to networked resource limitations and storage capacity restrictions, the exact information of their neighbors cannot be obtained by the agents. In this brief, it is supposed that the information exchanged between agents is quantized using a quantizer. By utilizing the open-loop estimation approach, an event-triggered control protocol is established, where the information communication with any connected neighbor is made discontinuously. To further reduce energy consumption, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism is designed, wherein a dynamic variable is assigned to each agent to dynamically govern its threshold. It is demonstrated that the presented control scheme can circumvent the Zeno behavior and the consensus control objective can be achieved. The validity of the theoretical analysis is manifested by the simulation results.</description></item><item><title>Deterministic Reinforcement Learning Consensus Control of Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems via Autonomous Convergence Perception</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10345763</link><description>This brief addresses an approximate optimal consensus control problem for multi-agent systems (MAS) using an autonomous perception empowered deterministic reinforcement learning scheme.

However, the low resistance of magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) results in significant power consumption in a conventional crossbar array, making it challenging to construct an efficient logic-in-memory. In this brief, we present a crossbar array of voltage-gated spin-orbit torque (SOT)-MRAM devices and establish a logic-in-memory scheme that implements majority gates in the crossbar arrays for reading operations. The multiple cells of the voltage-gated SOT-MRAM devices are connected in series, and each branch&#8217;s resistance is determined by adding the resistances of all the selected cells on it. In comparison to parallel connection schemes, the effective resistance  $({R_{eff}})$  in series connections are 25 times greater, resulting in lower read currents and improved energy efficiency. A case study of a 1-bit full adder serves as proof of the proposed logic-in-memory based on majority gates. These results indicate that the resistance summation in the voltage-gated SOT-MRAM crossbar arrays with majority gates is a preferred platform for logic-in-memory.</description></item><item><title>A New Design of Low Hardware Cost and Low Power Programmable FIR Filters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10320430</link><description>Programmable Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters (Proakis et al., 2007) are widely used in various fields such as communication, radio, audio, and signal processing.

The proposed structure employs, in the first time, an impedance variation reduction (IVR) mechanism based on the principle of the resistance compression network (RCN) for fundamental matching and a harmonic control based on the class-R operation, which can minimize both impedance mismatch loss and diode loss, and then achieve optimal power conversion efficiency (PCE) within a wide range of input power. A rectifier using a Schottky diode model BAT15&#8211;03W is designed and measured at a target frequency of 2.45 GHz for verification. In accordance with measurements, the rectifier can yield peak PCE of 82.3% at 12 dBm while a wide DR of &lt;50%, indicating a superior performance to the other designs.</description></item><item><title>A Modified Levenberg Marquardt Algorithm for Simultaneous Learning of Multiple Datasets</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10330102</link><description>Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm is a powerful approach to optimize the parameters of a neural network (NN).

The proposed rectifier includes three branches that operate at different input power levels: low, medium, and high. The proposed APDT is designed according to the input impedance of each branch and distributes the input power automatically to the three branches. In this way, only one branch is active for a specific input power level and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) at the boundary of different power levels can be optimized. For validation, a three-branch rectifier working at 2.4 GHz was implemented and compared with other designs. The experiment results show that the measured PCE is greater than 50% within an input power range of &#8722;1.5 to 29 dBm, and the range of input power is widened to 30.5 dB. In addition, the input return loss  $\boldsymbol {|S_{11}|}$  is less than &#8722;10 dB with a range of 38 dB.</description></item><item><title>A Three-Port Resonant Converter With Switches Multiplexing and Suppressed Switching Frequency Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10312741</link><description>This brief proposes a high efficiency three-port topology with simple structure. The circuit integrates a buck-boost converter and a LLC resonant converter into one MOSFET bridge, which includes three switches, and thus, voltage regulation and battery management are controlled simultaneously. Also, the LLC resonant tank can be symmetrically powered by appropriately coordinating the control sequence, and the switching frequency range can be narrowed by connecting PV and battery in series. As a result, cost reduction is achievable when maintaining high efficiencies. The effect is validated by detailed analysis and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Detection and Localization of Open Switch Faults for Level-Shifted PWM Cascaded H-Bridge Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315175</link><description>Open switch fault (OSF) detection and localization for level-shifted pulse width modulation (LS-PWM) of  ${n}$ -level cascaded H-bridge inverters (CHBIs) are presented in this brief. In CHBIs, the cascading of H-bridge power cells generates the step inverter output voltage, so the individual or group of switches is responsible for the respective voltage level output. The OSF with a healthy anti-parallel diode is considered for the proposed switch fault detection and localization algorithm. The complexity of fault detection and localization is defined with respect to the fault signatures obtained from the individual switches at the output. The fault signatures of the diagonally opposite switches of the  $p^{th}$  H-bridge are approximately similar for ( $2{p}+$ 1)-level CHBI, where  ${p}$  is an odd positive integer. The non-ideal characteristics of semiconductor switches are used for the proposed fast and accurate OSF detection and associated switch fault localization logic design.</description></item><item><title>A General Voltage Optimization Method for Different Capacitive-Power-Transfer Coupler Pairs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10318177</link><description>Due to the small dielectric constant in air, the corresponding small coupled capacitances make a capacitive power transfer (CPT) system usually suffer high voltage stresses not only on the face-to-face coupler pairs but also on the lateral and crossing coupler pairs, thus increasing the risks of air breakdown and electric field (E-field) radiation. To solve it, this brief proposes a general method to optimize the aforementioned voltage stresses on the different coupler pairs simultaneously via a voltage vector triangle model. The detailed design principles involving the key parameters of compensation network are also given for four basic compensations. Besides of voltage optimization of coupler pairs, a CPT system is usually required to provide the load-independent constant current (CC) or constant voltage (CV) output under a specified power level. Therefore, the high-order compensation networks are used and analyzed to increase the design freedom of the basic four compensations and achieve controllable CC/CV output, while the voltage characteristics on the coupler pairs still remain. Finally, a 1 MHz LC-LCLC compensated CPT prototype is demonstrated and implemented with load-independent CV output, input zero-phase angle (ZPA), and voltage simultaneous optimization on all coupler pairs.</description></item><item><title>Common Ground Buck Type Five-Level Transformerless Inverter With Less Stress</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10324330</link><description>The presented brief introduces a new switched capacitor-based transformer-less inverter (SC TLI). This SC TLI configuration is based on a reduced switch count employing only six switches, one of which is a bidirectional switch. It uses only one power source and two SCs to obtain a five-level output voltage. A level shift pulse width modulation (LS-PWM) based simple logic circuit controls SC TLI. It also handles capacitor charging and discharging during operation for each fundamental cycle. The SCs are self-balanced and do not require any specific controller. Further, detailed comparative studies are performed with existing arts of literature to determine the merits of the SC TLI. A prototype SC TLI model is made in the laboratory. The experimental results from the laboratory prototype validate the feasibility of the SC TLI. The voltage, current stress, and junction temperature across the power component are analyzed for the SC TLI design. Finally, this SC TLI performance characteristic is presented for different loading conditions.</description></item><item><title>Ka-Band Efficient Rectifier With Enhanced Power Capability Using Power Distributing Network and High-Q Bandstop Filter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10328652</link><description>This brief presents a Ka-band rectifier that utilizes power distributing technology to enhance its power handling capability. The matching network and power distributing network are integrated to simultaneously match the diode impedance and distribute power to eight Schottky diodes. A novel bandstop filter for millimeter-wave bands is proposed, which is composed of high  ${Q}$  cylindrical cavities and a coaxial line. This filter not only effectively suppress harmonics but also exhibits low loss characteristics. The fabricated rectifier, operating at 35 GHz, shows a measured  $\unicode{0x007C}S_{11} \unicode{0x007C}$  of &#8722;20.3 dB and a power conversion efficiency of 61.9% at the input power of 29 dBm. Efficiencies under different loads are compared, and it is found that  $50 \Omega $  is the best load. To the best of our knowledge, this rectifier has the highest power capability among existing works. Due to its high-power capability and efficiency, this rectifier shows potential for use in wireless power transfer systems to provide power to electronic devices.</description></item><item><title>Bi-Polar Buck-Boost Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10363770</link><description>In this brief, a bi-polar buck-boost DC-DC converter is formulated. A three-switch based LC-cell (TSLC) is responsible for bi-polar load voltage realization while front-end quadratic boost cell (QBC) effectively gives buck-boost voltage gain feature. The existence of front-end QBC ensures low source ripple current profile. This bi-polar converter is established with a lower number of controlled switching devices, yet it exhibits better boosting capability even in the positive output load voltage operating conditions. Also, a simple complementary gating scheme without any dead-band is employed to realize bi-polar load voltages. Detailed analysis (steady-state and small-signal models) is formulated and performance aspects are investigated. For concept demonstration, a 12 to &#177;42 V, 50 kHz prototype bi-polar converter system is built. The experimental results are in close agreement with the analysis.</description></item><item><title>Model-Free Predictive Frequency Control Under Sensor and Actuator FDI Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10342751</link><description>This brief investigates the load frequency control (LFC) issue of an interconnected power system under sensor and actuator false data injection (FDI) attacks. To this end, a novel model-free control method, ultra-local model-free predictive control (ULMFPC), is proposed as the secondary frequency controller to deal with the coordinated FDI attacks and system physical limitations. In contrast to the approaches available in the literature, the presented ULMFPC approach does not need the state estimation of observers and the mathematical model of the system. This method can independently cope with disruptions injected into the system. The ULMFPC considers the employed plant as a dependent system and utilizes predictive control in a constantly updated linear model to track the reference and control limitation. Unlike other predictive control methods, there is no training data set in the presented control strategy, and only small-scale convex optimization is essential for control computation. The proposed control method performance is evaluated by the Speedgoat real-time emulator and compared with the MPC and distributed economic MPC (DEMPC) methods under sensor and actuator FDI attacks. The experimental results indicate that the proposed ULMFPC technique provides much better dynamic responses compared to other methods.</description></item><item><title>Bifurcation Analysis and Criterion of Voltage Oscillation Induced by Low Voltage Ride Through Control in Renewable Energy Stations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10363634</link><description>The voltage stability issue of renewable energy stations (RES) cannot be ignored. In this brief, for the Voltage Oscillation Instability phenomenon caused by the Low voltage ride through during High active power output of the RES with No faults (VOI-LHN), works on both theory and criterion are conducted. In theory, it is explained that the VOI-LHN corresponds to a High active power output and Low voltage ride through control induced Non-smooth Bifurcation (HLINB). Furthermore, based on theoretical derivation and actual power grid parameters, the boundary between HLINB and Saddle Node Bifurcation (SNB) is obtained. The boundary suggests that in actual power grids, wind farms are more prone to HLINB than SNB. In criterion, a criterion for the occurrence of HLINB is developed, and a threshold calculation method for the criterion is proposed.</description></item><item><title>Robust Active Noise Control: Minimum Output Variance Approach With Least Mean Lp-Norm Algorithm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10330647</link><description>The filtered-x least mean  ${\mathcal {([A-Z]+)}}_{([a-z]+)}$ -norm (FxLMP) algorithm, renowned for its widespread usage, exhibits superior performance over the filtered-x Least Mean Square (FxLMS) algorithm in impulsive noise-afflicted environments. Nevertheless, the FxLMP algorithm experiences performance degradation when confronted with nonlinearity in either the primary or secondary path. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm known as the minimum output variance filtered-s LMP (MOV-FsLMP), which effectively tackles nonlinear active noise control problems by imposing constraints on variance or power. Notably, this proposed algorithm exhibits improved convergence and stability even in impulsive noise environments, all while maintaining lower computational complexity. Extensive simulations validate the efficacy of the proposed MOV-FsLMP method, surpassing that of state-of-the-art alternatives.</description></item><item><title>Chameleon: Dual Memory Replay for Online Continual Learning on Edge Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375748</link><description>Once deployed on edge devices, a deep neural network model should dynamically adapt to newly discovered environments and personalize its utility for each user. The system must be capable of continual learning (CL), i.e., learning new information from a temporal stream of data in situ without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. However, creating a personalized CL framework poses significant challenges due to limited compute and storage resources on edge devices. Existing methods rely on large memory storage to preserve past data while learning from incoming streams, making them impractical for such devices. In this article, we propose Chameleon as a hardware-friendly CL solution for user-centric CL with dual replay buffers. The strategy takes advantage of the hierarchical memory structure commonly found in edge devices, utilizing a short-term replay store in on-chip memory and a long-term replay store in off-chip memory. We also present an FPGA-based analytical model to estimate the compute and communication costs of the dual replay strategy on the hardware, making effective design choices considering various latent layer options. We conduct extensive experiments on four different models, demonstrating our method&#8217;s consistent performance across diverse model architectures. Our method achieves up to  $7\times $  speedup and improved energy efficiency on popular edge devices, including ZCU102 FPGA, NVIDIA Jetson Nano, and Google&#8217;s EdgeTPU.

However, the attention mechanism requires huge computational efforts to process unnecessary calculations, significantly limiting the system&#8217;s performance. To reduce the unnecessary calculations, researchers propose sparse attention to convert some dense-dense matrices multiplication (DDMM) operations to sampled dense&#8211;dense matrix multiplication (SDDMM) and sparse matrix multiplication (SpMM) operations. However, current sparse attention solutions introduce massive off-chip random memory access since the sparse attention matrix is generally unstructured. We propose CPSAA, a novel crossbar-based processing-in-memory (PIM)-featured sparse attention accelerator to eliminate off-chip data transmissions. 1) We present a novel attention calculation mode to balance the crossbar writing and crossbar processing latency. 2) We design a novel PIM-based sparsity pruning architecture to eliminate the pruning phase&#8217;s off-chip data transfers. 3) Finally, we present novel crossbar-based SDDMM and SpMM methods to process unstructured sparse attention matrices by coupling two types of crossbar arrays. Experimental results show that CPSAA has an average of  $89.6\times $ ,  $32.2\times $ ,  $17.8\times $ ,  $3.39\times $ , and  $3.84\times $  performance improvement and  $755.6\times $ ,  $55.3\times $ ,  $21.3\times $ ,  $5.7\times $ , and  $4.9\times $  energy-saving when compare with GPU, field programmable gate array, SANGER, ReBERT, and ReTransformer.</description></item><item><title>Toward Write Optimization for Skyrmion Racetrack Memory by Skyrmion Repermutation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10388033</link><description>Skyrmion racetrack memory (Sky-RM), as an emerging nonvolatile memory technology, provides both high-density data storage and low-access latency, accompanying with a novel feature of using current to shift data along a racetrack. However, it is time-comsuing and energy-hungry to write/inject new particle-like Skyrimons on Sky-RM compared with other manipulations. Thus, the goal of this work is to presents a novel strategy to optimize write performance in Sky-RM, permutation-write (PW). Particularly, PW reduces the number of Skyrmion injections when writing data, by &#8220;repermuting&#8221; existing Skyrmion particles within a racetrack. Moreover, based on the flexible concept of repermutation, this work further proposes PW+ strategy, which is an optimized PW strategy integrated with injection and shift optimizations to achieve better performance. Our evaluation results justify that PW+ can greatly reduce the amount of Skyrmion injections, which are considered highly expensive in Sky-RM, by at least 50%, compared with other state-of-the-art write-optimized strategies. Furthermore, PW+ only incurs 1.79 injections, averaged for every 64-bit-word write. We show that PW+ strategy can bring significant benefits over other state-of-the-art write-optimized strategies by about 16%&#8211;50% for every 64-bit-word write, for both performance and energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>An Energy-Efficient In-Memory Accelerator for Graph Construction and Updating</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10404048</link><description>Graph is widely utilized as a key data structure in many applications, such as social network and recommendation systems. However, many real-world graphs are constructed with large-scale correlated data, which typically involves massive random memory accesses and distance calculation resulting in considerable processing time and energy consumption on CPUs and GPUs. In this work, we present GCiM, a specialized processing-in-memory architecture for efficient graph construction and updating. By directly deploying the computing units on the logic layer of the 3-D stacked memory, GCiM benefits from memory-level parallelism and further improves the memory access efficiency with both optimized processing ordering and data layout. In addition, we notice that the computing engines for graph updating suffer from dramatic utilization imbalance and integrate a power gating module to cut down the power supply of the idle computing engines at runtime and further enhance the energy efficiency. According to our experiments, GCiM shows  $634.64\times $  and  $56.27\times $  speedup while consuming  $1194.14\times $  and  $505.07\times $  less energy compared to CPU and GPU, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Mobile Transformer Accelerator Exploiting Various Line Sparsity and Tile-Based Dynamic Quantization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375766</link><description>Transformer models are difficult to employ in mobile devices due to their memory- and computation-intensive properties. Accordingly, there is ongoing research on various methods for compressing transformer models, such as pruning and quantization. However, general computing platforms, such as central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), are not energy-efficient to accelerate the pruned model because the unstructured sparsity they exhibit causes degradation of parallelism. In this article, we propose a low-power accelerator for transformers that can handle various levels of structured sparsity induced by line pruning with different granularity. Our approach accelerates pruned transformers in a head-wise and line-wise manner. We present a head reorganization and shuffling method that supports head-wise skip operations and resolves the load imbalance problem among processing engines (PEs) caused by the varying number of operations in each head. Furthermore, we implemented a sparse quantized general matrix-to-matrix multiplication (SQ-GEMM) module that supports line-wise skipping and on-the-fly tile-based dynamic quantization of activations. As a result, compared to mobile GPU and CPU, the proposed accelerator improved the energy efficiency by  $2.9\times $  and  $12.3\times $  for the detection transformer (DETR), and  $3.0\times $  and  $12.4\times $  for the vision transformer (ViT) models, respectively. In addition, our proposed mobile accelerator achieved the highest-energy efficiency among the current state-of-the-art FPGA-based transformer accelerators.</description></item><item><title>U-SWIM: Universal Selective Write-Verify for Computing-in-Memory Neural Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10390540</link><description>Architectures that incorporate computing-in-memory (CiM) using emerging nonvolatile memory (NVM) devices have become strong contenders for deep neural network (DNN) acceleration due to their impressive energy efficiency. Yet, a significant challenge arises when using these emerging devices: they can show substantial variations during the weight-mapping process. This can severely impact DNN accuracy if not mitigated. A widely accepted remedy for imperfect weight mapping is the iterative write-verify approach, which involves verifying conductance values and adjusting devices if needed. In all existing publications, this procedure is applied to every individual device, resulting in a significant programming time overhead. In our research, we illustrate that only a small fraction of weights need this write-verify treatment for the corresponding devices and the DNN accuracy can be preserved, yielding a notable programming acceleration. Building on this, we introduce U-SWIM, a novel method based on the second derivative. It leverages a single iteration of forward and backpropagation to pinpoint the weights demanding write-verify. Through extensive tests on diverse DNN designs and datasets, U-SWIM manifests up to a  $10\times $  programming acceleration against the traditional exhaustive write-verify method, all while maintaining a similar accuracy level. Furthermore, compared to our earlier SWIM technique, U-SWIM excels, showing a  $7\times $  speedup when dealing with devices exhibiting nonuniform variations.</description></item><item><title>FedStar: Efficient Federated Learning on Heterogeneous Communication Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10373574</link><description>The proliferation of multimedia applications and increased computing power of mobile devices have led to the development of personalized artificial intelligent (AI) applications that utilize the massive user-information residing on them. However, the traditional centralized training paradigm is not applicable in this scenario due to potential privacy risks and high communication overhead. Federated learning (FL) provides an option to these applications. Nevertheless, the heterogeneity of computing and communication latency among devices have posed great challenges to building efficient learning frameworks. Existing optimizations on FL either fail to speed up training on heterogeneous devices or suffer from poor communication efficiency. In this article, we propose FedStar, an efficient FL framework that supports decentralized asynchronous training on heterogeneous communication networks. Considering the heterogeneous computing power in the network, FedStar supports running heterogeneity-aware local steps on each device. What is more, considering the heterogeneous communication latency and possibly unreachable communication path between some devices, FedStar generates a decentralized communication topology that can achieve maximal training throughput. Finally, it adopts weighted aggregation to guarantee high convergence accuracy of global model. Theoretical analysis results show the convergence behavior of FedStar under nonconvex settings. Experimental results show that FedStar can achieve a speedup of  $4.81 \times $  than the state-of-the-art FL schemes with high convergence accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Data Extraction Circuit for Posit Number System: LDD-Based Posit Decoder</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10374246</link><description>Since being proposed in 2017, the posit number system has attracted much attention due to its advantages over the IEEE 754 standard floating-point format for better dynamic range and higher accuracy, which are crucial to many applications such as neural networks. Those advantages are yielded from a varying-length segment, regime bits, which lead to the size variations for all rest components except the sign bit. Consequently, it requires an extra decoding process to extract the numerical value of a posit number. The state-of-the-art posit decoder is designed based on a leading one/zero detector. However, we find that this conventional method holds implicit redundancy when dealing with binary numbers. In this article, we design a novel hardware architecture, i.e., the leading difference detector, to optimize the circuit operation by eliminating the redundancy. The experimental results show that the proposed architecture can decrease the delay and power consumption by over 41% compared to the conventional designs for 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit posit decoders.</description></item><item><title>Silicon-Proven ASIC Design for the Polynomial Operations of Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10415637</link><description>In this work, we elaborate on our endeavors to design, implement, fabricate, and post-silicon validate CoFHEE (Nabeel et al., 2023), a co-processor for low-level polynomial operations targeting fully homomorphic encryption execution.
