The proposed design repurposes the receiver-side compensation inductor as the primary winding of a multiwinding transformer, enabling the balancing function to be realized without introducing additional magnetic components or control circuits. Balancing voltages and accurate intercell energy redistribution are governed by the transformer&#8217;s turns ratio, allowing precise regulation without auxiliary converters or switch matrices. Consequently, the system avoids the multiple receiver coils and complex switching networks typical of conventional WPT equalizers, leading to notable reductions in cost, volume, and control complexity. Furthermore, the topology ensures accurate balancing without stringent coupling consistency and remains stable under coil misalignment, highlighting its robustness to mutual inductance variations. These attributes make the system particularly suitable for dynamic or mobile energy storage applications. Experimental results validate the proposed equalizer, demonstrating a charging efficiency of 81.5% at a 19 W load while maintaining intercell voltage deviations below 0.02 V. These results demonstrate that the proposed method offers a compact, reliable, and scalable approach for integrated battery management in WPT-enabled systems.</description></item><item><title>Data-Based Zero-Phase Angle Frequency Tracking for Series&#8211;Series Compensated WPT Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11174129</link><description>The zero-phase angle (ZPA) operation is a widely used strategy in wireless power transfer (WPT) systems to improve the system efficiency. However, the ZPA frequency could vary in application scenarios such as ship-to-shore power systems, where the transfer distance is disturbed by waves, which could force the self- and mutual inductance of the coupled coils to change. Meanwhile, frequency bifurcation often occurs in tightly coupled WPT systems, leading to multiple ZPA frequencies. In this article, a data-based method is proposed to track one of the ZPA frequencies for a magnetic coupling WPT system with series&#8211;series compensation. The proposed method first tracks in real time the waveform of the inverter output current, i.e., amplitude and frequency, from sampled data; then, based on these quantities, aligns the output voltage and current of the inverter to achieve the ZPA operation. Moreover, convergence of the operation frequency is analyzed, and guidelines to suppress frequency hopping are suggested. The implementation of the proposed method in a digital signal processor with the help of a pulsewidth modulation module has also been discussed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by experiments.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Mechanism- and Data-Driven Joint Parameter Identification for Underwater Wireless Power Transfer Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11185120</link><description>Accurate identification of key parameters is crucial for closed-loop control and system stability in underwater wireless power transfer (UWPT) systems. However, the absence of communication and severe harmonic distortion from eddy currents in sea environments present significant challenges to identification results. This article proposes a hybrid mechanism- and data-driven method for accurate joint identification of mutual inductance and load. First, to resolve the linear dependence and parameter coupling inherent in typical LCC&#8211;S compensated UWPT systems, a multifrequency excitation strategy is introduced to extract informative features for joint identification. Second, an artificial neural network is pretrained on mechanism-based data to construct the source domain model (SDM). Moreover, transfer learning fine-tunes the SDM with limited experimental data to obtain a target domain model (TDM), enhancing model generalization under varying conditions. Finally, an experimental platform with 1 kW/85 kHz is constructed to validate the proposed method. Experimental results and three different typical underwater conditions are captured and collected, which demonstrates that the proposed mechanism and data-driven joint parameter identification method can achieve quick and accurate identification results with prediction error below 3% and response time within 2.72 ms.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Performance Enhancement for Multiexcitation-Units WPT System Using Data-Driven Modeling and Matrix-Inversion-Free Model Predictive Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11197913</link><description>The multiexcitation-units wireless power transfer (MEU-WPT) system supports multilevel power applications by adjusting the number of excitation units. Its inherent redundancy enhances reliability against inverter failures, making it ideal for wireless electric vehicle and underwater vehicle charging. However, the incorporation of the MEU structure increases the number of control variables (such as the phase-shift angles of the inverters) and introduces cross couplings among different power units, resulting in complex power transfer channels and interconnected feedback loops, where variations in one control variable generate disturbances in other channels. Consequently, achieving high dynamic performance in output regulation becomes challenging without effective coordination of all control variables. This article proposes a constrained model predictive control (MPC) method aimed at achieving high dynamic performance in output regulation for the MEU-WPT system with cross couplings. Initially, a data-driven simplified refined instrumental variable method is employed to model the MEU-WPT system, capturing the dynamics associated with the cross couplings. Subsequently, a Laguerre-network based multivariable MPC control law is derived from the data-driven models. A matrix-inversion-free quadratic programming solver is developed to enable computationally-efficient constrained optimization. Furthermore, an event-triggered mechanism is integrated into the control framework, demonstrating the potential for rapid switching between different input power allocations among excitation units. An MEU-WPT prototype featuring two excitation units is constructed to validate the feasibility of the proposed control approach.</description></item><item><title>3-D Wireless Power Transfer With Orthogonal Transmitters and Adaptive MPC-MPPT</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11202560</link><description>This article presents a three-dimensional wireless power transfer system that uses three transmitting coils oriented in orthogonal directions and an adaptive model predictive control (MPC) strategy that incorporates maximum power point tracking (MPPT). The framework combines MPC&#8217;s predictive optimization and MPPT&#8217;s efficiency-seeking behavior, which simultaneously optimizes power tracking accuracy, system efficiency, and current distribution, while maintaining zero-voltage-switching operation. The dynamic weight-adjustment mechanism alters the weights of competing objectives automatically and based on the current operational conditions. The system model indicates that power distribution in 3-D space fits a Lemniscate of Bernoulli surface revolved about its longitudinal axis, so the rotational Lemniscate of Bernoulli surface is important to the control design. The experimental results presented in this article show up to 20% increased efficiency at 40 cm transmission distance, and a peak efficiency of 87% at 60 W and at 40 cm &#215; 40 cm &#215; 40 cm charging volume. The framework provides stable power delivery while the receiver is in motion, making it appealing for applications that require spatial freedom, including mobile robots and bio-inspired aerial vehicles.</description></item><item><title>A M&#246;bius Transformation Impedance Matching Approach for Large Load Region and Multilevel Power Modulation in High Frequency Switched Mode Power Amplifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11207141</link><description>The switched mode power amplifier (PA) is widely used for high frequency high power applications due to its high efficiency. In the switched mode PAs, impedance matching network (IMN) is usually needed to ensure that the varying load impedances can be matched to the target impedances for high efficiency. The existing IMN design methods usually depend on empirical trial and error, load pull simulation, and numerical optimization, which cannot achieve actual region-to-region impedance matching. Therefore, this article proposed a novel impedance matching design approach for switch mode PAs based on the property of circle preservation in M&#246;bius transformation which guarantee that all the impedance points in a region or trajectory can be precisely transferred to the target region or trajectory. The proposed approach gives the simple and explicit formulas to design the IMN parameters, which helps solve the design challenge of accurate impedance matching for large load region. And the impedance matching design for frequency tuning control is also presented to achieve high efficiency and multilevel power modulation over a large impedance region. For verification, a 500 W 13.56 MHz GaN-based class E PA is built and the experiments show that the PA with proposed matching design can achieve 87.2%&#8211;95% efficiency over a large load region. And the high speed pulsing (200 kHz) and multilevel (25.6 kHz) power modulation can be also achieved by frequency tuning with ultra-fast transitions (369 ns) and 91% average efficiency by using the proposed design.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Wireless Power Transfer With Self-Resonance Coupler Based on Integrated Coil</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11208828</link><description>According to the duality of inductive wireless power transfer (IPT) and capacitive wireless power transfer (CPT) in coupler and tuning method, an integrated coil is designed in this article to constructs a compact hybrid wireless power transfer (HPT). The magnetic field coupling and the electric field coupling constructed by coils and plates share one energy transmission channel, which enhances the transmission power and energy density. The inductance of coils and capacitances of plates compensate for each other. The resonant frequency of integrated coils is adjusted to kHz. Additional tuning inductances and capacitances are eliminated to build a lighter self-resonance coupler. The stacked structure design of coils and plates enables compact integration and miniaturization of integrated coils. A 300 W experimental platform was built, and some comparative experiments were conducted. Compared to the coupler of IPT, the self-resonance coupler has improved performance in transmission power, antioffset, and over-coupling suppression. HPT performs better than CPT in transmission distance, transmission power, and transmission efficiency. It has some advantages in the medium-power application scenarios, such as inspection robots and drones, which expect couplers to have a smaller volume, lighter weight, higher power density and better antioffset.</description></item><item><title>Nonpolar Integration for LCC Compensation Inductor in EV-WPT Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11207549</link><description>To reduce the volume of the secondary side of an electric vehicle wireless power transfer system, integrated LCC compensation has become a prevalent approach. However, integrated inductors introduce additional coupling effects among the integrated inductors and the power coils, which may influence the input impedance angle, and increase electrical stresses. To circumvent this problem, this article proposes a nonpolar method for integrated compensation inductor design. The main idea behind the proposed method is to first separate a single compensation inductor into two bipolar inductors, then reconfigure the wirings so that the currents flow in opposite directions, which helps to mitigate their cross interactions. Since this approach decouples the compensation inductors from the power coils, the system becomes more compact and, at the same time, the symmetrical layout results in lower coil current stresses and reduced electromagnetic interference. The universal harmonic-considered time-domain model for vehicle-side magnetic integration is deduced. Furthermore, a systematic comparison of soft-switching behavior between conventional integrated solutions and the proposed topology is carried out under varying misalignment conditions. Experimental results obtained from a 11-kW prototype show that the proposed system achieves zero-voltage switching over the specified misalignment range, with a peak efficiency of 93.4%. A video showing the waveforms of the system during the misalignment process is provided in the Supplementary Material.</description></item><item><title>Pulse Skipping Analysis in Wireless Power Transfer Systems Based on a Reduced-Order Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11216023</link><description>Wireless power transfer (WPT) systems with battery loads exhibit low damping, which results in significant current overshoots and sustained oscillations when subjected to disturbances. Pulse skipping control is frequently employed in WPT systems and can be considered a significant disturbance. However, the accurate analysis of the resulting system dynamics and current envelope remains a challenge. To allow accurate evaluation of the performance of WPT systems with pulse skipping, this article introduces a new reduced-order model for WPT systems through balanced truncation. The derived second-order model enables real-time computation of the current envelopes on both sides of the system, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of the overall performance. This article presents two case studies that utilize this reduced-order model to optimize pulse skipping control in WPT systems. The first study proposes a pulse skipping soft-start strategy based on this model. The second study investigates the optimal pattern of pulse skipping modulations. Simulations and experimental results from a laboratory prototype validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed reduced-order model and the design and refinement of the pulse skipping patterns.</description></item><item><title>Research on an Efficient Noncontact Power Transfer Method for Elliptical Ultrasonic Tool Holders</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11223710</link><description>The elliptical ultrasonic tool holder (EUTH) is a critical core component in elliptical ultrasonic vibration-assisted milling. Traditional EUTH employ conductive slip rings for power transmission, which severely restricts milling speed. This study investigates an efficient noncontact power transfer method for EUTH, utilizing a dual-channel rotary transformer to replace conductive slip rings. Electrical energy is transferred through air coupling between the primary and secondary sides of the rotary transformer, and this frictionless power transmission method eliminates limitations on milling speed. A finite element model of the elliptical ultrasonic transducer was used to analyze its modal shape, impedance, and resonant frequency temperature drift characteristics, thereby determining the transducer's resonant frequency, vibration amplitude, and node positions. The rotary transformer was designed using ferrite core material with high magnetic permeability and low electrical conductivity to reduce eddy current losses. An equivalent circuit model of the EUTH was established, and compensation circuits were designed to improve the efficiency of noncontact power transfer. A dual-channel ultrasonic generator (DCUG) was developed using a Class D amplifier, enabling adjustable voltage amplitude, phase, and frequency. A Fuzzy-PID algorithm was implemented to achieve automatic resonant frequency tracking for the DCUG. Finally, a milling platform was set up to conduct elliptical ultrasonic vibration-assisted milling experiments, where the DCUG drove the EUTH. Experimental results show that below 40 kHz, the maximum driving voltage of the dual-channel ultrasonic generator reaches 300 Vp-p, while the elliptical vibration displacements at the tool tip in the X- and Y-directions are both approximately 20 &#956;mp-p. The output amplitude current remains stable, and the system automatically tracks the resonant frequency of the EUTH during milling. This provides an effective method for achieving high-efficiency noncontact power transfer in EUTH.</description></item><item><title>An Omnidirectional Wireless Power Transfer System via Two Orthogonal Bipolar Coils and Targeting Magnetic Field Control for UAVs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11226851</link><description>Misalignment tolerance represents a critical challenge in uncrewed aerial vehicle wireless power transfer (UAV-WPT) systems. Conventional approaches enhance positional and angular misalignment tolerance by generating wide-range omnidirectional magnetic fields through transmitter design or rotating field techniques. However, these methods exhibit a low magnetic field utilization rate since UAVs typically require only specific field orientations postlanding rather than omnidirectional fields. This article proposes a UAV-WPT system employing two orthogonal bipolar transmitting coils with a targeting magnetic field to achieve omnidirectional powering and enhance the magnetic field utilization rate simultaneously. COMSOL simulations are used to analyze the magnetic field distribution of the transmitter, and the principles for generating a targeting magnetic field through excitation current control are explained. The amplitude and phase of the excitation currents are controlled by adjusting the duty cycle and phase difference of the two half-bridge inverters. The mathematical relationships between maximum output power, maximum input power, and maximum transmission efficiency with respect to duty cycle and phase difference are established. A targeting magnetic field control method combining phase difference and duty cycle scanning is proposed. Experimental results show that the system can establish a targeting magnetic field within 85 ms, with a maximum output power of 216.2 W and a peak dc-to-dc efficiency of 89.5%. The dc-to-dc efficiency exceeds 76.1% across &#177;100 mm positional misalignment and arbitrary angular misalignment. The dc-to-dc efficiency of the targeting magnetic field mode is at least 5% higher than that of the rotating magnetic field mode.</description></item><item><title>A Single-Stage Synchronized Switch Interface Circuit for Power Enhancement and Voltage Regulation in Electromagnetic Energy Harvesting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11240585</link><description>Synchronized switch interface circuits demonstrate good performance for electromagnetic energy harvesting applications, but lack adaptability in terms of harvested power. This article introduces an additional control degree of freedom by proposing two power control methods and implementing them in a synchronous current inversion and energy extraction (SCIEE) circuit. Theoretical analysis indicates that the single-stage system achieves higher efficiency for approximately 41.3% of the supported load range compared to using a commercial dc&#8211;dc regulator. In the load transient experiments, the proposed system maintains the output voltage well-regulated, with undershoot and overshoot below 0.2 V. The output voltage ripple is 0.15 V at an 18 mA load current. The proposed system is compared to three other options: a direct ac&#8211;dc harvesting circuit, the synchronous switch energy extraction (SSEE) circuit, and a two-stage harvesting system using a commercial dc&#8211;dc regulator and an open-loop SCIEE circuit. The proposed system supports a maximum load current of 29.47 mA, the highest among these options. In a field test, the proposed system supports successful integrated circuit long range (LoRa) packet transmissions and exhibits a broader supported load range than the SSEE or direct ac&#8211;dc harvest scheme.</description></item><item><title>Constant Current/Voltage Charging Control for Communication-Free IPT Systems via Network-Based Deep Transfer Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11245200</link><description>Parameter identification-based control strategies are considered the preferred solution for achieving constant current (CC) and constant voltage (CV) charging control in communication-free inductive power transfer systems. However, identification errors in mutual inductance, load resistance, and other parameters can affect control accuracy. To improve control accuracy and response speed, a communication-free control strategy based on neural networks and deep transfer learning is proposed. This strategy eliminates the need to identify parameters like mutual inductance and load resistance. Only a few measured datasets are required to train the network model offline, and a trained model can online estimate output voltage/current. By combining with a controller, CV/CC charging control can be achieved under conditions of real-time variations in mutual inductance and load resistance. The experimental results show that the proposed control strategy achieves a static error of only 1.5% and a response time of no more than 24 ms. Compared to the parameter identification-based control strategy, the proposed strategy demonstrates lower static error, shorter response time, and a wider dynamic range.</description></item><item><title>Design of an Anti-Misalignment Coil With Hilbert Structure for WPT System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11249794</link><description>Currently, coil misalignment is recognized as one of the primary factors limiting the transmission efficiency of wireless power transfer (WPT) systems, presenting a substantial barrier to the large-scale adoption of WPT. To enhance transmission efficiency under misalignment, mitigate the impacts of misalignment, and increased transmission distance of WPT systems, research on Hilbert fractal curves in related fields was referenced, mutual inductance expressions for coils with Hilbert-extended structures and conventional coils were derived based on their mathematical formulations, and the potential advantages of Hilbert curves in wireless power transfer applications were analyzed. Supported by extensive simulation outcomes, a fractal coil incorporating a Hilbert structure was designed without altering coil manufacturing costs. The transmission performance advantages of this coil were investigated through simulations. A WPT system verification platform utilizing an LCC-S circuit was constructed, where 300 W power and efficiency tests were conducted under relatively consistent zero voltage switch (ZVS) conditions for both coil types. Experimental results across varying transmission distances and misalignment distances were obtained. The results demonstrate that the proposed coils comprehensively optimize the power transfer capability of conventional coils, delivering more stable output power and improving the transmission efficiency by over 10% (up to 24%).</description></item><item><title>Multifrequency and Multiload WPT System Based on Cascade H-Bridge Multilevel Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11251316</link><description>To address the issues of limited output power and harmonic interference in existing multifrequency and multiload magnetic coupling resonant wireless power transfer (MFML-MCR-WPT) systems, this article proposes a MFML-MCR-WPT system based on a cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverter (CHB-MLI). The system utilizes the phase disposition multifrequency modulation technique, achieving arbitrary frequency and quantity power output and control through the design of modulation wave quantity, frequency, and amplitude. First, the structure of the CHB-MLI-based MFML-MCR-WPT system is proposed, and the working principle of the multifrequency modulation method is analyzed. Subsequently, a five-level dual-frequency and dual-load system is taken as an example to establish the mathematical model. Then, system parameter optimization is conducted to suppress cross-coupling and interfrequency interference. Furthermore, to address the power and loss imbalance among H-bridge units under multifrequency low modulation indices, a carrier reconstruction method is adopted to balance power distribution and switching losses. Finally, an experimental platform is constructed to validate the proposed theory. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves multilevel multifrequency power output with continuous power and frequency control, maintains minimal interchannel interference, and achieves H-bridge unit balancing ratios of 1:1.19, while exhibiting excellent system compatibility and controllability.</description></item><item><title>Improved ADRC With a Disturbance-Separation CESO Based on Complex Coefficient-Filter for Current Source Rectifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11165752</link><description>Under complicated operations, the tracking performance and interference rejection ability of the LC-filtered current source rectifiers (CSRs) are inevitably compromised by various disturbances, including aperiodic and periodic disturbances. Aiming at this problem, an improved active disturbance rejection controller (ADRC) with a disturbance-separation cascaded extended state observer (DSCESO) based on a complex-coefficient filter (CCF) is proposed to improve the disturbance rejection ability. First, by integrating a CCF into the second cascade level of CESO, the proposed CCF-CESO can not only overcome the trade-off between estimation performance and noise suppression, but also accurately estimate positive and negative sequence disturbances arising from converter nonlinearity and nonideal grid conditions. Second, the CCF-DSCESO is constructed to decouple different disturbances based on disturbance separation technology, thereby further strengthening the robustness and tracking accuracy. Finally, comparative experimental results verify the superiority of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Input Voltage Proportional Feedforward Control for Three-Phase Buck Rectifier Under Unbalanced Input Voltages and Wide AC Input Frequency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11177612</link><description>In aircraft on-board power supply applications, the wide input frequency brings obstacles for three-phase buck rectifier (3ph-BR) when handling unbalanced input voltages, causing the problem of double-frequency pulsation on active power. To address this issue, an input voltage proportional feedforward control with light computation load and short reconstruction time is proposed in this article, in which the input voltages are reconstructed based on the input voltage feedforward coefficients. A simplified digital implementation for feedforward coefficients calculation is presented for wide input frequency, which only needs six multiplication operations for a set of feedforward coefficients. Besides, the reconstruction time is shortened to less than 1/3 input voltage period. Thus, the proposed control could realize faster reconstruction and impose low computational requirements on digital processors. A 1.2 kW experimental prototype is established to verify the theoretical analysis. The results show that the proposed method realizes low total harmonic distortion (THD) input currents and constant active power under unbalanced input voltages and wide ac input frequency.</description></item><item><title>A Zeta&#8211;Luo Integrated Dual Output Bridgeless Rectifier Fed SRM Drive With Improved Power Quality</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11176809</link><description>This article outlines a hybrid dual output bridgeless (HDOBL) power factor correction (PFC) converter, which is developed through integration of Zeta and Luo structures, intended for low-power midpoint converter (MPC)-assisted switched reluctance motor (SRM) drive. HDOBL converter is designed to generate a balanced dual output dc supply, facilitating effective and reliable front-end power conditioning, which ensures improved power quality and compatibility with midpoint-assisted SRM configurations. The input side inductor is selected to operate in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), which reduces switching losses of power devices and reverse recovery losses of diodes by zero current switching (ZCS) operation. Moreover, DCM operation requires single voltage sensor, which reduces cost and control complexity of converter. In addition, DCM facilitates natural PFC at grid end and provides speed control of SRM by controlling dual output dc link voltage through simple voltage controller. Proposed HDOBL converter is validated on 450 W experimental hardware set up to assess performance of converter fed SRM drive related to power quality measures such as supply current total harmonic distortion (THD), grid power factor, losses, and efficiency, carried out under various power conditions and supply fluctuations. Under rated conditions, obtained test results outlined supply current THD is 3.1 % and power factor is near unity, which confirms the recommended IEC 61000-3-2 guidelines.</description></item><item><title>Asymmetric Drive-Based Commutation Control of A Decoupled Multifrequency Multiphase Wireless Power Transfer SRM Drive System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11168947</link><description>This article proposes an enhanced commutation control of a wireless power transfer switched reluctance motor (SRM) drive system with decoupled channels. In this system, the SRM windings can be selectively and stably energized with overlapped excitation region through the magnetic link. Initially, the wireless SRM with trap filters and elaborately designed primary compensation is utilized to avoid cross interference between channels and realize power equalization of targeted windings. Additionally, an asymmetric drive method is applied to the inverter to construct a multifrequency ac excitation source. This method contains triple states, namely two half-bridge drive states in single-phase excitation mode (SPEM) and a full-bridge drive state in dual-phase excitation mode (DPEM), which facilitates the bridge leg operating frequencies configured with greater flexibility compared to the conventional dual-state drive method. Moreover, an enhanced commutation control is embedded into the traditional hybrid excitation strategy. When inheriting the merits of the overlapped winding excitation, this novel control eliminates the shift of a nonzero operating frequency from one inverter bridge leg to another, thus eliminating the sudden drop of terminal voltage during operating modes switching, and improving the stability and torque output of the motor. Finally, experimental results verify the validity of the proposed control strategy.</description></item><item><title>A Three-Degree-of-Freedom Bearingless Switched Reluctance Motor With Biased Permanent Magnets</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11164532</link><description>A traditional bearingless switched reluctance motor (BSRM) can only achieve two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) radial levitation of its rotor shaft.

The crucial aspect is to combine the standard Hall-effect position sensor with wireless sensor coils. The sensor coils possess functions of detector excitation and wireless information transfer (WIT) regulated by secondary-side bidirectional switches. A novel combination of unipolar, horizontal bipolar, vertical bipolar, and quadrupole coils is employed to achieve four-channel decoupling, thus realizing coil integration. A new snubber, consisting of two resistor-capacitor-diode (RCD) snubbers connected in antiparallel, is proposed to suppress the significant bidirectional voltage spikes across bidirectional switches. This detector possesses strong robustness against motor power and commutation as its excitation is independent from the wireless power transfer (WPT) channel of wireless BLDC. Besides, it enables extremely low delay since no complex commutation protocols like those in Bluetooth are involved. Moreover, its binary output signals can be directly recognized by the primary-side controller, not requiring additional algorithms or circuits for decoding or filtering. This detector holds the highest experimental speed record at 10&#8201;000 rpm among all existing wireless position sensors for wireless motors, with a delay of only 0.9% of the minimum Bluetooth communication latency.</description></item><item><title>An Online Estimation Method for DC-Link Capacitor in Doubly Salient Electromagnetic Motor Drive System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11178083</link><description>As a key component of the motor drive system, the dc-link capacitor has a significant impact on the system reliability.

The power switches and a dc-bus capacitor are shared. The proposed LED driver can be divided into a two-stage: the power factor correction (PFC) stage uses the output characteristics of a zero-voltage and zero-derivative-switching (ZVDS) Class-E current-driven rectifier as a power-factor corrector; in addition, this PFC stage is designed for the continuous conduction mode (CCM) operation, and the driver stage uses a zero-voltage switching Class-D LLC converter to supply a constant dc-driven current to the LED load. The circuit operation and step-by-step design of the converter are fully described. The proposed scheme works better with the CCM-ZVDS Class-E current-driven rectifier because it reduces the high current stress on the power switch caused by high di/dt. It also gets rid of the need for a differential mode input filter, and a simple non-isolated matching network without a high-frequency transformer can be used.

These cyber-attacks, once infiltrated, can either destabilize the complete system or remain undetected by maintaining operational control objectives despite the presence of an attack. This article presents a method for the local detection of such sophisticated covert attacks targeting DCMG actuators. A robust, converter-level detection metric is proposed that relies on both measured and internal states of each node. In contrast to existing methods, the proposed metric is explicitly designed to remain invariant to line and load variations, ensuring high sensitivity to attack vectors alone. In addition, a detection algorithm based on a finite state machine (FSM) framework is introduced to guarantee accurate and consistent identification of genuine attacks. The stealthiness of these covert attacks and the efficacy of the proposed detection method are validated through simulation and experimentation on a four-node DCMG laboratory prototype.</description></item><item><title>A Pseudobinary Cascaded H-Bridge Converter for the Front-End Stage of Solid-State Transformers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11176443</link><description>A converter based on the binary cascaded H-bridge (BCHB) regarded as the pseudobinary CHB (PBCHB) is proposed for the ac&#8211;dc front-end stage in solid-state transformers (SSTs). The hybrid modulator of the BCHB produces step-like sinusoidal waveforms with near-line-frequency commutations in the high-voltage cells and high-frequency commutations in the low-voltage cell. The power stage design of high-voltage cells transferring the active power can be modularized. However, the power transfer among them is unequal, and the issue has not been investigated. This article proposes a 15-level PBCHB that maintains a modular design while ensuring balanced power transfer and negligible switching losses among the high-voltage cells, regarded as active cells. The low-voltage high-frequency cell, which is regarded as the floating capacitor cell, is used as a power quality enhancer without real power consumption. Consequently, the original BCHB architecture is slightly modified along with the controller design to become PBCHB, balancing the power transfer among the active cells while maintaining equal voltage levels at their dc side. In this article, the design and analysis of the modulator and its controller for the PBCHB are presented in detail. The effectiveness of the proposed front-end SST with the proposed modulation and control technique is verified in a 1.2 kV/3 kW single-phase prototype.</description></item><item><title>A New Perspective of Dual-Frequency Power Oscillation in Multi-VSGs Parallel Supercharger System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11170421</link><description>The multivirtual synchronous generators (VSGs) parallel supercharger is an important way to achieve the fast charging of electric vehicles (EVs) and the fast support of the power grid. However, the dual-frequency power oscillation problem might seriously threaten its stable operation. Based on the P/&#969; admittance model of the multi-VSGs parallel supercharger, a new perspective of dual-frequency power oscillation in multi-VSGs parallel supercharger system is discovered. Specifically, with the various numbers of parallel VSGs, the power oscillation amplitude trend of the supercharger system under load power perturbation (LPP) and grid frequency perturbation (GFP) is opposite. Moreover, the larger the number of parallel VSGs, the greater the power oscillation caused by the GFP, which more easily leads to overload operation of the power transformer. Therefore, a dual-frequency power oscillation suppression method based on error power feedforward compensation (EPFC) is proposed, which can suppress the dual-frequency oscillation under two different perturbations regardless of the variation in the number of parallel VSGs. Finally, a three-VSG parallel supercharger platform is constructed to verify the accuracy of the new perspective and the effectiveness of the oscillation suppression method.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Asymmetrical-Parallelled LLC Resonant Converter for Light Load Efficiency Improvement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11176849</link><description>LLC resonant converters have been extensively applied in many applications due to their low switching loss and galvanic isolation features.

The generation and characteristics of high-frequency grid harmonics and interharmonics are correlated with pulse width modulation (PWM) of grid-integrated converters with amplitude&#8211;frequency (A&#8211;F) interfered modulation signals. However, due to the applicability and precision, prior PWM analysis methods cannot effectively deal with A&#8211;F time-varying modulation signals. To solve this issue, focusing on small harmonic and interharmonic disturbances near the steady operating state, the PWM modeling and characteristic analysis are carried out for A&#8211;F time-varying modulation signals in this article. Multiple Fourier series PWM analysis method based on decomposition principle of multivariate periodic function is proposed, which can explicitly characterize the impact mechanism of modulation signal components and carrier signal on the PWM amplitude and frequency. Coupling characteristics among fundamental, small A&#8211;F interference and carrier frequencies are clarified. To enhance applicability of this method, an improved multiple Fourier series coefficient calculation method is further proposed, which does not require multiple integrals, and has lower computational burden compared with traditional method. Finally, effectiveness of proposed method is verified by experiment.</description></item><item><title>Design-Level and Switching Modulation Optimization for Loss Minima Tracking in Nonresonant DC&#8211;AC DABs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11173178</link><description>This article provides a comprehensive modeling and modulator optimization of the nonresonant dual active bridge (DAB) configurations in terms of efficiency and output voltage total harmonic distortion (THD). This article characterizes nonresonant DABs by representing their governing equations in a mathematical framework using generalized harmonic approximation (GHA). The mathematical framework includes conduction losses, switching losses, and output voltage THD analyses. This framework is then used to derive optimized design-level and modulation-level variables and is applied to four candidates based on two possible switching modulations, variable or fixed frequency, and two possible configurations, single inductor DAB (L-DAB) and LC-DAB, to identify the merits of each candidate. Moreover, a series of mathematical analyses regarding soft-switching realization, conduction loss minimization, and output voltage THD performance are carried out in-depth for all four candidates. Finally, a $\textbf{500}\ \textbf{W}$ SiC/GaN-based single-stage DAB-based dc&#8211;ac converter prototype ($\textbf{40}\ \textbf{V}$/$\textbf{120}\ \boldsymbol{{V}_\text{rms}}$) is developed. Quantitative comparisons of efficiency and output voltage THD across the four candidates validate the analytical framework and highlight the individual performance trade-offs of each configuration.</description></item><item><title>Phase-Shifted Model Predictive Control With Improved Steady-State Control Input Reference for Three-Level Active-NPC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11176444</link><description>This article proposes a phase-shifted model predictive control (PS-MPC) strategy to fully exploit the most relevant features of finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) and phase-shifted pulse width modulation (PS-PWM) in a three-level active neutral point clamped (3L-ANPC) converter. Conventional PS-MPC strategies utilize a steady-state control input reference, typically a harmonic-free signal depending on the converter topology. However, this article demonstrates that the PS-MPC strategy applied to the 3L-ANPCconverter requires a control input containing a third-harmonic component with a specific magnitude and phase angle, which improves output current tracking and capacitor voltage balancing. By designing synchronized models for each carrier, the predictive controller optimizes duty cycles independently, ensuring the effective regulation of both control variables while addressing model nonlinearities. The proposed strategy is experimentally validated using a DSP F28379D microcontroller and a three-phase 3L-ANPCconverter using a total of 64 switching states in a grid-connected application. Compared to PS-PWM and FCS-MPC, the proposed approach maintains a fixed switching frequency, improves steady-state tracking, and enhances capacitor voltage balancing with a fast dynamic response. Additionally, it outperforms PS-MPC with control input change penalization (PS-MPC ${\boldsymbol\Delta} \boldsymbol{u}$) by reducing spectral dispersion while achieving lower execution time than both FCS-MPC and PS-MPC ${\boldsymbol\Delta} \boldsymbol{u}$, making it more suitable for real-time implementation. Such results are also discussed with a video demonstrating the real-time implementation.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Control Strategy to Enhance the Transient Performance of Grid-Forming Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11177595</link><description>In response to the issues of transient power angle instability and fault current (FC) over-limit under severe grid three-phase symmetrical faults for grid-forming voltage source converters (GFM-VSCs), this article proposes a novel joint control method combining second-order sliding mode control (SOSMC) with voltage adaptive regulation. Initially, an improved integral sliding surface is introduced into the active power-frequency loop of the GFM-VSC, and a Lyapunov function is constructed, which pertains to a large-signal problem. Based on this stability criterion, an output power control law is designed to strictly limit the fluctuation of the power angle. Subsequently, a reactive power&#8211;voltage loop switching control is employed to provide stable reactive power and support grid voltage, while ensuring that the steady-state current (SSC) is maintained within a safe threshold. Additionally, during faults, a virtual impedance is engaged, and the transient current (TC) can be suppressed by adjusting the ratio of resistance-to-inductance (R/L) and recovery resistance. This method achieves power angle stability (PAS) and fault current suppression (FCS) simultaneously, even during grid voltage sags accompanied by phase changes. Finally, the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method are validated on the real-time test platform.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Dual Input Quasi Z Source Bidirectional DC&#8211;DC Converter for Battery Powered Inverter Fed Microgrid Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11168956</link><description>This article presents a novel dual-input bidirectional quasi-Z-source dc&#8211;dc converter (DIBQZSC) using minimum components designed for 1&#8239;kW, 400&#8239;V, 50 kHz applications in microgrid.

The proposed ACT has a simple structure, where the half-bridge CLLC transformer is modified to a flyback coupling type and a half-wave rectifier with a freewheeling diode is employed. It achieves a combination of linear current injection and sinusoidal current feeding, and the operating frequency and turn-off losses are significantly reduced via multicycle passive resonance modulation. Moreover, the leakage inductor of the ACT is multiplexed as the resonant inductor, providing soft switching for semiconductors. The article investigates the operating principle, voltage gain, turn-off current, maximum resonance number, and soft switching of the proposed ACT. Then, according to the voltage gain range and loss characteristics of multicycle resonance, two voltage gain modes are designed for the wide input application, and the mode transition strategy and parameter design method are given. To verify the theoretical analysis, a 48 W prototype with an operating frequency of 120/240 kHz, an input voltage of 43&#8211;160 V, and an output voltage of 24 V is fabricated, achieving a peak efficiency of 92.56%.</description></item><item><title>Energy-Based Full-State Feedback Linear Control for Modular Multilevel Converters With Improved Damping and Reduced Model Order</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11168171</link><description>Modular multilevel converters (MMCs) are widely utilized in high-power conversion applications. Typically, a cascaded proportional-integral (PI) control scheme is employed for the regulation of the MMC&#8217;s dc-bus voltage, which is based on a second-order system model. However, achieving an optimal balance between dynamic performance and disturbance rejection using such schemes poses significant challenges. Moreover, MMCs often exhibit substantial energy nonlinearity, especially at the high-voltage dc-bus, which further complicates their operation and control. To address these issues, this article introduces a full-state feedback control (FSFC) strategy specifically designed for MMCs. The proposed method involves constructing an energy-based model to linearize the dc voltage control process. By incorporating full-state variable feedback, the FSFC reduces equivalent system model order, thereby enhancing disturbance suppression and accelerating response times. The article also presents the block diagram of the FSFC, determining the state feedback gain that yields optimal damping characteristics. Comparative analysis of the cascaded PI control and the proposed FSFC is performed under identical crossover frequencies and phase margins. Simulation and experimental results confirm that the FSFC offers superior advantages in terms of dynamic response and stability compared with existing advanced control schemes.</description></item><item><title>A Constant Frequency ZVS Modulation Scheme for Four-Switch Buck-Boost Converter With Optimal ZVS Conditions Based on BP Neural Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11172735</link><description>The pseudocontinuous conduction mode (PCCM) four-switch buck-boost (FSBB) converter is widely used in applications with wide input and output voltage ranges. In this article, a constant frequency zero-voltage switching (ZVS) modulation scheme with minimized root mean square (rms) inductor current is proposed. The proposed constant frequency ZVS modulation scheme does not rely on data-heavy three-dimensional (3-D)/two-dimensional (2-D) look-up tables (LUTs) or require wide switching frequency variation. In addition, the accurate ZVS conditions of switches are derived through theoretical analysis, and approximated by using a back-propagation (BP) neural network, which allows simple and accurate calculation of ZVS conditions over wide operating ranges and facilitates the minimization of rms inductor current. Finally, a 300 W FSBB prototype is built to verify the proposed modulation scheme and the derived ZVS conditions.</description></item><item><title>Robust Power Decoupling Controller Design for Grid-Forming Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11169324</link><description>Unlike grid-following inverters (GFLIs) that serve as current sources, grid-forming inverters (GFMIs) act as voltage sources, capable of providing voltage support and inertia support to the power grid. By controlling the magnitude and angle of voltage, it is possible to achieve active ($\boldsymbol{P}$) and reactive ($\boldsymbol{Q}$) power transmission along the line. However, conventional algorithm such as virtual synchronous generator (VSG) exhibits coupling between$ \boldsymbol{P}$ and $\boldsymbol{Q}$ loops. To address this issue, this article first establishes dynamic models for active and reactive power, which indicate that coupling becomes severe when the grid impedance or the power angle increases. Subsequently, a hybrid control method based on active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) and H&#8734; control is proposed to decouple the $\boldsymbol{P}$ and $\boldsymbol{Q}$ loops in GFMIs. This strategy employs a data-driven H&#8734; controller as the inner loop for preliminary decoupling of the system, and uses ADRC control as the outer loop, with an extended state observer (ESO) to treat the undecoupled part as a disturbance for secondary decoupling of the system. As a result, the robustness of system decoupling is significantly enhanced. The decoupling performance of this controller has been verified through experiments, which demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of this method.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid-Modulated Moving-Discretized-Control-Set Model-Free Predictive Control for DAB Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11178065</link><description>When applying conventional moving-discretized-control-set model predictive control (MDCS-MPC), the voltage performance of dual-active-bridge (DAB) converter is affected by the number of the MDCS and the parameter errors. The former affects the dynamic performance of the MDCS-MPC, while the latter affects the robustness of the MDCS-MPC. To enhance the dynamic performance and robustness of conventional MDCS-MPC, this article proposes a hybrid-modulated moving-discretized-control-set model-free predictive control (HM-MDCS-MFPC) for DAB converters, where the proposed HM-MDCS-MFPC not only establishes and updates the data model of DAB for replacing the conventional mathematical model, but also designs a hybrid-modulated control set for boosting the regulation range of control set. The proposed HM-MDCS-MFPC effectively eliminates parametric effects under parametric fluctuation and enhances dynamic performance under various operating conditions. The simulations and experiments of DAB converter are conducted to validate the feasibility and performance of the proposed HM-MDCS-MFPC.</description></item><item><title>Observer-Based Passivity Control for DC/DC Power Converters With Constant Power Loads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11169322</link><description>DC microgrid is a new trend of future microgrid, which is expected to be more efficient than ac microgrid and more convenient to connect dc loads. Among various types of loads, the constant power load (CPL), which has negative impedance characteristic, can easily cause oscillations in dc microgrid, and may lead to grid collapse. This article proposes an observer-based passivity control scheme to solve the instability problem brought by CPL. A passivity-based controller (PBC) is designed to attenuate the oscillations caused by CPL by adopting the concept of energy dissipation. To improve the control performance, a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) is designed to estimate the value of CPL and compensate PBC in real-time. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed control scheme are verified through both simulations and experiments. The results show that, compared with existing methods, the proposed control scheme obtains better control performance and reduces computation burden.</description></item><item><title>Interpretable Wind Power Forecasting With Feature and Loss Function Construction Guided by Domain Knowledge</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11122909</link><description>Current wind power forecasting (WPF) methods predominantly rely on data-driven deep learning models, inherently lacking integration of domain knowledge, which limits forecasting accuracy and model interpretability. To address this issue, an interpretable data-knowledge fusion ultra-short-term WPF model is proposed, in which domain knowledge guides the feature construction process and is directly embedded into the design of the loss function. In the feature construction module, a wind speed-power curve is established to generate theoretical power outputs by using historical wind speed as inputs. These theoretical outputs, combined with historical measured data, serve as inputs for the model. In the loss function construction module, a boundary constraint loss is designed by extracting the upper and lower boundaries of wind power output using the alpha shape algorithm and Local Weighted Linear Regression based on wind speed and power data. Notably, the parameters of boundaries are dynamically updated to capture the volatility of wind power. Additionally, an error distribution shape loss is introduced to penalize the deviation of the training error distribution from the normal distribution, using Jensen-Shannon divergence as an indicator. Case studies across 30 wind farms demonstrate that the proposed method guided by interpretable knowledge achieves the best average performance across all time horizons compared to baseline models. The method also shows strong robustness in noise and missing data experiments.</description></item><item><title>Novel Unified Control Framework for Networked RES-BES Microgrids With Enhanced Performance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11120450</link><description>The increasing deployment of renewable energy sources (RESs) facilitates the interconnection of distributed energy networks, thereby maximizing the utilization of the unevenly distributed RESs. Networked hybrid ac/dc microgrids enable regional multi-terminal networks at end-user sites, offering plug-and-play integration for RESs and battery energy storage systems (BESs) through synergistic ac/dc complementarity. However, this interconnected configuration introduces increased complexity in control strategies and poses significant power management challenges for RES-BES microgrids, as sudden RES fluctuations demand system-wide BES compensation to prevent local overloads. This paper proposes a unified droop control-based framework for networked hybrid microgrids comprising RESs, BESs and loads. The proposed approach enables seamless transitions between operational modes, proportional power sharing, and enhanced operation without circulating currents or overstressing components. Furthermore, it inherently addresses abrupt source failures and asymmetric line faults without requiring adjustments in the primary control methods, ensuring uninterrupted maximum power harvest of RESs. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through case studies using real-time simulation platform Typhoon-HIL.</description></item><item><title>Time-Varying Inertia Characterization of DFIG-Based Wind Turbines for Power System Frequency Dynamic Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11113495</link><description>Accurately assessing the inertial response of renewable energy generation (REG) is critical for frequency stability. However, REG represented by doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbine (WT) exhibits inherent time-varying inertia behavior, fundamentally distinct from synchronous generators (SGs). Prevailing inertia assessment methods predominantly rely on SG-derived time-domain inertia constants, which cannot capture this intrinsic variability. Consequently, the rationality of directly applying these conventional methods to DFIG-based WT lacks theoretical justification. To address this gap, this paper derives an expression for calculating time-varying inertia using the angular momentum theorem. Results demonstrate that inertia in the time domain dynamically varies with disturbances, highlighting the significant limitations of conventional inertia descriptions. Alternatively, a frequency-domain inertia characterization method is investigated to provide a disturbance-independent description of inertia, effectively capturing its intrinsic time-varying nature. Due to the duality between time and frequency domains, this paper mathematically describes the relationship between frequency-domain inertia and time-domain inertia, explicitly clarifying the physical meaning of inertia in the frequency domain. Simulations on an IEEE 39-bus system verify that the frequency-domain inertia method accurately captures inertia dynamics and is suitable for frequency stability analysis. These findings emphasize frequency-domain inertia characterization as an essential method for representing inertia in renewable-rich power systems.</description></item><item><title>Wind Turbulence-Induced Power Fluctuations Mitigation in PMSG-Based Wind Turbines by a Coordinated Control Scheme</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11106269</link><description>Power fluctuations in large-scale wind turbines (WTs), induced by persistent wind turbulences, can degrade the reliability of power modules and increase mechanical stress on light-strength structural components. These issues entail intricate challenges for system operators in terms of operation and maintenance. This paper investigates specifications of power fluctuations in PMSG-based WTs and presents a control scheme advantageous both below and above the rated wind speed, without requiring additional energy storage devices. This work strives to bridge the gap between the complicated art of WT modeling and wind turbulence-induced power fluctuations aiming to reveal the origin of power fluctuations in terms of operating regions and control strategies. In the proposed control scheme, the power fluctuations are mitigated without any auxiliary control terms below the nominal wind speed. Above the nominal wind speed, the power smoothing action is performed via three items, in which the machine side converter (MSC) virtually regulates the rotor inertia, the grid side converter (GSC) exerts the damping component, and the pitch control system helps enhance the damping mechanism. The feedback gains of the auxiliary terms are optimized while considering their interactions. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed control scheme effectively mitigates both the electrical and mechanical oscillations.</description></item><item><title>Incorporating Frequency Security Constraints in Two-Stage Robust Unit Commitment of Integrated Transmission and Distribution System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11098731</link><description>With the integration of high-proportion renewable energies, the independent operation of the transmission and distribution systems (T&amp;amp;DSs) makes it difficult to achieve optimal scheduling and ensure frequency security. Therefore, this paper proposes a two-stage robust frequency-constrained unit commitment (TRO-FCUC) model of T&amp;amp;DS. Firstly, the impacts of distributed energy resources (DERs) frequency regulation capabilities on inertial response and primary frequency response (PFR) are considered, and dynamic frequency constraints considering the cooperation of thermal units, wind farms, and DERs with their inertia-based frequency reserve are constructed. Then, the TRO-FCUC model is formulated to address uncertainties of wind farms (WFs) and distributed photovoltaics (DPVs) based on uncertainty sets. Further, the column and constraint generation (C&amp;amp;CG) algorithm and strong duality theory are utilized to transform the TRO-FCUC model into a mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) model and then solve it iteratively. Finally, case analyses proposed demonstrate that the coordinated operation of T&amp;amp;DS can fully mobilize the frequency regulation potential of DERs and improve the operation&#8217;s economy while ensuring the frequency security of the system.</description></item><item><title>Novel Series-Isolated-Parallel Wind Farm DC Collection System With New Control Strategies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11105057</link><description>Offshore wind farm (WF) DC collection systems offer significant reductions in weight and size compared to conventional AC systems. Among DC architectures, the series-parallel wind farm (SP-WF) configuration achieves higher efficiency by reducing the number of power conversion stages. However, because SP-WF places the DC-DC converter upstream of the series connection of wind turbines (WTs), it suffers from reduced reliability due to its vulnerability to DC short-circuit faults within the series string. This paper proposes a novel series-isolated-parallel wind farm (SIP-WF) architecture that enhances reliability by integrating a DC-DC converter to isolate each group of series-connected WTs. This isolation provides intrinsic DC fault blocking capability without the need for external DC circuit breakers. Furthermore, as only passive rectifiers are used at each individual WT, the proposed SIP-WF architecture maintains high efficiency. To manage maximum power point tracking (MPPT) across turbines experiencing different wind conditions, two new centralized control strategies are proposed to coordinate multiple WTs using a single DC-DC converter per group. The proposed SIP-WF architecture and control strategies are validated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink. A comprehensive performance comparison is conducted against existing DC collection topologies. The results demonstrate that SIP-WF achieves a higher net energy yield while reducing cost, system weight, and volume, and offering superior fault tolerance compared to conventional architectures.</description></item><item><title>Fault Ride-Through Strategy for Grid-Forming Converters Satisfying Multi-Objective Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11091548</link><description>Transient synchronization stability (TSS), current limitation and reactive power support (RPS) are the key objectives for fault ride-through (FRT) that grid-forming converters (GFMCs) must satisfy. However, the complex coupling restraints among these objectives, along with the fact that GFMC cannot directly control current due to its voltage-source nature, present significant challenges for FRT. To address these issues, this paper first analyzes the coupling relationships among the three objectives, and reveals the formations and control mechanisms of phase current, reactive current, and fault inrush current in GFMC. Inspired these insights, an adaptive FRT strategy is designed by cooperatively adjusting the active power and voltage references, as well as the adaptive virtual resistance, which satisfies FRT multi-objective constraints even if the voltage sags to 0. And it is straightforward to implement. Furthermore, the proposed FRT strategy is shown to exhibit superior TSS and RPS performance, as demonstrated through region of attraction and voltage phase portraits. Finally, simulation and experiment results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed FRT strategy.</description></item><item><title>Transient Stability Analysis of MMC-HVDC Connected DFIG-Based Wind Farms in the Electromechanical Timescale</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11106276</link><description>This paper investigates the transient stability of doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind farms connected via a modular multilevel converter (MMC)-based high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission system in the electromechanical timescale. During faults, the MMC tends to be switched to the current-limiting mode, which further interacts with the control systems of DFIG-based wind farms, thereby complicating the transient stability problem. In this paper, a large-signal model is constructed for transient stability analysis under this condition. The transient stability mechanism is revealed, and a transient stability index that considers the impact of a phase-locked loop in the electromechanical timescale is derived. The proposed index quantitatively assesses the instability risk arising from the coupled interaction between the DFIG-based wind farms and the MMC. In addition, the impacts of the current- limiting mode and other parameters (i.e., speed control loop gains, rotor shaft damping, inertia coefficient and fault location and severity) are analyzed. Based on the results of the parametric analysis, a suite of targeted countermeasures is proposed to enhance the transient stability of the power system. Finally, a theoretical analysis is demonstrated and verified through hardware-in-the-loop simulations using the Modeling Tech microgrid real-time simulation platform.</description></item><item><title>A Quantitative Accommodation Guaranteed Robust Scheduling Method for Renewable Power System With Dynamic Uncertainty Set</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11090046</link><description>Wind power generation (WPG) has been increasingly integrated into power systems to reduce carbon emissions. However, its inherent volatility and stochasticity have significantly challenged the reliable system operation and effective accommodation. In this paper, a robust scheduling method with a quantitative accommodation guarantee for power systems with WPG integration is proposed. First, a dynamic uncertainty set (DUS) of WPG is introduced, and a stochastic accommodation rate (SAR) indicator is accordingly proposed and derived to quantify the attainable accommodation level. Based on the DUS, a robust scheduling method is proposed, in which the implicit affine strategy (IAS) is adapted to guarantee the nonanticipativity of scheduling strategies. Moreover, a SAR constraint is carefully built according to the assessment result of the power system&#8217;s maximal and minimal SAR and embedded into the scheduling model to provide a quantitative accommodation guarantee. An illustrative case is presented to validate the effectiveness of the SAR indicator. Numerical simulations in the modified 6-bus, 14-bus, and 118-bus power systems validate the superiority of the proposed scheduling method.</description></item><item><title>Current Control and DC Capacitor Dynamic Interaction in a Cross-Timescale Manner in DFIG-WT Dominated Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11088231</link><description>The Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) based wind turbine (WT) contains control loops and energy storage components operating across multiple timescales, leading to potential cross-timescale influence dynamics in DFIG-WT-dominated power systems. Previous analyses have primarily focused on single timescale dynamics or the interactions between control loops at different timescales, with limited attention given to the cross-timescale influences between control loops and energy storage components. This paper aims to reveal the cross-timescale influence mechanism of current control at the AC-current-control timescale on the dynamics of the DC capacitor at the DC-voltage-control timescale. Modal analysis is a mature method used to uncover the cross-timescale influence phenomena and laws of current control on the dynamics of the DC capacitor. Subsequently, an equivalent circuit model is established to analyze the mechanism by which current control affects the dynamics of the DC capacitor. Finally, the conclusions are validated through simulations based on a four-machine two-area power system and the power grid of Northwest China.</description></item><item><title>Rapid Active Power Regulation of Distributed Photovoltaics Based on Optimal Dynamic Droop Coefficients</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11095309</link><description>To realize the active response for rapid active power regulation of massive distributed photovoltaics (DPVs), a bi-level architecture integrating clustering and optimization is proposed for the coordinated design of dynamic droop coefficients of DPVs in this paper.

Model predictive control (MPC) is the mainstream EMS for HESSs, as it typically yields a control solution close to the global optimum while satisfying constraints. However, MPC faces a high computational burden when the optimal control problem is nonlinear. More importantly, considering multiple competing objectives, tuning weighting factors (WFs) in the MPC cost function is also challenging. To tackle these challenges, this article proposes a learning-augmented MPC strategy to optimize energy management for the HESS in WECs. The strategy first utilizes a fuzzy logic-based asymmetric action trimming technique to reduce MPC computational time. Further, a warm-start Q-learning (QL) framework with high learning efficiency is applied to obtain the WF online tuning method. To bridge the simulation-to-reality gap in the QL framework, the article designs a neural network-based current predictor, aiming to sense the nonlinear power loss during power conversion. Finally, simulations and experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed strategy in reducing energy loss, battery degradation, and MPC computational burden.</description></item><item><title>Spatio-Temporal Probabilistic Forecasting of Wind Speed Using Transformer-Based Diffusion Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11091547</link><description>Spatio-temporal wind speed forecasting plays a crucial role in enhancing energy conversion efficiency and optimizing resource allocation, forming a cornerstone of sustainable development. However, existing methods for spatio-temporal wind speed forecasting face challenges in capturing intricate spatio-temporal dependencies and adapting to dynamic variations in wind speed data. To address these limitations, we propose the Probabilistic Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Transformer (PSTDT), a novel model that combines the generative power of denoising diffusion probabilistic models with the robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities of Transformers. This approach introduces a dual-spatial attention module to model static positional relationships and dynamic dependencies from historical data, thereby capturing evolving spatial correlations. Additionally, PSTDT integrates a dual-phase temporal module for modeling cross-period temporal dependencies alongside auto-regressive temporal features, enhancing its capacity to address the complexities of time-series forecasting. Furthermore, a temporal-adaptive layer normalization is incorporated to dynamically adjust normalization parameters, improving the model&#8217;s forecast accuracy and stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PSTDT outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, reducing continuous ranked probability score by 8% &#8211;20% and mean absolute error by 7% &#8211;19% .</description></item><item><title>End-to-End Collaborative Optimization for Active Distribution Network Power Dispatch Based on Sparse Model-Ensemble Learning Policy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119768</link><description>With the higher penetration of distributed renewable power sources, novel active distribution networks are increasingly implementing flexible adjustment strategies. Currently, the dual uncertainties from both sources and demand significantly affect power dispatch in distribution networks. Typically, power dispatch is performed using a predict-then-optimize approach, making it challenging to quantify the gap between the real-time and theoretically optimal dispatch performances due to inaccuracies in power predictions. Hence, this study introduces a novel end-to-end policy to solve a collaborative optimization between prediction and dispatch. The policy directly utilizes all available information, such as gridded numerical weather forecasts, for dispatch decision-making, which eliminates the need for power predictions as intermediate variables for dispatch. To address the challenges of high-dimensional and open-scenario model training in end-to-end policies, sparse model-ensemble learning is proposed to formulate the dispatch policy model. The model is solved using constrained policy optimization. Comparative studies show that the proposed end-to-end policy outperforms the predict-then-optimize policy in real-time dispatch cases involving photovoltaic reactive power ancillary service and demand response within distribution networks.</description></item><item><title>LPV Model Predictive Control for Offshore Wind Farms Considering Wake Delay Characteristics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11082107</link><description>The pronounced wake effect in large-scale offshore wind farm necessitates careful consideration of its delay characteristics, which are crucial yet often overlooked in control. Addressing the coupling between the dynamic evolution of wake effects and the parameter changes of the WT control model, this paper introduces a Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) model predictive control method that considers wake delay characteristics. Through the development of a quasi-steady state wake model, the wake delay characteristic is incorporated within an LPV model for the wind farm. A two-stage dimensionality reduction method is proposed to simplify the calculation, and a model predictive control (MPC) method is combined to optimize the fatigue damage balance and power generation enhancement in the wind farm coordinately. Simulation results from a wind farm consisting of 16 wind turbines validate the efficacy of the quasi-steady state wake model in depicting the spatial distribution of wake delays. Furthermore, in dynamically varying wind speed and directions scenarios, the proposed control method can effectively capture the wind speed delay and fluctuation characteristics between different wind turbines, leading to heightening power output and diminishing fatigue stresses. Notably, in comparison to the static model control, the adaptive parameter tuning mechanism inherent in the proposed method effectively curtails control overshoot, enhancing overall system performance.</description></item><item><title>Fast Frequency Response in Low Inertia Grids via Integrated Supercapacitor Energy Storage Systems and Wind Turbine Generators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11082652</link><description>The increasing penetration of inverter-based resources in modern power systems has led to a significant reduction in system inertia, creating challenges for maintaining grid frequency stability. To address these issues, a new ancillary service market, termed &#8220;Fast Frequency Response (FFR)&#8221;, has emerged. FFR mandates rapid power delivery from renewable energy sources,including wind power systems, immediately following contingency events to alleviate frequency drops in a few seconds. This paper presents a control method combining supercapacitor energy storage systems and wind turbine generators to enhance the FFR capabilities of wind power systems and mitigate the frequency drop. This approach ensures the readiness of supercapacitor energy storage systems to provide FFR services under diverse wind conditions. Additionally, a control scheme for the wind turbine generator is developed to optimize its participation in FFR across a range of wind speeds while maintaining a stable operation of the wind power system. The results demonstrate that, while preserving an equivalent investment cost to that of supercapacitor banks, wind power systems can significantly increase their FFR contributions. This improvement effectively addresses critical frequency stability challenges in low-inertia grids. Eventually, the proposed method is validated through real-time experiments on a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) setup.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Evolution and Stability Analysis of GFM-Based Renewable Energy Resources Considering Repeated &amp; Continuous Current Saturation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11079878</link><description>The current saturation (CS) strategy of grid-forming renewable energy sources (GFM-RESs) is designed to protect the device from overcurrent damages. However, the potential switching processes of control strategies trigger new stability issues. It is revealed that two emerging stability issues, i.e., repeated current saturation (R-CS) and continuous current saturation (C-CS) governed by the inherent inconsistency of switching conditions, will occur when the system operates into the corresponding virtual power angle (VPA) region. This paper adopts the hybrid system theory to analyze such stability issues by deriving the necessary and sufficient switching conditions of current saturation and desaturation. During R-CS, the GFM-RES externally behaves as an abnormal current source, triggering adverse high-frequency oscillations. When subject to C-CS, the system will suffer from persistent overvoltage issues and cannot return to its initial operating point. To identify the stability risks of these two issues and offer guidance for GFM-RES&#8217;s controller design, a novel R&amp;amp;C-CS criterion, along with a generic desaturation region-based (DRB) principle, is proposed. Meanwhile, a switching condition and dynamic characteristic decoupling control (S&amp;amp;D-DC) is developed based on the DRB principle to prevent the R&amp;amp;C-CS issues. High-fidelity electromagnetic transient simulations conducted on both single-machine and multi-machine systems validate the theoretical derivations and proposed control strategy.</description></item><item><title>Interpretable Augmented Ambiguity Set for Quantifying Regional Wind Power Uncertainty in Distributionally Robust Optimal Dispatch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11082100</link><description>A large-scale grid penetration of wind power has posed severe uncertainty challenges for power system operation. This paper comes up with an interpretable augmented ambiguity set assisted by deep learning for two-stage economic dispatch formulated in a distributionally robust optimization, aiming at precisely representing regional wind power uncertainty. The specifically designed augmented ambiguity set is driven by both the fine-grained uncertainty model of each wind farm and interactive dependencies among different sites. In particular, a multi-teacher knowledge distillation-time generative adversarial network (MKD-time GAN) is presented for the first time to form a spherical ambiguity set gathering all possible distributions for power prediction error of single wind farm. This model leverages a cascaded learning framework by typical teacher-time GANs to jointly educate one general student-time GAN so as to induce a family of comprehensive reference distributions as an ambiguity set. Further, multiple ambiguity sets are mapped into augmented ambiguity set, an interdependent joint probability distribution space for regional prediction error by Nataf transformation. Based on that, a tractable solution algorithm of two-stage optimal dispatch is explicitly derived and saves computation scale. The benefits of both novel MKD-time GAN and decision-making dispatch schemes are demonstrated in IEEE 118-bus systems.</description></item><item><title>Tri-layer Distributed Scheduling for Coastal Integrated Transmission-Distribution-Gas System With Uncertain Typhoons-Affected Offshore Wind Power</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11075623</link><description>This paper addresses the scheduling challenges associated with offshore wind power within coastal power systems during uncertain typhoons. The proposed tri-layer chance-constrained coordinated scheduling model differs from existing formulations through two major innovations. First, unlike the deterministic scheduling under forecasted typhoons, it implements a scenario-based stochastic programming to address the wind power deviations resulting from the typhoon uncertainties, while additionally factoring in the potential damage to wind turbines. Second, moving beyond the isolated scheduling of thermal units in the transmission network, the proposed model enables a distributed coordination of diverse flexible resources across the distribution and gas networks to mitigate typhoon damage, resulting in a more complex tri-layer scheduling framework. These advancements introduce marked challenges for model solution. To handle this, a mix-sample average approximation method is introduced to reformulate the original random variables involved model into a tractable linear form. Moreover, a novel efficient distributed solution methodology is proposed to tackle the specific nested interactions within the tri-layer scheduling framework. Case studies verify the economic and reliability advantages of the proposed model, with 20.2% average cost saving and over 90% decrease in imbalanced power, as well as the computational superiority of the proposed distributed solution for significantly reduced solution time.</description></item><item><title>A Two-Stage Ultra-Short-Term Wind Power Forecasting Method Based on Transitional Weather Identification and Meteorological Prediction Error Propagation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11078806</link><description>Accurate and reliable wind power forecasting is crucial for the safe and economical operation of power systems. However, under transitional weather conditions, the forecasting errors of meteorological variables such as wind speed tend to increase, introducing significant input noise into wind power prediction models and reducing their reliability. To address this, this paper focuses on analyzing the error propagation mechanism of meteorological input variables and proposes a strategy to improve short-term wind power forecasting accuracy under transitional weather conditions. First, transitional weather periods are identified by analyzing the fluctuation characteristics of multi-dimensional meteorological variables. Then, a two-stage model combining Sparse Variational Gaussian Process (SVGP) and Noisy Input Gaussian Process (NIGP) is proposed. In this model, noisy input data (wind speed predictions) are decomposed into true data (actual wind speed) and noise data (forecast errors), which are modeled independently. By considering the propagation process of input noise in wind power forecasting and making necessary corrections, the SVGP-NIGP model provides more accurate deterministic forecasts and higher-quality interval predictions. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly enhances wind power forecasting accuracy under transitional weather conditions, offering an effective solution to address the uncertainties arising from meteorological forecasting.</description></item><item><title>Self-Optimizing Local Voltage Control of SOP in Active Distribution Networks Based on Lift-Dimension Mapping Linearization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11072306</link><description>The high penetration of distributed generators (DGs) deteriorates the voltage violations in active distribution networks (ADNs). Owing to the flexible adjustment capacity, the local power regulation provided by soft open point (SOP) presents a promising solution for eliminating voltage violations in ADNs. A data-driven local control method can fully excavate the potential logic from operational data without requiring precious network parameters. However, the training data may be insufficient in practical applications. In this paper, a self-optimizing local voltage control method for SOP is proposed to achieve adaptive control in label-poor conditions. First, a SOP local control model is constructed based on lift-dimension mapping linearization (LDML), which portrays the complex relationship between ADN states and SOP control strategies. Subsequently, a self-optimizing guidance mechanism is established to obtain the label data of SOP control strategy, which provides a large number of training samples for the local control model. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using a practical distribution network with a four-terminal SOP. Results demonstrate that efficient control strategies can be determined based on local state measurements. A rapid response to DG fluctuations can be achieved while enhancing the adaptability to variations in practical operations.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Optimized Parameter Tuning Algorithm for Wind Turbine Grid-Forming Control to Mitigate Power Oscillations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11068198</link><description>As the transition from synchronous generators (SGs) to renewable energy sources (RESs) accelerates, grid forming wind turbines (GFM-WTs) are increasingly expected to play a critical role in maintaining power system stability. However, the integration of GFM without thoroughly considering the interaction between the outer and inner control loops can induce power oscillations. Therefore, this paper offers a systematic sensitivity analysis to explicitly reveal how the control parameters contribute to power oscillations in the GFM-WT system. This analysis is based on a linearized state-space model for the GFM-WT system, incorporating comprehensive system dynamics and control strategies. Furthermore, an optimized control algorithm is developed based on a comprehensive small-signal model, incorporating essential constraints such as the eigenvalue damping ratio and the control loop bandwidth. The algorithm autonomously tunes the control parameters of both the inner and outer loop systems, resulting in optimal parameter values. A comprehensive stability analysis was conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in ensuring system stability. The proposed method is verified through various scenario in modified WSCC 9-bus and New England 39-bus systems. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm effectively mitigates power oscillations in the WT output, subsequently reducing power oscillations in the SG.</description></item><item><title>Deterministic and Probabilistic Forecasting of Wind Power Generation and Ramp Rate With Expectation-Implemented Deep Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11068153</link><description>Accurate day-ahead forecasting of wind power generation, both deterministically and probabilistically, is crucial for reliable and efficient power system operations, and its significance will increase in renewable energy-dominant power systems. Furthermore, inherent variability of wind farms necessitates day-ahead ramp rate forecasting to ensure stable energy balancing. To address these needs, we propose an hourly day-ahead forecasting framework that concurrently predicts the wind power generation and ramp rate. This framework leverages expectation-implemented deep learning models trained by the custom loss functions tailored to the different signal attributes and our distinct expectations. Additional strategies, such as feature generation and a feedforward error learning model, are implemented to enhance forecasting performance while maintaining a balance between tasks. Finally, our framework integrates heterogeneous generation and ramp rate forecasting results, incorporating probabilistic ramp rate forecasting derived from the synthesized output. We validate our approach using real wind power data and assess the impact of each proposed method individually. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly contribute to identifying the intrinsic volatility of wind power, thereby fully exploiting its potential benefits.</description></item><item><title>Optimal BESS Management for Peak Load Shaving and Battery Health Under Prediction Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11071638</link><description>In modern power grids, integrating renewable energy sources (RESs), deploying battery energy storage systems (BESSs) is increasingly vital for mitigating power fluctuations. However, optimizing BESS operation remains challenging amidst uncertainties in both RES and load forecasting. This paper proposes a novel stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) framework for BESS operation, focusing on peak load shaving and battery health while addressing prediction uncertainties. The proposed framework employs a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network for forecasting and integrates a constraint-tightening technique into a stochastic optimization (SO) problem with a receding horizon. Based on the load profile of a company in Germany, the proposed framework achieves an additional reduction of 99 kW (5.8%) in peak grid take-out power compared with the traditional model predictive control (MPC) approach, demonstrating its advantage in addressing uncertainties.</description></item><item><title>PMU-Based Power Oscillation Damping Control for Renewable Energy System With Communication Disruption and Multi-Time Delays</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11071336</link><description>This paper presents a novel model-free power oscillation damping strategy for renewable energy (RE) system considering communication disruption and multiple time delays in control loops. First, a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process-enabled online estimation method is developed for state-space modeling estimation only using measurement data. This estimation method is applicable to systems with different delays in each wide-area control loop. Subsequently, a novel wide-area power oscillation damper (POD) is designed for the renewable energy sources (RESs) and that is further reconstructed in a decomposition manner to achieve independently sub-control, which allows to retain better damping performance under communication disruption. After that, the POD parameter settings are carefully tuned, where the time delay and estimation error are considered, formulated as stability constraints using Razumikhin theorem, and solved via linear matrix inequality (LMI), yielding multi-dimensional robustness of the system, including operating conditions, time delay and communication disruption. Case studies in the improved 4-machine 2-area system and IEEE 39-bus system show that the proposed method can accurately estimate the state-space modeling of closed-loop system and effectively dampen power oscillations in time delay and communication disruption scenarios.</description></item><item><title>A Unified Method for Assessing Frequency Support Capability of Diverse Renewable Power Generation Units</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11061796</link><description>The proliferation of renewable power generation units (RGUs) deteriorates the physical inertia of the system, making the evaluation of unit-level frequency support capability (FSC) and system-level frequency stability increasingly important. However, the prior-art approaches lack a standardized framework for FSC assessment, and the non-disclosure of RGU information by manufacturers exacerbates this challenge. To address these issues, this paper proposes a unified transfer function structure (UTFS) model and its parameter solving method based on impedance measurement, enabling a unified assessment of both the unit-level FSC and system-level frequency stability. The unit-level UTFS can be obtained through frequency-domain approaches, e.g., xy-impedance measurements. Moreover, the system-level UTFS can be acquired through the simple aggregation of unit-level UTFS. Without detailed models or post-event data, the proposed framework uniformly represents the FSC of various RGUs through three key indicators: effective inertia, damping, and primary frequency regulation (PFR). Furthermore, the proposed method analytically derives system frequency indicators: frequency nadir, rate of change of frequency (RoCoF), and steady-state frequency deviation. Numerical simulations and analysis of the operational data of a provincial power grid are provided to validate the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Timescale Operational Optimization for Mobile Charging Solutions Considering Voltage Regulation Support for ADN: A Two-Stage Coordination Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11051060</link><description>To alleviate the pressure of traditional fixed charging methods, mobile charging solutions have emerged in recent years. This article presents a two-stage coordination approach for mobile charging robots (MCRs) and active distribution networks (ADN). In the first stage, we maximize the total revenue for the MCRs from providing charging services for electric vehicles (EVs) and interacting with the ADN within a frame-based time scale, where the duration of each frame is determined by the charging decisions of MCRs. Furthermore, we consider the long-term objectives of meeting the battery energy deficit constraint for each MCR, thereby improving their battery life. Lyapunov optimization is utilized to transform frame-based scheduling into an optimization problem within a specified time slot, simplifying the process of solving the optimization problem. To avoid affecting charging efficiency when MCRs interact with the power grid, we use the reactive power of free MCRs to provide voltage regulation support for the ADN, improving power quality and minimizing total network loss simultaneously. Decoupling active and reactive power in two stages ensures both the profitability of the MCRs cluster and the voltage security of the ADN, resulting in a win-win situation. The simulation results, based on the 18-bus and 51-bus distribution networks, confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Assessing Grid Penalized Reinforcement Learning for Renewable Energy Management of Power-to-X Integrated With Intermediate Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11051013</link><description>This research explores the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based planning strategies of power-to-X (PtX) systems under uncertainties of renewable and price through a detailed case study and comparative analysis of system planning. A DRL-based hourly planning model is proposed to minimize operational costs for a PtX system, incorporating a hybrid energy storage system. The model employs a grid-penalized reward function to manage grid power usage while accounting for temporal uncertainties in renewable and grid prices. To analyze the DRL model&#8217;s planning strategies, it is compared to a general rule-based model across varying spatial and temporal uncertainties using real-world data from national (France) areas. The results show that the DRL-based planning approach consistently outperforms the rule-based model, achieving 1,360.12% higher monthly profits in the national area, though with a relatively lower renewable energy penetration (REP). However, sensitivity analysis reveals that increasing the grid penalty level effectively reduces the gap in REP while sustaining higher profitability. This comparative analysis is the first to quantitatively reveal the planning strategies of a DRL-based PtX system, highlighting its effectiveness in reducing grid power overuse while maintaining higher profitability in system planning.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Proximal Policy Optimization With Embedded Dual Rules for Power Systems Considering Wind and Photovoltaic Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11059762</link><description>Most renewable energy power systems are created to provide more resilient, reliable, economical, sustainable and secure power support services for loads. However, owing to the inherent forecasting errors of wind and photovoltaic (PV) power, existing optimal dispatch decisions based on forecasting errors have biases. To address this issue, this paper proposes the distributed proximal policy optimization (DPPO) model with embedded dual rules for optimal power dispatch that considers wind and PV power forecasting error correction. The proposed model embeds forecasting and error correction information into the DPPO state space. Moreover, considering the physical characteristics and operational security constraints of the power grid, power balance and flow constraints are embedded in the DPPO network in a regular form. Finally, by integrating the established rules, wind and PV forecasting, and error correction information, the proposed model achieves optimal dispatch decisions through the calculation of state and execution of prescribed actions. The proposed method is applied and tested on a modified IEEE-30 bus system using actual data from a provincial power grid. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively addresses optimal dispatch decisions caused by wind and PV forecasting errors. Compared with three other advanced methods, the proposed approach has significant advantages in promoting wind power accommodation, reducing operating costs, and enhancing the adaptability of optimal dispatch to uncertainty.</description></item><item><title>An End-to-End Ensemble Learning Approach for Enhancing Wind Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11048619</link><description>Accurate wind power forecasts are crucial for grid stability, thereby ensuring a reliable and efficient power supply. To characterize the complicated fluctuation of wind power, numerous ensemble models with multiple base forecasters have been developed. However, most existing ensemble forecasting models contain several modeling stages, which increases the risk of error accumulation and inefficiency in model training. Moreover, the limited number of base forecasters results in forecasts with reduced diversity, thereby diminishing the performance of ensemble models. To address these challenges, MG-DS, a simple but efficient end-to-end ensemble learning model based on the Dempster-Shafer (DS) evidence theory, is proposed to unify base model learning and ensemble learning into a single process. It comprises an all-MLP-based nonlinear feature extraction module, a GRU and cross attention-based base forecast generation module, and a DS-based self-ensemble forecasting module with a DS-based magnifying glass to enhance the diversity of base forecasts. Further, a DS-based self-ensemble (DSSE) plugin is proposed to integrate the trained RNN-type and non-RNN-type base forecasters. Experiments on five wind power datasets show that MG-DS outperforms popular wind power forecasting models and ensemble techniques, and the effectiveness of the DSSE plugin is also validated in enhancing the performance of ensemble wind power forecasting.</description></item><item><title>A Fully Distributed Incentive Mechanism for Integrated Electricity and Heat Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045415</link><description>Coordination between electric power systems (EPS) and district heating systems (DHS) integrates more renewable energy and improves economic benefits.

Specifically, the combined heat and power dispatch (CHPD) model is transformed into a monotone variational inequality (MVI) and solved by a fully distributed predictor-corrector algorithm (FDPCA). With FDPCA, the EPS and DHS operators can dispatch independently. Additionally, we use a novel two-stage benefit allocation approach based on Nash bargaining to distribute profits while simplifying computational complexity. Case studies demonstrate that the fully distributed incentive mechanism effectively protects privacy, enhances efficiency, and promotes cooperation.</description></item><item><title>Adaptable Parameters Estimation for Microgrid Distributed Energy Resources Using Modified Physics-Informed Neural Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045087</link><description>Parameters estimation in microgrids remains challenging due to ambiguous system dynamics brought by distributed energy resources (DERs) and scarcity of data. This study presents a modified physics-informed neural network (PINN) paradigmdesigned for parameters estimation under such constraints.

We evaluate the proposed method by using an error margin below 5% as a key metric to confirm its robustness and accuracy for different types of DERs. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed method across varying ordinary differential equations to diverse mathematical models. Additionally, suboptimal and failed cases are analyzed and discussed to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the method&#8217;s limitations.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Fractional Programming-Based Planning Model for 100% Renewable Poly-Generation of Electricity and Methanol</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045219</link><description>Engaging in long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with renewable energy producers (REPs) is a promising strategy for decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors, such as internet data centers. However, due to the inherent volatility and intermittency of renewable energy sources (RES), REPs typically require substantial over-installation of capacity to meet fixed PPA delivery commitments, resulting in significant energy curtailment and increased supply costs. Power-to-methanol (P2M) offers a viable pathway for large-scale integration of RES by providing flexible chemical storage and demand. This study proposes a unified planning framework for the 100% renewable poly-generation of electricity and methanol, considering both flexible and inflexible loads. The objective is to maximize the internal rate of return (IRR), a key metric for investment decision-making. To this end, a mixed-integer linear fractional programming (MILFP) model is developed and solved in a computationally tractable manner. The model is validated using real-world data. Results show that the proposed approach significantly improves IRR, reduces RES curtailment, and lowers the levelized costs of both electricity and methanol. Furthermore, the model effectively coordinates electricity delivery under PPA constraints with methanol synthesis, offering an economically robust solution for renewable energy utilization and sector coupling.</description></item><item><title>Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning Method for Volt/Var Control in Active Distribution Network With Safe Operation Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045109</link><description>In recent years, distributed energy resources (DERs) in power systems have been increasingly integrated into the distribution network. DERs will improve the flexibility and economy of active distribution networks (ADNs) while introducing increased complexity and challenges in maintaining stable and efficient system operations. The traditional voltage regulation methods struggle to cope with these complexities, highlighting the need for more advanced and adaptive control strategies for fast-response PVs and battery energy storage systems (BESS). This paper proposes a novel Human-in-the-loop deep reinforcement learning (HITL-DRL) framework for Volt/Var control in ADNs, addressing the limitations of the existing approaches by integrating human experience and knowledge into the learning process. Additionally, a Security-Clipped Proximal Policy Optimization (SC-PPO) algorithm is introduced to ensure safe operation during reinforcement learning. The paper explores three human-intervention strategies: human demonstration, human feedback, and setting adversary, which enhance the learning process by leveraging expert knowledge and experience. The proposed HITL-DRL framework demonstrates improved convergence speed, robustness, reduced exploration risk, and increased interpretability and trust, paving the way for more effective voltage regulation in complex power systems. The proposed HITL-DRL method is verified in the IEEE 33-bus system, demonstrating superior performance over standard DRL algorithms in terms of training speed and robustness, achieving the highest average reward and the second-fastest computational time. Compared to traditional PPO, our method significantly excels in managing unforeseen contingencies, resulting in a lower voltage violation rate of 73.4%. Compared with the model-based method, the strategy of HITL-DRL is very close to that of optimization results in terms of energy loss and voltage violation rates. However, HITL-DRL shows advantages in decision-making time, responding within 1 millisecond, which is capable of rapidly adapting to time-vary changes in ADNs.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Flexibility Aggregation of Heterogeneous Demand-Side Energy Storages for Secondary Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11044873</link><description>Demand-side energy storages (DESs), such as household batteries and electric vehicles (EVs), have shown great potential in providing fast frequency regulation services. This paper proposes a three-layer hierarchical flexibility aggregation framework to fully evaluate and reliably realize the aggregate flexibility of heterogeneous DESs for secondary frequency regulation (SFR). At the device layer, the regulation capacity of an individual DES is modeled as a two-dimensional feasible region, with the real-time state-of-charge (SoC) constraint and the statistical features of regulation signals well considered. On this basis, heterogeneous DESs are divided into several clusters according to the geometry of their feasible region. At the cluster layer, regulation capacity, dynamic response model as well as regulation costs are efficiently aggregated within each DES cluster by prototype-based maximum inner approximation (MIA). At the aggregator layer, an analytical expression of the multi-cluster coordinated SFR flexibility can be formulated by convex optimizations at each feasible operating point, which provides a comprehensive model for DES aggregators to economically participate in SFR. Comparative simulations validate that the proposed method can accurately capture the aggregate SFR flexibility of heterogeneous DESs with lower flexibility loss and affordable computational burden, while the disaggregation feasibility of aggregate flexibility is further demonstrated using real-world regulation signals.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Autonomous Control for Global Economic Operation of AC/DC Microgrid Clusters Interconnected by Flexible DC Distribution Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045308</link><description>This paper presents a distributed autonomous control strategy for AC/DC microgrid clusters interconnected by the flexible DC distribution network to simultaneously achieve the global economic operation and frequency/voltage control of the system while complying with the power limits of DGs and interlinking converters.

Mobile wind turbines (MWTs) are uniquely positioned to navigate transportation systems, being towed by trucks, and supply energy to power distribution systems (PDSs). This flexibility enables MWTs to serve as emergency power sources, thereby contributing to enhancing the system resilience by facilitating service restoration following extreme events. This paper presents a novel framework based on Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) to dispatch MWTs for service restoration. Deep Q-learning (DQL) and Double Deep Q-learning (DDQL) approaches are implemented within the agent for training and comparison purposes. Additionally, an action limitation is incorporated into the proposed framework in order to mitigate the influence of wind power fluctuations. Case studies conducted on an integrated power-transport system, comprising a Sioux Falls transportation system and four IEEE 33-bus test systems, illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed restoration scheduling policy in enhancing PDSs&#8217; resilience against disasters.</description></item><item><title>Robust Unit Commitment With Multi-State Uncertainty: A Novel Formulation and Scalable Solution Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045107</link><description>To mitigate the conservatism of scheduling schemes derived from the two-stage robust unit commitment model (TS-RUCM), this paper proposes a novel multi-state uncertainty set (MSUS) considering the uncertain wind power output (WPO). The MSUS formulates WPO uncertainties with higher resolution by introducing multiple discrete state values within the uncertain interval. Additionally, the MSUS limits extreme fluctuations of WPO uncertainties among state values through transition indicators embedded in multiple transition constraints. The state values and transition indicators are calculated using the conditional quantile regression technique and Markov chain analysis. This systematic and scientific approach allows the MSUS to effectively exclude low-probability WPO scenarios, thereby significantly mitigating the conservatism of the scheduling schemes. Moreover, to accelerate the computation of the TS-RUCM based on the MSUS, this paper proposes an improved inexact column and constraint generation (II-C&amp;amp;CG) method. The II-C&amp;amp;CG method employs an adaptive tolerance strategy and refined backtracking to solve master and subproblems inexactly while ensuring finite convergence, significantly reducing computational time. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of both the MSUS and the II-C&amp;amp;CG method.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Artificial Intelligence and Physics-Based Modeling for Long-Term Cascaded Hydropower Scheduling Under Extreme Heat Events</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11059276</link><description>The operation of hydropower plants are significantly challenged by extreme heatwave events. This paper integrates artificial intelligence and a physics-based model to introduce an efficient long-term scheduling framework aimed at maximizing hydropower generation during extreme heat events. The water values derived from the proposed long-term scheduling model can be used in developing effective strategies for short-term hydropower scheduling. A physics-based evaporation model (PEM), which captures key land-atmosphere interactions, is developed to account for significant variations in reservoir evaporation rates during extreme heat events. A multivariate long short-term memory (M-LSTM) forecasting model is also utilized to predict the key input parameters required for both the PEM and the long-term scheduling problem. A regression-based machine learning algorithm is also utilized to estimate the hydropower production function, which enables linear integration of the nonlinear and nonconvex behavior of hydropower plant in the mixed-integer linear formulation of the scheduling problem. The proposed model is applied to a case study of eleven cascaded hydropower units located on the Columbia river. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed long-term scheduling model effectively manages reservoir operations, mitigating the adverse impacts of extreme heat events on hydropower generation and operator profitability.</description></item><item><title>Chance-Constrained Optimization for VPPs With Base Stations Considering Diverse Communication Rate Requirements</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11082584</link><description>5G Base Stations (BSs) consume a large amount of electricity, requiring predominantly green power, which brings huge pressure on their electricity costs. To reduce energy costs and carbon emissions, aggregating 5G BSs (Macro BS and Micro BS), and distributed renewable energy into virtual power plants (VPPs) to participate in market transactions has become a trend. However, the operation of VPPs faces challenges: the uncertainty of renewable energy output and the unclear regulation mechanism of BSs. Consequently, this paper focuses on developing an optimal scheduling strategy for VPPs, considering the schedulability of BSs and the uncertainty of internal renewable energy. Firstly, the flexibility of BSs with 4G and 5G modules is investigated, particularly in terms of transceivers and backup energy storage. The communication rates of BSs are modeled to evaluate the impact of active transceiver numbers on user experience. A dynamic time-domain model of backup energy storage capacity considering communication load is proposed. The impact of user mobility and overlapping coverage areas of BSs on communication rates is considered to be more in line with real-world scenarios. Subsequently, an optimization model is developed for VPPs to maximize the profit of engaging BSs in the day-ahead market transaction, considering diverse communication rate requirements. The optimization model determines the schedule of transceivers, backup energy storage, and other resources. Then, to control the operational risks associated with the uncertainty of internal distributed renewable energy outputs, the chance constraint is introduced. Furthermore, the Taylor expansion-based algorithm is applied to coordinately solve the VPP dispatching problem. Numerical simulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed models, which achieve a 5.4% increase in the proportion of internal renewable energy consumption and a 18.72% increase in economic benefits.</description></item><item><title>Synthetic Inertia Control for a Wind Turbine Generator Based on Event Size and Rotor Speed</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045832</link><description>To enhance the frequency nadir without causing the excessive deceleration of the rotor speed (${{{{\omega }}}_{{r}}}$), synthetic inertia control (SIC) schemes of a wind turbine generator (WTG) need to provide incremental power in response to event magnitude and ${{{{\omega }}}_{{r}}}$. Conventional stepwise SIC approaches face limitations during large events due to the increase of predefined incremental power, which does not match the actual event size. This paper presents an SIC strategy for WTGs that adjusts incremental power in relation to event size and ${{{{\omega }}}_{{r}}}$. During the frequency-support phase, the incremental power is modulated based on the frequency deviation, along with a control gain proportional to ${{{{\omega }}}_{{r}}}$, rather than the rate of change of frequency. While this approach accounts for the power imbalance, it remains vulnerable to noise and delays in practical applications. After the frequency-support phase, the proposed method decreases the active power reference in accordance with ${{{{\omega }}}_{{r}}}$, ensuring it stabilizes within a secure operating range. Following stabilization, the WTG transitions smoothly back to maximum power point tracking operation. Simulation results indicate that the proposed approach significantly enhances the frequency nadir during large events, even under low wind conditions, while avoiding excessive deceleration of the rotor speed.</description></item><item><title>Prototype Federated Reinforcement Learning for Voltage Regulation in Distribution Systems With Physics-Aware Spatial-Temporal Graph Perception</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045127</link><description>Online voltage regulation in active distribution systems faces challenges stemming from privacy protection concerns and uncertainties introduced by renewable energy sources. To address these issues, a novel spatial-temporal transformer-based prototype federated reinforcement learning (STT-PFRL) model is proposed to mitigate voltage deviations while ensuring data privacy. Specifically, STT-PFRL operating within a decentralized framework trains the model by transmitting local prototype information between a central data server and local agents, avoiding raw data privacy leakage. Besides, a novel physics-aware spatial-temporal transformer network is proposed to improve the voltage regulation policy learning stability against uncertainties by embedding the spatial-temporal graphical physics information into the data aggregation process. Furthermore, the prototype learning-based federated soft actor-critic (ProtoFedSAC) algorithm incorporates a prototype layer to utilize diverse feature representations, thereby enhancing the model&#8217;s ability to handle heterogeneity in environmental data. Simulation results on 33- and 118-node distribution systems demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of STT-PFRL in voltage regulation.</description></item><item><title>County-Level Distributed PV Day-Ahead Power Prediction Based on Grey Correlation Analysis and Transformer-GCAN Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11061797</link><description>The distributed photovoltaic (PV) power stations within the entire county exist spatiotemporal correlation. Merely considering temporal correlation makes it challenging to meet the day-ahead scheduling demands. This paper proposes a distributed PV county-level day-ahead power prediction method based on grey relational analysis and the Transformer-Graph Convolutional Attention Network (Transformer-GCAN) model. Firstly, the grey relational degree is used to measure the relevance between each distributed PV stations, and the connection relationship of the station graph is determined based on the analysis results. Secondly, the Transformer network is utilized to extract the temporal features of each PV sequence in the graph. Based on the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model, a Graph Attention Mechanism (GAT) is introduced to dynamically extract spatial features between each photovoltaic station in the graph. Finally, the integration of spatiotemporal features is achieved through a fully connected neural network, enabling day-ahead power prediction at the county level. Case analysis results demonstrate that compared with the Transformer-GCN model, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the power prediction model proposed in this paper is reduced by 11.90%, 15.72% and 19.61% respectively in sunny days, cloudy days and rainy days.</description></item><item><title>Power Capacity Allocation Among Multiple Renewable Power Plants: A Perspective From System Strength</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11122291</link><description>Large-scale renewable energy projects consisting of renewable power plants (RPPs) managed by different stakeholders may suffer weak system strength. Consequently, only a limited amount of renewable power capacity can be delivered, or the insufficient system strength could incur stability issues. The allocation of system strength constrained power capacity among different RPPs deserves investigation, which is critical to their respective benefits. To this end, the system strength demand of each RPP is quantified based on its allowable power capacity. A power capacity allocation approach is proposed, ensuring that the RPPs efficiently and fairly utilize system strength. Case studies show that RPPs with longer electrical distances deliver less renewable capacity due to their greater impact on system strength.</description></item><item><title>Nonsmooth Decentralized Voltage Controller for Constrained Regulation of DC Microgrids With Constant Power Loads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11168949</link><description>This paper presents a novel decentralized voltage controller that enforces state constrains at all times and significantly enhances the transient response of DC Microgrid networks with constant power loads. The structure of the proposed controller ensures the existence of a positive invariant set under the solution of the dynamics, enforcing boundedness of each nodal voltage around a rated value. A rigorous analysis is presented to formulate sufficient conditions on the controller tuning parameters such that the boundedness property is guaranteed despite the time-varying nature of the nonlinear load demand. Closed-loop stability of the entire DC Microgrid with respect to desired reference points is analytically proven by employing a suitable Lyapunov function. This allows us to estimate the region of attraction of the desired equilibrium and obtain conditions under which system stability is ensured at all times. Furthermore, the structure of the proposed controller significantly improves the convergence rate of the closed loop system when compared with similar approaches in the literature. The theoretic results are verified in both experimental and power hardware-in-the-loop testing scenarios, while demonstrating fast voltage restoration in cases of load demand fluctuations and constrained regulation to the desired voltage References.</description></item><item><title>A Control Strategy of Multi-Terminal Grid-Forming Soft Open Point for Uninterrupted Power Supply Under Feeder Power Outages</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11173992</link><description>This paper proposes a control strategy of the multi-terminal grid-forming soft open point (MGSOP), aimed to ensure uninterrupted power supply during distribution feeder outages. Unlike existing approaches, the proposed control does not rely on an ideal DC voltage assumption, master-slave structure, or control mode switching. In the MGSOP, the AC-DC and DC-DC converters are used for multi-feeder interconnections and energy storage integration. The MGSOP control system comprises local and coordinating controllers, used to implement the proposed control strategy, which is made up of three sections: 1) Grid-forming AC voltage control implemented by local controllers, which ensures the independent construction of AC voltage and prevents control switching between grid-connected and standalone modes. 2) Hierarchical DC voltage control collaborated by both local and coordinating controllers. Based on the multi dynamic of DC voltage ( $\Delta U_{dc}$  and dUdc/dt), the control ensures dynamic DC power balance and DC voltage stability, avoiding system instability and restoration failures caused by the shutdown of the master converter under traditional master-slave control. 3) Coordinated control for the power regulation among multiple feeders, which reduces the consumption of energy storage during supply restorations. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is validated by simulations.</description></item><item><title>CommonPower: A Framework for Safe Data-Driven Smart Grid Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11186797</link><description>The growing complexity of power system management has led to an increased interest in reinforcement learning (RL). To validate their effectiveness, RL algorithms have to be evaluated across multiple case studies. Case study design is an arduous task requiring the consideration of many aspects, among them the influence of available forecasts and the level of decentralization in the control structure. Furthermore, vanilla RL controllers cannot themselves ensure the satisfaction of system constraints, which makes devising a safeguarding mechanism a necessary task for every case study before deploying the system. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the Python tool CommonPower, the first general framework for the modeling and simulation of power system management tailored towards machine learning. Its modular architecture enables users to focus on specific elements without having to implement a simulation environment. Another unique contribution of CommonPower is the automatic synthesis of model predictive controllers and safeguards. Beyond offering a unified interface for single-agent RL, multi-agent RL, and optimal control, CommonPower includes a training pipeline for machine-learning-based forecasters as well as a flexible mechanism for incorporating feedback of safeguards into the learning updates of RL controllers.</description></item><item><title>Chattering-Free Robust Terminal Sliding Mode Control for DC Nanogrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11197018</link><description>DC nanogrid is an emerging solution for providing affordable electricity to rural areas and homes equipped with solar panels, power converters, and on-site batteries. However, its poor transient response limits its practical application, presenting a significant drawback. This paper proposes a chattering-free robust terminal sliding mode control with finite time stability for the DC nanogrid. The proposed control strategy effectively addresses issues such as poor transient response and chattering, thereby ensuring optimal operation of the DC nanogrid. To achieve robust closed-loop power system operation, advanced nonlinear sliding surfaces and control laws are designed. This work focuses on achieving robustness against dynamic changes and system uncertainties caused by the intermittent nature of the renewable generation unit, instantaneous load variation, and saturation of the control laws. The finite-time stability of the closed-loop system is proved using Lyapunov theory to ensure finite-time convergence for both the reaching and sliding phases. The effectiveness of the proposed nonlinear controller is demonstrated by comparing it with higher-order SMC and conventional asymptotic SMC. System behavior is analyzed through MATLAB/Simulink simulations, and practical applicability is validated experimentally using an IMPERIX hardware setup.</description></item><item><title>Large-Signal Stability Analysis of Multi-Stack Fuel Cell Hybrid Power Systems With Virtual Inertia-Based Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11197052</link><description>Multi-stack fuel cell (FC) hybrid power systems (MSFCHPSs) are high-order nonlinear systems with inherently complex nonlinear characteristics due to their integration of multiple FC stacks, power electronic converters, and nonlinear loads. Thus, MSFCHPSs are very vulnerable to destabilization by transient disturbances, which exceeds the capabilities of traditional small signal stability analysis. To explore the destabilization mechanism of MSFCHPSs, this article proposes a comprehensive large-signal stability (LSS) analysis framework integrating a full-order nonlinear model, including all main circuits, complete control loops, and FC aging effects, with virtual inertia-based control. The nonlinear system is transformed into a Takagi&#8211;Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy representation, enabling domain of attraction (DOA) estimation via Lyapunov theory and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) with low computational burden and reduced conservatism. The method quantitatively assesses the influence of power distribution, virtual inertia parameters, circuit elements, control gains, and FC aging on LSS, identifying dominant stability factors. A hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platform is developed to experimentally validate the proposed approach. Results show strong agreement between estimated and actual stability boundaries, confirming the method&#8217;s accuracy and practical applicability for MSFCHPS design and operation.</description></item><item><title>Artificial Intelligence Data Driven Control for DC Solid State Transformer in DC Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11215658</link><description>The DC solid-state transformer (DCSST) serves as a key component for connecting power supplies, loads, and other elements in a DC microgrid system. With the integration of new energy sources and random loads, the system has become increasingly complex, making accurate modeling challenging due to high modeling costs. The randomness of the loads introduces various disturbances, compromising system stability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a data-driven model-free control (DMFC) approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and an improved Kalman filter (IKF) for the DCSST. First, a data-driven model of the DCSST is established. Next, the IKF is designed, which is tailored for DMFC to correct measurement errors, filter noise, and estimate uncertain disturbances. Subsequently, the DMFC is introduced, which ensures stability under large signal disturbances without relying on an accurate system model. Finally, a DRL sub-controller is integrated into the DMFC to intelligently adjust the control signal and enhance the system&#8217;s operational adaptability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed control method can adaptively ensure the stability of the system under large signal disturbances without requiring an accurate model, while also exhibiting good dynamic and steady-state performance.</description></item><item><title>Visual-Based Reinforcement Learning for Voltage Regulation and Attack Mitigation in Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11173844</link><description>The growing integration of distributed generators introduces increased vulnerability to cyber threats in modern power distribution systems, especially false data injection attacks (FDIAs) targeting communication network. This paper presents a novel real-time voltage regulation framework that enhances both system security and operational efficiency under FDIA scenarios. A time-frequency visual (TFV) model is first developed to identify FDIA types and accurately detect their duration in real-time. Based on the detection outcomes, a redirected control mechanism is employed to correct compromised control signals. These components are embedded into a Markov decision process (MDP) that guides voltage regulation strategies. To solve the MDP, an attention-based multi-agent soft actor-critic (AMS) algorithm is introduced, leveraging attention mechanisms to enhance decision-making under complex and uncertain environments. Integrating the TFV and AMS modules, a visual-based reinforcement learning (VRL) approach is formulated for robust and adaptive voltage control. Extensive simulations conducted on a modified IEEE 33-bus system using real-world synchrophasor data demonstrate that the proposed method effectively contains voltage deviations within 0.02085 p.u., significantly improving the resilience of the distribution network against cyberattacks.</description></item><item><title>A Safe Combined Reinforcement Learning and Model Predictive Control Scheme for Utility-Level Battery Control in Distribution Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11193800</link><description>Optimally controlling energy storage systems is essential for the integration of renewables and electromobility in future power grids. Such control schemes may need to satisfy lookahead requirements for the batteries state-of-charge so as to ensure a smooth grid operation. Model predictive control (MPC) is traditionally used to solve these type of problems suffering however from long runtimes and the need of fine-tuned forecasts. Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches are considered as alternatives but usually cannot guarantee constraints satisfaction. To overcome the limitations of both MPC and RL, in this work, a novel method that integrates RL into MPC is proposed leading to a fast real-time control scheme that aims to enforce near-future constraints satisfaction and accounts for lookahead constraints in the current decisions. Due to the inclusion of the RL-based learned value function in the MPC cost, traditional optimization solutions do not apply and the application of the cross-entropy-method (CEM) is suggested. Its runtime is reduced to the time scale of seconds by employing appropriate initialization based on RL decisions as well as an exponentially decaying amount of samples. Numerical comparisons show that the proposed method outperforms MPC and other safe RL schemes in terms of cost performance and constraints violations.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Placement of Smart Hybrid Transformers in Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11224498</link><description>Hybrid transformers are a relatively new technology that combine conventional power transformers with power electronics to provide voltage and reactive power control capabilities in distribution networks. This paper proposes a novel method of determining the optimal location and utilisation of hybrid transformers in 3-phase distribution networks to maximise the net present value of hybrid transformers based on their ability to increase the export of power produced by distributed generators over their operational lifespan. This has been accomplished through sequential linear programming, a key feature of which is the consideration of nonlinear characteristics and constraints relating to hybrid transformer power electronics and control capabilities. Test cases were carried out in a modified version of the Cigre European Low Voltage Distribution Network Benchmark, which has been extended by connecting it with two additional low voltage distribution test networks. All test case results demonstrate that the installation and utilisation of hybrid transformers can improve the income earned from exporting excess active power, justifying their installation cost (with the highest net present value being (6.56 million, resulting from a 45.53% increase in estimated annual profits due to coordinated HT compensation).</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Operational Strategy for Ice Thermal Storage District Cooling Systems via Model-Free Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11184258</link><description>District cooling system (DCS) offers centralized cooling services for building groups that significantly reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. However, existing model-based methods struggle with the large-scale, stochastic, and nonlinear characteristics of the DCS optimization problem under strict time limits. To fill this research gap, this paper proposes a model-free safe deep reinforcement learning (MFS-DRL) algorithm for the DCS to deliver real-time scheduling strategies of multiple chillers and ice thermal storage units under varying operating conditions. The problem is modeled as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) to systematically decouple the objective from the constraint, therefore overcoming the confusion between reward and penalty caused by manual penalty coefficients in traditional DRL methods. Moreover, prior expert knowledge is acquired through the interior point optimizer (IPOPT) solver, and the agent is pre-trained using imitation learning (IL) to mitigate exploration disorder and local convergence in the early training stage. Ultimately, the Lagrangian relaxation approach is applied to modify the optimality criteria and gradient update rules of the classic deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, thereby achieving a trade-off between feasibility and optimality. Numerical experiments on 12-node and 619-node DCSs demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms representative model-based and data-driven baselines, delivering high-quality solutions within only milliseconds and maintaining robustness across hyperparameter variations.</description></item><item><title>Load Prediction of Hydrogen Powered Ship: A Deep Prediction Framework Considering Operating Environment and Error Correction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11187418</link><description>The load prediction for the future period can serve as an important reference for ship navigation planning. However, the small displacement of hydrogen powered ships and the complex operating environment and conditions pose a serious challenge to load prediction. This study develops an advanced load forecasting framework for hydrogen energy ships by integrating navigation data with hydro-meteorological conditions, proposing a novel strategy that combines classified load prediction with unified error correction. The methodology begins with Spearman correlation analysis to identify critical features for both propulsion and maintenance loads. LightGBM models then generate rapid preliminary predictions for these load categories, employing continuous training to enhance computational efficiency while producing initial forecast sequences. The framework&#8217;s key innovation is the Int-ConvGRU network, which implements error correction through a parallel architecture that simultaneously processes historical data and preliminary predictions while preserving precise temporal relationships. This unique design significantly improves prediction accuracy by effectively capturing complex temporal dependencies. Comprehensive validation using data from hydrogen-powered vessels demonstrates the framework&#8217;s superior performance against multiple benchmark models, particularly in handling the distinct load characteristics of modern ships.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Time-Domain Hierarchical Scheduling of Integrated Energy Systems With Frequency Decomposition Considering Large-Scale Grid Connection of Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11192655</link><description>Amid global decarbonization efforts, Integrated Energy Systems (IES) face critical challenges from the inherent uncertainties of high-penetration renewable energy sources and the large-scale, potentially disorderly integration of Electric Vehicles (EVs), leading to significant supply-demand imbalances and system volatility. Existing approaches struggle to effectively coordinate diverse device response times and capture complex EV user behavior. To address these, this paper proposes a multi-time domain control model-driven bi-level optimization framework for Integrated Energy Systems. The upper level employs a multi-objective intelligent algorithm to generate Pareto-optimal solutions balancing economic costs and environmental impacts. The lower level implements a singular perturbation theory-based multi-time domain control model, dynamically partitioning devices into fast/slow subsystems for differentiated scheduling, significantly enhancing resilience against uncertainties. Additionally, a prospect theory-driven EV dynamic charging response model accurately incorporates user psychology (e.g., loss aversion) to guide orderly charging via price incentives. Furthermore, a Fourier-based power decoupling strategy for hybrid storage (LIB-SC) reduces battery degradation by 28.7%. Case studies demonstrate superior performance: a 12.2% reduction in economic costs, an 11.5% reduction in emissions, and robustly maintained system volatility below 5% under extreme uncertainties, showcasing significant advancements in balancing economic-environmental objectives while accommodating high renewable and EV penetration.</description></item><item><title>Interpretable and Accurate Multi-Energy Loads Forecasting via Continuous-Time Modeling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11195784</link><description>High-precision interpretable forecasting of multi-energy loads is crucial for planning and optimizing Integrated Energy Systems (IES). Current methods have three key limitations: 1) reliance on closed-box models obscures feature interactions; 2) traditional modal decomposition methods ignore cross-modal correlations and fail to efficiently extract global cycle-trend characteristics; 3) limitations in sampling frequency prevent capturing fast dynamic characteristics of energy loads. To address these, we propose a dual resolution channel multi-period cross reconstruction parallel closed-form continuous-time network (DMP-PCFC) for multi-energy load forecasting. This method includes a multi-period cross-reconstruction network which equivalent to the signal sifter for decoupling original sequences and nonlinear mapping across periods, and models hidden states of energy loads using neuron state iterative differential equations. A parallel Closed-form continuous-time neural network (PCFC) based on chunked parallelization reduces inference time from  $O(T)$  (change with input sequence length) to  $O(P)$  (fixed cycle length). To overcome inherent sampling resolution limitations, a dual-resolution channel model with weight-sharing PCFC is used for simultaneous inference. Extensive experiments and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) on the IES dataset at Arizona State University&#8217;s Tempe campus show that DMP-PCFC offers higher prediction accuracy and greater interpretability than existing methods, providing a new paradigm for downstream tasks based on other research methods, making it valuable for IES engineering applications.

However, the predicted flexibility potential of a building&#8217;s Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system is based on uncertain ambient weather forecasts and a typically inaccurate building thermal model. This paper presents an uncertainty-aware flexibility quantifier using a chance-constrained formulation. Because such a quantifier may be conservative, we additionally model real-time feedback in the quantification, in the form of affine feedback policies. Such adaptation can take the form of intra-day trades or rebound around the flexibility provision period. To assess the flexibility quantification formulations, we further assume that flexible buildings participate in secondary frequency control markets. The results show some increase in flexibility and revenues when introducing affine feedback policies. Additionally, we demonstrate that accounting for uncertainties in the flexibility quantification is necessary, especially when intra-day trades are not available. Even though an uncertainty-ignorant potential may seem financially profitable in secondary frequency control markets, it comes at the cost of significant thermal discomfort for inhabitants. Hence, we suggest a comfort-preserving approach, aiming to truly reflect thermal discomfort on the economic flexibility revenue, to obtain a fairer comparison.</description></item><item><title>Game-Based Optimization Method for Geo-Distributed Data Centers Under Customer Directrix Load Demand Response Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11173940</link><description>This study considers geo-distributed data centers (DCs) with diverse load profiles, electricity prices, and renewable energy availability, aggregated within their respective local virtual power plants (VPPs).

Meanwhile, as renewable energy becomes more integrated into the grid, the carbon intensity of grid electricity varies at different times. This variability presents an opportunity for data centers to align their workloads with periods of high renewable energy generation and low carbon intensity, thereby reducing their operational carbon emissions. This paper proposes a multi-objective scheduling strategy to minimize carbon emissions and maximize quality of service (QoS) by identifying the Pareto front. The proposed strategy employs an integrated reinforcement learning model to dynamically integrate action strategies for multiple objectives. Results from a case study based on a real-world, large-scale data center illustrate the method&#8217;s effectiveness. This effectiveness arises from its dual-objective job scheduling strategy, which simultaneously reduces carbon emissions from electricity consumption and maintains a high quality of service in data centers. The method aims to promote the low-carbon operation of data centers, provide decision support, and facilitate coordination between data centers and power systems in real-world applications.</description></item><item><title>Stability Constrained Voltage Control in Distribution Grids With Arbitrary Communication Infrastructure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11164977</link><description>We consider the problem of designing learning-based reactive power controllers that perform voltage regulation in distribution grids while ensuring closed-loop system stability. In contrast to existing methods, where the provably stable controllers are restricted to be decentralized, we propose a unified design framework that enables the controllers to take advantage of an arbitrary communication infrastructure on top of the physical power network. This allows the controllers to incorporate information beyond their local bus, covering existing methods as a special case and leading to less conservative constraints on the controller design. We then provide a design procedure to construct input convex neural network (ICNN) based controllers that satisfy the identified stability constraints by design under arbitrary communication scenarios, and train these controllers using supervised learning. Simulation results on the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) microgrid testbed illustrate the effectiveness of the framework and highlight the role of communication in improving control performance.</description></item><item><title>Virtual Power Plants for Frequency Regulation: A Learning-Based Method With Safety Guarantee</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11195783</link><description>Frequency safety is becoming increasingly critical in modern power systems due to the reduction of rotational inertia and governor damping. With advances in power electronics, the inverter-based resources (IBRs) installed in distribution networks can provide inertia and frequency support if their controllers are properly designed. In this paper, the virtual power plants (VPPs) framework is leveraged to aggregate and coordinate IBRs to provide inertial and primary-frequency responses. In particular, sufficient conditions are derived for the VPP central controller design to guarantee the transient frequency safety, including stability, the rate of change of frequency and Nadir requirements. On this basis, a nonlinear controller parameterization that satisfies these conditions automatically is proposed. The optimal VPPs control policies are trained by recurrent neural network (RNN)-based reinforcement learning and then fairly disaggregated to individual IBRs, ensuring that IBRs share the power injections for frequency response in proportion to their reserve capacities. Moreover, the controllers are equipped with a safety layer with trivial computation burden to satisfy critical constraint during implementation. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed control strategy outperforms linear controller and other cutting-edge learning-based control strategies.</description></item><item><title>Iterative Linear Programming-Based Angle-Relaxed Branch Flow Model and Its Application to Volt-Var Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11195819</link><description>This paper addresses the challenge of optimizing distribution networks under the increasing integration of distributed energy resources and the inherent nonconvexity of AC power flow equations. Traditional methods relying on conic-relaxed formulations often fail to accurately capture critical voltage and power flow dynamics, particularly when the optimization objective does not directly minimize current magnitudes. To overcome these limitations, we propose an iterative linear formulation for the angle-relaxed branch flow model (BFM-ar), termed BFM-it. This approach iteratively linearizes the branch flow equations and updates key parameters&#8212;such as losses and voltage estimates&#8212;so that each iteration solves a linear program that progressively converges to the true nonlinear AC power flow solution. Both mathematical analysis and numerical experiments confirm that the BFM-it achieves convergence with errors on the order of machine precision, while demonstrating superior performance in volt-var control compared to conventional methods. The proposed method not only enhances modeling accuracy but also offers a computationally efficient framework for real-time distribution network optimization.</description></item><item><title>Power Swing Trajectory Influenced by Virtual Impedance-Based Current-Limiting Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11203273</link><description>Grid-forming (GFM) inverter-based resources (IBRs) can emulate the external characteristics of synchronous generators (SGs) through appropriate control loop design. However, in systems with GFM IBRs, the apparent impedance trajectory under current limitation differs significantly from that of SG-based systems due to the limited overcurrent capability of power electronic devices. This difference challenges the power swing detection functions of distance relays designed for SG-based systems. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the apparent impedance trajectory over a full power swing cycle under two typical current-limiting strategies: variable virtual impedance (VI) and adaptive VI. The analysis reveals that the trajectory under VI current-limiting strategies differs significantly from that of a conventional SG. The results also indicate that the control parameters affect the characteristics of the trajectory. In addition, the new trajectories challenge conventional power swing detection functions, increasing the risk of malfunction. Furthermore, the implementation of VI leads to a deterioration in system stability. The theoretical analysis is further validated through simulations on the MATLAB/Simulink platform.</description></item><item><title>Two-Stage Distributionally Robust Optimization Dispatch for Power Systems With Uncertain Small-Sample Wind and Photovoltaic Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11203248</link><description>Extreme meteorological phenomena (e.g., cold waves) are low-probability, high-impact events that present significant operational and dispatch challenges for new-energy power systems. 1) Insufficient data on wind and photovoltaic power generation hinder data-driven modelling. 2) The uncertainty of small-sample wind and photovoltaic data is difficult to characterize. Therefore, a two-stage distributionally robust optimization dispatch strategy for a power system based on small-sample wind and solar data with uncertainty is developed. First, a generalized modelling method for a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) is proposed, which increases the generation of hourly output data for wind and photovoltaic power. Considering the drawback of large prediction errors for wind power and photovoltaic power in small-sample cases, a two-stage distributionally robust optimization model based on the Wasserstein metric is constructed, which embeds hard constraints (e.g., the capacity constraint of wind and solar transmission lines) and soft constraints (e.g., prediction errors). This model is nonconvex, and exactly solving it incurs a heavy computational burden. Duality theory and relaxation approximation are adopted here; the robust two-stage-distribution model is transformed into a mixed-integer linear programming model, and the iterative Taylor formula algorithm is used to linearize the constraint conditions. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate that the proposed model and solution algorithm can not only address the uncertainty of small-sample wind and photovoltaic data but also reduce the system operating costs and increase the model-solving efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Two-Stage Optimization Method for Real-Time Parameterization of PV-Farm Digital Twins</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11235949</link><description>Digital twins (DTs) are high-fidelity virtual models of physical systems. This paper details a novel two-stage optimization method for real-time parameterization of photovoltaic digital twins (PVDTs) using field measurements. Initially, the method estimates equivalent irradiance from PV power, voltage, and current data, eliminating the need for direct irradiance sensors. This is crucial for tuning the DT&#8217;s parameters to actual environmental conditions, thereby improving power prediction accuracy. The second stage focuses on refining these parameters by minimizing discrepancies between measured and predicted outputs. This optimization utilizes the estimated equivalent irradiance as a model input, maintaining synchronization with real-world conditions. Parameter updates are event-trigger, launched when deviations exceed predefined thresholds. This strategy optimizes prediction accuracy and manages communication loads efficiently. Validated with extensive data from a PV farm, this approach outperforms existing methodologies in predictive accuracy and operational efficiency, significantly improving the performance DTs in real-time grid operations.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Distribution of Grid-Following and Grid-Forming Converters for Charging Control of Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11181195</link><description>We address the problem of determining the optimal combination of grid-following (GFL) versus grid-forming (GFM) modes of control in electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) to maintain an acceptable balance between small-signal stability and voltage stability of electric distribution grids. We recall the state-space dynamic models of EVCSs operating in GFL and GFM modes and demonstrate how high charging rates of electric vehicles (EVs) in the GFL mode can impact small-signal performance. We then optimize the GFL-to-GFM ratio while also determining the optimal EV charging setpoints and a state-feedback controller to minimize the  $\mathcal {H}_{2}$ -norm of the grid transfer function (TF). To make the proposed optimization computationally favorable, we use participation factor analysis to identify the most dominant EVCSs in the GFM mode so that they can be prioritized for optimization. We validate our results using a modified model of the IEEE 33-bus power distribution test system with ten EVCSs.</description></item><item><title>Planning and Integration of a Multi-Robot Adaptive Charging Network for Voltage Regulation via Unscented Kalman Filter-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11195829</link><description>High levels of electric vehicle (EV) penetration and load uncertainty pose significant challenges to traditional voltage regulation in distribution systems (DS), particularly concerning voltage drops. This study investigates the potential of a dual-service mode (V2V/V2G) for mobile charging using multiple charging robots, cooperating with conventional DS voltage regulation methods to enhance performance. Specifically, we propose a multi-robot adaptive charging network (MRACN) embedded in a three-level voltage regulation framework to address voltage violations. At the low level, we introduce a voltage security rule-based dispatch strategy for MRACN to mitigate EV-induced voltage drops. At the mid-level, we optimize day-ahead scheduling of on-load tap changers and capacitor banks via optimal power flow for long-term voltage regulation. At the high level, we employ an unscented Kalman filter-based deep reinforcement learning (UKF-DRL) approach to integrate MRACN into DSs for real-time voltage control. Experimental results demonstrate that MRACN effectively reduces voltage violations and enhances the flexibility of conventional voltage control systems. Moreover, the UKF-DRL method accelerates DRL training by nearly an order of magnitude compared to full AC power-flow solutions, with the overwhelming majority of state estimates deviating by no more than 2%.</description></item><item><title>A Resilience-Oriented Incentive Pricing Strategy for Power-Transportation Network Against Flood Hazards</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11197582</link><description>Extreme weather events, such as flood hazards, may superimpose damage on coupled power-transportation networks (PTNs). An effective approach is to guide electric vehicle (EV) owners to enhance grid resilience. However, the EV emergency response and incentive prices are not sufficiently quantified for the post-flood recovery of power distribution network (PDN). Thus, this paper develops a fault scenario generation method to capture the capacity attacks on coupled PTNs during flood hazards. Then, a resilience-oriented tri-level incentive pricing strategy of EV emergency response is proposed for PDN post-flood recovery. At the upper level, EV charging station (EVCS) operators decide incentive pricing strategies for EV emergency response services by assessing the coupled relations of EV discharging/path strategies and PDN subsidy. At the middle level, a modified traffic model is proposed to capture the EV owner&#8217;s inconvenience cost associated with emergency response. At the lower level, a resilience metric incorporating EV discharging responses is introduced to mitigate load curtailment of PDN. Furthermore, a decomposition method based on column generation and optimal path set pre-assignment is proposed to address the urgency and destination uncertainty in emergency responses. Numerical results illuminate that the proposed strategy could reduce 41% of the peak load power shedding.</description></item><item><title>Intrusion Detection System for Digital Substations Using Semi-Supervised Learning and Traffic Distance Similarity Clustering</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11168910</link><description>Cyber attacks on power grids are imminent and potentially have a severe impact, as evidenced by the cyber attacks in Ukraine in 2015, 2016, and 2022. In response to this challenge, machine learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have become more prevalent as a potential mitigation owing to their alignment with the latest advances in artificial intelligence. However, existing anomaly detection methods for power grid Operational Technology (OT) are often inadequate, as they primarily focus on detecting power grid physical anomalies at the later attack stages and suffer from the scarcity of available data for supervised machine learning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised IDS specifically for digital substations of the power system. The proposed detection method identifies the distinctive distance similarity of digital substation OT communication traffic using a Convolutional Neural Network and Chebyshev distance of packet payloads, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov of packets&#8217; interarrival time using Fast Fourier Transform amplitude. Subsequently, these traffic features are combined into a vector and classified using a novel hybrid semi-supervised Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN). Results indicate that the proposed method can identify zero-day attacks and achieve accuracy and F1 above 95%.</description></item><item><title>A Dual Power Grid Cascading Failure Model for the Vulnerability Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11175257</link><description>When considering attacks against the power grid, one of the most effective approaches could be the attack to the transmission lines that leads to large cascading failures. Hence, the problem of locating the most critical or vulnerable transmission lines for a Power Grid Cascading Failure (PGCF) has drawn much attention from the research society. There exist many deterministic solutions and stochastic approximation algorithms aiming to analyze the power grid vulnerability. However, it has been challenging to reveal the correlations between the transmission lines for the critical line identification. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that learns such correlations, based on self-supervised learning and the self-attention mechanism, which is inspired by the Transformer model for natural language processing (NLP). Once the correlations are learned, a ranking algorithm is introduced for the critical line identification. With extensive experiments comparing our approach versus 2 other benchmark algorithms, it is proven that the proposed Dual PGCF model provides a novel and effective solution for critical line identification.</description></item><item><title>Scalable Voltage Control for DC Microgrids: Robustness to Network Structural Variations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11180064</link><description>Frequent plug-in/-out operations result in structural variations of DC microgrids (DCmGs), posing challenges to scalable control and often requiring costly redesigns to maintain stability. To address this issue, this paper proposes a scalable voltage control strategy for uncertain DCmGs, enabling plug-and-play functionality without controller redesign or system reconfiguration. A polytopic uncertain DCmG model is first formulated to simultaneously capture parameter uncertainties in distributed generation units (DGUs), power lines, and ZIP (i.e., impedance, current, and power) loads. A structured free-weight matrix technique is then developed to mitigate the adverse effects of line and load uncertainties on DGUs while yielding a more tractable linear matrix inequality formulation. The proposed scalable control method is implemented locally to ensure the dissipative voltage stability of each DGU, thereby preserving the dissipativity of the entire network. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in achieving faster convergence and reduced overshoot.</description></item><item><title>An SDN-Based Framework for Cyber-Physically Coordinated Voltage Support of Virtual Power Plants Against DoS Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11181222</link><description>The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into smart grids is accelerating worldwide. However, the growing reliance on information and communication technologies (ICTs) for real-time monitoring and control in large-scale DER aggregations introduces significant cybersecurity risks. Among these, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks pose a critical threat, with the potential to severely disrupt system operations. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a security-by-design framework for large-scale DER aggregation in the context of virtual power plants (VPPs), with a focus on enhancing the resilience of voltage support services. Central to this framework is a cyber-physical coordinated control architecture that leverages software-defined networking (SDN) to dynamically adapt to variations in both the cyber and physical layers. Specifically, a cyber-aware voltage control algorithm is developed to coordinate DERs based on the real-time status of the communication network, while a physically informed network configuration algorithm adjusts communication paths according to voltage support priorities. The proposed approach is evaluated through cyber&#8211;physical co-simulations on both the IEEE 123-bus test system and the 240-bus test system, based on a real-world distribution system located in the Midwest U.S., under server DoS attack scenarios. Results demonstrate that the SDN-enabled coordination significantly mitigates server DoS attacks, confirming the framework&#8217;s effectiveness and robustness. This work offers a scalable and resilient solution for securing large-scale DER aggregation and integration against evolving cyber threats.</description></item><item><title>Post-Disaster Multi-Timescale Coordinated Restoration of Power and Thermal Cyber-Physical System Considering Hot Standby Resources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11184621</link><description>After extreme natural disasters, the inherent coupling between the cyber and physical components of power and thermal cyber-physical systems (PTCPS) facilitates the coordinated emergency resources from both domains, thereby expediting system restoration. Previous research has overlooked the influences of hot standby emergency resources and actual services in post-disaster restoration. Taking into account thermal inertia (TI) and wireless communication emergency resources, this paper proposes a post-disaster multi-timescale coordinated restoration method for PTCPS, aiming to minimize load loss, reduce emergency costs, decrease communication delays, and maximize distributed generation (DG) absorption. Firstly, models for TI, wireless communication, and repair crew emergency resources are established, and the multi-timescale coordination emergency resources are formed. Secondly, based on the switch control and load control services, a cyber-physical interaction model is constructed, and a dynamic networking model for wireless communication with wired communication node access is established. Then, the communication network, physical system operations, and topology reconfiguration models are constructed. To optimize the numerous unconventional nonlinear constraints in the proposed model, the logical constraint and Big-M methods are introduced in linearization techniques, the multiple linearization methods are derived. Finally, case studies are conducted using an improved RBTS-Bus2 power system/12-node thermal system, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method through comparisons with two benchmarks and highlighting the necessity of multi-timescale emergency resources and cyber-physical interaction.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic PMU Configuration for Stealthy Multi-Snapshot FDIA Mitigation: Enhancing Security in Hybrid-Measurement-Based State Estimation in Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11184615</link><description>Modern power systems have evolved into cyber-physical power systems (CPPSs) requiring high-resolution spatial-temporal state awareness, driving the adoption of hybrid measurement-based state estimation (SE). However, such advancements introduce heightened cybersecurity requirements that demand systematic investigations from adversarial perspectives. This paper establishes a comprehensive attacker-defender framework with dual contributions. From the attacker&#8217;s perspective, this paper proposes a multi-snapshot coordinated false data injection attack (MS-FDIA) strategy against hybrid measurement-based SE. The proposed attack model can effectively bypass both hybrid measurement synchronization checks and temporal data anomaly detection mechanisms, thereby achieving enhanced stealth and operational impact. From the defender&#8217;s perspective, this paper develops a dynamic trusted phasor measurement unit (PMU) configuration scheme that adaptively reconfigures secure measurement matrix subsets against evolving multistage attacks. The defense mechanism is solved through two complementary approaches: a numerical algorithm based on matrix row transformations and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based optimization method with temporal awareness. Comprehensive case studies on different standard test systems demonstrate the improved MS-FDIA mitigation capabilities and the defense scheme&#8217;s effectiveness, and the test results reveal the matrix transformation algorithm&#8217;s superiority in small-scale systems versus DRL&#8217;s scalability advantages for large networks.</description></item><item><title>Communication-Aware Wide-Area Damping Control Using Risk-Constrained Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11222886</link><description>Non-ideal communication links, especially delays, critically affect fast networked controls in power systems, such as the wide-area damping control (WADC). Traditionally, a delay estimation and compensation approach is adopted to address this cyber-physical coupling, but it demands very high accuracy for the fast WADC and cannot handle other cyber concerns like link failures or cyber perturbations. Hence, we propose a new risk-constrained framework that can target the communication delays, yet amenable to general uncertainty under the cyber-physical couplings. Our WADC model includes the synchronous generators (SGs), and also voltage source converters (VSCs) for additional damping capabilities. To mitigate uncertainty, a mean-variance risk constraint is introduced to the classical optimal control cost of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR). Unlike estimating delays, our approach can effectively mitigate large communication delays by improving the worst-case performance. A reinforcement learning (RL)-based algorithm, namely, stochastic gradient-descent with max-oracle (SGDmax), is developed to solve the risk-constrained problem. We further show its guaranteed convergence to stationarity at a high probability, even using the simple zero-order policy gradient (ZOPG). Numerical tests on the IEEE 68-bus system not only verify SGDmax&#8217;s convergence and VSCs&#8217; damping capabilities, but also demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional delay compensator-based methods under estimation error. While focusing on performance improvement under large delays, our proposed risk-constrained design can effectively mitigate the worst-case oscillations, making it equally effective for addressing other communication issues and cyber perturbations.</description></item><item><title>Load Forecasting Model Trading: A Cost-Oriented and Auction-Based Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11181218</link><description>Data sharing is essential for accurate load forecasting and efficient energy management, yet data exchange remains severely constrained by a lack of effective economic incentives. Data markets have emerged as a potential solution by incentivizing the exchange of data and forecasting resources among stakeholders. Existing data market mechanisms, often designed around trading raw data or forecast outputs, face multiple barriers&#8212;such as privacy concerns, valuation misaligned with real operational benefits, unilateral pricing, computationally intensive allocation, and inflexible asset adaptation&#8212;that limit their practicality for real-world energy applications. The aim of this paper is to address these challenges by proposing a novel market framework that treats pre-trained forecasting models as tradable assets, thereby fundamentally redefining the data market paradigm. Specifically, a cost-oriented evaluation approach that links model quality to downstream operational costs is first established as the foundation throughout the entire market process. Subsequently, we propose a bilateral iterative model auction mechanism to enable efficient transactions between the buyer and sellers while maximizing social welfare. Furthermore, we propose a model adaptation strategy, including model fine-tuning and ensembling, for the buyer to enhance the applicability of purchased models to his decision-making problem. Case studies in building energy management based on public datasets demonstrate that our approach converges to the socially optimal solution, allowing all participants to benefit: sellers are appropriately compensated for providing high-quality models, and buyers achieve significant operational cost reductions through the utilization of traded models.</description></item><item><title>Forced Oscillation Recognition With Interpretable Network Framework for Class Imbalance and Limited Real-World Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11200994</link><description>Deep learning (DL) holds significant potential for distinguishing forced oscillations (FOs) from natural oscillations (NOs) and resonances in power systems. However, most existing studies treat DL models as opaque system classifiers, and these models are often susceptible to challenges such as class imbalance among the three oscillation patterns (i.e., FOs, NOs, and resonances) and the limited size of real-world training datasets. These issues can lead to incorrect diagnoses of oscillation patterns in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose a FO oscillation recognition framework that integrates balanced data processing, an interpretable recognition network, and a fine-tuning learning strategy. In this framework, DeepSMOTE1D is introduced to address the issue of class imbalance by oversampling features extracted from an encoder-decoder network. The interpretable DWT-CNN-LSTM recognition network incorporates multiple discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) into each convolutional and LSTM layer to enhance both interpretability and performance of the model. Finally, a fine-tuning transfer learning strategy is employed, where the recognition network is first pretrained on simulation data and subsequently retrained on limited real-world data. The effectiveness of DeepSMOTE1D and the fine-tuning strategy in the proposed framework is also evaluated. Experimental results show that the proposed recognition model not only learns effectively from simulated oscillation data but also outperforms existing related networks in real-world scenarios, achieving superior accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</description></item><item><title>OptDisPro: LLM-Based Multi-Agent Framework for Flexibly Adapting Heuristic Optimal DisFlow</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11201936</link><description>The existing generative coding of distribution grids modeling and optimization face several issues, like complicated usage or high auto-codes error rates. This paper proposes the OptDisPro, a novel LLM-based multi-agent framework, enabling automatic optimal power flow (OPF) script modeling and solving. Driven by interactive linguistic instruction, it realizes automatic coding for customized requirements and flexibly adaptive heuristic optimization. Specifically, domain expertise and example scripts are encoded into structured prompt sequences to guide OptDisPro and enhance reasoning via Chain-of-Thought (COT). To mitigate LLM hallucinations, a contextual feedback mechanism is introduced, which collects error messages from the run-time environment for self-correction. Furthermore, Adaptive Selection of Multiple Algorithms (ASMA) is applied in the solving process, flexibly selecting heuristic algorithms to decrease the possibility of local optima. According to cases verification in multiple scenarios, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of OptDisPro in OPF problem of distribution network. The results also encourage further exploration of LLM applications in script online self-updating, autonomous OPF problem-solving and intelligent operation within distribution grid.</description></item><item><title>Learning Data-Driven Uncertainty Set Partitions for Robust and Adaptive Energy Forecasting With Missing Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11202569</link><description>Short-term forecasting models typically assume the availability of input data (features) when they are deployed and in use. However, equipment failures, disruptions, cyberattacks, may lead to missing features when such models are used operationally, which could negatively affect forecast accuracy, and result in suboptimal operational decisions. In this paper, we use adaptive robust optimization and adversarial machine learning to develop forecasting models that seamlessly handle missing data operationally. We propose linear- and neural network-based forecasting models with parameters that adapt to available features, combining linear adaptation with a novel algorithm for learning data-driven uncertainty set partitions. The proposed adaptive models do not rely on identifying historical missing data patterns and are suitable for real-time operations under stringent time constraints. Extensive numerical experiments on short-term wind power forecasting considering horizons from 15 minutes to 4 hours ahead illustrate that our proposed adaptive models are on par with imputation when data are missing for very short periods (e.g., when only the latest measurement is missing) whereas they significantly outperform imputation when data are missing for longer periods. We further provide insights by showcasing how linear adaptation and data-driven partitions (even with a few subsets) approach the performance of the optimal, yet impractical, method of retraining for every possible realization of missing data.</description></item><item><title>Frequency-Aware Multi-Task Forecasting for Integrated Energy Systems via Variational Mode Decomposition and Convolution-Attention Encoding</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11205895</link><description>Integrated Energy Systems (IESs) integrate electricity, heating, cooling, and gas through coupled infrastructures, posing forecasting challenges due to heterogeneous temporal patterns and cross-energy interference. These heterogeneous temporal patterns often reflect distinct frequency characteristics, which existing multi-task approaches struggle to disentangle due to the lack of frequency-aware task decoupling. To address this, this paper proposes VATLNet, a unified multi-task forecasting framework that integrates frequency-aware task decoupling with hybrid convolution-attention feature extraction. Specifically, multivariate energy inputs are decomposed via variational mode decomposition, and the resulting components are clustered into frequency-similar groups based on sample entropy. A shared encoder combining temporal convolutional networks and multi-head attention extracts frequency features across all clusters, which are then independently decoded by parallel long short-term memory network branches. Extensive experiments on real-world IES load datasets demonstrate that VATLNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 2.44% and 1.03% MAPE in single- and multi-task forecasting, respectively. The framework improves cross-frequency-aware feature extraction, reduces inter-task interference, and enhances forecasting robustness and interpretability across diverse energy modalities.</description></item><item><title>Smart Meter Scheduling for Data-Driven Granular Customer Voltage Visibility</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11215656</link><description>The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) in power distribution systems introduces greater voltage volatility. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) measurements at medium-voltage (MV) networks cannot directly monitor customer-end voltages; smart meters provide direct customer-end voltages but have insufficient reporting rates to track short-term voltage fluctuations due to DERs. This paper proposes an approach to high-resolution voltage monitoring at all customer points based on low-resolution smart meter measurements. This is based on staggered smart meter data acquisition: smart meters are grouped into subsets, each of which contains enough information to estimate the voltages of all customers. These subsets of smart meters are scheduled to report their data at different times rather than simultaneously. Then, at each instant when a subset of meters reports their measurements, a data-driven method is used to estimate all the unreported customer voltages by utilizing voltage measurements of the reporting subset. To support multi-customer estimation with minimal computational overhead, an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model is chosen due to its efficiency and robustness. This approach ensures high-resolution voltage estimation (HiVE) without the need of increasing the reporting rate of smart meters. Extensive simulations on real-world smart meter datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Aperiodic Sampling Load Frequency Control of Wind Power-Integrated Power Systems With Packet Losses and Delays Under Discrete Time Feedback Interconnection Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11181202</link><description>This paper explores the stability assessment and the development of controllers for aperiodic sampling load frequency control scheme for wind power-integrated power systems, accounting for communication delays and packet losses. Firstly, transform the multi-area continuous time model into a discrete time load frequency control model. By incorporating linear operators to manage the uncertainties including communication delays, packet losses and sampling interval within the system, the discrete time load frequency control system is converted into a feedback interconnected system that consists of uncertain operators and linear time-invariant systems. Secondly, the exponential stability condition of the system is given by utilizing the integral quadratic constraint theory and linear matrix inequality technique, which can be used to compute the upper bounds for aperiodic sampled-data intervals and delays. Furthermore, based on the proposed stability conditions, a controller iteration optimization algorithm is designed, which effectively addresses issues related to delays and packet losses. Finally, an example study based on one-area, three-area load frequency control system and IEEE 39-bus system show that the method can obtain larger sampling upper bounds and better control performance than previous methods.</description></item><item><title>A Cross-Level Consistency-Aware Diffusion Model of Hierarchical Imputation for Energy Prosumers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11168916</link><description>Motivated by the aggregation structure of prosumers from energy communities within a region, this letter proposes a cross-level consistency-aware diffusion model for solving the hierarchical imputation problem (CDHI), directly processing three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical time series. In CDHI, a 3D attention mechanism of hierarchical, temporal, and feature Transformer layers is developed to capture the aggregated dependency of hierarchical series. Based on mask modeling, we extend imputation target choice strategies of missing patterns, thus training CDHI in a self-supervised manner. For implementation, we formulate the aggregation structure of prosumers as the hierarchical consistency across aggregation levels in the denoising loss function of CDHI.</description></item><item><title>Coupled Task Allocation and Path Planning for Energy-Optimal Multi-AUG Multi-Target Exploration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11113332</link><description>Autonomous underwater gliders (AUGs), as low-energy mobile observation platforms, offer significant potential for multi-target exploration tasks. However, existing studies typically use Euclidean distance to decouple task allocation from path planning, ignoring the effects of ocean currents and seabed topography on task performance. To address this gap, we develop an asymmetric energy consumption matrix that incorporates pitch angle and diving depth as decision variables, enabling energy-optimal path planning between targets. Subsequently, we propose a Discrete Artificial Bee Colony algorithm with Enhanced Search Strategies (DABC-ESS) for optimal task allocation. DABC-ESS integrates a greedy insertion initialization method with three innovative search strategies: enhanced neighborhood search, enhanced insertion, and enhanced destruction-reconstruction. The effectiveness of these strategies is validated through ablation studies, while comparative experiments against five state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the superior performance of DABC-ESS. Furthermore, our method achieves greater energy efficiency than the latest multi-AUG task allocation approach, highlighting its potential for complex underwater tasks.</description></item><item><title>SP-CPP: Semi-Physical Coverage Path Planning for Offshore Morphological Survey Aided by Autonomous Surface Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11120394</link><description>Coverage path planning for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) is crucial for underwater morphological surveys. However, current coverage path planning methods for practical surveys are inadequate. The main challenge arises from the fact that typical path-length/turning-number objective of current studies fails to directly minimize the energy consumption as they neglect the nonlinear hydrodynamic characteristics of vessel maneuvering. Furthermore, the intricate coastline features segment the offshore region into various complex areas, posing a significant challenge to CPP. To address these issues, for the first time, this research proposes the idea of establishing the CPP model by solving the nonlinear maneuvering differential equations of ASVs, referred to as Semi-Physical Coverage Path Planning (SP-CPP). SP-CPP can accurately captures the hydrodynamic characteristics of ASVs operating on water and comprehensively address large-scale and complex cases by jointly optimizing factors including survey orders, entry and exit selection, and sweep direction. Simultaneously, we propose a novel hierarchical heuristic approach which is able to quickly find optimal solutions for SP-CPP. Comprehensive simulations have been conducted across both large- and small-scale problem instances. The results indicate that SP-CPP demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art models, with its superiority becoming more pronounced as the problem scale increases. Finally, lake trials have been conducted using a real ASV to demonstrate the effectiveness of SP-CPP in practical applications.</description></item><item><title>Efficiency Optimization for Blockchain-Enabled V2V Energy Trading With Dynamic Clustering Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119334</link><description>Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) energy trading is a feasible solution to alleviate charging anxiety and enhance the range of electric vehicles (EVs). Clustering EVs can improve the efficiency of both energy transfer and V2V communication. However, in the complex large-scale Internet of Electric Vehicles (IoEV), the security and reliability of trading and communication, as well as the impact of cluster number and strategy on trading efficiency, require further discussion. This paper proposes a V2V energy trading system that leverages blockchain sharding and dynamic clustering to securely record energy trades as transactions on the blockchain. The system forms clusters using a clustering algorithm based on the mobility information and power levels of EVs, ensuring the reachability of energy trading. These trading clusters correspond to blockchain shards, enhancing transaction throughput through sharding scalability. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is employed to optimize the number of clusters, clustering algorithms, and parameters of the sharded blockchain system under security and latency constraints. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme ensures timely power replenishment for low-power vehicles, improves overall economic utility and throughput for participants, and is effectively applicable to large-scale V2V energy trading scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Physics-Informed Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator for Solving Pantograph-Catenary Interaction in Electric Railway</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11125493</link><description>In electric railway systems, the interaction performance of pantograph-catenary systems (PCS) is essential for ensuring a stable electrical supply. Establishing high-fidelity numerical models using the finite element method is generally desirable, yet it involves considerable computational complexity and time demands. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic modelling method that integrates physical information and data-driven approaches to solve the pantograph-catenary interaction, called Physics-Informed Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (PI-EFNO). Firstly, the enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (EFNO) based on global perceptron is developed to capture the nonlinear mapping between parameter space and output solution space by approximating solutions to dynamic equations in the frequency domain. Then, we integrate multiple physics-informed loss terms into the EFNO architecture to handle implicit constraints within coupled equations, which leverages physical principles to guide learning while reducing the need for labelled training data. Additionally, a dynamic weighting mechanism adaptively balances the contributions of various terms in the physics-based loss function. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and advantages of PI-EFNO in modelling pantograph-catenary dynamics. It demonstrates exceptional accuracy, computational efficiency, and generalizability across diverse pantograph models and catenary conditions, exhibiting strong capability in learning physically coupled equation systems.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Gate Mixture-of-Experts for Predistortion of Power Amplifiers in Satellite Multi-Antenna System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11114953</link><description>To meet the high data rate and large capacity demands of communications, multi-antenna technology is widely adopted in satellite communication systems, significantly increasing system capacity and spectrum efficiency by transmitting data through several links. However, the increase in the number of transmission paths introduces significant challenges, such as power amplifier (PA) nonlinearity and inter-antenna crosstalk. Traditional digital predistortion (DPD) techniques typically rely on independent compensation for each PA, which leads to high hardware complexity and scalability issues. Moreover, signal crosstalk distorts the feedback signal used for DPD parameter estimation, thereby degrading the accuracy of the nonlinear modeling. To solve the abovemetioned problems, this paper proposes a novel DPD approach that jointly compensates multiple PAs using a single model, thereby ensuring beam linearity while substantially reducing hardware overhead. Specifically, we design a multi-gate mixture-of-experts-based DPD model to mitigate PA nonlinear distortions and multi-antenna crosstalk. The proposed model formulates the inverse modeling of each PA as a multi-task learning problem, in which shared and task-specific representations are jointly leveraged to extract both common and distinctive nonlinear features, thereby enabling efficient and simultaneous compensation across multiple PAs. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms conventional polynomial-based and neural network-based approaches in compensating for nonlinear distortions and suppressing inter-antenna crosstalk. Specifically, in a 4-paths antenna array, the proposed model achieves an improvement of 2 dB in adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) and a 3 dB reduction in normalized mean square error (NMSE).</description></item><item><title>Towards Integrated Sensing in Multi-Tier Multi-User MEC: A DRL-Driven RSMA-Assisted Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11120392</link><description>This paper investigates a multi-tier multi-user mobile edge computing (MEC) network with integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), where the base station (BS) first receives computational tasks from $K$ users while simultaneously performing target sensing in an environment with $M$ clutter sources, and then the BS processes both the communication and sensing data, dynamically offloading portions of the computational tasks to the cloud server (CS) while maintaining the sensing performance. Such a system faces significant challenges, particularly in managing interference between sensing and communication processes. The primary goal of this study is to address this interference problem while simultaneously optimizing the performance and resource efficiency of both phases. To tackle these challenges, we employ uplink rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) to enhance spectral efficiency during the communication phase and indirectly support the sensing phase by mitigating interference, optimizing resource allocation, and preventing resource congestion. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem that jointly considers computational data rate, beamforming design, and power allocation. This problem is solved using a reinforcement learning-based soft actor-critic (SAC) method. Simulation results demonstrate that the RSMA-assisted system achieves at least 40% higher spectral efficiency than conventional non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) while maintaining robust sensing performance, even under the stringent QoS constraints.</description></item><item><title>Resource Optimization for Secure Transmission in Combined Radar and Multicast-Unicast Systems Supported by RIS and NOMA</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119323</link><description>In this research, we explore the secure communication within a system that integrates radar functionality with multicast and unicast communication (Rad-MU-Com), utilizing both reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). A dual-function base station (BS) sends combined multicast and unicast signals to communication-centric users (C-users) and radar-centric users (R-users) while detecting the R-users. In particular, multicast signals are intended for both C-users and R-users, whereas unicast messages are exclusively directed to C-users. Initially, we investigate an integrated Rad-MU-Com configuration with a single C-user and a single R-user, employing RIS and NOMA technologies to enhance transmission effectiveness. We formulate an optimization challenge aimed at maximizing the secrecy rate of the unicast signal. This is accomplished by concurrently optimizing both the transmit beamforming vectors and the RIS reflection coefficient matrix, with a constraint on maintaining similarity between the transmit beampatterns and the radar's desired beampatterns. To generalize from the single-pair scenario, we further examine a cluster-based Rad-MU-Com scheme that incorporates several pairs of C-users and R-users, with the assistance of RIS and NOMA technologies. The objective of the optimization challenge at hand is to maximize the minimum achievable secrecy rate of the unicast signal. This is accomplished by collaboratively optimizing the RIS's reflection coefficient matrix, the transmission beamforming vectors at the BS, and the power distribution parameters, with respect to the corresponding system constraints. To address the two optimization challenges, we introduce a low-complexity iterative framework that breaks down the original problems into multiple subproblems, each of which can be approximately solved. Simulation findings indicate that the secrecy performance of the proposed system, which incorporates RIS and NOMA, surpasses that of the traditional joint Rad-MU-Com system using RIS and orthogonal multiple access.</description></item><item><title>STAR-RIS-Empowered Monitoring Over Two-Way Suspicious Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11125872</link><description>This paper investigates a simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) empowered wireless surveillance system, where a pair of suspicious nodes send messages to each other in separate time phases, and the suspicious signal is simultaneously decoded by a monitor through a STAR-RIS-enhanced link for surveillance purposes. During the STAR-RIS-assisted monitoring, cooperative jamming (CJ) can also be leveraged by the monitor to disturb the receiver of the two-way suspicious communications, so as to benefit from the full-space coverage of STAR-RISs. We propose the STAR-RIS and CJ-assisted monitoring (SR-CJM) scheme, the STAR-RIS-assisted passive monitoring (SR-PM) scheme, and derive analytical expressions of their surveillance success probabilities (SSPs) for both infinite and finite phase-shift resolutions at the STAR-RIS, respectively. Since the closed-form and asymptotic analyses facilitate an optimization of the transmission-coefficient amplitudes of the STAR-RIS, we further present the SR-CJM with an optimal transmission coefficient (OTC), denoted by the SR-CJM-OTC scheme. Numerical results not only validate the closed-form SSP analysis and the robustness of proposed schemes for different phase-shift resolutions, but also verify that faced with two-way suspicious communications, the proposed SR-CJM outperforms the conventional pure-transmission/reflection RIS assisted CJ-assisted monitoring (CR-CJM) in terms of the SSPs. Besides, the SR-CJM shows its surveillance performance advantage over the SR-PM, and the performance can be further improved by exploiting more degrees of freedom provided by the transmission-coefficient amplitudes of the STAR-RIS, especially in the high jamming power region.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Spatio-Temporal Rate-Splitting-Based Power Allocation Optimization Strategy for RIS-Assisted 6G MU-MISO Communication Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11113353</link><description>Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can dynamically adjust phase shifts to achieve scalability in networks, while rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) can dynamically allocate spectrum and power resources according to the communication needs of IoT devices and reduce the energy consumption of the system. Therefore, the integration of RIS and RSMA can not only enhance the performance of IoT communication systems, but also reduces wastage of limited resources. This paper proposes a novel spatio-temporal rate-splitting-based power allocation optimization strategy for RIS-assisted multi-user (MU) systems to maximize channel capacity and energy efficiency gains. Leveraging the proposed spatio-temporal minimum mean squared error (STMMSE) principle and the rate splitting-based optimal power consumption (RS-OPC) method, the approach considers the Cram&#233;r-Rao bound for channel errors and derives expressions for maximizing channel capacity and obtaining the optimal solution. The proposed method selectively adjusts power values for different users and transmission types of symbols to achieve optimal power allocation objectives, thereby ensuring communication quality while optimizing channel capacity. This offers communication systems a higher configurability and resource optimization. Extensive simulation results including channel capacity, energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE) validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A New Achievable Rate for Decode-Forward-Based Gaussian Relay Channel With Hybrid-Duplex</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11113337</link><description>Combining half-duplex (HD) and full-duplex (FD) has shown great potential to improve the transmissionrate of relay channels. To approach the channel capacity of Gaussian relay channel, a novel three-phase hybrid-duplex (HyD) scheme was proposed based on decode-forward (DF) relaying. Apart from the pure FD mode, the relay works in receive-only and transmit-only modes for a fraction of time, respectively. The achievable rate of the proposed scheme is characterized. Furthermore, a joint time division and power allocation problem is formulated, aiming at maximizing the achievable rate of the proposed HyD relaying scheme. In particular, a two-step optimization method is raised to solve the formulated problem. Firstly, the local optimal power allocation is obtained for given time division factors. Then, the maximization of the achievable rate is addressed by finding the optimal time division factors, leading to a new achievable rate of the DF-based Gausian relay channel. A degenerated two-phase hybrid-duplex (D-HyD) scheme is also studied to reduce the implementation complexity. Additionally, the maximal achievable rate of the D-HyD scheme is derived in closed-form for specific scenarios. Numerical results demonstrate that, when using optimal parameters, the proposed three-phase HyD scheme and its two-phase variant can significantly enhance the rate performances of Gaussian relay channel, outperforming pure HD, pure FD, and other benchmark DF-based relaying schemes.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Physical Layer Security of URLLC Using Artificial Noise in Full-Duplex Cooperative NOMA</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11115032</link><description>In this paper, we propose enhancing physical layer security (PLS) of ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) in a full-duplex cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (FD-CNOMA) based Internet of Things (IoT) network. We analyze the PLS performance of a two-user FD-CNOMA system, where a source node transmits the short packet URLLC information to a near user and a far cell-edge user in the presence of an external eavesdropper. To ensure the security and reliability of URLLC signal transmission, the near user is utilized as a cooperative relay for transmitting the information intended for the far user, and also transmits an artificial noise (AN) signal to mitigate the impact of eavesdropping. An approximate closed-form expression of the average secure block error rate (SBLER) and the average secrecy throughput (AST) of the legitimate users under eavesdropping is derived. The analytical framework presented in this work considers the URLLC signal transmission with and without AN signal while evaluating the impact of residual self-interference (RSI) at the relay node on the PLS performance of the FD-CNOMA system. Thus, to improve the PLS performance and maximize the system AST, we optimize the URLLC blocklength and power allocation coefficient (PAC) at the source. The numerical and simulation results validate the proposed analytical framework and demonstrate a significant improvement of average SBLER and overall system AST (SAST) using AN-assisted URLLC signal transmission in the FD-CNOMA system.</description></item><item><title>3D Trajectory Optimization for Energy-Efficient UAV Communication With Obstacle Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119314</link><description>In this paper, we address the challenges faced by a UAV in multi-obstacle environments, where frequent flight path adjustments increase energy consumption and obstacles impede communication. To tackle these issues, we propose a UAV-assisted ground user communication system, where a fixed-wing UAV navigates a complex multi-obstacle environment. Based on this model, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the UAV's energy efficiency by optimizing its 3D trajectory. This problem is a mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem, with dual effects of obstacles on the UAV. To tackle this challenge, we introduce an obstacle avoidance factor to optimize the UAV's flight height, thereby avoiding obstacles of specific heights. Additionally, we consider the impact of obstacles on the UAV communication link and derive an equation for determining the blocking region. In response to the influence of obstacles and flight height on UAV energy efficiency, we propose an optimization method based on the DOB-DSCA algorithm. Experimental results show that optimizing flight height can improve energy efficiency by 12.6%, while the presence of obstacles reduces energy efficiency by 17.7%. Furthermore, considering the limited research in the existing literature on factors affecting UAV energy efficiency, we focus on how variations in transmission power, total flight time, and obstacle height can enhance UAV energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Joint Transmit and Jamming Power Optimization for Secrecy in Energy Harvesting Networks: A Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11120367</link><description>In this paper, we address the problem of joint allocation of transmit and jamming power at the source and destination, respectively, to enhance the long-term cumulative secrecy performance of an energy-harvesting wireless communication system until it stops functioning in the presence of an eavesdropper. The source and destination have energy-harvesting devices with limited battery capacities. The destination also has a full-duplex transceiver to transmit jamming signals for secrecy. We frame the problem as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) problem and propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimal joint power allocation (OJPA) algorithm that employs a policy iteration (PI) algorithm. Since the optimal algorithm is computationally expensive, we develop a low-complexity sub-optimal joint power allocation (SJPA) algorithm, namely, reduced state joint power allocation (RSJPA). Two other SJPA algorithms, the greedy algorithm (GA), and the naive algorithm (NA) are implemented as benchmarks. In addition, the OJPA algorithm outperforms the individual power allocation (IPA) algorithms termed individual transmit power allocation (ITPA) and individual jamming power allocation (IJPA), where the transmit and jamming powers, respectively, are optimized individually. The results show that the OJPA algorithm is also more energy efficient. Results also show that the OJPA algorithm significantly improves the secrecy performance compared to all SJPA algorithms. The OJPA algorithm also outperforms the secrecy performance of a genetic algorithm-based RL algorithm and a finite-horizon RL algorithm. The proposed RSJPA algorithm achieves nearly optimal performance with significantly less computational complexity marking it the balanced choice between the complexity and the performance. We find that the computational time for the RSJPA algorithm with considering only 50 percent of the total number of states is around 75 percent less than the OJPA algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Joint Task Allocation and Power Optimization in Multi-UAV Systems: An Overlapping Coalition Formation Game Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11120350</link><description>Unmanned Multiple Aerial Vehicle (multi-UAV) systems are capable of executing tasks and transmitting data effectively through cooperation. However, most existing works mainly focus on non-overlapping coalition formation and independent data transmission, which does not fully utilize the capability of UAV. This article investigates the cooperative task allocation of multi-UAV systems with consideration of limited UAV communication energy. In order to improve cooperative task performance, we jointly optimize overlapping coalition formation and UAVs' transmit power within the communication energy budget. Specifically, the problem is formulated as an overlapping coalition formation game (OCFG) in order to model the interactions among UAVs. In addition, a multi-coalition-based altruistic (MCA) order is proposed to support the overlapping of coalition members. The modeled OCFG is strictly proved to be an exact potential game (EPG), and hence the existence of stable coalition sturcture is guaranteed. Furthermore, we derive the conditions for UAV transmit power adjustment and develop a Joint Overlapping Coalition Formation and Transmit Power Optimization (JOCFTPO) algorithm to obtain the stable coalition structure. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed JOCFTPO algorithm outperforms the benchmark schemes in terms of the network utility.</description></item><item><title>Learning RIS-Assisted Hybrid NOMA Transmissions for Capacity Maximization in Wireless-Powered Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11122338</link><description>In this paper, we aim to enhance the throughput of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted and wireless-powered network by enabling user devices (UDs) to cooperatively adapt their channel access strategies. The base station (BS) simultaneously receives data and provides radio frequency (RF) energy to the UDs. Each UD equipped with a passive RIS employs non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) or backscattering for data transmissions. Moreover, the UD can assist other UDs' data transmissions through RIS's phase reconfiguration. We seek to maximize the overall throughput by optimizing UDs' channel access modes, time allocations, and the beamforming strategies of the RISs and the BS. Throughput maximization is challenging due to uncertain channel information, dynamic traffic demands, and limited energy supply. We propose a hierarchical learning approach to address access mode selection and transmission control in two steps. We first employ a multi-agent attention-enhanced deep reinforcement learning approach to update each UD's channel access strategy by interacting with the dynamic network. Then, we efficiently update the UDs' time allocation and the beamforming strategies of the RISs and the BS to further enhance throughput. Simulation results validate that our proposed scheme achieves improved throughput and learning efficiency, and exhibits superior adaptability against the varying traffic demands, compared to benchmarks.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Task Offloading and Resource Management for Vehicular Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11122339</link><description>Within the field of dynamic vehicular networks, also known as vehicular edge computing (VEC), task offloading and resource allocation face significant challenges due to constantly changing network conditions and limited resources. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for task offloading and resource allocation that considers the unpredictable starting points of vehicle offloading and the immediate impact of vehicle movement on wireless communication links. We utilizes dynamic channel modeling to track the fluctuations in link state, incorporating a task classification and migration strategy. This approach allows us to adaptively modify both single and cross-region offloading. Furthermore, to minimize overall latency and energy consumption, we optimally coordinate communication and computing resources by dynamically assigning vehicle transmission power, local computing resources, and the computing resources of roadside units. Simulation results indicate that the proposed approach effectively minimizes both latency and energy consumption. It notably outperforms benchmark schemes, showing a significant reduction in the Z value, achieving lower task delays and reduced energy consumption compared to existing strategies. These findings highlight the substantial advantages of the proposed approach, particularly in dynamic vehicular environments.</description></item><item><title>On the Convexity Analysis of Message Error Probability in Rateless-Coded Transmission: A Deeper Dive Into Reliability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11358828</link><description>Rateless codes are particularly appealing in dynamic and unpredictable communication environments, making them a natural choice for the communication in high-mobility networks. In this paper, motivated by this, we characterize the message error probability in rateless-coded transmission, defined as the probability that a user fails to decode the original message from the collected encoded packets using a rateless decoder. Building on this characterization, we prove the convexity and concavity of the message error probability with respect to a new variable under distinct sufficient conditions. Specially, under these sufficient conditions, we reveal that the message error probability is convex with respect to a power function of the packet success probability and concave with respect to a power function of the packet error probability, respectively. These properties provide valuable insights into analyzing rateless-coded transmissions across various scenarios. Through a practical multi-stream application example, we demonstrate how the convexity property can be applied to improve the overall reliability in rateless-coded transmissions.</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid Advertising Mode for Neighbor Discovery in Bluetooth Low Energy Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11108695</link><description>Neighbor discovery has a great impact on the performance of bluetooth low energy (BLE). BLE neighbor discovery has two advertising modes: pseudo-random delay advertising (RDA) and periodic deterministic advertising (PDA). PDA has low discovery latency but is susceptible to persistent collisions, whereas RDA does not suffer persistent collisions but has much larger discovery latency. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid advertising mode, called Deterministic and pseudo-Random delay Advertising (DRA), which has the advantages of both PDA and RDA. We develop an analytical model for DRA, and analyze the expected discovery latency of DRA in different cases.

However, irradiance variability and partial shading pose significant challenges to system stability and efficiency. This study evaluates three advanced nonisolated dc&#8211;dc converter topologies: interleaved boost, quadratic boost, and multi-input/single-output (MISO) under maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control using the perturb and observe algorithm. Simulations were conducted in Simulink using real irradiance and temperature data collected in a high solar irradiance place, such as Antofagasta, Chile. The system comprises 600 photovoltaic cells ($350\, \mathrm{V}$) connected to a $540\,\mathrm{ V}$ dc-Link bus and a $50\, \text{kWh}$ LiFePO$_{4}$ battery bank. Key performance metrics, such as voltage gain, efficiency, current ripple, and duty cycle behavior, were analyzed under three solar scenarios. Under favorable irradiance, all topologies delivered over $3.2\, \text{kW}$ with ideal efficiencies above 98.4%. The interleaved topology demonstrated strong steady-state performance but limited transient regulation. The quadratic converter operated with a low duty cycle yet showed greater sensitivity to disturbances. In contrast, the MISO converter consistently maintained a stable output, low ripple, and high efficiency even under minimal irradiance conditions (70 W/m$^{2}$). These results position the MISO topology as the most robust solution for variable urban environments, ensuring reliable energy delivery and supporting the efficient deployment of ViPV systems in electric mobility applications.</description></item><item><title>Tracking Concepts for High-Density PV Power Plants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11205357</link><description>In the search for new sites, photovoltaic (PV) system installations spread out into complex places and contexts, such as hilly terrain, floating PV, and agriPV. It is, therefore, plausible to assume that PV power plants will increasingly need to use space and, thus, sunlight more efficiently, e.g., by not wasting solar energy in the space between module rows. This means it may become increasingly important to consider the energy output of PV systems per area of land use, i.e., the &#8220;efficiency of the PV system.&#8221; To increase this efficiency, power plants with high density of PV modules are needed. For tracked systems, this necessitates adapting the tracking strategies to avoid excessive losses from either row-to-row shading or angle-of-incidence losses in backtracking. This article explores different tracking strategies that could contribute to enabling high-density PV power plants with high efficiency. The advantages of these advanced tracking strategies are quantified at two different latitudes as a function of the ground coverage ratio.</description></item><item><title>Floating Offshore Solar Photovoltaics for Land-Constrained and Diverse Renewable Supply Conditions in the United States and Canada</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11214224</link><description>Energy transition pathways for large continental areas are largely understood to be achievable using a diverse set of onshore renewable energy technologies. Previous research for the integrated United States and Canada energy&#8211;industry system indicated that solar photovoltaics (PVs) may dominate the primary energy structure, complemented by onshore wind power. However, societal constraints may require increased supply diversity, and onshore renewable energy may not be sufficient for densely populated regions, especially on the east coast of the United States. The LUT Energy System Transition Model was applied to investigate the role of floating offshore solar PV coupled with offshore wind and wave power when onshore solar PV is limited. The results indicate that, when onshore solar PV is limited to 60% of electricity generation, 434 GW of floating offshore solar PV may be installed by 2050 as part of a hybrid power plant sharing the same grid connection as offshore wind power, which reaches 414 GW of installed capacity, contributing 607 and 1576 TWh to the electricity supply, respectively. In total, 7.4 TW of solar PV capacity is installed by 2050, complemented by 1.4 TW of onshore wind power. Increased supply diversity still leads to a 42% reduction in the levelized cost of electricity, reaching 32.7 &#8364;/MWh in 2050. Compared with cost-optimal conditions, the levelized cost of final energy and nonenergy use in 2050 increases by 28% to 52.7 &#8364;/MWh. Nevertheless, such increased costs may be justifiable to meet societal constraints, and a diverse power-to-X economy structure for the United States and Canada may still be technoeconomically viable.</description></item><item><title>Performance Limits in Bifacial Tandem Solar Cell Modules for Multiple Configurations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11224657</link><description>While bifacial tandem photovoltaic technology is promising as it is able to generate higher electrical power output by accessing illumination from both front and rear surfaces, a thorough investigation of the performance limits of bifacial tandems with different architectures/arrangements and under different conditions has not been explored. In this work, we present a comprehensive analytical framework based on the principle of detailed balance to assess the performance limits of bifacial tandems spanning multiple architectures, including unconstrained, current-matched (CM), and voltage-matched (VM) configurations. Our methodology explores the performance benefits of incorporating area-decoupled subcells across layers and examines the impact of different bandgap arrangements (monotonic and non-monotonic) on the performance. We show that having non-monotonic arrangement of bandgaps under optimal albedo conditions can significantly enhance the performance of bifacial tandems. In addition, we analyze the performance resilience of each configuration and bandgap arrangement to spectral variations induced by environmental factors such as shading, fluctuations in temperature, and albedo. This provides crucial design guidelines for the design, fabrication, and estimation of the performance limits of these solar cell architectures in different conditions.</description></item><item><title>Performance Enhancement of Bifacial PV Modules on Horizontal Single-Axis Trackers in Desert Environments</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11206410</link><description>The adoption of bifacial photovoltaic (PV) modules has grown significantly due to their potential for higher energy yield.

Reliably managing high penetrations of solar PV within modern grids requires predictions that reflect the systemic consequences of fast renewable variability across cyber-physical energy infrastructure. This article proposes RR-LTNet, a ramp-rate (RR)-centric prediction architecture that elevates the RR as the core variability feature linking plant-level intermittency to grid-level operational risk. RR-LTNet first performs dynamic clustering of RR regimes to characterize rapid weather transitions and stability conditions. These regimes taken as feature for hybrid temporal learner that fuses recurrent memory with temporal convolution to capture multiscale dynamics. For predictive assessment, numerical experiments are conducted on one year solar power database of the Yulara Solar Project, Australia. The proposed RR-LTNet consistently outperforms other feature extraction methods by achieving up to 90% reductions in root mean square error (RMSE) for 5-min resolution. The reductions are significantly larger when baseline models are augmented with RR-aware features than when those features are absent. Cross-site validation on two additional PV plants with different capacity and data distribution confirms robustness and consistency required for system engineering deployment across fleets. By surfacing variability intelligence in real time, RR-LTNet supports PV-specific tasks central to reserve scheduling, advanced simulation of PV plant-grid interactions. This framework thus bridges PV monitoring analytics with system level reliability engineering, accelerating the integration of large-scale PV into modern power systems.</description></item><item><title>A 15-bit ROIC With Current-Mode Folding Integration Technique for Microbolometer Thermal Imagers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11223065</link><description>This article presents a 52-mK noise-equivalent temperature difference (NETD) reference-cell-free wide temperature sensing range readout integrated circuit (ROIC) for a microbolometer thermal imager.

The design is facilitated by a passive pole-optimized second-order noise-shaping successive-approximation register (NS SAR) quantizer. A sampling&#8211;settling-merged technique is proposed with the assistance of a canceling conductance output stage, leading to significantly suppressed sampling errors and an extension of the available time budget for the NS SAR quantizer. The technique merges the NS SAR quantizer&#8217;s sampling phase with the settling phase of the integration of the continuous-time (CT) feedback digital-to-analog converter (DAC), achieving a power-efficient integration and sampling process. This approach relaxes the operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) requirements in the CT loop and enhances both the resolution and power efficiency of the DSM. The NS SAR quantizer, featuring left-half-circle (LHC) poles, enables complex conjugate poles optimization for the noise transfer function, enabling an excess loop delay compensation (ELDC)-free design. Fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, the prototype analog-to-digital converter achieves a 71.6-dB signal-to-noise and distortion ratio within the 5-MHz bandwidth at an oversampling ratio of 20.

Although triple-well on-chip solar cells improve photovoltaic conversion efficiency, their multiport output characteristics pose design challenges: conventional parallel output schemes cannot address the mismatch in maximum power point (MPP) voltages among ports, thereby limiting energy extraction efficiency. Moreover, fully integrated EH systems lack external storage, and input&#8211;output coupling renders traditional voltage regulation unsuitable. To address these challenges, this article presents a fully integrated dual-channel EH system that employs a dual-port, independently boosted parallel architecture combined with a frequency-driven lightweight self-regulation mechanism, eliminating the need for conventional regulators. Measurement results show that the system achieves a stable output voltage of approximately 1.22 V, a peak end-to-end efficiency of 63.97%, and a 6.31% improvement in maximum output power, while also exhibiting reliable start-up and ripple suppression, providing valuable guidance for the design of efficient power extraction and self-regulation in on-chip photovoltaic EH systems.</description></item><item><title>AHCO-YOLO: An Algorithm&#8211;Hardware Co-Optimization Framework for Energy-Efficient and Real-Time Object Detection on Edge Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11218222</link><description>Real-time object detection on edge devices operates under tight computational, memory, and power budgets. Prior work typically treats model compression and hardware acceleration independently, yielding suboptimal trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and energy. We present AHCO-YOLO, an algorithm&#8211;hardware co-optimization framework (AHCO) that unifies model design, quantization, design space exploration (DSE), and hardware implementation. This approach overcomes the limitations of isolated methods and delivers synergistic gains. We introduce a hardware-friendly, lightweight You Only Look Once (YOLO) model with batch normalization (BN)-preserving quantization method that reduces the model size while maintaining accuracy at low precision. In addition, we propose a layer-specific resource&#8211;latency-aware DSE (LSRLA-DSE) method that selects the optimal dataflow based on layer-wise features and searches hardware design parameters under latency and resource constraints. Furthermore, we propose a FIFO-based streaming architecture with layer-wise dynamic dataflows that maintains high processing element (PE) utilization while minimizing off-chip traffic. Moreover, we introduce a semantic partition and regrouping strategy (SPRG) that improves resource efficiency and throughput. Implemented on a Xilinx ZCU104 FPGA, AHCO-YOLO-T achieves 79.8 FPS at 64.8% mAP, delivering 41.9 FPS/W and 80.5 GOPS/W.

However, accelerating DRL on hardware platforms faces three major challenges: 1) large memory footprint of experience replay data; 2) inefficient weight access due to weight transposition; and 3) computational imbalance across processing elements during deep neural network (DNN) inference and training. To address these issues, we propose E2CAP, an energy-efficient field-programmable gate array (FPGA) accelerator tailored for DRL workloads. E2CAP integrates a compression strategy that significantly reduces the data volume of the experience pool in the DRL model, enabling on-chip deployment of the experience pool. In addition, E2CAP features a configurable array processing core (CAP) based on configurable processing elements (CPEs) that support both intra-PE and inter-PE configurability. This design effectively addresses the issues of weight trans position and computational imbalance, improving computational efficiency and hardware resources utilization. We implement full on-chip DRL inference and training using the DQN algorithm on E2CAP. Experimental results demonstrate a 98.19% compression ratio for experience replay data. Compared to the state-of-the-art CPU and GPU, E2CAP achieves  $33.01\times $  and  $17.72\times $  higher energy efficiency, respectively, while outperforming existing FPGA-based DRL accelerators in multidimensional performance.</description></item><item><title>SConvNSys: Accelerating Spiking Convolutional Neural Networks With a Reconfigurable Neuromorphic Architecture for Diverse Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11247941</link><description>In recent years, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have progressively closed the performance gap with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are renowned for their success in complex artificial intelligence tasks. However, most existing SNN accelerators suffer from limited flexibility, lacking support for diverse convolutional topologies and struggling to deploy complex SNN models. To address these challenges, this article proposes a reconfigurable neuromorphic architecture, SConvNSys, tailored for accelerating spiking CNNs (SCNNs) across a wide range of applications. A fast, sparse detection technique, coupled with a dedicated sparse response unit, is introduced to effectively exploit the spatio-temporal sparsity inherent in spike-based computation. On this basis, a reconfigurable spiking convolution dataflow is designed to optimize computation across various SCNN structures. The proposed architecture supports multiple convolution types, including standard, transposed, dilated, and residual convolutions. Implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), SConvNSys achieves competitive results: for image classification, it attains recognition accuracies of 91.48% on CIFAR-10 and 68.54% on CIFAR-100, with a power consumption of just 1.8 W and a processing rate of 73 frames/s. In image segmentation tasks, it reaches 99.00% segmentation accuracy at 153 frames/s. For object detection, the proposed detection model achieves a mean intersection over union (MIoU) of 74.20%, with 0.11 giga operations (GOP) of convolutional computation, resulting in a throughput of 27.4 giga operations per second (GOPS) and an energy efficiency of 15.23 GOPS/W.</description></item><item><title>Weightless Neural Networks on Flexible Substrates: A Novel Approach to Wearable Machine Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11267783</link><description>In this article, we present a novel approach that seamlessly integrates machine learning (ML) algorithms into wearable technology through the use of weightless neural networks (WNNs) and flexible integrated circuits (FlexICs).

HBM is typically integrated with other systems-on-chip (SoCs) through a silicon interposer, and the primary bottleneck in aggressively scaling the bandwidth in next-generation HBM systems stems from significant crosstalk caused by closely spaced, high-density parallel interconnects in the interposer. While crosstalk avoidance code (CAC) has emerged as a promising solution, prior CAC schemes suffer from low bit efficiency and considerable hardware overhead. This article proposes an efficient CAC scheme, WITCH, which employs a novel weighted coding strategy. Unlike prior approaches that consider all channels identically, WITCH assigns different weights to channels based on their relative positions in the array, enabling more bit-efficient crosstalk suppression. We also present WITCH with additional shielding (WITCH-AS), an extension of WITCH that incorporates additional shielding to further reduce crosstalk levels. Our coding schemes achieve high bit efficiency, up to 17.3% higher than state-of-the-art techniques while providing an identical level of crosstalk reduction. Simulation results using an industry-proven channel model demonstrate that WITCH and WITCH-AS improve eye height by 10.1%&#8211;49.4% and 17.1%&#8211;51.1%, respectively. Furthermore, we propose an area- and energy-efficient hardware implementation that can be integrated into real-world HBM systems. The design reduces area and critical path delay by 31.0% and 28.2%, respectively, compared with conventional designs. Finally, we propose a compatible simultaneous switching output (SSO) noise mitigation technique that can be seamlessly integrated into WITCH to further enhance signal integrity under high-speed, high-density operating conditions.</description></item><item><title>A Heterogeneous CIM Architecture With Splittable Nonvolatile Computing-in-SRAM Cell Pairs Enabling Efficient On-Chip Neural Network Inference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11239474</link><description>Heterogeneous computing-in-memory (CIM) offers a promising solution for efficient neural network (NN) accelerations by leveraging the characteristics of different types of memories. However, the previous heterogeneous CIM either requires additional data transfer between different types of isolated memories or solely relies on in situ embedded single-level (SL) or three-level (TL) nonvolatile memories (NVMs), making it difficult to trade off between storage density and robustness benefits. In this article, a new heterogeneous CIM architecture (NVS-SPT) with enhanced storage density and inference robustness is proposed to enable full on-chip acceleration of practical-scale NNs while scalable to larger models. A splittable nonvolatile computing-in-static random access memory (SRAM) cell pairs (nvS2RAM-CIM) is proposed with hybrid in situ embedded SL and TL resistive random access memory (ReRAM) groups, allowing flexible configuration as split or linked state to enhance storage density and restore yield. A layerwise hybrid-coding search (LHCS) algorithm with bitwise and tritwise data-aware mapping (BTM) method is proposed to determine the optimal weight coding patterns with high array utilizations. In addition, a merged hybrid-coding block (MHCB) generation scheme is employed to enable high computing parallelism by merging the dense computing patterns. The proposed NVS-SPT demonstrates up to  $4.2\times $  higher storage density compared with previous heterogeneous CIM with pure SL-ReRAMs and achieves up to 44.7% enhanced NN accuracy, compared with previous unified ternary coding. Furthermore, the proposed NVS-SPT exhibits up to  $1.72\times $  and  $1.44\times $  enhanced energy efficiency with  $3.10\times $  and  $1.42\times $  higher computing density, compared with previous heterogeneous CIM based on pure SL- or TL-ReRAMs, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Power Speech-Based Depression Recognition Processor With Hierarchical Local&#8211;Global Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11224022</link><description>Depression is a critical public health concern characterized by underdiagnosis, often due to stigma, lack of awareness, and reluctance to seek help. Cases of delayed intervention could be alleviated by wearable solutions which enable continuous and unobtrusive monitoring of depression indicators. Compared to electroencephalogram (EEG)-based and video-based depression recognition, speech-based approaches can be performed without deliberate user attention. However, due to the limited accuracy of existing algorithms and constrained resources at edge, performing accurate speech-based depression recognition on wearable platforms remains a challenge. Therefore, to achieve unobtrusive, accurate, and efficient depression recognition at edge, this work presents a hierarchical local&#8211;global network (HLG-Net) and optimized processor design for speech-based depression recognition. The proposed HLG-Net integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with multihead attention (MHA) mechanism to simultaneously capture local acoustic features and global utterance-level coherence, enhancing depression stage recognition. For efficient processor design, a cross-layer buffered dataflow is proposed for efficient data handling, reducing data storage by 98.77%. The computing unit (CU) employs layer fusion, operator optimization, and quantization techniques to further improve resource utilization and reduce power consumption while preserving recognition accuracy. System-level low-power techniques such as clock/input gating and near-threshold design for application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) further reduce power consumption. The proposed processor implemented on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) (XC7Z100-2FFG900) achieves the lowest reported mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.13 on AVEC 2014 database. The 180-nm ASIC implementation shows a simulated power consumption of  $17.4~\mu $ W at 0.4 V. The results demonstrate the feasibility of accurate and efficient speech-based depression recognition on wearables.</description></item><item><title>Continuous Matrix Transposition for a Subclass of Matrices Using Minimal Memory</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11239467</link><description>Transposing matrices is essential in various fields, including signal processing and machine learning, making efficient hardware implementations for real-time processing highly desirable. The transposition of general matrices in a stream using memory is mathematically formalized. A novel algorithm has been developed to compute the necessary sequence of addresses for the memory whose depth is parametrizable and reducible to its theoretical minimum. For the subclass of matrices, where one dimension is a power of two and the other is two, it has been determined that the recursions in this algorithm exhibit logarithmic time complexity when minimal memory is used. Subsequently, it is shown how efficient transposition circuits can be built for these matrices, achieving minimal latency and full throughput. The proposed solution and recently published designs have been simulated for an ASIC implementation using the 45-nm NanGate Open Cell Library and compared for all suitable matrix dimensions of up to  $2\times 512$ . For the considered configurations, the results indicate for the proposed approach a memory saving of up to 33.3% over the state of the art. Overall area savings of up to 24.9% were achieved, making the new scheme very favorable for deployments with restricted area. Further advantages are seen with an average frequency increase of 13.7% and a lowered power consumption by up to 29.6%.</description></item><item><title>An Energy-Efficient Kalman Filter Coprocessor Design for Multiple-Object Tracking Targeting at Video Understanding</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11239472</link><description>Energy-efficient Kalman filter (KF) designs are inevitable in multiple-object tracking (MOT), a challenging computer vision task, for real-time mobile applications such as smart glasses, nanodrones, and mobile robots. VLSI design for KF is a feasible way to implement the required complex matrix operations; however, direct implementations are inefficient due to the data sparsity and redundant calculations existing inside. This article introduces an energy-efficient KF coprocessor, which improves computational efficiency by employing KF formula simplifications, matrix sparsity and symmetric properties, and common coefficient sharing, along with a dedicated but flexible hardware architecture. In contrast to state-of-the-art (SOTA) application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designs that rigidly customize several hardware modules for specific formulations in KF, our architecture executes all formulations in one hardware, enabling both flexibility and high efficiency. Implementation results demonstrate up to  $44.8\times $  improvement in energy efficiency over SOTA solutions, achieving 110.2 GOPs/J when executed at 180 MHz, which supports 120-FPS real-time multiobject tracking.</description></item><item><title>EVMx: An FPGA-Based Accelerator for Smart Contract Processing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11230572</link><description>Ethereum leverages smart contracts (SCs) to power decentralized applications (dApps), with execution handled by the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) within an Ethereum client. Other blockchain platforms, including Avalanche, Polkadot, Aurora, and Cardano, have also adopted the EVM.

Furthermore, EVMx executes entire Ethereum blocks with a percentage reduction in execution time between 6% and 56% against comparable FPGA implementations and 98% to 99% compared to CPU-based EVMs in the literature. These results demonstrate the potential of EVMx to significantly accelerate SC execution and enhance the performance of EVM-compatible blockchains.</description></item><item><title>A 95.3% 12-Class, 108-nJ/Inference Keyword Spotting Chip With Hybrid FFT-BFNet Architecture and Exponent-Aware Nonuniform Quantization in 65-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11259055</link><description>This article presents a 65-nm keyword spotting (KWS) chip that achieves 95.3% accuracy on 12-class tasks with 108.04-nJ/inference efficiency through cross-domain hardware-algorithm innovations. The unified fast Fourier transform (FFT)-butterfly-structured neural network (BFNet) accelerator fundamentally rethinks computational reuse: by replacing dense pointwise convolutions with butterfly-based sparse operations mirroring FFT&#8217;s dataflow, it slashes  $6.3\times $  multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations and halves parameter counts while preserving model expressivity. A 6-bit exponent-aware nonuniform quantization (EANUQ) scheme compresses weights, achieving a 25% reduction in storage while maintaining an accuracy loss of less than 0.01% with lightweight on-chip decoders. Hardware resource sharing extends beyond computation: Mel-filter-banks reuse fully-connected (FC) layer multipliers through decomposed 8-bit arithmetic, and FFT output buffers double as convolutional neural network (CNN) feature map memory.

Our design is the first pipelined CTC Viterbi decoder architecture tailored for nanopore sequencing and is implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-7 (VC707) FPGA within a Linux-capable reduced instruction set computer-fifth generation (RISC-V) system-on-chip (SoC). The accelerator processes over 23&#8198;000 DNA bases per second at 100 MHz with about  $4.3~\boldsymbol {\mu }$ s per-sample latency and only 0.43-W overhead power. This corresponds to  $\textbf {5.3}\times \mathbf {10^{4}}$  bases/J ( $19~\boldsymbol {\mu }$ J/base) and yields approximately 7x end-to-end speedup over a CPU baseline, while reserving the baseline read-identity accuracy. For the same CTC task, the accelerator delivers 29x higher throughput than a recent FPGA beam-search decoder. These results demonstrate the viability of dedicated decoding accelerators for real time, on-device genomic processing in power-constrained environments.</description></item><item><title>An Energy-Efficient Edge Coprocessor for Neural Rendering With Explicit Data Reuse Strategies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11301889</link><description>Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have transformed 3-D reconstruction and rendering, facilitating photorealistic image synthesis from sparse viewpoints. This work introduces an explicit data reuse neural rendering (EDR-NR) architecture, which reduces frequent external memory accesses (EMAs) and cache misses by exploiting the spatial locality from three phases, including rays, ray packets (RPs), and samples. The EDR-NR architecture features a four-stage scheduler that clusters rays on the basis of  $Z$ -order, prioritize lagging rays when ray divergence happens, reorders RPs based on spatial proximity, and issues samples out-of-orderly (OoO) according to the availability of on-chip feature data.

Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) have emerged as effective hardware security primitives for device identification and attestation. However, integrating PUFs into existing designs is often manual, labor-intensive, and incurs high overhead in area, power, and design time. Moreover, traditional PUFs are typically localized to small regions of a chip, limiting entropy extraction from the full design surface. To address these limitations, we propose ASTRA, an automated framework that integrates PUF-based entropy sources into digital logic circuits in a distributed and timing-aware fashion. ASTRA enhances the conventional logic synthesis flow by inserting memory-in-logic PUFs (MeLPUFs), which are constructed using standard cell elements and offer high entropy. By distributing MeLPUF primitives across the circuit, ASTRA maximizes response randomness while minimizing area and power overhead. It can also reuse existing logic elements and supports multiple MeLPUF templates. ASTRA ensures timing constraints are respected and enables validation of both functional and logic equivalence checking (LEC) between the original and PUF-inserted designs. Experimental results show that ASTRA achieves near-ideal PUF quality metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability for secure hardware design.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient VLSI Architecture for Hammerstein-Type Spline Adaptive Filters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11218027</link><description>The Hammerstein spline adaptive filter (HSAF) is a class of nonlinear adaptive filters (NAFs), known for its flexible nonlinear modeling and low complexity in applications, such as self-interference cancellation in wireless communications.

The multibit fusion (MF) scheme enhances energy efficiency by fusing low-bit results, which typically require multiple read-out cycles, into a single-cycle read out. However, the relationship between hybrid INT-CIM circuit design and network performance based on the MF scheme has not yet been systematically explored. In addition, we investigate how different MF configurations affect the performance of various neural networks. To address this gap, we first propose a less-significant group quantization (LSGQ) model, which defines and explores the design space of hybrid INT-CIM. Second, we develop a FastFuse-Search (FFS) algorithm, which optimizes configurations for different networks to strike a better balance between model accuracy and energy efficiency. Based on the experimental results, some key considerations on hybrid CIM design are derived. FFS yields a  $1.72\times $  energy-efficiency boost with negligible accuracy loss. Finally, we fabricate a 28-nm hybrid INT-CIM test chip, achieving 59.74 TOPS/W and 0.96 TOPS/mm2, with performance metrics of 23.21 perplexity for GPT-2, 68.69% accuracy for ResNet18, and 80.53% accuracy for ViT.</description></item><item><title>A Crosstalk Suppressed Reconfigurable Fully Passive Multichannel Noise-Shaping SAR ADC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11239512</link><description>This brief presents a reconfigurable multichannel noise-shaping (NS) SAR analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with crosstalk suppression.

Traditional noncoherent modulation schemes, such as pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), are reaching their scalability limits at higher data rates, making coherent detection increasingly attractive due to its higher spectral efficiency. Coherent detection systems leverage advanced modulation formats such as dual-polarization quadrature amplitude modulation (DP-QAM) but typically depend on complex digital signal processing (DSP) for polarization, phase, and timing recovery, resulting in increased power consumption. To address this, analog signal processing techniques have been explored for low-power coherent optical receivers (RXs) with several quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK)-based designs reported. However, 16-QAM remains underexplored due to its higher complexity. This article presents a low-power 16-QAM coherent optical RX designed for short-reach data center interconnects, featuring a decision-directed 16-QAM phase detector (PD) that improves carrier-phase recovery and tracking by leveraging both inner and outer constellation symbols. Fabricated in a 28-nm complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS), the RX achieves a bit error ratio (BER) of 1E&#8722;10 at 64 Gb/s with a 20-MHz carrier-phase recovery loop bandwidth (BW) while consuming 1.54 pJ/bit. These results demonstrate the potential for scalable and power-efficient coherent RXs in future short-reach optical interconnects.</description></item><item><title>A 108 Gb/s PAM-4 VCSEL-Based Direct-Drive Optical Engine for Co-Packaged Optics Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11165151</link><description>This article presents a multimode vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL)-based direct-drive optical engine for co-packaged optics (CPOs) applications that employs pulse amplitude modulation (PAM)-4 to enhance shoreline bandwidth (BW) density and features a compact direct optical wiring (DOW) approach for on-package fiber termination. On the transmit side, a VCSEL driver (VCDRV) comprising a passive complementary-drive complex-zero continuous-time linear equalizer (CZ-CTLE) is introduced to compensate for the VCSEL&#8217;s complex-pole response while offering the high linearity required for PAM-4 signaling. The receiver integrates a high-linearity transimpedance amplifier front-end (TIA-FE) capable of handling large input current swings, followed by an active CZ-CTLE to equalize the complex-pole pair response of the low-gain shunt-feedback transimpedance amplifier (TIA). The transceiver prototype, fabricated in a 22-nm FinFET process and integrated on-package with optical devices and fiber-termination, achieves a PAM-4 data rate of 108 Gb/s with a record energy efficiency (EE) of 0.9 pJ/b&#8212;representing over  $1.7\times $  improvement in data rate compared to previously reported VCSEL-based transceivers.

Dynamically optimizing guardbands can help achieve all of these goals with minimal design and chip area costs, leveraging on-chip sensors and targeted investments in test and firmware. Many chips use fixed voltage guardbands at each supported frequency to safeguard correct operation in the field from all threatening sources of variation, including VDD power-supply droops from sudden workload changes, temperature excursions, and device aging. Previously, advances in robust error recovery and power-supply droop mitigation techniques have been used independently to reduce required guardbands and save power.

In HBM standards, WDQS buffers experience abrupt load current ( $I_{\mathrm {L}}$ ) transitions, leading to significant voltage droop in the environment of the complexity of the power delivery network (PDN). However, conventional analog LDOs (ALDOs) and event-driven LDOs (ED-LDOs) suffer from a limited loop bandwidth, making it difficult to prevent large voltage droops and PSIJ degradation. To address these challenges, the proposed CA-HLDO leverages a unique property of memory systems: the magnitude and timing of  $I_{\mathrm {L}}$  are deterministic based on commands from the host. Exploiting this property, the CA-HLDO proactively sources a current ( $I_{\mathrm {D}}$ ) that matches  $I_{\mathrm {L}}$  precisely at the time of its occurrence, thereby minimizing voltage droop and reducing the settling time ( $T_{\mathrm {S}}$ ). The architecture includes an  $I_{\mathrm {D}}$  adaptor to dynamically adjust the magnitude of  $I_{\mathrm {D}}$  and a control signal generator (CSG) to calibrate the timing of  $I_{\mathrm {D}}$  sourcing. Fabricated in a 40-nm CMOS, the CA-HLDO achieved sub-10-mV voltage droop and 400-ps settling time using a small output capacitor and minimal quiescent current ( $I_{\mathrm {Q}}$ ). In addition, it provides a power-supply rejection (PSR) more than 10 dB across all frequencies, effectively mitigating PSIJ caused by a noisy and complex PDN.</description></item><item><title>IBM Telum II Microprocessor: 5.5 GHz With On-Die AI and Data Processing, and Design&#8211;Technology Co-Optimizations for Power, Area, and Reliability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11173265</link><description>The IBM Telum II microprocessor features eight cores operating at a base frequency of 5.5 GHz, ten 36-MB L2 caches achieving 3.6-ns access latency, a 360-MB virtual L3 cache, and a new on-chip data processing unit (DPU) for I/O acceleration.

Owing to its short modeling time, computational simplicity, and high rendering quality, it is expected to replace traditional 3-D graphics on edge devices. However, its substantial memory access requirements and the challenges of real-time modification present major barriers to deployment on mobile augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) platforms. We present a spatial computing system-on-chip (SoC), IRIS, to enable real-time, spatially interactive rendering with surface-aware modelling (SAM). The architecture of IRIS introduces three key hardware features. First, the surface perception unit (SPU) reduces external memory access (EMA) and minimizes Gaussian sorting latency by clustering Gaussians based on surface alignment. Second, the reconfigurable ApproxLP (ALP)-based multiply-accumulator array (RAMA) achieves high computational efficiency and throughput during neural Gaussian feature generation and mesh deformation. Finally, the error direction cache (EDC) enables fast and efficient modeling by eliminating redundant backpropagation (BP) operations. As a result, IRIS is fabricated using a 28-nm process and occupies a die area of 20.25 mm2. When evaluated on the SyntheticNeRF dataset, IRIS achieves  $34.3{\times }$  faster interactive rendering and consumes  $300.0{\times }$  less energy per frame compared to an edge GPU, despite having  $21.3{\times }$  lower external memory bandwidth.</description></item><item><title>An Edge 3-D Gaussian Splatting Processor Based on Shape-Aware Computation Architecture and Spatio-Temporal Gaussian Cache</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11222650</link><description>Three-dimensional Gaussian splatting (3D GS) is capturing attention due to its widespread applications in cutting-edge fields. Compared with the traditional neural radiance field (NeRF)-based methods, 3D GS demonstrates superior rendering realism and speed on high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). However, 3D GS still faces challenges on edge devices. First, rasterization in 3D GS requires a large number of operators and a high bitwidth. This resource-intensive dataflow leads to significant power consumption and area overhead. Moreover, the extensive input-dependent ineffective computation in 3D GS causes unnecessary computational delays. Finally, the irregular and repeated access pattern of off-chip Gaussian parameters presents challenges for external memory access (EMA). To address these challenges, this work presents an energy-efficient edge 3D GS processor featuring: 1) a shape-aware reconfigurable rasterization&#8211;interpolation computation architecture reducing area and power overhead; 2) an online shape-aware early skipping controller (SESC) which efficiently detects ineffective computation; and 3) a spatio-temporal Gaussian cache to alleviate EMA overhead. The fabricated silicon prototype achieves a maximum throughput of 373 fps and a minimum rendering energy of  $0.58~\text {mJ}/\text {frame}$ .

When implemented with computing-in-memory (CIM), MX allows an attractive tradeoff between accuracy and hardware efficiency for specific neural network (NN) workloads. This work presents the first multi-mode gain-cell (GC) CIM macro capable of processing MX, integer (INT), and FP multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations with high energy efficiency (EEF) and area efficiency (AEF). The proposed macro employs four important innovations: 1) a multi-mode input processing unit (M2-IPU) with SS-variance-aware MAC flow (SS-VAF) for SS processing and SS alignment within the CIM macro to reduce system-to-CIM data transfer and compute energy; 2) a pattern-aware hybrid adder tree (PAH-ADT), which improves EEF and AEF by optimizing the common input patterns; 3) an accumulation-aware data flow (A2-DF) that adjusts the write path based on accumulation size to reduce data transfer energy; and 4) a 3.xT GC, which boosts data retention time (DRT) by increasing parasitic capacitance without additional area overhead. A 16-nm FinFET 216-kb MX&#8211;INT&#8211;FP multi-mode GC-CIM macro achieved 133.5 TFLOPS/W for MX-MAC with MXINT8 input, MXINT8 weight, and FP32 output; and 91.9 TFLOPS/W for FP-MAC with BF16 input, BF16 weight, and FP32 output.</description></item><item><title>A &#956;-NMC-&#916;-IMC Heterogeneous STT-MRAM Compute-in-Memory Macro Using &#916;-Clamping Bit Reduction for Noise-Tolerant Bayesian Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11215668</link><description>Nonvolatile compute-in-memory (nvCIM) macros integrate memory and computation to enable high-density multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) acceleration for inference tasks on low-power edge artificial intelligence (AI) devices.

However, deploying BNNs on nvCIM platforms poses several design challenges: 1) ensuring reliable in situ  $\Delta $ -weight generation using stochastic memory devices under write-monitor sense margin (WM-SM) degradation; 2) balancing inference accuracy against energy efficiency in dual-weight MAC operations; 3) preventing in-memory-compute (IMC) MAC sense margin (SM) degradation in large memory arrays; and 4) avoiding excessive MAC energy consumption due to bit-level  $\Delta $ -weight redundancy. This work addresses these challenges using a heterogeneous nvCIM macro featuring four key schemes: 1) self-compare write-termination (SCWT); 2) a heterogeneous nvCIM structure using near-memory compute (NMC) for  $\mu $ -compute and IMC for  $\Delta $ -compute ( $\mu {N}$ - $\Delta {I}$ ); 3) 2-D clamping-voltage scaling with sense margin compensation (2D-CVS-SMC); and 4)  $\Delta $ -clamping bit reduction (DCBR).

The proposed CR-PAM3 signaling provides tolerance to supply noise and reference offset in SE chiplet or die-to-die (D2D) interfaces by using forwarded clock as reference voltages instead of generating them at the RX side. To minimize power consumption for PAM3, a differentially weighted data driver is employed. The proposed XTC-combined FS-puller helps voltage level transition while canceling FEXT from adjacent channels. A decision feedback equalizer (DFE)-embedded sampler enables low-power feedback within 1&#8198;UI by eliminating the CML summer structure and directly adding a tap branch to the sampler. A digital on-chip foreground training sequence is used to sequentially train TX per-lane deskew, clock swing level, and RX quadrature error corrector (QEC). Six data lanes, two clock lanes, and one replica lane for testing are implemented using an on-chip 2-mm channel in a 28-nm CMOS technology. In the presence of 200-mVpp 120-MHz sinusoidal supply noise injected at TX, horizontal and vertical eyes with CR-PAM3 are measured as 0.34&#8198;UI and 121&#8198;mV at BER  $\lt 10^{-12}$ , while the conventional PAM3 eye is closed.</description></item><item><title>Laser Voltage Probing Attack Detection via Leakage Shift Monitoring Without Dedicated Sensors at 4.35% Area Overhead</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11173930</link><description>In this article, a novel architecture to detect laser voltage probing (LVP) attacks is introduced to make silicon systems secure against such threats, while pushing the area overhead to a level that is compatible with low-cost chip products. The inherent and sharp temperature rise due to the presence of a laser beam (i.e., an attack) is detected by sensing the resulting exponential leakage increase. In turn, this is achieved by sensing the leakage of the logic under protection via intermittent power gating, suppressing altogether area-hungry and explicit sensors in prior art. In particular, the rate of the virtual supply decay rate is sensed via simple and local voltage comparison. The proposed approach is seamlessly incorporated into an automated digital design flow, and the inherent resilience against process/voltage/temperature variations suppresses any postsilicon calibration. Extensive LVP attacks on a 28 nm testchip demonstrate attack decision margin well above six standard deviations, insignificant power overhead, percentage point-range performance degradation, and 4.35% area overhead ( $13.3{\times }$  better than prior best). This enables for the first time ubiquitous inclusion of LVP protection even in low-cost consumer electronics.</description></item><item><title>A 128-Gb/s PAM-4 Transmitter With Edge-Boosting Pulse Generator and Pre-Emphasis Asymmetric Fractional-Spaced FFE in 28-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10967239</link><description>This article presents a 128-Gb/s current-mode four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) transmitter (TX) with a pre-emphasis asymmetric fractional-spaced feed-forward equalizer (AFS-FFE) and an edge-boosting pulse generator.

To achieve low power consumption in next-generation HBM interfaces, the transmitter employs a hybrid equalizer composed of integrated pulsewidth modulation, a voltage mode feed-forward equalizer, and a delay line controller (DLC). The proposed hybrid equalizer technique reduces input/output capacitance, minimizes bandwidth degradation, and provides effective inter-symbol interference equalization and significant power reduction. The receiver utilizes a time-domain decoder, which halves the number of comparators and reference voltages compared to conventional decoder methods, minimizing hardware cost and design complexity. Additionally, using a low supply voltage in the decoder results in a slower rising slope of the comparator&#8217;s output, increasing the decodable range and enhancing power efficiency. Consequently, the proposed TRX achieves a 15-Gb/s data rate with an energy efficiency of 0.253 pJ/bit and occupies 0.0135 mm2.</description></item><item><title>A Duty-Cycle Switching 30-Gb/s Burst-Mode CDR With 1.6-ns Locking Time in 28-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10960670</link><description>This article presents a closed-loop type burst-mode clock and data recovery (BM-CDR) circuit with fast phase offset detection using 8/3x-fractional oversampling in the periodic preamble. The proposed phase offset detector achieves a resolution of 1/8 unit intervals (UIs) with a detection time of 4 UIs. A 2x-oversampling closed-loop bang-bang CDR is performed after the phase offset detection to provide jitter filtering. The switching between these two different oversampling ratios is realized in a single multi-phase clock generator (MPCG) by changing the duty-cycle in four differential quarter-rate clocks. Furthermore, fast duty-cycle switching (DCS) is introduced in the injection-locked ring oscillator (ILRO) design to speed up the transition from one sampling ratio to another. A prototype fabricated in 28-nm CMOS achieves a locking time of 1.6 ns at 30-Gb/s data rate, a BER of 1E-12 with a recovered clock integrated rms jitter of 398.4 fs. The jitter tolerance curve shows a corner frequency around 20 MHz with a 20-dB/dec slope in the low-frequency region. The receiver including the proposed CDR consumes 75.53 mW with 0.9-V supply and occupies an area of 0.148 mm2.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Jitter Fractional- N Digital PLL With Spur Cancellation Based on a Multi-DTC Topology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10976732</link><description>This work presents a low-jitter and low-spur fractional-N digital phase-locked loop (PLL) with a multi-path topology, each path having its own digital-to-time converter (DTC) and phase detector (PD).

A number of background adaptive digital algorithms are introduced to ensure a robust operation across PVT spreads. The implemented PLL prototype, fabricated in a 28 nm CMOS process, has an active area of 0.36 mm2 and dissipates 17.9 mW. At 9.25 GHz near-integer channels, the measured worst case fractional spur is below  $-\textrm {60}$  dBc, with an rms jitter of 77.1 fs, leading to  $-\textrm {249.7}$  dB jitter-power figure-of-merit.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Band RF Transmitter Employing a Transformer-Based N-Path Switched-Capacitor Modulator for CIM3 Suppression</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964110</link><description>A multi-band high-linearity radio frequency (RF) transmitter features a transformer-based N-Path switched-capacitor (SC) modulator to perform third-order harmonic (3x $f_{\mathrm {LO}})$  suppression, and tunable high-Q bandpass filtering to reduce the out-of-band (OB) noise emission. The intrinsic lowpass characteristic of the transformer also aids in suppressing the 3x $f_{\mathrm {LO}}$  harmonic terms in the modulator, reducing the third-order cross-intermodulation product (CIM3) at the transmitter output. To enhance the transmitter efficiency and preserve the linearity, the power amplifier (PA) driver features a class-A/B transconductor (g ${}_{\mathrm {m}})$  parallelized with a gm linearizer biased in the triode region.

To reduce power loss when  $R^{{3}}$  rectifier is in freewheeling mode, transmission power control is essential, with accurate detection of the receiver (RX) mode being the key requirement. Currently, most detecting methods rely on a fixed threshold derived from the steady-state transmission current amplitude, which is only effective in a narrow-range coupling coefficient  $k$ . In this article, phase shift and near-zero-time detection methods are proposed to detect the RX mode correctly under a wide range  $k$ . The proposed method is based on the transient behavior in mode transition, which is insensitive to  $k$ . Moreover, a hybrid transmission power control, composed of a 1/15-density pulse frequency modulation and power transistors size-switching control, is introduced for further efficiency improvement. Both the transmitter (TX) and RX chips in the proposed WPT system have been fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu $ m CMOS process. Measured under the coil distance  $d_{\text {coil}}$  from 2 to 20 mm ( $k$  ranging from 0.39 to 0.1), the maximum output power  $P_{\text {O}}$  is 950 mW, and the peak efficiency reaches 74.3%. Furthermore, efficiency improvement is observed across various values of  $k$ , with a 27.9% peak enhancement at 75-mW  $P_{\text {O}}$  and 10-mm  $d_{\text {coil}}$  ( $k$  of 0.23).</description></item><item><title>Phase-Scalable CF-Cross-Connected-Based Hybrid DC-DC Converter With Auto VCF Balancing and Inactive CF Charging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964111</link><description>This article presents a multiple-phase (MP) flying  ${C}_{\mathrm { F}}$ -cross-connected (CCC)-based hybrid dc-dc converter for 12-V input to point-of-load (PoL) conversion. First, we illustrate the evolution of the proposed MP CCC converter from the conventional two-phase (2P) CCC converter. The proposed topology enables easy scalability in the number of active phases with the finest granularity. Second, we compare potential &#8220; ${I}_{\mathrm { L}}$ -balance&#8221; and &#8220; ${V}_{\mathrm { CF}}$ -balance&#8221; control schemes, selecting the &#8220; ${V}_{\mathrm { CF}}$ -balance&#8221; one for its higher efficiency and wider voltage conversion ratio (VCR) range. Third, in light-load conditions where certain phases are disabled and their  ${C}_{\mathrm { F}}$ s are discharged by leakage currents, this topology facilitates an inactive- $C_{\mathrm { F}}$  charging scheme. This prevents overstress on inactive switches and mitigates large inrush charging currents upon reactivation of  ${C}_{\mathrm { F}}$ s.

The easy scalability extends the VCR range and the load current range with high efficiency. Furthermore, it is suited for fault-tolerant schemes.</description></item><item><title>A Compact Photocurrent Recording IC With High-Linearity Dual PWM Buffered R-DACs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10966013</link><description>This article introduces a photocurrent recording front-end, emphasizing both energy efficiency and compact size. The proposed front-end circuit comprises a voltage-controlled oscillator-based quantizer (VCOQ) and a digital low-pass filter for feedback current, optimizing conversion efficiency. Furthermore, a dual pulse-width modulation (PWM)-based buffered resistive digital-to-analog converter (R-DAC) is employed for enhanced linearity and area efficiency. The PWM logic, implemented with a digital counter instead of conventional structures, reduces dynamic power requirements. Additionally, integrating a coarse R-DAC with extended bit depth into the digital filter feedback loop significantly enhances dynamic range (DR). The proposed architecture is further reinforced by loop gain calibration and a fast-settling feedforward path to mitigate parasitic effects on the passive integrator and reduce the data loss due to saturation caused by rapid input current fluctuations.

Neural network parameters can be stored in local analog non-volatile memories (NVMs), saving the energy required to move data between memory and logic. However, the main drawback of analog sub-threshold electronic circuits is their dramatic temperature sensitivity. In this paper, we demonstrate that a temperature compensation mechanism can be devised to solve this problem. We have designed and fabricated a chip implementing a two-layer analog neural network trained to classify low-resolution images of handwritten digits with a low-cost single-poly complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process, using unconventional analog NVMs for weight storage.

Multi-level RRAM cells have been investigated to improve memory density and cost-per-bit. However, sensing multi-level becomes challenging due to the smaller R-ratios between stored digital values. This paper introduces a novel time-based sensing (TBS) scheme for enhancing the sensing speed and robustness for single-level cells (SLC) to multi-level cells (MLC). The proposed time-based sensing scheme converts the bit line (BL) current into a time delay using a novel current-to-time converter (CTC). The BL-current-dependent time delays are utilized to generate digital data. In addition, the proposed sensing scheme executes sensing without need for reference current or reference voltage. Comprehensive simulation in 40nm CMOS technology shows that the proposed TBS scheme achieves better linearity and higher read speed by precise cell current replication in CTC compared to the prior TBS schemes. As a result, the proposed TBS reduces sensing latency by 230%~340% compared to the prior TBS schemes. Furthermore, the proposed TBS improves the variation tolerance of read operation by 5%~33% at 1.1 V.</description></item><item><title>A BiCMOS Circuit Interface for Low Power and Low Noise Magnetic Field Sensor Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11104817</link><description>Bio-magnetic sensing will have broad applications owing to its advantages of being non-invasive and having good spatial resolution. A wearable magnetic sensing device can realize long-term health monitoring for the purposes of medical research and diagnosis. The challenges underlying this technology are the simultaneous realization of low magnetic noise with low power consumption. Strain-modulated, multiferroic, vector magnetic field sensors have shown high sensitivity and low magnetic noise with small volume. To achieve a complete low power sensing system, this paper presents a low flicker noise readout circuit realized in SiGe BiCMOS 130 nm. The application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) achieves amplification and demodulation of the sensor output current using a differential, demodulation-first structure. The system includes demodulation noise cancellation to largely reduce the external noise from the modulation drive voltage, such that the magnetic noise of the sensor-readout system is improved.

First, a mathematical model that describes all the possible points of equilibrium is derived by exploiting the symmetry and regularity of the chain of gain stages that form the ring oscillator. The analysis then proceeds to determine the set of minimum conditions that guarantee that the ring oscillator can self-start. The result is a collection of equations that provides the proper design criteria to avoid any start-up failure. These criteria are only a function of the supply, the devices threshold voltage and the ratio between the forward and cross-coupled inverters. No further process technology or system parameters need be known. A graphic representation of the equations allows us to determine at a glance the region of guaranteed oscillations. Simulations that cover process and temperature corners of several 4-stage pseudo-differential ring oscillators built with different device sizes in a 7nm FinFET technology confirm the validity of the mathematical analysis, and the equations thereby derived.</description></item><item><title>A 2 &#215; 80 Gb/s Single-Ended TAS-TIS PAM-4 Receiver Front-End With Crosstalk Cancellation and Signal Reutilization in 28-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11099549</link><description>This paper presents a  $2\times 80$  Gb/s single-ended trans-admittance trans-impedance (TAS-TIS) 4-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) receiver with crosstalk cancellation and signal reutilization technique in 28-nm CMOS. Based on the TAS-TIS architecture, to achieve a precise cancellation of the far-end crosstalk, a common mode gain rejection methodology is proposed in the balanced differentiator, ensuring low gain mismatch and low phase skew.

An augmented  ${N} +4$  coupling matrix that incorporates the harmonic control (HC) network and the transistor is synthesized to characterize the filtering PA circuits. Due to the introduced HC node, the characteristic polynomials and coupling matrix are resynthesized. By leveraging the coupling matrix, the PA circuits can achieve a standard Chebyshev filtering response at the fundamental frequencies while simultaneously introducing arbitrary transmission zeros (TZs) at harmonic frequencies with precisely controlled phase. This technique greatly expands the flexibility and practicality of waveguide PAs, particularly because harmonic manipulation plays a crucial role in determining efficiency and saturated power. The performances of return loss and gain can be predicted by the coupling matrix. Furthermore, this technique facilitates seamless integration between on-chip transistors and 3D high-Q resonators, as well as HC circuits. Consequently, the need for additional planar matching circuits is eliminated, resulting reduced losses, improved efficiency, and a more compact system architecture. The technique is validated by using the 0.25- $\mu $ m GaN HEMTs microwave integrated circuits (MICs) at 3.3&#8211;3.5 GHz. The measured drain efficiency is from 62.8% to 67.7% at the saturated power of 38.8&#8211;39.1 dBm, and the adjacent channel leakage power ratios (ACLR) are &#8722;34.8/&#8722;33.5 dBc.

A noise-aware design flow is introduced to integrate the tuning of AuFEx parameters directly into the neural network classifier&#8217;s training process. This co-design approach enables the joint optimization of feature extractor and classifier within a unified framework. By incorporating noise during the training process, the system becomes more robust to variations in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), maintaining high inference accuracy even with lightweight neural network classifiers.

These RISC-V-based modern processors often use a pipeline architecture and frequently load data from memory to enhance the throughput. However, bubbles due to load-word (Data hazard) hazards will inevitably arise in the pipeline, causing degradation in CPI. The out-of-order pipeline processor can handle the bubble through scheduling but it introduces WAR (write after read) and WAW (write after write) making architecture more complex and not suitable for low-power applications. Hence, this paper proposes a novel lw-driven bubble-free five-stage pipelined RV32I processor core based on open-source RISC-V ISA, i.e. the proposed core is an in-order RISC-V processor core that can handle bubbles without any clock penalty due to stall. The core is implemented using Verilog HDL and prototyped on the commercially available Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA with a resource requirement of 1271 LUTs and 641 Registers. A notable 19.37% improvement in CPI is achieved compared to the state-of-the-art stalling algorithm on the same RV32I processor core. Comparing the proposed design to the traditional stall method, the score improved significantly by 14%, achieving a core mark score of  $1.06~CoreMark/MHz$ . The dynamic power consumption of the core is  $0.9~mW/MHz$  and is best suited for energy-constrained applications.</description></item><item><title>An FPGA-Based Frequency-Focused Vision Transformer Accelerator for Real-Time Inference on Edge Platforms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11165448</link><description>Vision Transformers (ViTs) often struggle to effectively capture local features. SpectFormer addresses this limitation by incorporating spectral blocks into the shallow layers of DeiT. However, deploying SpectFormer on edge devices is challenging due to its high computational complexity, the implementation of spectral blocks, additional matrix transpositions, and intensive nonlinear operations. To address these challenges, we propose an FPGA-based Frequency-focused Vision Transformer Accelerator (FFVTA), the first FPGA-based ViT accelerator that incorporates frequency-domain optimization for real-time inference of SpectFormer on edge devices. FFVTA employs a Unified DFT-Attention Matrix (UDAM) architecture to unify the computation of spectral and self-attention blocks, significantly enhancing the hardware reuse and reducing resource usage. Additionally, FFVTA introduces a Block-Broadcast Loop (BBL) Dataflow to efficiently accelerate matrix multiplication in self-attention blocks and a Configurable Two-Stage Log-Softmax (CTS-Log-Softmax) computation process to optimize nonlinear function computations. These innovations improve computational efficiency while reducing the resource usage. When deployed on a resource-constrained FPGA platform (KV260), FFVTA achieves a 16.61 $\times$  speedup compared to the baseline, with significant reductions in the hardware resource usage and power consumption. FFVTA demonstrates superior performance with an energy efficiency of 63.40 GOPs/W and a DSP efficiency of 0.46 GOPs/DSP. FFVTA not only achieves efficient acceleration for the hierarchical SpectFormer-H-S variant, but also attains competitive accuracy of 84.02% on ImageNet classification.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Low Latency Generalized Architecture for Complex Nth Root and Nth Power Computation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11153522</link><description>This paper proposes a novel computing architecture for high-precision, low-latency, low-power, and cost-effective computation of complex number Nth roots and Nth powers. By integrating the high-precision properties of the coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) algorithm with the low-latency benefits of piecewise linear (PWL) approximation, the architecture leverages the binary logarithm-antilogarithm relationship to compute roots and powers of arbitrary complex numbers.

Current CNN accelerators can efficiently handle CNN computations but cannot effectively accelerate the essential fast Fourier Transform (FFT) computations in mmWave radar signal processing, thus failing to achieve end-to-end high-efficiency radar signal processing. This work presents a low-cost energy-efficient FFT-CNN processor with a unified architecture that combines CNN and FFT to enhance performance for mmWave radar IoT applications. The proposed FFT-CNN processor employs a reconfigurable dual-mode processing element to maximize hardware resource sharing, supporting both butterfly operations for FFT and multiply-accumulate computations for CNN acceleration. This sharing technique reduces hardware resource consumption by 22.1% in LUTs, 22.7% in FFs, 9.5% in BRAMs, and 16.7% in DSPs, leading to a total power reduction of 34.9%. Compared to state-of-the-art processors optimized for radar applications, the proposed processor achieves the highest performance-to-resource ratio and energy efficiency, making it ideal for a wide range of low-cost radar IoT applications.</description></item><item><title>DiP: A Scalable, Energy-Efficient Systolic Array for Matrix Multiplication Acceleration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11098764</link><description>Transformers are gaining increasing attention across Natural Language Processing (NLP) application domains due to their outstanding accuracy. However, these data-intensive models add significant performance demands to the existing computing architectures. Systolic array architectures, adopted by commercial AI computing platforms like Google TPUs, offer energy-efficient data reuse but face throughput and energy penalties due to input-output synchronization via First-In-First-Out (FIFO) buffers. This paper proposes a novel scalable systolic array architecture featuring Diagonal-Input and Permutated weight stationary (DiP) dataflow for matrix multiplication acceleration. The proposed architecture eliminates the synchronization FIFOs required by state-of-the-art weight stationary systolic arrays. Beyond the area, power, and energy savings achieved by eliminating these FIFOs, DiP architecture maximizes the computational resource utilization, achieving up to 50% throughput improvement over conventional weight stationary architectures. Analytical models are developed for both weight stationary and DiP architectures, including latency, throughput, time to full PEs utilization (TFPU), and FIFOs overhead. A comprehensive hardware design space exploration using 22nm commercial technology demonstrates DiP&#8217;s scalability advantages, achieving up to a  $2.02\times $  improvement in energy efficiency per area. Furthermore, DiP outperforms TPU-like architectures on transformer workloads from widely-used models, delivering energy improvement up to  $1.81\times $  and latency improvement up to  $1.49\times $ . At a  $64\times 64$  size with 4096 PEs, DiP achieves a peak throughput of 8.192 TOPS with energy efficiency 9.548 TOPS/W.</description></item><item><title>FLAMES: Framework for Learning With Analog MEmory Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11195852</link><description>Online training is central for increasing the speed and accuracy of edge ML.

Most many-core architectures couple a standalone CPU core and a tensor core together as a compute node. However, the existing architectures suffer from inefficiency at the architecture, data flow, and control flow levels: The standalone scalar CPU core with deep out-of-order pipeline and low data parallelism per instruction incurs high hardware overhead and low throughput; Fixed proportions of CPU and tensor cores execute computations alternately in each cluster, leading to core under-utilization under diverse workloads; The MIMD parallelism strategy causes redundant instruction cache (I-Cache) accesses, which increases power consumption. To tackle the above limitations, we propose MRCIM, a many-core reconfigurable computing-in-memory (CIM) processor with reconfigurable cores featuring both CPU and tensor modes. 1) We design a reconfigurable CPU core by reusing the CIM-based tensor core&#8217;s inherent memory and computing logic to simplify the pipeline logic and improve the data parallelism of conventional CPU. 2) We propose interleaved workload execution (IWE) and adaptive workload mapping (AWM) scheduling strategies, which dynamically adjust the proportion of CPU core and tensor core in a cluster, making them work in parallel with high utilization. 3) We propose a hybrid MIMD/SIMD control flow to bypass unnecessary I-Cache accesses by instruction forwarding and sharing, thereby reducing power consumption. Experimental results show MRCIM achieves 166.48x~446.67x speedup and 96.76x~309.01x energy saving over Intel i9-13900k CPU, 12.62x~27.62x speedup and 5.49x~17.82x energy saving over NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU. Compared with state-of-the-art NN processor architectures, our MRCIM achieves average 6.84x, 7.51x, and 3.66x speedup and average 4.57x, 3.03x, and 3.11x energy saving over Simba, LUT-ICC, and MAICC.</description></item><item><title>An Optimized Digital Implementation of the Hodgkin&#8211;Huxley Neuron Model on FPGA: Enhancing Computational Efficiency for Biomedical and Neural Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142490</link><description>This study introduces an optimized FPGA-based digital implementation of the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model, aimed at reducing hardware complexity and energy consumption while maintaining biological accuracy.

However, the potential for further speed-up is constrained by the challenges associated with pipeline insertion and signal integrity preservation. Unlike ALPGs, test patterns in vector memory (VM) are generated by simply fetching pre-stored patterns without performing complex operations. Although its fetching logic is advantageous in high-speed operation, the speed of VM-based pattern generation is limited by the VM load speed. Furthermore, the limited VM capacity restricts the storage of extensive test patterns. To address the limitations of both approaches, a vector memory using bit-level address segmentation (VASE) that enables high-speed memory testing is proposed. VASE improves pattern generation speed by cyclically reusing test patterns while reducing the required VM capacity. Although VASE may impose some limitations on test algorithm coverage and incur overhead in logic area and power consumption, it still supports a wide range of commonly used test algorithms. Considering the speed improvements achieved, these trade-offs are acceptable for ATE applications.</description></item><item><title>Quartet: A Digital Compute-in-Memory Versatile AI Accelerator With Heterogeneous Tensor Engines and Off-Chip-Less Dataflow</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11130436</link><description>Although most AI core operations can be formulated as matrix multiplications (MMs), their characteristics are quite different. In some cases, one input may be a constant weight matrix while the other is a dynamic feature matrix, i.e., FWMM, or both inputs may be dynamic features as FFMM. Furthermore, the data involved can also be sparse, leading to variations like SpFWMM and SpFFMM. To address this challenge, this paper investigates a versatile accelerator architecture for AI algorithms based on heterogeneous tensor engines. For MM operators with varying characteristics, this paper proposes four-quadrant heterogeneous tensor engines to handle FWMM, SpFWMM, FFMM, and SpFFMM, respectively. These four tensor engines are comprised of SRAM-based single address digital compute-in-memory (CIM) array, SRAM-based multi-address digital CIM array, systolic array, and multi-SIMD array, respectively. In addition, to improve the AI execution efficiency, this paper proposes a dual-level multi-issue mechanism to achieve inter-operator and inter-block parallelization along with an off-chip-less dataflow enabled by on-chip unified memory pool. Thanks to the integration of aforementioned innovations, this paper develops a versatile AI acceleration chip Quartet, which achieves exceptional energy efficiency. Specifically, for graph convolutional network on PubMed, it demonstrates a  $19.56\times $  and  $3.47\times $  improvement in energy efficiency compared to similar works, ReDCIM and TensorCIM, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Homogeneous Versus Heterogeneous Graph Representation for Graph Neural Network Tasks on Electric Circuits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11098768</link><description>Machine learning (ML) has the potential to revolutionize electronic design automation (EDA), but mainly lacks the scalable and adequate representation of electric circuits, and requires diverse datasets that capture the performance of various electrical circuits. Literature shows methodologies that fall short on representing unlimited complexity circuits, in which models are hard coded to a limited certain circuit order, and are more focused on using a fixed circuit topology rather than providing a general purpose representation. This paper proposes a generalizable and scalable circuit graph representation based on bond graphs modeling as heterogeneous graph. Additionally, an analytical comparison between mapping the bond graph as either homogeneous or heterogeneous graph is shown. By analyzing the graph in spectral domain, the frequency component distribution of node features is found to impact the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) unique to the graph representation used. The analysis discusses inherent limitations of GNNs, and reveals that GNNs designed for heterogeneous graphs can more effectively capture system dynamics &amp; variations. Finally, different case studies are presented utilizing heterogeneous graph neural network (Hetero-GNN) for different ML tasks including dynamics prediction and converter classification.</description></item><item><title>Energy-Accuracy Trade-Offs in Massive MIMO Signal Detection Using SRAM-Based In-Memory Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11112521</link><description>This paper investigates the use of SRAM-based in-memory computing (IMC) architectures for designing energy efficient and accurate signal detectors for massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. SRAM-based IMCs are the state-of-the-art for executing deep learning workloads in terms of energy efficiency and compute density. However, given the more stringent accuracy requirements of massive MIMO signal detection compared to deep learning, it remains an open question whether the energy efficiency benefits of IMCs can be preserved while meeting these accuracy requirements. This paper systematically explores the energy-accuracy trade-off in massive MIMO signal detectors designed using SRAM-based IMCs. Through transistor-level behavioral modeling and simulations in 28 nm CMOS process, we evaluate the energy per information bit ( $E_{\mathrm {b}}$ ), error vector magnitude (EVM) and symbol error rate (SER) of linear detectors designed using SRAM-based IMCs for various wireless channels. We perform extensive design space exploration to determine the design parameters and operating conditions under which IMC-based linear detectors achieve significantly better energy efficiency than conventional digital implementations, while maintaining comparable accuracy. Our results show that IMC-based detectors can meet 3GPP EVM specifications for QPSK, 16-QAM, and 64-QAM across both real-world (Argos) and synthetic (WINNER-II) wireless channels, achieving  $7.2\times $  to  $11.7\times $  better energy efficiency than digital detectors while incurring  $\lt \mathrm {0.1~dB}$  penalty in receiver signal-to-noise ratio (RX SNR). We present extensive simulation results that provide insights into how parameters such as MIMO dimension, modulation scheme, precision of detection matrix, IMC bit-cell capacitance, IMC ADC precision, and ADC thermal noise impact the energy efficiency and accuracy of massive MIMO signal detection.</description></item><item><title>Differential Privacy Consensus in Dynamic Topologies: Performance Analysis and Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11133694</link><description>This paper investigates the differential privacy consensus problem for a class of multiagent systems under dynamic topologies. To meet the requirements of power consumption, a random communication strategy is proposed in which each agent sends data to its neighbors with different probabilities. For analyzing the effect of time-varying topology and coupling strength among agents on system performance, a necessary and sufficient condition for almost sure convergence of differential privacy consensus systems is established. Furthermore, the convergence rate and convergence accuracy of the system are also studied.

At first, a unified fully actuated distributed generation unit (FA-DGU) model is developed, integrating nonlinear load dynamics, renewable energy intermittency, attack-induced disturbances, and power line coupling into a lumped uncertainty framework. Then, a decentralized controller is designed using Radial Basis Function neural networks (RBFNNs) to adaptively approximate unknown ZIP load characteristics and attack-generated perturbations, eliminating dependence on communication networks while enabling plug-and-play (PnP) operations through purely local measurements. Following this, Lyapunov stability analysis rigorously proves the asymptotic convergence of voltage regulation errors at the point-of-common-coupling (PCC) under heterogeneous uncertainties. Finally, various uncertain scenarios in DC-MGs are simulated using MATLAB/Simulink, thereby verifying the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control method.</description></item><item><title>Fast Single-Loop Voltage-Based MPPT Using Sliding-Mode Control for Switched-Inductor Multi-Cell Boost Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11104276</link><description>A switched-inductor (SL) multi-cell boost converter is analyzed in this paper for a high-voltage gain application, stepping up a dc voltage from 36 V to 380 V in the first stage of a photovoltaic (PV) conversion chain. A fast maximum power point tracker (MPPT), processing the system input voltage, is used to extract the maximum power from the PV generator regardless of atmospheric conditions. A single sliding-mode control (SMC) loop forces the PV generator voltage to follow the maximum power point (MPP) voltage provided by a Perturb and Observe (P&amp;amp;O) algorithm. The sliding-mode analysis uses the equivalent control approach to demonstrate that the linearized ideal sliding dynamics are unconditionally stable. Theoretical predictions are corroborated by simulations and experimental measurements of the system under step-type changes in input irradiance and output load. The MPPT performance is experimentally evaluated against two classical approaches applied to a canonical boost converter: a current-based SMC and a voltage-based PWM. Both approaches track the MPP current and voltage, respectively, as given by the P&amp;amp;O algorithm. The proposed system outperforms the two classical systems, showing a better tracking accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Fast Unauthorized Energy Decryption for Frequency-Varying Wireless Power Without Additional Sensor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11193856</link><description>With the popularity of wireless charging, energy access protection and cybersecurity are gaining importance, especially in public places. Currently, the most common energy encryption method uses frequency and associated impedance variation. However, we have proven that this method is not reliable, since a hacker can detect the changing frequency and adjust the compensation. Still, the previously presented system needed time to follow the updated frequency, while encryption systems may vary the frequency faster to avoid energy theft. Furthermore, the previous system required an additional sensor coil. To solve these problems, we optimized the attack and the associated system, which can intrude and steal energy within 200  $\upmu$ s. The key is the elimination of the time-consuming maximum receiver current regulation. Also, we use the main receiving coil rather than any additional sensor antenna to detect the magnetic field. Thus, the new hardware is even simpler. A simulation model and experimental results demonstrate the fast response speed of the attack on encrypted wireless power and steal 65% of the power. Overall, the applicability of the attack is highly improved and leaves less room for hardening the encryption. The results demonstrate that energy access protection needs to be given great attention.</description></item><item><title>Nonlinear Power Injection Sensitivity Analysis in Power Systems: An Effective Strategy for Distributed Source Allocation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11225904</link><description>Distributed generation in power systems is currently attracting significant attention as a means to reduce energy generation costs through the exploitation of low-cost decentralized sources. Cost reduction becomes especially relevant when a large portion of the energy supplied by a centralized generator is replaced by energy from a few high-power distributed sources. However, the effectiveness and safety of this approach critically depend on the proper allocation of distributed generators. To this end, this paper presents a novel sensitivity analysis for system losses that highlights the nonlinear dependencies on power-injecting sources. It is shown that the parameters of the nonlinear model allow easy identification of a small subset of grid buses that are suitable candidates for large-power injection. At these buses, source sizing can be determined using standard optimal power flow techniques that minimize the energy cost function. The proposed allocation strategy is validated on the IEEE 69 and 85 benchmark bus grids, and its robustness is further confirmed through simulations that account for stochastic load fluctuations. Comparison with state of the art and robust source allocation approaches, such as the Iterative Search Method, shows that for similar accuracy the proposed method is two/three orders of magnitude faster.</description></item><item><title>Impact of Angle-Voltage Coupling on Small-Signal Stability of Power Systems: A Damping Perspective</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11230129</link><description>The rise of inverters integrated into power systems has raised enormous concerns about potential system instability. This paper aims to investigate the correlation between phase-angle and voltage dynamics and their impacts on the stability of power systems, focusing on damping perspectives. To this end, we first formulate a generic model to unify the dynamics of synchronous generators and diverse inverter-interfaced devices. By exploring systems&#8217; damping characteristics, we find that angle-voltage coupling tends to undermine stability by redistributing the system&#8217;s damping in a more dispersed manner, consequently rendering the system more vulnerable to inadequate or even negative damping. Our work also involves analyzing and quantifying the factors affecting coupling strength, including power flow, control parameters of devices, and the number of integrated inverters. A cross-loop control is also introduced to demonstrate the potential benefits of utilizing angle-voltage coupling to enhance stability. We validate these findings through simulations on a modified IEEE 39-bus system with heterogeneous inverters and other standard benchmarks with up to 500 buses. Simulations show the coupling&#8217;s impact on dispersing individual damping under 100% of the tested benchmarks. The rightmost eigenvalue shift varies from 20% to 80% under the coupling, which significantly influences the stability evaluation results. This comprehensive investigation yields insights into the complexities of angle-voltage coupling, which offers useful implications for the analysis and control of power systems.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Design of Load-Independent Class-E Zero-Voltage Switching Power Oscillator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119440</link><description>This paper proposes the load-independent class-E Zero-Voltage Switching (ZVS) power oscillator. Conventional class-E power oscillator has a load-dependent phase shift, which hinders sustained oscillation under varying load conditions. Hence, we introduce the class-E power amplifier that ensures the load-independent phase shift in the output current. By incorporating it into an LCLC filter with a resonant-capacitor feedback network, the load-independent self-oscillation is realized. The proposed power oscillator satisfies a phase-shift requirement for sustained oscillation regardless of the load resistance. Furthermore, the proposed circuit exhibits load independence in ZVS, output current, and gate-drive voltage. This paper provides a thorough analysis of the proposed power oscillator, covering its operating principle, power loss prediction, design, and limitations. This paper also gives two design examples with 0.8 MHz and 6.78 MHz oscillation frequencies. In the experiment, the prototype power oscillators achieved 93.8 % and 87.4 % power-conversion efficiencies, respectively. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed power oscillator are demonstrated from the experimental verifications.</description></item><item><title>Non-Linearity Analysis of Drain-Source Capacitance in Extended Continuous Class-F Power Amplifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11128873</link><description>This work presents a new design space of Extended continuous class-F (ECCF) power amplifiers with resistive second harmonic impedance after including the effect of non-linear drain-to-source capacitance  $C_{\mathbf {ds}}~_{\mathbf {}}$  of a transistor. The expression of current waveforms is modified to include the impact of nonlinear drain to source capacitance in this mode. The analysis shows that this non-linear capacitance generates harmonic current, which alters the load trajectory on the Smith chart by achieving active and modified passive second harmonic loads. These active harmonic loads at the current reference plane of the transistor represent an active harmonic injection that increases the drain efficiency. Consequently, a design methodology is proposed to obtain passive loads for matching that ensures this active harmonic injection at the current reference plane of the transistor provides an efficiency improvement in the ECCF mode while maintaining the operation more than the octave frequency range. The proposed theory is validated by designing a power amplifier operating from 0.8-3.0 GHz (115.7% fractional bandwidth) with a measured drain efficiency of 57.24-70.3%, and an output power of 41.7-44.63 dBm.

Therefore, a novel distributed prescribed-time (Di-PT) control methodology is developed to achieve this objective, which is composed of the regular output feedback and prescribed scaling function to accelerate the convergence process. Compared with the previously reported fixed-time control method, the upper bound of the convergence time (UB-CT) of the designed Di-PT control can be set explicitly and flexibly with much less conservativeness to evade the complicated inequality derivation of the Lyapunov-based convergence analysis. Its UB-CT does not require any calculation of control parameters and initial values. The designed Di-PT secondary control adopts a dual-layer architecture to decouple communication delays and unknown disturbances, such as hardware interferences and cyber attacks on the actuator. Through rigorous real-time simulation conducted on the RT-Unit platform, the superior performance of the designed control methodology has been demonstrated in terms of the improvement of power quality and disturbance robustness.</description></item><item><title>Offset-Immune Split-LSB Weight Calibration for Capacitor Mismatch and Gain Nonlinearity in Pipelined SAR ADC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11227128</link><description>This brief presents a digital background calibration technique that uses a split-least-significant-bit (Split-LSB) weight to simultaneously address both capacitor mismatch and gain nonlinearity in pipelined successive approximation register analog-to-digital converters (SAR ADCs).

A novel multi-mode architecture is proposed in the receiver (RX) chain, which supports reconfigurable low-noise (LN) and high-linearity (HL) operations with the RX chain reused for feedback observation (FBO). The RX achieves a noise figure of  $2.0-5.4$  dB in the LN mode, an IP1dB of &#8722;4.6 dBm and an IIP3 of +5.3 dBm in the HL mode. In the TX chain, a modified RFATT integrated with a symmetrical passive resistor network (SPRN) is utilized to achieve high precision, large dynamic power control and high linearity. The TX achieves &gt;92 dB TX power control range with 0.25-dB step, 62.0 dBc ACLR, &#8722;66.1 dBc IRR, and &#8722;38.8 dB EVM at 40-MHz 256QAM 802.11ac signal.

To enhance loop gain and improve the noise figure (NF) while achieving wideband input impedance matching, the differential outputs from the single-to-differential (S2D) converter are converted into a single-ended signal using a voltage-subtractor-based differential-to-single (D2S) buffer. This single-ended signal is then fed back to the input of the S2D converter through a feedback resistor. Additionally, two separate gain paths are implemented by employing two optimized S2D converters, one designed for low noise and the other for high linearity, to enable gain control while maintaining a nearly constant output 1 dB compression point (OP1dB) and OIP3. In particular, when very strong signals are received, the feedback path is disabled, and a pi-attenuator is activated in front of the S2D converter optimized for high linearity, in order to attenuate the signal while keeping a constant input impedance. A current-mode passive mixer with a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) is adopted to maintain low impedance and reduce the voltage swing at the mixer output, thereby enhancing linearity. In the measurement, the proposed receiver front-end shows an average conversion gain of 50.5 dB, NF of 3.3 dB, and OIP3 of + 24.3 dBm at high gain mode over the operating frequency band. In addition, it achieves a gain range of 49 dB with nearly constant OIP3. The current consumption is 12.4 mA from a 1.2 V supply.</description></item><item><title>Fixed-Time Consensus Tracking Control for Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems: A Dynamic Edge/Self-Triggered Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11269904</link><description>This brief investigates the fixed-time consensus tracking (FTCT) problem for nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs) via a dynamic edge-triggered (DET) control mechanism.

The framework innovatively integrates two optimization algorithms, including the Intercept Compensation and Error-Flattening Non-Uniform Segmentation Scheme for high-precision implementations and the Unity-Slope Piecewise Linear Approximation for low-precision implementations that require less hardware overhead. Employing constraint-driven automated exploration of adder count, segment count, error-redundancy factor, and segment-point bit-width, optimal parameters are selected for an optimized logarithmic converter implementation. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art designs with identical maximum absolute error constraints, the proposed circuits achieve superior area (up to 62.7% reduction), power (up to 62.4% reduction), and delay (up to 29.9% reduction), yielding 7.3%&#8211;88.5% improvements in the comprehensive error-area-delay-power (eADP) metric.</description></item><item><title>Fault Ride-Through Strategy for Hybrid Cascaded HVdc Systems Based on Controllable LCC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11222754</link><description>This brief proposes a fault ride-through (FRT) strategy for hybrid cascaded high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems using a controllable line-commutated converter (CLCC). Unlike conventional LCCs prone to commutation failures during AC faults, the CLCC provides forced commutation and ensures stable operation. When combined with series-connected modular multilevel converters (MMCs), it also limits transient overcurrents and overvoltages in vulnerable submodules. Modeling and control principles are outlined, and simulations under various fault conditions confirm that the CLCC both eliminates commutation failures and reduces MMC stress, enabling reliable FRT. These results highlight the CLCC&#8217;s potential to improve the resilience and engineering feasibility of future hybrid HVDC systems.</description></item><item><title>Frequency Synchronization Techniques for DC&#8211;DC Converters With Time-Based Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11245570</link><description>In this brief, a frequency synchronization method for time-based-controlled power converters is presented. The proposed synchronization technique makes it possible to precisely lock the internal oscillators frequency of the time-based controller (i.e., the power converter switching frequency) to any externally provided clock signal, without trading the dynamic performance. By leveraging the differential structure of the time-based controller, the proposed feedback loop operates orthogonally with respect to the main voltage regulation loop, minimizing any interaction with the latter.

Subsequently, a family of unilateral compensation networks is readily derived on the basis of this model, with advantages of near unity power factor, flexible load-independent constant-voltage (CV) or -current (CC) output, soft switching and so on. Finally, a 100 W CPT prototype with LLL-None(N) unilateral network is built to verify the analysis.</description></item><item><title>Flexible Automatic Design of GaN PA Based on Gaussian Process-Assisted Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11062675</link><description>This article introduces a new method for designing power amplifiers (PAs) using a flexible, automatic approach. It employs a Gaussian process (GP)-assisted fast nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (GP-NSGA-II) for both circuit synthesis and layout optimization. Traditional genetic algorithms are computationally intensive and have poor convergence, making them difficult to use with 3-D full-wave simulators. To address these issues, the authors incorporate GP regression from Bayesian optimization into NSGA-II, improving convergence and computational efficiency. The method integrates layout simulation and optimization, enabling automatic PA design with direct layout optimization. To demonstrate the method&#8217;s effectiveness, the authors design a wide-band PA and a tri-band PA using a 10-W gallium-nitride (GaN) high electron mobility transistor (HEMT). The tests show that the prototypes perform well: the wide-band PA has a power-added efficiency (PAE) of over 61% and an output power greater than 41.5 dBm in the 2-3 GHz band, while the tri-band PA achieves PAE values of over 59%, 55%, and 57% in the 0.7-1.1 GHz, 2.3-2.5 GHz, and 3.4-3.5 GHz bands, respectively, with output powers exceeding 41.2 dBm, 40.6 dBm, and 40.6 dBm.</description></item><item><title>Chiplever: A Hardware&#8211;Software Co-Design Framework Toward Extension of Chiplet System for Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11060913</link><description>fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) is a promising privacy-preserving technique that has drawn increasing attention from academia and industry. It allows computation directly on encrypted data without decryption. However, FHE incurs intensive computations. Chiplet-based designs integrate multiple processors, delivering high performance and thereby are embraced by computation-intensive FHE tasks. Despite the chiplet-based system with various processors, it is designed for unencrypted applications, falling short in handling FHE with unique ciphertext manipulations. One common approach to make it capable of FHE is developing a new FHE accelerator. However, this approach overlooks existing abundant resources already in the system and introduces a large area overhead. In this article, we propose Chiplever, a framework that empowers a non-FHE-tailored system to efficiently support FHE tasks via a hardware extension. Chiplever aims to leverage the existing resources already in the room for FHE tasks. To achieve this, 1) Chiplever introduces a hardware extension with an FHE unit providing efficient function support for FHE operators. 2) Chiplever proposes an FHE coordinator in the extension, which enables direct ciphertext transfer between the newly introduced extension and existing chiplets, achieving efficient integration of the extension. 3) Chiplever lowers the high-level homomorphic operations to primitive operators that can be matched by existing chiplets and constructs a fine-grained computation graph (CG). Based on this, Chiplever employs a task scheduling algorithm, which partitions the FHE task across the extension and existing chiplets to exploit the parallelism between them and reduce the ciphertext communication overheads. With these hardware and software optimizations, Chiplever achieves efficient FHE acceleration. Compared with prior FHE ASICs, Chiplever achieves  $9.6{\times }$ &#8211; $15.9{\times }$  speedup and  $6.2{\times }$ &#8211; $67.4{\times }$  throughput improvement on TFHE, while consuming only 18.8%&#8211;35.6% of the area overhead of dedicated FHE ASICs.</description></item><item><title>eBrainISA: Edge-Oriented Instruction Set Architecture for Hybrid Brain-Inspired Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11084892</link><description>Hybrid brain-inspired computing (BIC), which integrates computer science-oriented artificial neural networks (ANNs) with neuroscience-oriented spiking neural networks (SNNs), represents a significant trend in the field of BIC. This approach demonstrates considerable advantages in domains, such as perception, cognition, and learning. Nevertheless, several challenges persist in deploying hybrid BIC on resource-constrained edge devices, particularly in enabling these devices to effectively manage complex tasks. To tackle these challenges, we present eBrainISA, an edge-oriented hybrid BIC instruction set architecture (ISA). eBrainISA is designed to support sophisticated ANNs, SNNs, and hybrid neural networks (HNNs), which integrates an extensive suite of neural operators that are tailored to accommodate the hardware limitations on edge devices. To validate the proposed architecture, we develop a unified low-precision quantization approach alongside a hardware simulator. Prior ISAs offer limited support for hybrid BIC, while ours can support all major networks, including ANNs such as ResNet and Yolo, SNNs such as Spike_ResNet and Spike_Transformer, and HNNs such as DetectHNN and ReSpike with &lt;1% accuracy degradation. Moreover, our architecture achieves about  $5\times $  memory saving compared to full-precision versions and  $3.87\times $ &#8211; $53.61\times $  higher energy efficiency compared to edge GPU when executing different neural networks with diverse behaviors. This work demonstrates a promising balance between intelligent demands for general models and resource constraints on edge devices.</description></item><item><title>SCISSORS: System Level Error Detection for Enabling Near-Threshold Operating Systolic Arrays</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11062572</link><description>Since dynamic power has a quadratic relationship with voltage, reducing voltage is an effective way to lower power consumption in digital circuits. However, maintaining stable operation at lower voltages is challenging due to increased sensitivity to process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations, making it difficult to determine optimal operating points using static timing analysis (STA). While circuit- and device-level solutions like timing error detection (TED) systems can enable lower voltage operation, they introduce significant overhead and design complexity. In this article, we integrate an algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) method into the structure of systolic arrays (SAs) to capture timing errors when voltage is scaled down, ensuring safe and optimized low-voltage operation. Our proposed approach, SCISSORS, demonstrates how extra voltage margins in SAs used for matrix arithmetic can be trimmed by integrating a simple algorithmic technique into the structure of the array. This solution not only detects errors in the accelerator but also those caused by voltage reduction in on-chip memory and auxiliary circuits. It is fully implementable through hardware description languages (HDL) without requiring transistor- or circuit-level modifications to the netlist. Implementation on a Zynq system-on-chip (SoC) shows that SCISSORS introduces only a tolerable overhead of 11% and 8% for  $32{\times }32$  and  $64{\times }64$  SAs, respectively, while achieving nearly a  $2{\times }$  improvement in energy efficiency. Experimental results further demonstrate that SCISSORS adaptively adjusts voltage in response to the voltage-temperature coupling behavior of digital circuits at runtime, specifically addressing inverse temperature dependence (ITD).</description></item><item><title>Scalable Sequential Logic Synthesis Using Observability Don&#8217;t Care Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11078761</link><description>Sequential logic synthesis expands the solution space compared to combinational logic synthesis by reasoning about the reachable states of memory elements, leading to better power-performance-area (PPA) outcomes. As gate costs continue to rise in advanced technologies, sequential logic synthesis is gaining significant traction within the electronic design automation (EDA) community as a powerful alternative. This article introduces a scalable algorithm for don&#8217;t care (DC)-based sequential logic synthesis, leveraging sequential k-step induction to perform redundancy removal and resubstitution under sequential observability don&#8217;t care (SODCs). sequential observability don&#8217;t cares (SODCs) generalize observability don&#8217;t care (ODCs) by explicitly considering reachable states, making SODC-based optimization a challenging problem due to dependencies and alignment issues between the base case and inductive case in k-step induction. Our approach overcomes these challenges, fully utilizing the potential of SODCs without limiting the solution space. We rigorously prove the correctness of our approach, discuss some limitations arising from bounded-step induction, and analyze how our approach can effectively be used in practice to exploit obscure optimization opportunities. Implemented as part of an industrial tool, our algorithm achieves an average &#8722;6.9% area improvement after technology mapping compared to state-of-the-art sequential synthesis methods, and further provides 3.16% and 1.06% reductions in combinational and sequential areas, respectively, in post place-and-route results. Furthermore, all optimizations are efficiently verified using industrial sequential verification tools.</description></item><item><title>Identifying Design Challenges in Analog Circuits Due to Device Nonidealities at Cryogenic Temperatures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11068185</link><description>This work presents a detailed analysis of the impact of MOS device performance on circuit metrics at cryogenic temperatures.

One of the most popular design styles in this domain involves using memristors to perform logic operations in memory, known as logic-in-memory (LiM). memristor aided logic (MAGIC) is one of such LiM based design style that is widely used given its benefits in latency and energy. Several prior works have focused on the generation of logic operations, also called micro-operations, for LiM based on the MAGIC design style. Recently, the generation of SPICE netlists for MAGIC design style has been achieved by the MemSPICE tool. While this represents a significant step forward, verifying the correctness of the generated netlists still depends on SPICE-level simulations. These simulations become particularly impractical for medium-to-large designs presenting a bottleneck in the validation process. To address this limitation, in this article, we introduce veriSiM, an automated formal verification methodology for MAGIC-based LiM. More concretely, it ensures the correctness of the generated LiM SPICE netlists against the golden reference Verilog design. Our methodology involves generating clauses from the SPICE netlists and verifying them against clauses generated from the golden reference Verilog design, using the high-performance Z3 solver to perform the equivalence checking. The clause generation process from the SPICE netlists needs to be based on several conditions, which have been identified and discussed in detail. We have used several benchmarks from ISCAS&#8217;85, ISCAS&#8217;89, and ITC&#8217;99 to demonstrate the efficacy of the veriSiM methodology in formally verifying the LiM SPICE netlists.</description></item><item><title>QNU-CPN: A Low-Power Single-Event Quadruple-Node-Upset Recovery Latch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11084868</link><description>Integrated circuit are increasingly sensitive to radiation-induced multinode upset in advanced cMOS technology.

However, fully automated yet fast and process, voltage, and temperature (PVT)-robust sizing algorithms are still lacking as even the most recent methods continue to require extensive simulations or domain-specific circuit expertise. In this article, we present a PVT-robust analog circuit sizing method, called AnaCraft, that is the first to introduce an adversarial training scheme of multiagent reinforcement learning (RL) for robust circuit design automation. We adopt the soft actor&#8211;critic (SAC) agent for circuit sizing, which outperforms other actor&#8211;critic agents in stability and robustness. Then, we introduce a duel-play scheme to address PVT-robustness, where sizing agents cooperate to find optimal circuit parameters while competing with an adversarial PVT agent. We combine this approach with the model-based policy optimization method: an ensemble of probabilistic models is trained and used to extract many short rollouts of generated data for updating the sizing agents. We test our algorithm on the sizing of operational amplifiers in a 45-nm CMOS technology, as well as on a complex data receiver circuit in a predictive 7-nm FinFET technology. This demonstrates our approach&#8217;s ability to find PVT-robust power-area-optimal sizes for advanced technologies and circuits. Our proposed method achieves a higher figure of merit with up to  $\sim 3\times $  fewer circuit simulations and  $\sim 2\times $  less runtime compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</description></item><item><title>Oiso: Outlier-Isolated Data Format for Low-Bit Large Language Model Quantization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11062568</link><description>The scale of large language models (LLMs) has steadily increased over time, leading to enhanced performance in multimodal understanding and complex reasoning, but with significant execution overhead on hardware. Quantization is a promising approach to reduce computation and memory overhead for LLM deployment. However, maintaining accuracy and efficiency simultaneously is challenging due to the presence of outliers. Moreover, low-bit quantization tends to deteriorate accuracy due to its limited precision. Existing outlier-aware quantization/hardware co-design methods split the sparse outliers from the normal values with dedicated encoding schemes. However, such separation produces a nonuniform data format for normal values and outliers, leading to additional hardware design and inefficient memory access. This article presents an outlier-isolated data format (Oiso) for low-bit LLM quantization called Oiso. Oiso is a unified representation for both outliers and normal values. It isolates the normal values from the outliers, which can reduce the impact of outliers on the normal values during the quantization process. Taking advantage of the uniform format, Oiso arithmetic can be performed using a homogeneous computational unit, and Oiso values can be stored in a standardized format. Hierarchical block encoding with a subblock alignment scheme is introduced to reduce the encoding cost and the hardware overhead. We introduce the Oiso architecture, equipped with Oiso processing elements and encoders tailored for Oiso arithmetic, realizing efficient low-bit LLM inference. Oiso quantization can push the limits of low-bit LLM quantization, and the Oiso accelerator outperforms the state-of-the-art outlieraware accelerator design with  $1.26\times $  performance improvement and 25% energy reduction.</description></item><item><title>TRIM: Thermal Auto-Compensation for Resistive In-Memory Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11073135</link><description>in-memory computing (IMC) has emerged as one of the most promising architectures to efficiently compute artificial intelligence tasks on hardware, particularly deep neural networks (DNNs). IMC can make use of analog computation principles alongside emerging nonvolatile memories (eNVM) technologies, potentially offering several orders of magnitude increased energy efficiency compared to generic processing units. Yet, the use of analog circuitry, potentially integrated with emerging technologies post-processed on top of silicon wafers, increases the susceptibility of hardware to a large spectrum of variations, for instance manufacturing, noise or temperature sensitivity. Hence, this susceptibility can hamper the large-scale deployment of IMC circuits into the market. To tackle the reliability of analog resistive-based IMC circuits regarding temperature variations, this article presents TRIM, a thermal on-chip auto-compensation method aimed at fully calibrating first-order temperature effects. TRIM is designed to maintain the computational accuracy of IMC cores in DNN applications over a wide temperature range, while being highly scalable and adaptable. In essence, the temperature compensation is realized through a complementary-to-absolute-temperature (CTAT) voltage reference integrated inside a voltage regulator and applied at the zero reference node of a multiplying digital-to-analog converter (MDAC), eliminating the need for external circuits or look-up table. The proposed methodology is demonstrated on a proof-of-concept 65 nm CMOS resistive IMC column. Measurement results showcase that the proof-of-concept auto-compensation system significantly enhances inference and multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operation accuracy of any first-order resistive crossbar column, achieving inference accuracy recovery of 100% over a temperature range of &#8211;20 &#176;C to 60 &#176;C and a 91.3% improvement in MAC operation accuracy, with an area overhead of 2% and power overhead of &#161; 0.02%.</description></item><item><title>Memristive Neural Network Circuit Implementation of Model Predictive Control for Trajectory Tracking</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11096083</link><description>model predictive control (MPC), a receding-horizon optimal control strategy, predicts system dynamics and optimizes control actions to satisfy performance and constraint requirements, making it widely adopted in control engineering. However, contemporary computing platforms struggle to meet the real-time and energy-efficient demands of MPC&#8217;s computationally intensive matrix operations, stemming from high data movement overhead, extensive circuit resource utilization, and frequent data conversions inherent in physical system interfaces. These challenges collectively impose significant latency and power penalties, particularly critical as systems grow in complexity and scale within the big-data era. This article introduces a zeroing neural network (ZNN)-based memristive neural network circuit that directly converges the MPC error function to zero in one step. Theoretical analysis and simulations validate the closed-loop circuit&#8217;s stability. For a 32-step prediction horizon, evaluations show that the control output from the proposed circuit matches the ideal digital MPC solution with 96.0% accuracy. The circuit also executes at least an order of magnitude faster and consumes less energy than traditional MPC solvers. Additionally, the circuit successfully accelerates the proposed trajectory tracking algorithm, achieving 98.0% accuracy compared with the theoretical result and  $318.2\times $  improvement in computation time compared to CPU.</description></item><item><title>NeFT: Negative Feedback Training to Improve Robustness of Compute-in-Memory DNN Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11087589</link><description>Compute-in-memory accelerators built upon nonvolatile memory devices excel in energy efficiency and latency when performing deep neural network (DNN) inference, thanks to their in-situ data processing capability. However, the stochastic nature and intrinsic variations of nonvolatile memory devices often result in performance degradation during DNN inference. Introducing these nonideal device behaviors in DNN training enhances robustness, but drawbacks include limited accuracy improvement, reduced prediction confidence, and convergence issues. This arises from a mismatch between the deterministic training and nondeterministic device variations, as such training, though considering variations, relies solely on the model&#8217;s final output. In this work, inspired by control theory, we propose negative feedback training (NeFT)&#8212;a novel concept supported by theoretical analysis&#8212;to more effectively capture the multiscale noisy information throughout the network. We instantiate this concept with two specific instances, oriented variational forward (OVF) and intermediate representation snapshot (IRS). Based on device variation models extracted from measured data, extensive experiments show that our NeFT outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods with up to a 45.08% improvement in inference accuracy while reducing epistemic uncertainty, boosting output confidence, and improving convergence probability. These results underline the generality and practicality of our NeFT framework for increasing the robustness of DNNs against device variations. The source code for these two instances is available at https://github.com/YifanQin-ND/NeFT_CIM.</description></item><item><title>Gas Leakage Detection Using YOLO Accelerator Based on ZYNQ</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11096717</link><description>Infrared imaging is a valuable technology for gas leakage detection due to its high sensitivity, long detection range, and high efficiency. Conventional target detection methods depend on manually extracting image features, which often leads to limited accuracy, low adaptability, and slow detection speeds. Deep learning technology offers a potential solution to these challenges; however, the increasing depth of neural networks imposes significant computational demands, posing challenges to real-time detection. This article presents a compact and energy-efficient gas detection system, implemented with a ZYNQ platform and an infrared camera. We propose a ZYNQ-based convolution accelerator to enhance gas plume detection from images captured by the infrared camera. Operating at a clock frequency of 130 MHz, the accelerator is capable of reaching a peak performance of 37.44 Gop/s, with power consumption of only 4.12 W. The system achieves a processing speed of 0.235 s per image, enabling real-time gas leakage detection.</description></item><item><title>Systematic Methodology of Modeling and Design Space Exploration for CMOS Image Sensors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11068172</link><description>CMOS image sensors (CIS) are integral to both human and computer vision tasks, necessitating continuous improvements in key performance metrics, such as latency, power, and noise. Despite experienced designers being able to make informed design decisions, novice designers and system architects face challenges due to the complex and expansive design space of CIS. This article introduces a systematic methodology that elucidates the tradeoffs among CIS performance metrics and enables efficient design space exploration (DSE). Specifically, we propose a first-principle-based CIS modeling method. By exposing low-level circuit parameters, our modeling method explicitly reveals the impacts of design changes on high-level metrics. Based on the modeling method, we propose a DSE process that swiftly evaluates and identifies the optimal CIS design, capable of exploring over  $10^{9}$  designs in under a minute without the need for time-consuming SPICE simulations. Our approach is validated through a case study and comparisons with real-world designs, demonstrating its practical utility in guiding early-stage CIS design.</description></item><item><title>A ReRAM-Based Processing-in-Memory Framework for LSM-Based Key-Value Store</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11087580</link><description>log-structured merge (LSM) tree-based key-value (KV) stores organize writes into hierarchical batches to optimize write performance. However, the notorious compaction process and multilevel query mechanism of LSM-tree severely hurt system performance. Our preliminary experiments show that 1) When compaction occurs in the  $L_{0}$  and  $L_{1}$  of the LSM-tree, it may saturate system computation and memory resources, ultimately causing the entire system to stall and 2) large number of iterative retrievals across multiple levels is usually required to locate the queried data, while redundant key range overlap in  $L_{0}$  further increases the overhead. Based on these observations, we introduce Re-LSM+, a resistive random-access memory (ReRAM)-based Processing-in-Memory framework for LSM-based KV Stores. In Re-LSM+, we offload compaction tasks from the higher levels of the LSM-tree to the PIM processing part. A highly parallel ReRAM compaction accelerator is designed by breaking down the three-phase compaction process into basic logic operations. Additionally, we design an index table and a multilayer Bloom filter for different levels to improve the query efficiency of the LSM-tree. Evaluation results from db_bench show that Re-LSM+ achieves a  $2.37\times $  improvement in random write throughput compared to RocksDB. Furthermore, the ReRAM-based compaction accelerator achieves a  $68.16\times $  speedup over the CPU-based implementation and reduces energy consumption to  $25.5\times $ .</description></item></channel></rss>
