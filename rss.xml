As the current stress in conventional phase-shift controls couples with voltage gain, high-degree voltage gain occurred in the hold-up process would lead to terrible current stress higher than safe limit, which not only heightens the risk of device failure but also shortens the hold-up time due to the potential execution of protective measures. To address such issues, this letter proposes a novel hybrid phase-frequency (HPF) control method, particularly suitable for operations under low input voltage with high inductor currents. The HPF control facilitates the decoupling of the current stress from operation gain, offering advantages such as further optimized and fully regulated current stress, an extended hold-up time and enhanced operational safety. Experimental results show that current stress at full-load can be reduced 56% with HPF control, thereby extending hold-up time by 3 times. Additionally, the reduced current stress under certain power ranges contributes to improved steady-state efficiency</description></item><item><title>Standing Wave Compensation-Based Harmonic Propagation Mitigation for Closed-Loop Distribution Feeder</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10607943</link><description>The concepts of impedance matching and infinite feeder simulation are currently the mainstream solutions to the problem of background harmonic propagation and magnification on distribution feeders, and their principle is to eliminate reflected waves, which can dampen the harmonic voltage-magnifying factor to around 1. The standing wave compensation mitigation scheme proposed in this letter is based on a completely different concept, which can extend the feeder length to an integer multiple of the harmonic wavelength equivalently by constructing a virtual feeder. At this time, the reflection effect does not disappear but transfers to another state, and the maximum harmonic voltage-magnifying factor on the feeder is limited to 1. Furthermore, since the magnifying factor at most positions on the feeder is obviously lower than this limit, the proposed standing wave compensation-based active power filter (SWC-APF) can obtain significantly better mitigation performance than conventional schemes regardless of the installation location, and the required power capacity will not increase. Finally, the experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>Single-Phase Six-Switch Four-Port Boost Inverter With Active Power Decoupling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10621641</link><description>This letter proposes a novel single-phase six-switch four-port boost inverter with active power decoupling (6S4PwA). The four ports are two dc ports, an ac port, and a ripple port that acts as an active power decoupling (APD) circuit. A novel hybrid modified sinusoidal pulsewidth modulation (HMSPWM) scheme is proposed to operate the 6S4PwA. The proposed topology along with the HMSPWM scheme achieves high voltage gains at both the dc and ac ports and also eliminates the double-frequency ripple at dc ports. The ac film capacitor employed at the ripple port absorbs the 2&#969; ripple component, thereby eliminating dc-link voltage and inductor current ripples at two dc ports. Hence, the size of the dc-link capacitor and inductor at dc ports is reduced significantly. Overall, the proposed topology employs fewer components for four ports and reduces the size of passive elements, resulting in improved power density and reduced cost. To evaluate the performance of the proposed topology, a 500-W prototype is fabricated and tested. The experimental results show that the converter attains boost, inverter, and APD operations in a single stage and also improves power quality at the ac port.</description></item><item><title>An Ultrafast and Wide-Safe-Range Start-Up Method of DAB Converters With Straightforward Frequency-Phase Closed-Loop Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10623714</link><description>Fast and safe start-up is crucial for the dual-active-bridge (DAB) converters. Conventional closed-loop start-up controls fail to achieve theoretical maximum power output due to manually predefined phase-shift modes, limiting start-up speed and safe operational range. To address these issues, this letter proposes a novel variable frequency plus extended phase-shift (EPS) control. This approach enables ultrafast and wide-safe-range start-up of DAB converters by maximizing power-per-current-stress capability within safety limitations. In addition, sole EPS modulation is required in the proposed control, thus eliminating complex mode transitions and streamlining the start-up process. Experimental results indicate that the proposed control achieves a broader safe start-up range and improves start-up speed by up to 43% under voltage-match condition compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</description></item><item><title>Discrete Pulse Control Strategy for Embedded Li-ion Batteries Broadband EIS Measurement System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10623753</link><description>Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries provides comprehensive information on material properties, interfacial phenomena, and electrochemical reactions. An embedded EIS measurement system, based on the power interface dc&#8211;dc converter of Li-ion battery, can achieve nondestructive, low-cost, and accurate online EIS measurement. Therefore, it holds great potential for real-time status assessment and early fault detection of Li-ion batteries. However, accurately measuring EIS at high frequencies poses a challenge due to the limited bandwidth of dc&#8211;dc converter's controller. To address this issue, a discrete pulse (DP) control is proposed in this letter. The proposed DP control regulates constant current charging current by generating two discrete duty ratios and achieves real-time EIS measurement by introducing a disturbance duty ratio to fit ac disturbance signal. Therefore, the implementation of DP control eliminates the need for proportional&#8211;integral (PI) regulator and overcomes the limitation of controller bandwidth on the frequency range of ac disturbance signal. Experimental results show that DP control achieves accurate EIS measurement from 0.1 to 25 kHz, with a maximum normalized root mean square error of only 1.61% (75.93% less than PI control), and significantly reduces measurement time to 59.20 s (86.79% less than commercial electrochemical workstation).</description></item><item><title>Single-Stage IIOS Converter With Auto-Voltage-Sharing for Distributed Photovoltaic MVDC Collection System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638239</link><description>A single-stage input-independent output series converter is proposed for the distributed photovoltaic (PV) medium voltage dc (MVDC) collection system, which can realize autovoltage-sharing without other auxiliary circuit. The submodule (SM) is a three-port converter (TPC), which is integrated by an interleaved parallel boost unit and a full-bridge LC series resonant unit. Every TPC's input port is connected to an independent PV array and the simple pulse width modulation is adopted to realize the maximum power point tracking (MPPT). The output port of every TPC is in series connection to accommodate MVDC bus voltage. Moreover, all the intermediate ports are paralleled as the shared dc bus. Since the full-bridge LC series resonant unit operates as a DC transformer and the intermediate ports are paralleled, the output voltage of every TPC is shared without extra control. Hence, the proposed converter can realize autovoltage-sharing and only the PV voltage and current need sampling to realize MPPT. Moreover, the zero-voltage-switching can be realized for switches and zero-current-switching realized for all rectifier diodes. A 1.5 kW prototype with three SMs is built to verify the characteristics and effectiveness of the proposed converter.</description></item><item><title>Novel High-Frequency Pulse Permutation Scheme for DC-Link Voltage Balance of CHB-Based PV Solid-State Transformer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10605066</link><description>The cascaded H-bridge (CHB) based solid-state transformer is an attractive solution to integrate large-scale photovoltaic (PV) power plants into medium-voltage grids with high power quality in a controllable and scalable manner. The dc-link voltage balance of the CHB is critical to the lifespan of capacitors and semiconductor devices, grid-current quality, and the system's stable operation. However, with the conventional level-shifted pulsewidth modulation, the output power and dc-link voltage of each module are intrinsically imbalanced, which make the switching pulse permutation necessary. Although voltage balancing can be reclaimed using the pulse rotation scheme, the low permutation frequency in the existing methods increases the ripples in the dc-link voltages, which affects the maximum power point tracking efficiency. To tackle this challenge, a novel high-frequency pulse permutation scheme is proposed for the CHB-based PV solid-state transformer, and the implementation procedure based on an improved sorting method is provided. The proposed scheme can effectively ensure the dc-link voltage balance over a wide regulation range without the penalty of additional switching actions. The effectiveness of the proposed high-frequency pulse permutation scheme is validated with the experiments on a 3-kW prototype.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid LVRT Control of Doubly-Fed Variable Speed Pumped Storage to Shorten Crowbar Operational Duration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10613415</link><description>Crowbar is the most widely used low voltage ride-through (LVRT) solution for doubly-fed variable speed pumped storage (VSPS) unit. However, the conventional crowbar solution suffers from excessive crowbar activation period when applied to large-scale VSPS unit, which leads to the disadvantages of high reactive power absorption and huge electromagnetic torque oscillation. To solve the issue, this article analyzes the condition of crowbar release from the perspective of system controllability. Based on it, a hybrid LVRT control strategy combining crowbar and dynamic demagnetizing control is proposed. In this strategy, the crowbar operational duration can be minimized by optimizing the demagnetizing coefficient dynamically. Moreover, the objective of reactive power support or electromagnetic torque oscillation suppression can be achieved to enhance the transient performance of VSPS unit. Finally, the proposed hybrid LVRT control method is validated by the experiments.</description></item><item><title>Rethinking Model-Based Fault Detection: Uncertainties, Risks, and Optimization Based on a Multilevel Converter Case Study</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10608153</link><description>This article presents a probabilistic framework for assessing uncertainty and failure risk in model-based fault detection (MBFD) of power electronic systems. The proposed methodology encompasses uncertainty factor selection, uncertainty propagation, risk assessment, sensitivity analysis, and the development of tailored solutions to optimize MBFD performance. By quantifying two types of misdiagnosis, the risk-of-failure of MBFD has been evaluated under diversely random conditions. In a detailed case study on a modular multilevel converter (MMC), the framework has analyzed five different methods and revealed that existing MBFD methods can have misdiagnosis rates up to 20% due to uncertainties. By identifying leading uncertainty factors and mitigating their impacts, we have reduced the misdiagnosis rate to below 0.4%. While the MMC case study exemplifies practical implementation, the framework's generality makes it applicable to optimize fault detection across diverse power electronics applications.</description></item><item><title>DC Series Arc Fault Detection Method With Resonant Filter Design for PV Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10616253</link><description>Photovoltaic (PV) power generation has become widespread owing to the global need to achieve carbon neutrality. With the increase in the number of PV systems, a broken connector in the PV panel induces a dc series arc fault condition. Therefore, arc fault detection technology becomes significant to guarantee the safety and reliability of PV systems. However, the series arc fault condition is similar to that of the normal operation with a small current variation, which makes it difficult to classify the normal and arc fault conditions. In this article, the resonant filter is proposed to improve the dc series arc fault detection capability. The characteristics of arc fault current are analyzed with the considerations of PV and converter impedance. The operational principle and design methodology of the proposed resonant filter are analyzed to clarify the arc fault signal through decoupling with the converter impedance. In addition, the algorithm for arc fault detection is designed with the proposed resonant filter. The experiment setups are designed with a dc optimizer and two commercial inverters, which can verify the arc fault detection performance with the proposed resonant filter.</description></item><item><title>An Edge-Based Condition Monitoring Scheme for the AC and DC Capacitors in LLC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10623782</link><description>LLC converters are widely used in high-power, high-power-density scenarios due to their ability to achieve high-frequency operation and galvanic isolation. However, the ac resonant capacitor and output dc capacitor are prone to aging and failure under high-frequency charging and discharging conditions. This article proposes an online condition monitoring scheme for the multicapacitors in the LLC converter based on an active control transient. The motivation behind the active control is to create a ms-level discharge processes during the converter operation while maintaining the output voltage fluctuations within an acceptable level. During this discharging transient, the output voltage, output current, and resonant current of the converter are recorded only. Subsequently, a capacitance estimation algorithm based on a back propagation neural network is proposed and embedded in the microcontroller. Finally, experiments verify the effectiveness of the method for capacitance monitoring in the field, and its estimation error is less than 3% for the resonant capacitor and less than 1.5% for the output capacitor.</description></item><item><title>Improved Packaging of Power Module With Low-Permittivity Material for Low Common-Mode Noise and High Reliability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10623801</link><description>This article proposes a novel power module configuration which replaces a part of the bottom copper layer of a direct-bonded copper by low-permittivity (low-&#1013;) epoxy. The proposed power module reduced common-mode (CM) capacitance by 52.5% compared to that of the conventional counterpart. The CM noise measured from line impedance stabilization network was reduced by 4&#8211;5 dB&#956;V in steady-state operation. The proposed power module does not sacrifice thermal performance which is proved by simulation and thermal resistance measurement. Thermal cycling tests confirmed high mechanical reliability with no cracks in the solder near the epoxy region. Less mechanical deformation of 5.80 &#956;m was observed compared to the 9.48 &#956;m of the power module that adopts air instead of low-&#1013; epoxy.</description></item><item><title>Study on High Voltage Reverse Bias (HTRB) Test Method of 6.5 kV High-Voltage IGBT Modules for Railway</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10632788</link><description>In this article, a temperature stabilization method of high-temperature reverse bias (HTRB) and high-voltage high-temperature high-humidity reverse bias (HV-H3TRB) tests for 6.5 kV high-voltage power IGBT modules used in railway is proposed. The traditional climate chamber is not suitable for stabilizing the temperature of high-voltage IGBT modules, as there are multi-chips connected in parallel, which can create a high leakage current during the high-voltage blocking state at high junction temperature. The proposed junction temperature stabilization method can avoid thermal runaway caused by positive feedback between power loss and junction temperature in HTRB and HV-H3TRB tests, and the effectiveness is confirmed by experimental results. Furthermore, a precise junction temperature measurement method based on leakage current is proposed, which can be used to set initial junction temperature correctly for HTRB and HV-H3TRB tests.</description></item><item><title>Experimental and Numerical Analysis of Off-State Bias Induced Instabilities in Vertical GaN-on-Si Trench MOSFETs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10634782</link><description>We analyzed the threshold-voltage dynamic instabilities induced by off-state stress in pseudo-vertical GaN-on-Si Trench mosfets (TMOS). Extensive measurements revealed that off-state stress experiments induce a progressive increase of threshold voltage (VT), that is fully recoverable only after high-temperature cycles, so that it can appear as permanent degradation at room temperature. VT increase is found to be strongly affected by drain bias and negligibly influenced by gate bias (below threshold). Activation energy (EA) extracted from high-temperature VT recovery experiments was determined to be &#8776;1 eV. We further characterized pseudo-vertical p&#8211;n junction diodes fabricated onto the same wafer as the TMOS's by means of capacitance isothermal spectroscopy. This experiment revealed depletion capacitance (CDEP) instabilities with the same EA as that characterizing the VT instability, leading to the conclusion that trap states present in the epitaxy are the cause of both observations. Numerical device simulations guided the physical interpretation of the observed phenomena, i.e., donor traps at 1 eV from the conduction band and localized in the p-layer lead to both VT and CDEP instabilities in the TMOS and in the p&#8211;n diode, respectively, by dynamically modulating the effective p-type doping density in the former and the effective depletion layer width in the latter.</description></item><item><title>Common-Mode EMI Noise Reduction With Improved Balance Technique for DC&#8211;AC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10599860</link><description>Wide-bandgap semiconductor devices are widely used in power electronic systems for their high switching speed and frequency characteristics, which enhance power density and output fidelity, but also cause serious common-mode (CM) electromagnetic interference (EMI) issues. Balance technique is a promising method due to its significant CM noise suppression ability and high-power density. However, conventional balance techniques are typically constructed with additional inductors and front input grounding parasitic capacitors, which the high-frequency impedance of the former is affected by the equivalent parallel capacitances while the latter is sensitive to variations of front input circuits. To solve the aforementioned issues, an improved balance technique considering input parasitic inductor is proposed in this article. First, the CM EMI model and propagation paths of a dc&#8211;ac converter are analyzed. Second, a Wheatstone bridge is constructed with input parasitic inductor. Then, additional capacitors are introduced to achieve the balance condition. Furthermore, the effect of parasitic parameters of the additional CM current path on the CM reduction performance is investigated. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through simulation and experiments.</description></item><item><title>A Novel AHB/LLC Combo Converter Using Numerical Optimal Trajectory Control for Wide Voltage Gain Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10614872</link><description>The latest universal serial bus (USB) power delivery 3.1 quick charger, requiring 5&#8211;48 V output and 240 W maximum output power, demands a wide voltage conversion ratio on the ac&#8211;dc converter topology.

This article proposed a novel AHB/LLC combo converter that realizes high efficiency at different output voltage levels. Combined with a novel numerical optimal trajectory control method, the converter could seamlessly switch between two operation modes and thus enjoy the extraordinary dynamic performance. The proposed topology and control method are verified on a 240-W prototype, achieving 97.98% peak efficiency and good dynamic regulation during load transient.</description></item><item><title>Mechanism Analysis and Oscillation Suppression of the False Triggering Oscillation for Parallel-Connected GaN Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10621653</link><description>Gallium nitride (GaN) devices are being used more and more due to the advantages of fast switching speed and low on-state resistance. However, these advantages may also cause severe switching oscillations, such as false triggering oscillation. This oscillation can significantly impact system performance by causing overshoot, severe electromagnetic interference, and even device damage. Compared to a single device, paralleled GaN devices are suitable for applications requiring higher current and power, that will introduce a more complex parasitic parameter network, thus making it more susceptible to false triggering oscillation. However, the mechanism responsible for the occurrence of false triggering oscillation in parallel-connected GaN devices remains inadequately investigated, especially under asymmetry. This article presents a comprehensive analysis of false triggering oscillation in parallel-connected GaN devices by integrating the operational theory and stability criteria of paralleled devices. First, the oscillation mechanism and behavior of paralleled GaN devices under asymmetry are analyzed. Then, an equivalent circuit model with considering parasitic parameters is developed to accurately represent false triggering oscillation. Furthermore, the impact of parallel circuit parameters on stability is investigated. Finally, experimental validation confirms the accuracy of proposed analysis and provides design recommendations for reducing false triggering oscillation in paralleled GaN devices.</description></item><item><title>Simultaneous Mitigation of Switching Overvoltage and Oscillation for SiC MOSFET via Gate Charge Injection Concept</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10621663</link><description>Due to the inherent parasitic inductance and high switching speed, the SiC mosfet generally experience significant overvoltage and oscillation, reducing the voltage margin and causing substantial electromagnetic interference. To mitigate these challenges, a novel auxiliary circuit using the gate charge injection (GCI) concept is proposed in this article. The GCI circuit, assembled across the drain-gate of the SiC mosfet, injects charges into the gate during the overvoltage stage of the turn-off process, effectively reducing overvoltage and oscillation without affecting the turn-off speed. The mechanism of the proposed GCI circuit is meticulously analyzed interval by interval based on the cell structure of the SiC mosfet, and its parameters are designed and validated through the circuit simulation. Additionally, the proposed GCI circuit, comprising Si-RC and PiN diode die, is integrated into the SiC power module and assessed by the double pulse test and power cycling test. Experimental results show a 70% reduction in the transient overvoltage at 600 V/30 A and complete the oscillation elimination, with only a 3.4% increase in the switching loss. The GCI circuit does not affect the turn-on process, making it an effective and cost-competitive solution for suppressing the overvoltage and oscillation in the SiC power module.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Prediction of Low-Frequency Near-Field Radiation for a Power Converter Based on the Operating Principle of a Monopole Antenna</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10633875</link><description>This article develops a model to predict the measured near-field radiation via a monopole antenna based on the test setups specified by the EMI standards such as CISPR 25, DO-160E, MIL-STD-461E.

The operation principle of the monopole antenna is then studied, and a model is developed to predict the output voltage of the antenna. Next, the transmission line effect in the EMI test setup is identified and its impact on the measured radiated EMI is modeled. A prediction technique is developed for the low-frequency near-field radiation. Finally, experiments validated the developed theory.</description></item><item><title>Overcurrent Limiting in Grid-Forming Inverters: A Comprehensive Review and Discussion</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10603443</link><description>Grid-forming (GFM) inverters are increasingly recognized as a solution to facilitate massive grid integration of inverter-based resources and enable 100% power-electronics-based power systems. However, the overcurrent characteristics of GFM inverters exhibit major differences from those of conventional synchronous machines. Accordingly, an in-depth characterization of GFM current-limiting strategies is needed to ascertain their performance during off-nominal conditions. Although GFM current-limiting controls are primarily necessary to protect the inverter power stage, they determine the inverter behavior during and after an off-nominal system disturbance. As a result, they can profoundly impact device-level stability, transient system stability, power system protection, and fault recovery. This article offers a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art current-limiting techniques for GFM inverters and outlines open challenges where innovative solutions are needed. One key contribution of this article is the use of graphical methods that allow for intuitive understanding and visually aided comparisons of current-limiting methods. With this approach, we evaluate various performance criteria for different limiting methods, such as fault current contribution, voltage support, stability, and post-fault recovery. We also discuss the latest standards and trends as they require inverter dynamics under off-nominal conditions and outline pathways for future developments.</description></item><item><title>Comprehensive Online Decoupling Strategy for LC-TAB Converters in EVs Considering Voltage Fluctuation During Load Transient</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10606080</link><description>Power coupling between the ports is a significant challenge faced by triple-active-bridge (TAB) converters. The existing power decoupling strategies only consider the impact of phase-shift angles on power coupling and compensate only for the phase-shift angles to achieve decoupling power control. While these strategies exhibit good decoupling characteristics under constant-voltage-load condition, the magnetic flux of three port transformers is also closely aligned with port voltages. Under constant-resistance-load or constant-power-load conditions, the decoupling effects of conventional strategies would be deteriorated due to fluctuant port voltages, degrading the applicability. To address the above issue, this article presents a comprehensive online decoupling strategy for the TAB converter with LC resonant cavity, where the coupling effect of phase-shift angles and output voltages are comprehensively considered, allowing for a superior decoupling effect under various load types. Herein, the slopes of coupling factors with respect to the output are analyzed and are compensated to zero to achieve decoupling. Furthermore, the fixed-point iteration method is introduced to simplify the calculation process, enabling online decoupling. Finally, a 1-kW experimental prototype is built to validate the proposed strategy, where, compared with the existing strategy, the power fluctuations caused by coupling have been decreased by an average of 30%.</description></item><item><title>A Decentralized Nonlinear Harmonic Power Sharing Scheme Considering Harmonic Residual Capacity and Working Conditions of Fundamental Load</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10607963</link><description>The proper harmonic power sharing in an islanded microgrid plays a significant role in reliable system operation. Virtual-impedance-or-admittance-based strategies are intuitive and effective solutions. However, there is an inherent tradeoff between harmonic sharing accuracy and power quality. Besides, optimal capacity utilization has not been considered in most existing methods. Facing these issues, a nonlinear droop scheme, between harmonic residual capacity (HRC) and virtual impedance, is proposed in this article. Under the proposed scheme, harmonic residual capacity is defined and utilized to share harmonic power. Different working conditions of the fundamental load and corresponding control target are analyzed to determine the variable droop coefficient. Therefore, the proposed scheme can render an optimal utilization of the converter capacity and adjust the inherent tradeoff dynamically and adaptively. It contributes to a more flexible harmonic sharing in the islanded microgrid and enhances the ability to avoid overload risk. Furthermore, the communication line is unnecessary, leading to high reliability and expandability. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the scheme are verified by simulation and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>High-Precision Time-Domain Analysis Method Based on the Superposition Principle for CLLC Converter in Above-Resonant-Frequency Mode</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10609556</link><description>The CLLC converter is widely used in applications requiring highly efficient bidirectional power flows. However, multiple resonant components make its modeling and analysis quite challenging, hence, hard to reach a higher operating efficiency. In this article, the method based on the superposition principle is proposed to provide a more accurate analysis for CLLC converters in the above-resonant-frequency-mode (ARFM) and simplified time-domain analysis is employed for below-resonant-frequency mode. First, the principle of the novel method is analyzed within the introduction of the operating modes for CLLC converter. Then, the time-domain expressions regarding the voltage-gain, resonant currents, and resonant voltages are derived by using the proposed method in ARFM. Afterward, the soft-switching conditions are then redefined in a more accurate way. More detailed synchronous-rectification (SR) timings are derived, which is followed by the optimal hardware parameter design. The proposed concept is finally verified through a 1.5-kW resonant CLLC prototype. The experiment has confirmed that the voltage gain and peak values are consistent with the theoretical calculations. And the operating efficiency is improved by 1.8% with the accurate soft-switching and SR compared with the uncontrolled rectification as confirmed by experimental results. Furthermore, the proposed method surpasses the time-domain analysis method to implement SR considering the parasitic capacitance of switches.</description></item><item><title>A Bipolar DC Grid-Interfaced Integrated Dual Input Converter With Reduced Overloading Under Unbalanced Line Voltage Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10623702</link><description>The bipolar dc microgrid configuration ensures enhanced efficiency, flexibility, and improved power quality compared to unipolar dc-based distribution. However, a bipolar structure is susceptible to voltage imbalance caused by asymmetric loading between its two poles. In such cases, power electronic converters with constant power characteristics can provide additional overload to these bipolar lines. This article presents a novel three-port dc&#8211;dc power electronic interface whose impedance can be dynamically adjusted to regulate both the pole voltage magnitudes (under balanced or unbalanced conditions) with reduced overloading while feeding a constant power load. The performance of the proposed configuration has been assessed using a three-port structure referred to as the integrated dual input converter (IDIC).

However, the conduction losses and costs may significantly increase when the SSCBs are used in multiport system. In this article, a new multiport SSCB (M-SSCB) concept is proposed for direct current (dc) microgrids. The energy absorbing branches (EABs) are integrated into one, thus the required number of devices can be reduced by at least half compared with typical separate bidirectional SSCB topologies in the same voltage and current level applications. Moreover, by introducing the grounded EAB based on a thyristor, the leakage current is eliminated from the system and the fault current is bypassed. This further increases the allowable dc voltage and safety of the breaker. As a result, the M-SSCB has a more economic design, smaller volume and higher safety. The operation principles and designing guidelines are presented in detail. The feasibility and effectiveness are verified based on experimental results and comparative analysis.</description></item><item><title>Analytical Modeling and Comparison of EMI pre-filter Noise Emissions of Three-Phase Voltage and Current DC-Link Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10598221</link><description>Three-phase power-factor-correction rectifiers (PFC) or motor drive inverters can be realized using two dual converter topologies featuring either a voltage dc-link (voltage source) or a current dc-link (current source). This article presents a generic comparison of the pre-filter differential-mode (DM) and common-mode (CM) electromagnetic interference (EMI) noise emissions of these two topologies (considering only the switching stage), which serve as indicators for the required EMI filter attenuation and, hence, EMI filter realization effort. In contrast to the voltage dc-link topology, the DM pre-filter noise of the current dc-link topology is primarily attributed to the current pulses generated by its switching stage, resulting in high-frequency voltage drops across the 50-$\Omega$ measurement resistor employed in line-impedance stabilization networks (LISNs) as defined by, e.g., the CISPR 11 standard. Addressing this aspect, low-complexity analytical expressions for approximating the envelopes of the pre-filter DM and CM noise amplitude spectra are derived and experimentally verified using 400 V (line-to-line rms), 10 kW voltage and current dc-link ac/dc converter demonstrator systems. The DM pre-filter noise of current dc-link converters is lower than that of the voltage dc-link converters if the equivalent ac resistance the converter represents to the mains is higher than the LISN's 50-$\Omega$ measurement resistor. On the other hand, the current dc-link converter's CM pre-filter noise is, in typical cases, lower than the voltage dc-link converter's; current dc-link converters are thus an interesting choice for motor drive inverter applications.</description></item><item><title>An Online-Optimized ZVS-Current Tracked Soft-Switching Modulation for Triple Active Bridge Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10599836</link><description>This article presents the synthesis and implementation of a switching-network loss-reduced, soft-switching-enabled PWM modulation scheme for an isolated bidirectional triple-active bridge (TAB) dc&#8211;dc converter that dynamically varies the five phase-duty control variables. Due to the power coupling among each TAB port, circuit analysis of TAB's operational modes becomes complex, posing a challenge to implementing a computationally intensive PWM strategy derived from the established frequency domain-based circuit analysis approach. In this work, we first develop the time-domain analytical model of the TAB converter, drawing on the working principles of the dual active bridge (DAB) converter and the linear superposition theorem. This model simplifies the calculation of switching transient currents in a TAB converter, which significantly influences soft-switching operation and overall switching loss in the high-frequency H-bridges. Second, a rigorous effort is made to decipher the zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) process of the TAB converter considering the influence of voltage-dependent junction capacitances, and the critical ZVS current requirements are correctly identified. Using the proposed TAB circuit model, associated loss models, and identified ZVS criteria, the design optimization of the TAB port inductances is further carried out. Subsequently, we propose a simplified penta-phase shift modulation scheme for the TAB converter, ensuring the soft-switching of the H-bridges. This proposed modulation solution is easier to implement, computationally stress-free, features all-ZVS, and exhibits low switching and conduction loss characteristics. The proposed modulation solution is also implemented, validated, and benchmarked in a 2.4-kW/100-kHz GaN-based TAB converter proof-of-concept, tailored for space power supply applications.

The proposed inverters directly connect the source and load, excluding the inverters from leakage current. The first proposed inverter works only for unity power factor operation. In its operation, the inverter employs only one high-frequency switching device, thus presenting low switching losses and improving overall efficiency. The second proposed inverter works for any power factor. In its operation, the inverter utilizes two high-frequency switching devices, resulting in minimal switching losses. The proposed inverters have no reverse recovery loss and related issues since the body diodes of the power metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor field-effect transistors are disabled. The proposed inverters are devoid of short-circuit issues, resulting in high reliability. The detailed modes and operating principles together with the pulsewidth-modulated strategy for the proposed inverters are described. Experiments were carried out on 0.6-kW laboratory prototypes, operating at a switching frequency of 50 kHz and an output voltage of 110 Vrms. The experimental results verified the robustness of the proposed inverters.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Thermal-Stress Double-Sided Cooling Wire-Bondless Package Structure of SiC Power Modules for High-Temperature Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10606084</link><description>To leverage the outstanding high-temperature resistance of silicon carbide (SiC), theoretically up to 500&#8201;&#176;C, conventional packaging materials, and structures have become inadequate to meet the requirements. The double-sided cooling (DSC) package structure can eliminate power bond wires, which are the reliability weak points in the conventional package, and has low parasitic inductance and low thermal resistance. However, it still faces severe high-temperature thermal stress, which hinders its high-temperature applications. Hence, this study proposes a high-temperature resistant DSC wire-bondless package structure called &#8220;Island,&#8221; which retains the conventional DSC package's excellent electrical and thermal performance and has lower thermal stress at high temperatures. The high-temperature stress concentration at the substrates' copper pattern gaps in the conventional DSC package is solved by splitting substrates. High-temperature co-fired ceramic (HTTC) substrates are introduced as monolithic spacers to provide adequate mechanical strength for the split-substrate structure. Besides, the island structure's thermal resistance is lower than the conventional DSC structure's because the HTCC-based interposer provides new heat conduction paths. Finally, a high-temperature-resistant SiC power module based on the island structure is designed and fabricated. Its static and dynamic characteristics were tested, and a prototype converter was assembled to verify its high-temperature continuous operation capacity.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Integrated Magnetics With Winding Cancellation Technique to Reduce Common-Mode EMI Noise for a Single-Phase CLLC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10617801</link><description>This article proposed a printed-circuit-board (PCB) based integrated magnetics with a winding cancellation technique to reduce common-mode (CM) noise for an 11-kW single-phase CLLC (1PCLLC) resonant converter. Shielding design is effective in reducing CM noise; however, its benefits come along with increased cost with more layers of PCB and increased winding loss due to increased eddy effect in the shielding layers. More shielding layers are required for multiple-turn applications, which makes the idle shielding design unattractive. Implementing windings as active shielding for noise cancellation is a good solution. A symmetrical 1PCLLC converter with symmetrical resonant tanks and symmetrical integrated magnetics is required to achieve the winding cancellation technique. The proposed integrated magnetics consists of three elemental transformers (ETs) with two identical ETs with built-in leakage inductance and one pure transformer. The physical middle points in the primary and secondary windings of the pure transformer become the static-electrical-potential points that can adopted as the starting point to achieve winding cancellation with proper winding arrangements. The effectiveness of the proposed concept was demonstrated through a high-efficiency, high-power density 1PCLLC dc/dc converter for an 800-V 11-kW onboard charger. The designed converter can achieve a power density of 420 W/in3 and a peak efficiency of 98.5%. Compared with the existing solution, the proposed integrated transformer with winding cancellation techniques shows 17-dB CM noise reduction at switching frequency.</description></item><item><title>A Lightweight Artificial Neural Network Start-Up Controller for CLLC Resonant Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10620655</link><description>The start-up of CLLC resonant converters presents challenges such as high inrush current and voltage surges. Conventional approaches often resort to conservative control parameters, which, albeit effective in mitigating resonant current during start-up, invariably extend the start-up duration. Addressing these challenges, this study investigates the optimal start-up sequence, aiming for operation within a customized peak resonant current range. A specialized, lightweight artificial neural network designed for digital signal processors is introduced as the start-up controller. This start-up controller is seamlessly integrated with the conventional proportional-integral controllers, thereby ensuring a seamless transition from start-up to steady-state operation. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is corroborated through experiments on a 2-kW CLLC prototype, which showcases the elimination of inrush current and approximately 25% enhancement in start-up speed over the best outcomes of existing methods, all achieved without the need for additional sensors or reliance on trial-and-error adjustments.</description></item><item><title>A Closed-Loop Soft Startup Strategy to Suppress Inrush Current for Full-Bridge Modular Multilevel Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10631165</link><description>Aim to charge all submodule (SM) capacitors of the full-bridge modular multilevel converter (FB-MMC) to their nominal voltage values smoothly and effectively, this article proposes a closed-loop soft startup strategy by utilizing the negative output voltage of FB-SM, which completely suppresses the potential inrush currents at the startup process. Based on the analysis of the precharging process of FB-MMC with load, when bypassing the current limiting resistors, the inrush currents are induced owing to the presence of load. To solve this issue, an improved startup strategy is further proposed by intentionally controlling the dc voltage to zero. With this strategy, the main ac contactor is closed with zero current, which is beneficial for extending the service life of mechanical switches. Besides, the overall control system is integrated and optimized because separately designed startup control is not required, thereby reducing the computational burden of digital controllers. Moreover, the SM capacitors can be charged rapidly by a ramp shaped charging current, and equal charging of all SMs during startup process can be guaranteed with the voltage balancing control algorithm. Simulation and experimental results of three-phase FB-MMC rectifier interfaced with grid and 5 kV dc are provided to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed startup strategy.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Electromagnetic Performance Optimization of Double-Layer Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10500893</link><description>Permanent magnet (PM) machines garner significant attention due to their high-power density and high efficiency. As research progresses, high-end motor applications are placing higher and more comprehensive performance demands on PM machines, driving the need for multifaceted and synergistic motor design optimization. In response to this demand, this article proposes a multi-objective optimization design process aimed at improving the overall electromagnetic performance of PM machines. The objectives include enhancing torque density, suppressing torque ripple, and reducing vibration and noise. The optimization process utilizes a meta-model fitted to the numerical model solved by the finite element method, leading to a substantial acceleration of the overall optimization process. Furthermore, an optimization approach is employed to optimize several key structural parameters of a double layer interior PM machine using an evolutionary algorithm. The resulting optimized motor is fabricated and tested, and both numerical simulations and experiments validate that the optimized motor exhibits enhanced torque, low torque ripple, and avoids resonance vibration noise near the rated speed. This comprehensive validation confirms the effectiveness of the structural design and the optimization process.</description></item><item><title>Development of a Compact and Contactless Stage Capable of Levitating/Rotating Wafer Functioning as an Ultrasonically Virtual Hand</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472714</link><description>This article presents a compact and contactless stage capable of levitating/rotating the wafer via hybrid excitation of standing waves (SWs) and traveling waves (TWs). The stage incorporates two concentrically- arranged irradiators, where the inner one sends out powerful SW to accomplish the levitation while the outer one generates the TW whose intensity and direction are modulatable to achieve the rotation. Interestingly, the stage is regarded as an ultrasonically virtual hand with the holding and plucking functions. Initially, the SW- and TW- irradiators&#8217; configurations are designed to tune the resonance frequency of each component and enhance the air pressure. Subsequently, through acousto-structural analysis, the levitation force and propulsion torque are estimated to numerically discuss the acoustic properties of the air gap between the stage and the wafer. Finally, a stage prototype 220 mm in diameter and 390 mm in height is fabricated to assess its performance. At 20.3 kHz working frequency and 400 V voltage, the stage yielded the maximal levitation height of &#8764;1 mm. Meanwhile, the maximal rotation speeds reach 0.15 and 0.16 rad/s in the clockwise and counter-clockwise directions, respectively. These results validate the effectiveness of our proposal and demonstrate the stage's potential for the semi-conductor manufacturing industry.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Voltage-Guaranteed Control of DC/DC-Buck-Converter-Interfaced DC Microgrids With Constant Power Loads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472613</link><description>Bus voltage control is a crucial issue in dc microgrids. Constant power loads (CPLs) exhibit negative incremental impedance characteristics and tend to affect the operation of the microgrid system. To this end, most of the existing methods concentrate on ensuring the steady-state performance of the system while the transient performance is often overlooked. Hence, this article proposes an adaptive voltage-guaranteed controller for the dc/dc buck converter feeding CPLs to enhance both steady-state and transient performances. First, a constrained function is utilized to incorporate the voltage constraint into the modeling of a buck converter. Second, the adaptive update laws are constructed to estimate uncertainties/disturbances for different operation conditions. Finally, the design guideline of the proposed adaptive controller is presented using the backstepping theory. Through the aforementioned design procedures, the proposed controller can keep the bus voltage working within the prespecified range even when large-signal disturbances happen. The stability of the closed-loop system is proved by using the Lyapunov stability theory. Both simulations and experimental studies are conducted to verify the efficacy of the proposed controller.</description></item><item><title>Investigation of Power Cycling Degradation on the Dynamic ON-Resistance of HD-GITs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472623</link><description>As promising candidates for high-performance power system applications, gallium nitride high electron mobility transistors (GaN HEMTs) have received a lot of attention from the market. However, reliability issues, particularly the dynamic on-resistance (dR$_{\text{DS(ON)}}$), also known as the current collapse effect, severely limit the promotion and application of GaN HEMTs. This article investigates and compares the dR$_{\text{DS(ON)}}$ under various power cycle aging conditions for hybrid drain-embedded gate injection transistors (HD-GITs), which serve as representative devices of GaN HEMTs. For the purpose of this, HD-GITs are prepared using power cycling tests, and a voltage clamping circuit is employed to accurately measure the dR$_{\text{DS(ON)}}$ during the switching applications in both the double-pulse test and the multipulse test. Experimental results demonstrate that, under certain conditions, the dR$_{\text{DS(ON)}}$ of the device deteriorates as it ages. Furthermore, the primary mechanisms responsible for the deterioration of dR$_{\text{DS(ON)}}$ characteristics under different aging states are discussed based on systematic electrical test results and reasonable inference. The finds are of great significance for guiding the design, manufacture, and application of GaN devices.</description></item><item><title>A Fast and Sensitive Current Differential Protection for MMC-HVDC Lines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10495727</link><description>This article proposes a fast and sensitive current differential protection (CDP) for modular multilevel converter based high voltage direct current lines. This method utilizes the fully distributed and frequency dependent (FD) line model to compensate for the influence of FD parameters, thus achieving high sensitivity. The improved curve fitting scheme in the FD line model is provided to enable the formulation of the differential current. Then, a fast time domain convolution scheme is specially designed to achieve the capability of the real-time calculation with the FD line model, and therefore guarantee the high response speed. A comparative analysis between the proposed CDP and the existing Bergeron based CDP is utilized to demonstrate the superior sensitivity and faster response speed of the proposed method. Moreover, the proposed method only requires a relatively low sampling rate and can complete internal fault detection within 3 ms after the fault occurs. Hardware-in-the-loop experiments using real time digital simulator are also conducted to verify the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Fault Diagnosis of DC/DC Buck Converter for Embedded Applications Based on BO-ELM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472681</link><description>With the increasing demand for ocean missions, the development of autonomous marine vehicles (AMVs) has flourished. AMVs rely on electricity to power various systems, so the high reliability and stability of dc-dc converters are critical to the normal operation of AMVs. In reality, fault diagnosis and optimization of converters under the low sampling frequency and computational capability conditions remain practical challenges. This article focuses on the buck converter circuit and utilizes undersampling techniques to obtain output voltage signals sampled at a low sampling frequency. Support vector machine recursive feature elimination is employed for feature selection to reduce computation. Bayesian optimization-based extreme learning machine is used for fault diagnosis, which is suitable for actual deployment and shown to outperform three classical machine learning models. The diagnosis results are used to propose a reliability optimization strategy involving switching frequency adjustment. Physical experiments based on a digital signal processor prove the feasibility of this method.</description></item><item><title>Single-Ended Protection of VSC-HVdc Outgoing Line Based on Backward Traveling Wave Time-Domain Weighted Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10500473</link><description>This article considers the problems of high difficulty in fault analysis of direct current (dc) line in a voltage source converter (VSC)&#8211;high-voltage direct current (HVdc) outgoing system from wind farms and the poor adaptability of traditional protection principle. To solve these problems, this article proposes single-ended protection of the VSC-HVdc outgoing line based on the time-domain weighted optimization (TDWO) of a fault backward traveling wave (BTW). The analysis of the propagation process of the internal fault (IF) and external fault (EF) voltage BTW and the attenuation characteristics of the dc line and boundary shows that the voltage BTW measured by the protection element decreases significantly under IF. When an EF occurs, the variation range of the voltage measured by the protection element is small, and the higher the frequency is, the more significant the difference between them is. The fault data are optimized by using the time-domain weighted coefficient, and the fault distinction between the IF and EF is expanded. In addition, the fault identification criterion is constructed according to the time-domain weighted coefficient. The proposed protection method is verified by experiments using a renewable energy grid-connected system constructed on a real-time digital simulation (RTDS) platform. The experimental results show that the proposed protection method can identify faults rapidly with a small amount of calculation and realize the full-line action with high speed, reliability, and sensitivity. The maximum achievable sampling rate for safeguarding equipment is up to 50 kHz; the proposed method, with a sampling rate of 20 kHz, has an application value in practical engineering.</description></item><item><title>Intrinsic Causality Embedded Concurrent Quality and Process Monitoring Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472781</link><description>The causality between different variables can reveal the flows of material, energy, and information in the process system. It is beneficial to reflect the relationship between quality variables and process variables. In this study, a concurrent quality and process monitoring method is proposed with intrinsic causality analytics. The proposed method explores the causality between different variables using transfer entropy. Then, the directly related variables and their corresponding time lags are combined to extract convolutional features, which are used to generate feature matrices for process and quality variables. In this way, the quality related information is extracted from the process variables which are directly related to the quality variables. After that, monitoring models are established for each pair of feature matrices, and the monitoring results are integrated to provide a final monitoring result. Since the process disturbances usually smear to directly related variables, the fault signature can be amplified to improve the detection sensitivity when the directly related variables are combined. Finally, the operation status of the process system is identified through the designed monitoring policy, which combines the decisions of different statistics. It is noted that the proposed strategy can be readily generalized to many other existing quality related monitoring methods. Experiments on a real industrial condenser show that the proposed method can distinguish the quality related faults from the process related faults in the condenser. Besides, it has better detection sensitivity than some commonly used quality related monitoring methods.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Power Splitting and Conversion in Ferrite/Piezoelectric Transformer Magnetoelectric Composites</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472890</link><description>Developing efficient power-splitting device for multichannel distributed low-frequency (LF) mechanical antenna (MA) communication system is challenging since conventional LF power-splitting technologies rely on lumped resistive elements with unsatisfied efficiency and poor electrical isolation. In view of this, a magnetoelectric (ME) power splitter consisting of nickel&#8211;zinc ferrite and Rosen-type piezoelectric transformer composite was modeled, fabricated, and packaged with a supporting theory to quantitatively describe the power-splitting ratio. To reveal the energy loss between interlayers, a noncontact optical Doppler measurement was employed to track the energy losses between interlayers. Results show that favorable input-to-output isolation with a high insulation voltage of 2.35 kV in the packaged device was obtained, and the maximum PE for Port I and Port II reached 34.45% and 35.87% at RL = 1 k&#937; and RL = 13 k&#937;, respectively, in tailored sample with thickness ratio of np = 0.412, and then the measured splitting ratio approximates 1.1 and matches well with the theoretical predictions. Finally, the proposed ME splitter was deployed in a dual-channel distributed LF communication system for implementing each MA excitation, the system divided one source into two independent transmitting ME antennas and accomplished 20 bps amplitude shift keying modulated signal delivery to searching coils under a distance of 125 cm and an input power of 3.57 mW.</description></item><item><title>A Two-Stage Interpolation Time-to-Digital Converter Implemented in 20 and 28 nm FGPAs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472783</link><description>This article presents a two-stage interpolation time-to-digital converter (TDC), combining a Vernier gray code oscillator TDC (VGCO-TDC) and a tapped-delay line TDC (TDL-TDC). The proposed TDC uses the Nutt method to achieve a broad, high-resolution measurement range. It utilizes look-up tables based gray code oscillators to build a VGCO-TDC as the first-stage interpolation for fine-time measurements. Then the overtaking residual from the VGCO-TDC is measured by a TDL-TDC to achieve the second-stage interpolation. Due to the two-stage interpolation architecture, the carry-chain-based delay line only needs to cover the resolution of the VGCO-TDC. Hence, we can reduce the delay-line length and related hardware resource utilization. We implemented and evaluated a 16-channel TDC system in Xilinx 20-nm Kintex-UltraScale and 28-nm Virtex-7 field-programmable gate arrays. The Kintex-UltraScale version achieves an average resolution [least significant bit (LSB)] of 4.57 picoseconds (ps) with 4.36 LSB average peak-to-peak differential nonlinearity (DNLpk-pk). The Virtex-7 version achieves an average resolution of 10.05 ps with 2.85 LSB average DNLpk-pk.</description></item><item><title>A Strong Offset-Resistant Electric Vehicle Wireless Charging System Based on Dual Decoupled Receiving Coils</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472778</link><description>In an electric vehicle wireless charging system, the dramatic variation of the mutual inductance caused by the coil misalignment is an urgent problem to be solved. An offset-resistant wireless charging system based on dual decoupled receiving coils is proposed, with one receiving coil as the unipolar coil and the other as the quadrupolar coil. With series compensation, they are connected in series through the diode rectifier. In this way, the total equivalent mutual inductance is the summation of the absolute values of the two mutual inductances. Thus, the total equivalent mutual inductance can remain stable against misalignment, guaranteeing a stable system output. Experimental results confirm that the designed system has good misalignment tolerance capability in two perpendicular directions, enabling stable and efficient power transmission. Along the misalignment, the output voltage fluctuation is only 2.81% with the highest system efficiency of 94.68%.</description></item><item><title>Synchronization Stability Analysis Under Ultra-Weak Grid Considering Reactive Current Dynamics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10476724</link><description>The synchronization stability of grid-following converter has attracted extensive attention. It has been reported that the transient synchronization behavior during a grid fault is dominated by the phase-locked loop (PLL), while the current loop is always approximated as a unity gain. Nevertheless, this letter notices that the reactive current dynamics will also influence the synchronization stability under ultra-weak grid, which increases the risk of losing synchronization, and causes the PLL output frequency to be outside the limitation. Accordingly, a refined fourth-order model is proposed to reveal the above underlying mechanism and quantify this coupling effect.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Impedance Compensation Method for IPT System Applying Inverse Coupled Current Doubler Rectifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10462682</link><description>Inverse coupled current doubler rectifier (ICCDR) has been applied in high output current scenarios due to its higher current gain and rectification efficiency than diode full-bridge rectifier. However, existing analysis about ICCDR has nonnegligible errors because the inductance effect of a transformer is simply ignored. In this letter, the inductance effect and energy storage-release process of transformer are taken into account innovatively. Then, an accurate input impedance model of ICCDR is first established via modal analysis, whose equivalent inductor leads to poor constant current effect within large load range. Based on this input impedance model, a novel compensation method, which can eliminate the impact of its equivalent inductor and optimize constant current output effect by tuning primary capacitance, is provided. The proposed S-S compensated inductive power transfer system applying ICCDR achieves zero phase angle and shows a &#177;5% output current change rate within 8:1 load resistance range. The analysis is verified by a 20-A output prototype, which shows a peak efficiency of 95.6%.</description></item><item><title>Modulation and Control Independent Dead-Zone Compensation for H-Bridge Converters: A Simplified Digital Logic Scheme</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472893</link><description>The H-bridge (HB) converters are essential components in various power typologies, offering dual energy flow, increasing power density, and enhancing extensibility. For the HB converters, the dead zone plays a crucial role in avoiding power semiconductors against shoot-through phenomenon in the phase leg of an HB converter. However, it also negatively affects the quality of the output ac currents, impacting system performance. This letter introduces a simplified digital logic-based scheme that effectively compensates for the dead zone in HB converters. Initially, the scheme examines the repercussions of dead zones in HB converter. Subsequently, it adjusts pulsewidth modulation signal waveforms by either delaying the leading edge or the lagging edge for the dead-zone compensation, irrespective of the control and modulation methods employed. Furthermore, extensibility of the proposed scheme to other power converters, such as a neutral-point-clamped converter is discussed. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated by experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Two-Stage Benders Decomposition and Dual Dynamic Programming for Hydrothermal-Wind Planning With Intra-Stage Cost Functions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10552437</link><description>The continuous increase of renewable energy sources (RES) brings challenges to electric power system planning, since RES effects must be considered in both short-term dispatch and mid/long-term planning (MLTP). In the latter, immediate or intra-stage cost functions (ICF or ISCF) have been proposed in the literature to provide thermal generation costs for each weekly/monthly stage, to address the uncertainty and high variability of RES without explicitly discretizing the stage in hourly steps. This work proposes a combined two-stage Benders decomposition and dual dynamic programming (DDP) approach to improve the construction and consideration of such ISCF for the MLTP problem. In this case, a set of subproblems considering hourly aspects as load curve, RES intermittency and peak capacity of hydro-generation are iteratively solved in the DDP master problem of each stage, for several scenarios of RES generation profiles, along DDP iterations. Since the discretization points of the ISCF are obtained on demand, this approach yields more accurate ISCF functions, specially in multi-area systems. The methodology is validated for both a tutorial case and a case based on data from the large-scale Brazilian system, where more realistic mid-term policies are obtained when compared to current approaches, with a reduced number of subproblems.</description></item><item><title>Graph Spatio-Temporal Networks for Condition Monitoring of Wind Turbine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10552429</link><description>Condition monitoring of wind turbines (WTs) is essential for advancing wind energy. Existing data-driven methods heavily rely on deep learning and big data, leading to challenges in distinguishing true faults from false alarms, impacting operational decisions negatively. Thus, this paper proposes a spatio-temporal graph neural network framework that incorporates prior knowledge. Prior WT knowledge is utilized by establishing a spatially structured directed graph embedded in a graph attention network (GAT). The features in WTs&#8217; supervisory control and data acquisition system are indicated by the nodes in GAT. Then, the global and local attention embedding layers as well as long short-term memory layers are employed to combine spatio-temporal information from each node. Finally, the condition monitoring in WTs&#8217; graph and node-level are established, and a fault propagation chain at node-level is constructed for explaining condition monitoring results. To demonstrate the explainability, robustness and sensitivity of the proposed approach, a comparative analysis between a true fault case and a false alarm case are given, and anomaly detection results are also reported.</description></item><item><title>Nonlinear Behavior and Transient Stability of Grid-Following Converters Using Direct Power Control Under Weak Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10555420</link><description>Ensuring reliable operation of renewable energy sources requires robust grid-connected converters. Depending on the choice of synchronization methods, grid-connected converters may exhibit distinct nonlinear behavior that plays a vital role in determining their transient stability. Recently, the grid-voltage-modulated direct power control (DPC) has been proposed as an alternative to the conventional phase-locked loop (PLL) to enhance the dynamic response of the grid-following converter (GFLC). However, existing studies have primarily treated the DPC-based GFLC as a linear system. In this paper, we investigate the nonlinear behavior of this converter under weak grids using a large-signal model based on double reference frames. Our findings reveal that the DPC-based GFLC demonstrates sustained oscillation. Interestingly, the stable periodic orbit observed does not arise from a Hopf bifurcation but rather a saddle-node bifurcation of periodic orbits. This critical bifurcation is characterized by the coexistence of a stable periodic orbit and a stable equilibrium point, resulting in a sudden contraction of the converter's stability region. Furthermore, we provide a comparison between the nonlinear behavior of PLL-based GFLCs and DPC-based GFLCs. To validate our findings, we present full-circuit simulations and laboratory experiments.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Functional Integrated Converter for Dynamic Voltage Restoration and Reactive Power Compensation in Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10555312</link><description>Conventionally, parallel-connected or series-connected power quality control devices cannot compensate for both the voltage fluctuation and reactive power simultaneously. To improve the equipment utilization and reliability of the existing power quality control devices, a multi-functional integrated converter (MFIC) is proposed, which can effectively integrate the functions of both dynamic voltage restoration and reactive power compensation. When the grid voltage sags or swells, the MFIC works in the series access mode to achieve voltage regulation function. When the grid voltage is normal, the MFIC works in the parallel access mode to achieve unity power factor operation at the grid side. Compared with the traditional series-connected power quality control device, the MFIC only has one more coupling capacitor, markedly improving the utilization factor of equipment. In addition, the port voltage of the converter module in MFIC is clamped to zero when a short circuit or grounding fault occurs. Meanwhile, a large equivalent impedance is formed to effectively limit the line fault current, which improves the reliability of the MFIC itself and its connected grid as well. Furthermore, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed topology and strategy are verified by simulation and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Power System Decarbonization: A Comparison Between Carbon Taxes and Forcing Coal Power Plant Retirements</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10555380</link><description>The U.S. power system faces a 2035 decarbonization target, though the exact pathway to the target remains unclear. Policy instruments, like carbon taxes and forcing coal plants to retire through various mechanisms, could help achieve the target. It is critical to analyze and compare decarbonization policies as different policies lead to different costs, emissions pathways, and political challenges. In this paper, we explore the ramifications of adopting alternative decarbonization policies. We assume a particular carbon tax to be the benchmark policy and compare it to alternative carbon tax and forced coal retirement policies in terms of emissions and costs. We use a power system dispatch model that co-optimizes unit commitment, energy, and frequency regulation capacity to simulate system evolution over multiple years, including retirements and renewables/storage expansion, under each policy. Our case study highlights the trade-offs between policies. We find that, counter-intuitively, higher carbon taxes do not always achieve lower emissions due to the complexity of dispatch, resulting profits and retirements, and the addition of renewables/storage. In contrast, forced coal retirements result in lower power system costs but higher emissions than the benchmark policy, with a large range of possible outcomes across different retirement cases.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Multistage Distribuionally Robust Programming to Hydrothermal Economic Dispatch With Renewable Energy Sources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10561496</link><description>The multistage solution is very important to achieve optimal hydrothermal economic dispatch considering the uncertainty of renewable energy sources. In data-driven settings, only some historical trajectories are available and the probability distribution is unknown. A data-driven scheme for multistage stochastic hydrothermal economic dispatch with Markovian uncertainties is proposed in this paper. Then a data-driven distributionally robust stochastic dual dynamic programming (DDR-SDDP) is proposed to tackle the corresponding computational intractability, where the conditional probability distributions are estimated by using kernel regression. The out-of-sample performances are improved by distributionally robust optimization on a Wasserstein distance-based ambiguity set. Furthermore, a scenario aggregation method is designed to reduce the computational burden. Numerical results for a practical regional power system in China are presented and analyzed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Co-Optimizing Distributed Energy Resources in Linear Complexity Under Net Energy Metering</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10568387</link><description>The co-optimization of behind-the-meter distributed energy resources is considered for prosumers under the net energy metering tariff. The distributed energy resources considered include renewable generations, flexible demands, and battery energy storage systems. An energy management system co-optimizes the consumptions and battery storage based on locally available stochastic renewables by solving a stochastic dynamic program that maximizes the expected operation surplus. To circumvent the exponential complexity of the dynamic program solution, we propose a closed-form and linear computation complexity co-optimization algorithm based on a relaxation-projection approach to a constrained stochastic dynamic program. Sufficient conditions for optimality for the proposed solution are obtained. Numerical studies demonstrate orders of magnitude reduction of computation costs and significantly reduced optimality gap.</description></item><item><title>Control and Power Balancing of an Off-Grid Wind Turbine With Co-Located Electrolyzer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10569094</link><description>Co-locating electrolyzers and offshore wind can significantly reduce the cost of green hydrogen. However, without a grid connection, a new control paradigm is required for the electrolyzer to follow the variable power supplied by the wind turbine. Commercial electrolyzers have power ramp rate limitations, which can result in a mismatch between the wind turbine and electrolyzer power, leading to frequent shutdown and potentially unstable operation. This paper is the first to develop a control system for this off-grid operation with three mechanisms to dynamically balance the power, including energy storage, rotor inertia, and enhanced pitch control. The results show that a $6.8 million supercapacitor is required with a power rating and capacity of approximately 6.7 MW and 8.5 kWh to enable the system to operate through 99% of the annual wind variation. If the electrolyzer ramp rates can be doubled, the same operating hours can be achieved using only control-based power balancing methods at the cost of a marginal reduction in energy production. If commercial electrolyzer ramp rates can be tripled, the system is able to operate without the need for any power balancing.</description></item><item><title>Real-World Scale Deployment of Hydrogen-Integrated Microgrid: Design and Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10571822</link><description>The development and utilization of hydrogen hold the potential to revolutionize new power systems by providing a clean and versatile energy carrier. This paper presents a practical hydrogen-integrated microgrid developed by Xi'an Jiaotong University in Yulin, China. The hydrogen-integrated microgrid features a 1-MW photovoltaic (PV) system and a 640-kW proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system, equipped with a complete set of hydrogen production and supply system, aiming to establish a near-zero carbon multi-energy supply and demand system.

Addition of energy storage systems in an IBR power plant makes it feasible to have frequency control at the power plant level. While frequency control appears as a simple frequency-power droop control to adjust real power commands to inverter-level controls with measured frequency as an input, care must be taken to avoid interactions among the plant frequency control with communication delays, inverter-level control effects, and the frequency sensor, usually a phase-locked-loop (PLL). This paper present two types of interaction scenarios that makes frequency control design challenging. The first interaction scenario may occur if the frequency control's gain is large, while the second interaction scenario may occur at a small control gain if the plant-level PLL lacks sufficient damping. We contribute to the fundamental understanding of the causation of stability issues due to plant frequency control through the derivation of a simplified feedback system focusing on the frequency and power relationship, and the follow-up frequency-domain analysis for gaining insights. For validation, we also design a data-driven approach to obtain models from data generated from an electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation testbed. The findings from analysis have all been validated by EMT simulation. Finally, we contribute to mitigating strategies and also the understanding of the role of additional proportional integration power feedback control. This addition has been demonstrated as an efficient stability enhancement strategy to mitigate the effect of communication delay.</description></item><item><title>Differential Power Processing Based Control Framework for Multiple Battery Energy Storage Systems in DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10579077</link><description>Multiple battery energy storage systems (BESSs) have been widely used in the DC microgrids to balance generation and demand. To achieve this, the BESS converters need to deliver the full required input/output power imposed on BESSs under the conventional BESS-DC bus configuration, which often demands high power ratings for the converters, hence leads to high installation cost as well as high power losses. To reduce the power ratings for BESS converters while delivering the same power from BESSs, this paper proposes a new differential power processing (DPP) based control framework where the DPP techniques and BESSs are firstly combined without losing the following control objectives, namely, the accurate current-sharing and state of charge (SoC) balance of BESSs as well as DC bus voltage regulation. This is achieved first by introducing inverted bidirectional buck converters to function as a front-end converter and DPP converters. Then, a virtual state variable combining BESS output current and its SoC is proposed, based on which a consensus control strategy is proposed. The stability of the proposed DPP-based control framework is also analyzed. Finally, the real-time hardware-in-loop (HIL) tests confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control framework, showing that the proposed DPP-based control framework reduces the power ratings of the converters to less than 20 $\%$ of BESS converters used in conventional BESS-DC bus configuration even in the worst operating scenario, while delivering the same required power from BESSs, paving a way for an innovative BESS DC microgrid design with much down-sized converters for BESSs.</description></item><item><title>Replicating Power Flow Constraints Using Only Smart Meter Data for Coordinating Flexible Sources in Distribution Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10584114</link><description>The increasing integration of distributed energy resources necessitates effective coordination of flexible sources within distribution networks. Traditional model-based approaches require accurate topology and line parameters, which are often unavailable. Neural constraint replication can bypass this requirement, but it relies on complete nodal and branch measurements. However, in practice, only partial buses are monitored, while branches often remain unmeasured. To address this issue, this paper proposes a topology identification-incorporated neural constraint replication to replicate power flow constraints with only partial nodal measurements. Utilizing the additive property of line parameters, we develop a recursive bus elimination algorithm to recover topology and line impedance from power injection and voltage measurements on limited buses. We then estimate missing voltage and branch flow measurements based on the recovered model information. By combining observed and estimated measurements to construct training sets, we train neural networks to replicate voltage and branch flow constraints, which are subsequently reformulated into mixed-integer linear programming forms for efficient solving. Monte-Carlo simulations on various test systems demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed method, even with limited nodal measurements.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Power Tracking Performance and Small Signal Stability Analysis of Integrated Wind-to-Hydrogen System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10582460</link><description>To achieve the 2050 global climate target, offshore wind will increase to meet the growing demand of direct and indirect electrification (e.g. green hydrogen production for the hard-to-abate sector). To keep up with the rapid increase of offshore wind generation, the energy balancing challenges due to the intermittency nature of wind and the network congestion/capacity challenges resulting from structural network capacity planning latency are to be addressed with system integration technology. In this paper, it is proposed that the hydrogen electrolysis plant be co-located with the wind farm, where the power consumption is controlled to track the wind generation profile accurately to cancel the intermittency of wind generation, reduce the required grid connection capacity, and thereby avoid expensive grid expansion. However, this power tracking controller introduces a cross-plant feedback path from the wind farm to the hydrogen plant, posing challenges for partitioning the power tracking loop completely for stability analysis, which also makes it difficult to make a good trade-off between the tracking performance and stability margins. To address this issue, this paper proposes an equivalent transformation to eliminate the cross-plant feedback path. Then, the criteria for choosing the optimal partition method are proposed and examined for different types of partition methods, which are mathematically proven to be equivalent in terms of stability conditions but provide different insights. An optimal partition method is then proposed in this paper, which not only provides clear insight on the ideal and non-ideal power tracking performances but also can also identify the stability issues of different minor loops individually. Finally, the proposed optimal partition method and its valuable insights into power tracking performance and stability analysis are validated through time-domain simulations of a 180 MW integrated wind-to-hydrogen plant with a realistic complexity.</description></item><item><title>Toward on Rolling Optimal Dispatch Strategy Considering Alert Mechanism for Antarctic Electricity-Hydrogen-Heat Integrated Energy System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10582516</link><description>Renewable energy will be the important form of energy supply for future Antarctic scientific research station. This will complicate the dispatch of the Antarctic integrated energy system (IES), due to the harsh operation environment and diverse operation situation of the Antarctic system, especially for the problem of equipment outage caused by extreme weather. To cope with that, a rolling optimal dispatch method considering alert mechanism for Antarctic integrated energy system is proposed in this paper. First, the output of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is characterized by the feasible region and converted into a linear P-H-T model. By introducing the alert mechanism, a rolling optimal dispatch strategy is then established to ensure the security operation of the Antarctic integrated energy system. Furthermore, the normalized multiparametric disaggregation technology (NMDT) is presented to deal with the bilinear terms in dispatching formulation, in which a mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming (MIQCP) is converted into mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Finally, case study is verified on the actual Antarctic energy system. The results indicates that the proposed fuel cell P-H-T model can enhance the flexibility and economy of the operation system. Also the load shedding can be reduced during the emergency operation by developed optimal dispatch strategy, which improves the resilience of IES.</description></item><item><title>Improving Resiliency of Cyber-Dependent Power Distribution Network Using UAVs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10587086</link><description>Resiliency enhancement of the power distribution network (PDN) through restoration is paramount in the face of escalating natural disasters. State-of-the-art literature has centered on augmenting resiliency through network reconfiguration, along with the integration of renewable energy resources (RES) and mobile energy storage systems (MESS). However, these approaches often assume an intact communication infrastructure, a premise that fails to address the damage in the cyber or communication network (CN). This study introduces the integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for wireless communication in the aftermath of communication infrastructure damage. Motivated by this, a comprehensive mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem-based restoration framework is proposed, aiming to elevate PDN resiliency considering a cyber-dependent PDN. This approach encompasses network reconfiguration, MESS, and UAV integration. The proposed method's efficacy is evaluated through rigorous testing and validation on the cyber-dependent IEEE 33 bus system and IEEE 123 bus system. This work pioneers a holistic approach to PDN resiliency, considering communication challenges often overlooked.</description></item><item><title>Fault Current Limiting and Grid Code Compliance for Grid-Forming Inverters&#8212;Part I: Problem Statement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10589298</link><description>Grid-forming (GFM) inverters are controlled to directly regulate the voltage. A major challenge stemming from this control model is that sustaining the voltage during faults would require high currents&#8212;beyond the levels that an inverter can withstand. Various fault current limiting (FCL) methods have been developed in recent years for GFM inverter-based resources (IBRs). The theoretical analysis supported by detailed simulation studies in Part I of this paper investigates whether existing FCL methods for GFM inverters can be deemed feasible solutions for future IBR-centric power grids. The challenges revealed for the first time in this paper are multifaceted and depend on the type of the FCL method. The focus is not only on a GFM inverter's internal operation, but also on its impact on the grid and the practical requirements for grid integration of an IBR considering most recent grid codes. Part II of this paper will address these challenges.</description></item><item><title>Fault Current Limiting and Grid Code Compliance for Grid-Forming Inverters &#8212; Part II: Solution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10589281</link><description>Part I of this paper unveiled various shortcomings of existing fault current limiting (FCL) methods for grid-forming (GFM) inverters. Part II of this paper develops a new FCL method that overcomes these drawbacks. Additionally, the FCL method proposed in this paper follows the strict requirements of recent grid codes for the low-voltage ride-through mode of inverter-based resources (IBRs). This makes the exact response of GFM inverters during faults fully predictable. Such predictability is a prerequisite for the reliable design/setting of protection systems, operation, and planning of power grids with high penetration of IBRs. The paper uses PSCAD simulations to corroborate if the proposed method meets these objectives. It also uses simulation results to compare this new method with existing FCL solutions for GFM inverters.</description></item><item><title>Per-Phase Unsymmetrical Adaptive Derivative Optimized Droop for Mitigating Voltage Quality Issues of Unbalanced Islanded Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10589303</link><description>The proliferation of unbalanced linear and nonlinear loads in microgrids degrades the voltage quality at the inverter terminals, and thus, load terminals receive unbalanced and distorted voltages. To alleviate these voltage quality issues, this paper proposes a per-phase unsymmetrical adaptive derivative optimized droop control scheme for unbalanced islanded microgrids (UIMG). The proposed controller is coupled with a per-phase unsymmetrical virtual impedance (UVI) to mitigate the unbalance of the inverter-based UIMG. Additionally, a proportional multi-resonant (PMR) controller is adopted to compensate for the voltage distortion. To improve the UIMG dynamics response while changing the loading states, derivative terms of active and reactive powers are added to the proposed control. The derivative gains are adaptively updated with the change in the microgrid loading to achieve the desired transient response. The proposed scheme is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem to determine the per-phase unsymmetrical droop settings and UVI that fit different loading states simultaneously. Several case studies are designed to test the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme under different types of disturbances and operating conditions. The cases are conducted on the IEEE 34-bus benchmark power distribution feeder with a combination of unbalanced linear and nonlinear loads. Moreover, the proposed control is validated using real-time simulations carried out in OPAL-RT system. The results show that the proposed control scheme is capable of mitigating voltage quality issues by reducing the voltage unbalance factor and voltage distortion.</description></item><item><title>Design and Tank Testing of Reinforcement Learning Control for Wave Energy Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10592659</link><description>This paper introduces a model-free control strategy utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the electrical power generation of a point absorber wave energy converter (WEC). While model-based methods may suffer from control performance degradation due to modeling errors, such as inherent Coulomb-type friction, RL-based approaches are well-suited for the WEC environment, where system dynamics are complex or unknown. The strength lies in their ability to learn from interactions with the environment, bypassing the necessity for precise models. To enhance the control performance in electrical power generation, a control-oriented loss model is established, and a force penalty term is introduced into the reward function to avoid the WEC system operating in high-loss, low-efficiency regions. To further eliminate the reliance on wave information and improve applicability, an analysis is conducted to examine the contribution of each state feature to the training outcomes and a loss-considering and wave information-independent RL-based control scheme is developed. The RL-based controller is further validated on a point absorber WEC prototype in the wave tank experiment, demonstrating effective implementation and commendable performance in both regular and irregular waves.</description></item><item><title>Towards Improving Unit Commitment Economics: An Add-On Tailor for Renewable Energy and Reserve Predictions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10592660</link><description>Generally, day-ahead unit commitment (UC) is conducted in a predict-then-optimize process: it starts by predicting the renewable energy source (RES) availability and system reserve requirements; given the predictions, the UC model is then optimized to determine the economic operation plans. In fact, predictions within the process are raw. In other words, if the predictions are further tailored to assist UC in making the economic operation plans against realizations of the RES and reserve requirements, UC economics will benefit significantly. To this end, this paper presents a cost-oriented tailor of RES-and-reserve predictions for UC, deployed as an add-on to the predict-then-optimize process. The RES-and-reserve tailor is trained by solving a bi-level mixed-integer programming model: the upper level trains the tailor based on its induced operating cost; the lower level, given tailored predictions, mimics the system operation process and feeds the induced operating cost back to the upper level; finally, the upper level evaluates the training quality according to the fed-back cost. Through this training, the tailor learns to customize the raw predictions into cost-oriented predictions. Moreover, the tailor can be embedded into the existing predict-then-optimize process as an add-on, improving the UC economics. Lastly, the presented method is compared to traditional, binary-relaxing, neural network-based, stochastic, and robust methods.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive Controller of a Hybrid Storage System for Power Smoothing With Enlarged Battery Lifetime</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10596967</link><description>The volatility of grid-coupled photovoltaics can cause local voltage deviations, while the impact on frequency becomes obvious in isolated weak grids. Thus, a standalone battery is usually proposed for smoothing purposes. However, the frequent cycles and abrupt power variations shrink its life and impair control performance. To this end, this study introduces a controller for a hybrid system composed of a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) and a battery. The proposed method establishes an idling zone for battery to eliminate its short-term activity, while SMES handles any power mismatch. The zone limits are dynamically adjusted in case of power balance detection, while an adaptive saturation is applied to them for maximal SMES utilization and minimal battery degradation. When SMES current deviates from this zone, battery operates with an adaptive ramp rate (i.e., di/dt) depending on the state of charge of SMES, to further optimize its life. Additionally, to prevent unnecessary power circulation among SMES and battery, supervisory control loops are implemented. Finally, to evaluate this scheme against preceding controllers regarding battery life extension, a real-time approach is followed using a dedicated simulator, while a hardware-in-the-loop verification is presented using an actual controller.</description></item><item><title>Transient Stability of Synchronous Condenser Co-Located With Renewable Power Plants Under High-Resistance Faults and Risk Mitigation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10599822</link><description>Synchronous condensers (SynCons) are widely used in supporting the integration of renewable power plants (RPPs) in weak grids. However, recent research suggests that a SynCon co-located with RPPs may be prone to transient rotor angle instability due to the excessive active power injected by nearby RPPs during metallic faults. This paper further discovers that the transient stability of the SynCon may be lost even it generates electrical power during high-resistance faults. This novel mechanism of instability is investigated by deriving power-angle characteristics in different fault scenarios, and then the effect of the system parameters on the stability is analyzed via a proposed index based on the critical clearance time (CCT). It reveals that inappropriate parameters of SynCons, weak grid, and voltage support during fault ride-through (FRT) all contribute to such transient instability. To mitigate such instability, an adaptive FRT strategy is proposed. The electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations based on the PSCAD are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis and the proposed adaptive control strategy.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Chance Constrained Optimization Method for Risk-Based Routing and Scheduling of Shared Mobile Energy Storage System With Variable Renewable Energy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10599624</link><description>This paper proposes a pricing and scheduling method for shared mobile energy storage systems (SMSs) in coupled power distribution and transportation networks. Different from existing shared energy storage studies, which mostly focus on stationary resources, the paper investigates the SMS operation considering the negotiation of rental prices as well as mobility and charging/discharging among SMS owners and different users. Specifically, the SMS pricing and scheduling with variable renewable energy are established as a bilevel mixed-integer chance-constrained distributionally robust optimization problem. In the upper-level problem, the SMS owner determines pricing and day-ahead mobility strategy to maximize its payoff. In the lower-level problem, the SMS users, i.e., distribution grid operators, determine the SMS charging/discharging power according to the SMS day-ahead pricing results and intra-day distribution grid operation strategies for accommodating variable renewable energy. The distributionally robust chance constraint is designed to cope with the intra-day operational risk caused by the variability of renewable power generation. To cope with the solution difficulty in the proposed bilevel optimization problem, the chance constraint is reformulated as second-order cone constraints, which are further transformed into a set of linear constraints, and then the reformulated bilevel mixed-integer linear programming problem is decomposed and iteratively solved to avoid enumerating lower-level integer variables. Simulation results show that the utilization rate of SMS batteries is increased and the excess renewable power is fully consumed when SMSs are shared among different distribution grids. The proposed distributionally robust optimization achieves higher revenue for the SMS owner and smaller operating costs of distribution grids than robust optimization under uncertain environments.</description></item><item><title>Reliability Indexes for Variable Energy Resource Generation in IEEE Standard 762-2023</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10602780</link><description>IEEE Standard Definitions for Use in Reporting Electric Generating Unit Reliability, Availability, and Productivity has recently been revised to extend the standard to variable energy resource (VER) generating facilities.

Thus, an adjustable robust tri-level defender-attacker-defender (ART-DAD) model is proposed to improve the resilience of power systems by hardening critical transmission lines. The proposed ART-DAD model considers both uncertain attacks and uncertain wind power output, which provides meaningful insights into the resilience improvement of power systems that involve uncertainties. More specifically, the proposed defense model integrates dynamic N-K criterion for attack budgets and the polyhedral uncertainty set for wind power output to develop resilient line hardening strategies. The proposed defense model can be formulated as a mixed integer tri-level programming problem that is decoupled into a master and sub-problem. Then, a constraint-generation based solution algorithm is proposed to solve the overall ART-DAD model with a master and sub-problem scheme. Simulation results on IEEE RTS-79 and RTS-96 systems validate the effectiveness of the proposed resilience improving strategy.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Multi-Mode Single-Step Power Tracking for Microinverter-Based Photovoltaic System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10612237</link><description>The conventional de-load power tracking algorithm, utilizing a perturb and observe method, manifests deficiencies in terms of speed, stability, and efficacy in identifying operating points within the inverter's voltage range.

However, existing data-driven methods cannot be applied to new wind farms due to the lack of operational data. This paper presents a novel Bayesian deep learning-based adaptive wind farm power prediction (BDL-AWFPP) method, which is the first time to utilize the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation results as the prior of BDL-based method, thus avoiding the problem that data-driven approaches cannot be applied to newly constructed wind farms. Firstly, a CFD-based wind farm numerical simulation database and a wind turbine power curve database are established to construct a multi-source heterogeneous prior dataset. Then, the BDL-AWFPP model is proposed to utilize the multi-source heterogeneous prior dataset, which can be updated adaptively with newly acquired operational data and saved periodically throughout the life cycle. And an auxiliary aging assessment method for wind turbines is also developed according to the periodically-saved models. Finally, a stochastic variational inference (SVI)-based parameter updating algorithm is derived for the proposed BDL-AWFPP model. Case studies on an actual wind farm validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Net-Zero Scheduling of Multi-Energy Building Energy Systems: A Learning-Based Robust Optimization Approach With Statistical Guarantees</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10620675</link><description>Buildings produce a significant share of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, making homes and businesses a major factor in climate change. To address this critical challenge, this paper explores achieving net-zero emission through the carbon-aware optimal scheduling of the multi-energy building integrated energy systems (BIES). We integrate advanced technologies and strategies, such as the carbon capture system (CCS), power-to-gas (P2G), carbon tracking, and emission allowance trading, into the traditional BIES scheduling problem. The proposed model enables accurate accounting of carbon emissions associated with building energy systems and facilitates the implementation of low-carbon operations. Furthermore, to address the challenge of accurately assessing uncertainty sets related to forecasting errors of loads, generation, and carbon intensity, we develop a learning-based robust optimization approach for BIES that is robust in the presence of uncertainty and guarantees statistical feasibility. The proposed approach comprises a shape learning stage and a shape calibration stage to generate an optimal uncertainty set that ensures favorable results from a statistical perspective. Numerical studies conducted based on both synthetic and real-world datasets have demonstrated that the approach yields up to 8.2% cost reduction, compared with conventional methods, in assisting buildings to robustly reach net-zero emissions.</description></item><item><title>Deriving Sufficient Conditions for Exact Relaxation of Complementarity Constraints in Optimization Problems With Energy Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10629239</link><description>Energy storage is becoming increasingly important in power and energy systems. However, its strongly nonconvex complementarity constraints, which prevent simultaneous charging or discharging behavior, hinder its application in optimization-based decision making. One remedy is to relax these constraints, but the existing relaxation methods are specific to power system applications with limited universality. To bridge this gap, we provide a methodology to derive the general form of sufficient conditions for the exact relaxation of a general energy storage-concerned optimization problem (ESCOP). Specific sufficient conditions for a wide range of ESCOPs can be easily accessed via the proposed methodology. This paper provides mathematical proofs and analyses of the proposed conditions, where sufficient conditions obtained from specific forms of ESCOPs are numerically validated to guarantee exact relaxation and significantly improve the ESCOP solution efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Joint Electricity and Carbon Sharing With PV and Energy Storage: A Low-Carbon DR-Based Game Theoretic Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10623777</link><description>This paper proposes a joint electricity and carbon sharing framework with photovoltaic (PV) and energy storage system (ESS) for deep decarbonization, allowing distributed PV prosumers to participate in a sharing network established by aggregator of prosumers (AOP). The ESS-equipped AOP plays multiple roles as a carbon aggregator, an ESS operator, and an energy-sharing provider at the same time. First, a demand response (DR)-based model that incorporates the multi-strategy of ESS is proposed to optimize energy-carbon transaction. A low-carbon DR with consideration of electricity-carbon coupling is developed to incentivize prosumers to adjust consumption behavior for costs and emissions reduction. Second, a joint optimization based on Stackelberg game is proposed, where AOP is leader, and prosumers act as followers. A dynamic pricing mechanism is proposed for AOP to determine the electricity-carbon coupled selling and buying prices simultaneously. Meanwhile, prosumers would adjust their energy consumption as response to different sharing prices. In addition, a distributed optimization algorithm with interactions is used to reach the Stackelberg game equilibrium. Finally, through a practical testing case, the effectiveness of the method is validated in terms of economic benefits and PV sharing enhancement, as well as the reduction of carbon emissions.</description></item><item><title>Cooperative Planning of Multi-Energy System and Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10631701</link><description>Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) can play critical roles in transitioning to global net-zero emissions. However, existing works only focus on small-scale or local CO2 utilization. For the first time, this paper proposes a cooperative planning model of multi-energy system and CCUS considering the regional CO2 availability. In this model, the multi-energy system and CCUS are coupled through interconnected energy hubs. To leverage its inherent operational dispatchability and flexibility, the physicochemical and thermo-electrochemical processes of CCUS are mathematically formulated with source-sink matching analysis. The multi-energy planning is a demanding optimization challenge owing to its inherent nonconvexities and substantial energy-interest couplings. The original problem is firstly relaxed as mixed integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) to ensure satisfactory computational efficiency. A carbon-oriented bargaining problem can then be reformulated to share the cooperative surplus, which is further decomposed into a joint investment/operation subproblem and a cost-sharing subproblem. The proposed methodology is benchmarked over interconnected energy hub systems to show its effectiveness and superiority in technical, economic, and environmental aspects.</description></item><item><title>Semi-Peer-to-Peer Safety Coordination Control for Distributed Battery Energy Storage System in DC Microgrids via Saturated Limitation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10631704</link><description>This paper presents a semi-peer coordination control strategy to ensure the bus voltage stability and effectively constrain the power trajectory, thereby mitigating safety concerns arising from excessive unit power and communication failures in distributed battery energy storage systems (DBESS) based DC microgrids. Firstly, the primary controller is employed a saturated feedforward design to maintain bus voltage stability and address the excessive part of power allocation with droop control. The saturation results enable flexible switching of the reference state, allowing energy storage units (ESUs) to autonomously transition between voltage tracking and power tracking modes. Secondly, the dual-dynamic power allocation strategy is introduced with distributed consensus and saturation allocation.The power allocation with distributed consensus aims to achieve synchronous proportional charging and discharging for SOC balancing. For the offline ESUs of communication failures, saturation power allocation is designed with arrived operation point to avoid the over-utilization of offline ESUs. To address potential communication failures in offline ESUs, the saturation power allocation strategy based on the current operational point is devised to mitigate the risk of over-utilization of offline ESUs. Finally, simulations and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>An Equitable Active Power Curtailment Framework for Overvoltage Mitigation in PV-Rich Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10636072</link><description>There are various active power curtailment (APC) approaches to mitigate overvoltage. In PV-rich networks, the overvoltage happens to be especially at the end of the distribution feeders. While APC helps maintain voltage within operational limits, it results in varying degrees of renewable curtailment for each prosumer. This curtailment increases as the distance from the transformer grows. Hence, these approaches introduce unfairness among prosumers. This study proposes an equitable APC (EAPC) based on the prosumer's self-consumption rate (SCR). The method calculates each prosumer's SCR, compares it with the precalculated critical SCR, and calculates a fair share of curtailment for each prosumer. Subsequently, leveraging the voltage sensitivity matrix obtained from the inverse of the Jacobian matrix, the new active power injection at the point of common coupling (PCC) is calculated to mitigate the overvoltage. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, a comparison with three other methods is presented under various PV penetration levels. The proposed EAPC is less sensitive to the prosumer's location and improves fairness among prosumers. In addition, a battery deployment scenario is analysed considering the annual supply and demand balance to suppress the extra curtailment introduced by EAPC without increasing the battery capacity.</description></item><item><title>Shape Optimization of a Point Absorber Wave Energy Converter for Reduced Current Drag and Improved Wave Energy Capture Using Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638322</link><description>The shape of the floating buoy of a point absorber wave energy converter (WEC) plays a crucial role in both wave energy harvesting and current drag reduction. In this study, an approach to optimizing the buoy hull geometry with a neural network that replaces the hydrodynamic analysis software is presented, aimed at reducing the ocean current drag force while improving wave energy captured. A new parametric model is introduced to describe the complex shape of the buoy by utilizing the control points of non-uniform rational b-splines. A neural network is developed to significantly reduce the computational time compared to traditional hydrodynamic simulation methods. The optimal hull shape of the buoy is determined by solving an optimization problem using a genetic algorithm, a global optimization technique. The results of the case studies show that the optimal buoy hull shape reduces 68.7% and 71.1% of the current drag, and 50% of mooring line forces compared to the cylinder-shaped buoy and the optimal-power-shaped hull from literature.

To minimize the levelized cost of energy, OWC energy capture must be maximized. To date, most focus has been on maximizing air turbine efficiency, while neglecting other aspects of the system. This paper presents an integrated wave-to-wire optimal control approach, considering the OWC hydrodynamics, turbine characteristics, and generator. The approach is based on a receding-horizon pseudospectral formulation, which transcribes the continuous-time optimal control problem into a finite-dimensional nonlinear program. The results show optimal exploitation of the hydrodynamic, aerodynamic, and electric subsystem efficiency characteristics, surpassing the electric energy production available through a specific focus on turbine efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Comparative Evaluation of Converter Control Impact on Torsional Dynamics of Type-IV Grid-Forming Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10637722</link><description>This paper explores the impact of back-to-back converter control strategies on the torsional dynamics of grid-forming permanent magnet synchronous generator wind turbines (GFM-WTs). Two general converter control methods for GFM-WTs, distinguished by the placement of dc-link voltage control (DVC)&#8211;either in the machine-side converter or the grid-side converter, are evaluated through the complex torque coefficient method to offer a theoretical basis. It reveals that a negative damping is introduced when the DVC is with the machine-side converter. Then, to further characterize the parametric impacts of electrical and mechanical system constants and controller gains, the sensitivity analysis is performed by employing the partial derivative algorithm, which is based on the feedforward neural network training. It is found that the converter control has a limited impact on the damped frequency in both GFM converter control methods. Finally, electromagnetic simulations based on full-order nonlinear models of GFM-WTs are carried out to confirm the theoretical findings.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive Transfer Learning Framework for Data-Scarce HVAC Power Consumption Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10637762</link><description>Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems constitute a large proportion of building energy consumption and provide considerable potential for power grid regulation. While the HVAC power consumption forecasting task is generally straightforward with sufficient historical data, it becomes challenging when dealing with scarce data. Such situation is common in cases of intermittent data collection or early system implementations, where precise forecasting is required despite limited data available. Considering accessible datasets from nearby or similar HVAC systems through energy management systems, this paper proposes an adaptive transfer learning framework to tackle this issue. Specifically, the framework leverages diverse source domains, employing model-level regularizers to quantify domain discrepancies and an adaptive parameter regulation mechanism to dynamically align source domains with the target domain. Embedded within the framework, a unique deep learning architecture with attention mechanisms is proposed, capable of identifying complex temporal patterns and hierarchical features in HVAC systems. Experiments on public HVAC datasets demonstrate the generalization, accuracy and robustness of our methodology under diverse data-scarce scenarios.</description></item><item><title>A Novel GAN Architecture Reconstructed Using Bi-LSTM and Style Transfer for PV Temporal Dynamics Simulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10601515</link><description>The stochastic production simulation of photovoltaic (PV) power is crucial for the analysis of power balance in power planning, annual or monthly operational planning, and long-term transactions in the electricity market, especially in power systems with a high share of PVs.

Uncontrolled state changes can occur if optimal microgrid restoration and dispatch algorithms, used for generating control commands for distributed energy resources, do not incorporate the behavior of automatic controllers of voltage regulation devices. Inaccurate demand forecasts may be encountered since post-outage demand of behind-the-meter net metered (NM) loads can vary significantly from their historical NM profiles. This paper proposes an optimization formulation which allows optimal control of voltage regulators and capacitor banks without remote control and communication capabilities. A generalized demand model for NM loads is proposed which incorporates the cold load pickup phenomenon and their time varying post-outage demand in accordance with the IEEE 1547 standard. The time dependent optimal control formulation and the NM demand model are integrated in a sequential microgrid restoration algorithm by linearization of the involved logic propositions. A detailed case study on the unbalanced IEEE 123-node test system in OpenDSS validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Data-Driven Frequency Control in Networked Microgrids via Voltage Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10511276</link><description>In this paper, a distributed data-driven frequency control scheme is proposed for the off-grid networked microgrid system (NMG). In the proposed scheme, the frequency is regulated by coordinately adjusting the active power generation provided by controllable generators and the active power demand provided by voltage sensitive loads, where the active power consumption of voltage sensitive loads is specially modified by adjusting the load operating voltages via voltage regulation. The whole control problem is solved with the feedback-based gradient method. To achieve better scalability and privacy, the overall control scheme is implemented in a distributed manner by employing an approximated gradient that can be calculated by limited communication between neighboring MGs. To further enable the controller to adapt to real-time system conditions, the required system model is updated online via the partial least square method in a recursive manner, which renders the proposed controller model-free. Numerical simulations involving detailed nonlinear NMG models illustrate the key benefits of the proposed method, including (i) eliminating the need for an accurate offline system model, (ii) reducing the need of controllable generation, and (iii) being robust against communication delays.</description></item><item><title>A New Composite Control Strategy for Large-Signal Stabilization of Constant Power Loads in Islanded AC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10518170</link><description>Large operating range in an islanded AC microgrid feeding constant power loads (CPLs) will cause both the severe amplitude wave and harmonic distortion of the bus voltage. This paper proposes a new composite control strategy to realize the large-signal stabilization for an islanded AC microgrid feeding CPLs. Firstly, a three-phase inverter system feeding CPLs is constructed in a dq rotating coordinate form. Secondly, the nonlinear disturbance observer technique is introduced to accurately and simultaneously estimate the current of the CPLs and coupling interactions, serving as feed-forward compensations for the AC bus voltage controller. Then a composite strategy can be designed by executing a feedback domination procedure. For the issue of voltage regulation under the large variation of CPLs and control targets, the proposed control strategy exhibits three merits: large-signal stability, fast performance recovery ability and concise control form. The tuning process of the control parameters are illustrated in the simulation. The effectiveness and priority of the proposed strategy are demonstrated by abundant of hardware-in-loop (HIL) and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Weighted Gradient Descent Method With Adaptive Step Sizes for Energy Management of Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10530408</link><description>Economic dispatch problems for power systems become more challenging as the system sizes, types and data increase significantly. Facing these complex optimization problems, centralized optimization methods may fall short and appear inefficient. Conversely, distributed optimization methods seem to be a potential and powerful tool for dealing with these more complex problems. However, some widely-used distributed methods suffer from their low convergence rates. Therefore, in this paper, a faster distributed optimization method via gradient descent is proposed, where the weighted matrix and adaptive step sizes are the keys of our method. In the distributed gradient method, the weighted matrix is modified and constructed from the out-degrees and upper limits of the second derivatives of objective functions, which boosts gradients reaching consensus more quickly. Further, the adaptive step sizes are presented to overcome the low convergence rate caused by manual settings of step sizes, where the Hessian matrix are used iteratively to obtain the optimal step sizes, which cooperates with the weighted matrix for gradients to lead to a faster convergence rate. Next, two propositions and a theorem are proved to show the linear convergence feature of the proposed method, which guarantees the fast convergence of our method. Finally, the proposed method is applied to solve the economic dispatch problem that consists of economic and environmental objectives in microgrids. Simulation results show that the number of iterations of our method is only one third or even less than those of some widely used methods. Moreover, when solving economic dispatch problems, our method exhibits superior fault tolerance in comparison to centralized methods.</description></item><item><title>Fault Analysis and Voltage Support Strategy Through Equivalent Line Impedances for MMCs in AC/DC Hybrid Distribution Networks Under Asymmetrical Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10485271</link><description>Under asymmetrical fault, modular multilevel converters (MMCs) in AC/DC hybrid distribution network should limit fault currents and inject currents to support grid voltages. The effect of voltage support is related to the line impedances, hence, injecting active-reactive currents based on line impedance parameters is a valuable solution. However, there are some problems remained to be solved: 1) fault network is quite different with the pre-fault network, and equivalent model of fault network should be built accurately; 2) the optimal ratio of injected active-reactive currents  $(I_{\mathrm{d}} / I_{\mathrm{q}}$ ) based on the line impedances in equivalent model should be deduced; 3) impedance parameters in the model should be estimated. Thus, in this manuscript, fault analysis is described via symmetrical component method, and MMC-based interconnected sequence network (ISN) is proposed to illustrated the fault network with fault branch under the steady-state period of fault. Then voltage support strategy based on the equivalent line impedances of ISN model are put forward. Perturbation and observation algorithm is introduced to estimate these impedances. Finally, the proposed ISN model and the voltage support strategy are verified in MATLAB/Simulink.</description></item><item><title>Post-Disaster Robust Restoration Scheme for Distribution Network Considering Rerouting Process of Cyber System With 5G</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10492470</link><description>Due to global warming, the frequency of various extreme weather events is increasing worldwide, posing significant threats to the power system. As a substantial number of distributed energy resources (DERs) and other smart devices are integrated into the distribution system, traditional passive distribution systems are transforming into cyber-physical active distribution systems. Components in both the cyber network and the physical network may sustain damage following severe natural disasters. Therefore, this paper proposes a post-disaster restoration scheme for active distribution networks (ADNs) considering the coupling of cyber-physical systems. The innovation of this work lies in the full utilization of 5G networks, complemented by a novel rerouting process, which reconnects offline cyber devices after disasters. This approach substantially enhances the resilience of the cyber system, which in turn can effectively support the restoration process of the physical system. Furthermore, the uncertainty of DERs and the three-phase unbalanced characteristic of ADNs are taken into account. To reduce the computation complexity, linearization techniques are applied to nonlinear constraints, ultimately resulting in a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation based on a two-stage robust optimization model, which is solved by the column and constraint generation (C&amp;amp;CG) algorithm. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model are verified on both a modified IEEE 33-node system and a modified IEEE 123-node system integrated with cyber networks.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Single-Ended Transient-Based Boundary Protection Scheme for 35 kV Active Distribution Networks Based on Capacitive Voltage Transformers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504853</link><description>When many distributed generators (DGs) are connected to active distribution networks (ADNs), the performance of conventional overcurrent protection can seriously deteriorate. In response, single-ended transient-based boundary protection is considered an effective scheme for improving relay performance in ADNs due to its independence from power supply properties and its ability to cover an entire protected feeder. However, this approach depends on the filtering effect of the line boundary. This paper finds that capacitive voltage transformers (CVTs), metal-oxide arresters (MOAs), and the stray capacitances of the other apparatuses can serve together as line boundaries at substations and switching stations, and their excellent high-frequency filtering characteristics can assist in boundary protection design. A protection criterion is constructed based on the differences in high-frequency spectral energy between the internal and external fault-generated traveling waves (TWs). Furthermore, a novel two-stage boundary protection scheme is formed by reasonably coordinating the operation sequence and the protection scope of the first- and second-stage boundary protection. Finally, based on the PSCAD platform, the effectiveness, sensitivity, and reliability of the proposed protection scheme are verified under different fault scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Dispatch for Integrated Energy System Considering Data-Driven Dynamic Energy Hubs and Thermal Dynamics of Pipeline Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10485199</link><description>The modeling of dynamics in energy devices and pipeline networks reflects the real states of multi-energy flows, which is significant for realizing accurate optimal dispatch of integrated energy system (IES). In this paper, an approach with data-driven dynamic energy hubs (DDEH) and thermal dynamics of pipeline networks (TDPN) is proposed to describe the energy dynamic response process of IES. Based on the efficiency characteristics of energy conversion and storage devices, data-driven deep neural network (DNN) is adopted to excavate input-output relationship of the variable efficiency devices, which helps establish DDEH in time domain. To address the problem of nonlinear introduced by DNN, the nonlinear activation function in DDEH is equivalently converted into mixed integer linear model. At the same time, the TDPN is developed by bilateral characteristic line method (BCLM), which quantifies the time delay and loss of pipeline networks. TDNP demonstrates the network transportation dynamics in optimal dispatch, and the virtual energy storage effect of pipeline networks are analyzed. Case study from a community IES verifies the proposed approach effectively improve dynamic modeling accuracy of devices and pipeline networks, and have superiority in providing precise, reasonable and highly efficient optimal dispatch scheme.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Preserving Combined Heat and Power Dispatch Based on Information Masking Mechanism: A Decentralized Perspective</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504614</link><description>Combined heat and power dispatch (CHPD) has aroused widespread attention nowadays due to its great potentiality and cost-effectiveness for wind accommodation. However, the CHPD requires the joint operation of multiple energy agents, and the traditional dispatch scheme is inapplicable in engineering practice due to the demand for privacy preservation among energy agents. To tackle this issue, a privacy-preserving method based on the information masking (IM) mechanism is proposed, which converts the original CHPD problem into another masked CHPD problem by obscuring the privacy parameters of the electric power systems and district heating systems. Furthermore, considering the absence of a third party in practice, we develop an improved IM mechanism based on blockchain, enabling privacy preservation in a fully decentralized framework. Numerical simulations conducted across different cases testify the effectiveness of the proposed privacy-preserving method and tests based on an actual system in Jilin province demonstrate the feasibility of application in practice. The computational performance of the proposed method is validated as well.</description></item><item><title>Load Data Valuation in Multi-Energy Systems: An End-to-End Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10508249</link><description>Accurate load forecasting serves as the foundation for the flexible operation of multi-energy systems (MES). Multi-energy loads are tightly coupled and exhibit significant uncertainties. Many works focus on enhancing forecasting accuracy by leveraging cross-sector information. However, data owners may not be motivated to share their data unless it leads to substantial benefits. Ensuring a reasonable data valuation can encourage them to share their data willingly. This paper presents an end-to-end framework to quantify multi-energy load data value by integrating forecasting and decision processes. To address optimization problems with integer variables, a two-stage end-to-end model solution is proposed. Moreover, a profit allocation strategy based on contribution to cost savings is investigated to encourage data sharing in MES. The experimental results demonstrate a significant decrease in operation costs, suggesting that the proposed valuation approach more effectively extracts the inherent data value than traditional methods. According to the proposed incentive mechanism, all sectors can benefit from data sharing by improving forecasting accuracy or receiving economic compensation.</description></item><item><title>Two-Step Diffusion Policy Deep Reinforcement Learning Method for Low-Carbon Multi-Energy Microgrid Energy Management</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10529228</link><description>Coordinately scheduling multi-energy in a power system has attracted great research attention because of the benefits like improved energy utilization efficiency, lower system cost and carbon emission. However, the uncertainties from renewable power generation, energy supply and demand sides make this task highly complex. To solve it, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm with a novel diffusion model-based policy is proposed to optimize the problem of energy management in a multi-energy microgrid (MEMG) system. Moreover, a two-step reward function is developed to improve the training performance. To lower the overall carbon footprint and economic costs, the carbon emission trading and green certificate trading market mechanisms are introduced in our system to guide the end-user&#8217;s energy behaviors. A piece-wise linear carbon price model is proposed to constrain the undesired behavior more strictly and further reduce carbon emissions. The superior performance of the proposed scheduling method is compared with several benchmark methods, i.e., three state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, based on real-world datasets. Numerous case studies including three IEEE standard test systems have illustrated its effectiveness in terms of carbon reduction and cost efficiency, acquiring better convergence speed and stability at the same time, all of which lead our method to a better energy management strategy.</description></item><item><title>Online Operation Optimization for Hydrogen-Based Building Energy Systems Under Uncertainties</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10529226</link><description>Hydrogen-based energy systems have attracted widespread attention due to their capabilities of promoting renewable penetration and cutting carbon emissions. In this article, we study an operation optimization problem of a hydrogen-based building energy system. Since there are multi-source uncertainties related to electricity price, hydrogen price, electrical load, thermal load, and renewable generation output, spatially and temporally coupled constraints associated with power balance, heat balance, and energy storage systems, and nonlinear constraints, it is difficult to solve the considered optimization problem. To deal with the above difficulties, this paper proposes a low-complexity online operation optimization algorithm. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the algorithmic feasibility and performance guarantees. Extensive simulations verify that the proposed algorithm can achieve near-optimal performance and reduce operation cost by 2.81%-7.74% compared with five baselines, including model predictive control and deep reinforcement learning.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Agent Deep Constrained Q-Learning Method for Smart Building Energy Management Under Uncertainties</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10496495</link><description>Data-driven energy management with flexible appliances in smart buildings is a key towards power system operational intelligence. However, the low efficiency of existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods in terms of optimization and computational performance, caused by reward shaping, large neural networks, system-wide constraints and reward allocation of photovoltaic power generation, signifies the need for new system-specific DRL methods. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-agent deep constrained Q-learning method to obtain online optimal solutions for smart building energy management in presence of various uncertainties. The proposed method minimizes daily energy cost via real-time adjustment of flexible appliances, and addressing impacts of the uncertainties. A deep constrained Q-learning algorithm is developed to effectively avoid reward shaping. By adopting multi-layer perception to estimate thermodynamics and electric vehicle charging states, and developing appliance-specific logic, it is novel to calculate the joint safe action space of all appliances during the training process. A multi-agent approach is developed to address the system-wide constraints and the reward allocation, directly in the Q-update, where hyper-parameters of individual agents are tuned separately. Numerical simulation results verify the high efficiency of the proposed method in daily energy cost minimization and online energy management.</description></item><item><title>Under-Frequency Load Shedding for Power Reserve Management in Islanded Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10508572</link><description>This paper introduces under-frequency load shedding (UFLS) schemes specially designed to fulfill the power reserve requirements in islanded microgrids (MGs), where only one grid-forming resource is available for frequency regulation. When the power consumption of the MG exceeds a pre-defined threshold, the MG frequency will be lowered to various setpoints, thereby triggering UFLS for different levels of load reduction. Three types of controllable devices are considered for executing UFLS: sectionalizers, smart meters, and controllable appliances. To avoid unnecessary UFLS activation, various time delay settings are analyzed, allowing short-lived power spikes caused by events like motor startups or cold-load pickups to be disregarded. We tested the proposed UFLS schemes on a modified IEEE 123-bus system on the OPAL-RT eMEGASIM platform. Simulation results verify the efficacy of the proposed approaches in restoring power reserves, maintaining phase power balance, and effectively handling short-lived power fluctuations. Furthermore, in comparison to sectionalizer-based UFLS, using smart meters or controllable loads for UFLS allows for a more accurate per-phase load shedding in a progressive manner. As a result, it leads to better balanced three-phase voltage and serves more loads.</description></item><item><title>Pareto-Optimized Thermal Control of Multi-Zone Buildings Using Limited Sensor Measurements</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10530220</link><description>This paper presents a control-oriented building thermal model and optimization framework. Space heating is used as an illustrative example of a flexible building load, with temperature setpoints as a control input. The presented framework is applicable to practical building systems where measurements are limited by cost and installation burden. An Unscented Kalman Filter estimates parameters and disturbance inputs of a multi-zone thermal circuit. Forecast models of multiple exogenous input sources are created from disturbance proxies and estimated disturbance inputs. Zone-level controllers in the thermal circuit simulation estimate the heating system response based on forecasted exogenous thermal inputs and proposed temperature setpoint profiles. Genetic algorithm-based operations are used to find an approximate Pareto set, i.e., the best trade-offs in the objective space. The focus of this work is reducing energy usage from space heating, while maintaining or improving thermal comfort. The full framework is demonstrated using data collected from a university building. Results predict that the proposed method provides a lower energy consumption than the baseline strategy. The framework is implemented in practice in a model predictive control scheme.</description></item><item><title>Flexible Building Energy Management With Neural ODEs-Based Model Predictive Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10531060</link><description>The increasing renewable penetration leads to a great need for flexible resources to balance supply and demand. Building energy systems can provide considerable flexibility by optimally coordinating various appliances. However, the complex thermodynamics and insufficient data associated challenge the modeling and operation of building energy systems. To address this, this paper proposes a neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) based model predictive control (MPC) framework for building energy management. Flexibilities are explored from two aspects: building thermal capacity and energy equipment coordination. The former is modeled using neural ODEs due to its complexity, while the latter is modeled as an energy hub. Both models are integrated into MPC in a linear form. The neural ODEs model is designed to strike a balance between reliability and representational capability, as well as a balance between the accuracy of long- and short-term predictions. The proposed method is verified on a simulated multizone retail building. The results indicate that the proposed model has a higher accuracy than the traditional resistance&#8212;capacitance (RC) model and the neural network model in operation with efficient computational performance. The controlled building can respond to price signals while providing demand response resources, which may result in significant cost savings.</description></item><item><title>Online Learning for Robust Voltage Control Under Uncertain Grid Topology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10486962</link><description>Voltage control generally requires accurate information about the grid&#8217;s topology in order to guarantee network stability. However, accurate topology identification is challenging for existing methods, especially as the grid is subject to increasingly frequent reconfiguration due to the adoption of renewable energy. In this work, we combine a nested convex body chasing algorithm with a robust predictive controller to achieve provably finite-time convergence to safe voltage limits in the online setting where there is uncertainty in both the network topology as well as load and generation variations. In an online fashion, our algorithm narrows down the set of possible grid models that are consistent with observations and adjusts reactive power generation accordingly to keep voltages within desired safety limits. Our approach can also incorporate existing partial knowledge of the network to improve voltage control performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a case study on a Southern California Edison 56-bus distribution system. Our experiments show that in practical settings, the controller is indeed able to narrow the set of consistent topologies quickly enough to make control decisions that ensure stability in both linearized and realistic non-linear models of the distribution grid.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Two-Timescale Configuration of Mobile Edge Computing With Mixed Energy Supply</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504784</link><description>Powering mobile edge computing (MEC) with a hybrid supply of smart grid (SG) and renewable energy source (RES) offers an opportunity to utilize clean energy and cut down energy expenses under two-way energy transactions. We propose two-timescale online resource allocation and energy management (TSRE) for MEC with a hybrid power supply, adapting to dynamic task and RES arrivals, wireless channels, and energy prices. The TSRE minimizes the time-averaged cost of predictive energy planning and real-time energy trading of base stations (BSs), and the energy usage of mobile users. By generalizing the Lyapunov optimization and stochastic subgradient method, the energy planning (sub)problem is solved upon RES arrivals using only historical data. The real-time offloading schedules, energy trading decisions and CPU configurations are decoupled over time and (asymptotically) optimally made in a distributed manner. The feasibility and the asymptotic optimality of the TSRE are proved. Numerical results demonstrate that the TSRE saves system cost significantly by 33.7%, compared to its baselines.</description></item><item><title>Revenue Maximization for a Battery Storage With Optimal Capacity Revamping Due to Cyclic Fade</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10506242</link><description>An accurate approach for optimal revenue-stacking operation of battery storage assets should consider the degradation of their energy capacity as a result of cyclic charging/discharging operations.

However, scheduling massive HVACs is challenging due to computation complexity and the uncertainty of outdoor temperature. In this paper, we first introduce a novel continuous-time (CT) aggregation model to reveal the potential intra-hour flexibility of HVACs. For accurate aggregation, a new affine transformation is designed to handle the heterogeneity in high-dimensional feasible region. Further, for reliable aggregation in practical environment, the outdoor temperature uncertainty is constructed by distributionally robust chance constrains and integrated into the aggregation model. Secondly, for the tractable calculation of the proposed CT aggregation model, a cascade of tailored reformulation techniques is proposed, including the Bernstein polynomial spline, polytope projection, and linearization transformation. Thirdly, a customized hierarchical dispatch framework is proposed via incorporating the proposed CT aggregation model into reserve provision in power system dispatch, so as to efficiently schedule massive HVACs to cope with the renewable uncertainty. Case studies verify the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed CT aggregation model in aggregation accuracy, intra-hour flexibility utilization, and uncertainty handling.</description></item><item><title>Load Recognition With Few-Shot Transfer Learning Based on Meta-Learning and Relational Network in Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504869</link><description>Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) monitors the operating status and power consumption of residential appliances with only one main meter, providing a new measure for energy management. Deep learning (DL) shows outperformance in NILM. However, the lack of appliance data caused by rapid growth appliance types and high-cost data sampling reduces the DL-based load recognition accuracy. Transfer learning (TL) enables DL-based model generalization. However, the generalization would be limited when data in the target domain are insufficient. Therefore, a non-intrusive load recognizing (NILR) few-shot TL based on meta-learning and relational network is proposed to improve the load recognition generalization performance, named MRNILR-TL. First, the method constructs an episode task dataset by task sampling to provide diverse learnable tasks for few-shot load recognition training. Afterward, a multi-classification load recognition model based on meta-learning and relational network is constructed, and a meta-learning based relational network enhances the ability to learn the laws of similarity among appliance features from few-shot data. Finally, achieving the few-shot multi-classification load recognition generalization by directly transferring the source task knowledge and strategies to the target task. Experimental results in four transfer scenes demonstrate the proposed method achieves generalization and outperforms most existing NILM TL methods.</description></item><item><title>A Distributionally Robust Model Predictive Control for Static and Dynamic Uncertainties in Smart Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10486942</link><description>The integration of various power sources, including renewables and electric vehicles, into smart grids is expanding, introducing uncertainties that can result in issues like voltage imbalances, load fluctuations, and power losses. These challenges negatively impact the reliability and stability of online scheduling in smart grids. Existing research often addresses uncertainties affecting current states but overlooks those that impact future states, such as the unpredictable charging patterns of electric vehicles. To distinguish between these, we term them static uncertainties and dynamic uncertainties, respectively. This paper introduces WDR-MPC, a novel approach that stands for two-stage Wasserstein-based Distributionally Robust (WDR) optimization within a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, aimed at effectively managing both types of uncertainties in smart grids. The dynamic uncertainties are first reformulated into ambiguity tubes and then the distributionally robust bounds of both dynamic and static uncertainties can be established using WDR optimization. By employing ambiguity tubes and WDR optimization, the stochastic MPC system is converted into a nominal one. Moreover, we develop a convex reformulation method to speed up WDR computation during the two-stage optimization.

While prevailing evaluation metrics prioritize forecast quality, they often overlook the significant influence a forecast exerts when integrated into the V2G scheduling optimization. In this paper, a reliable metric is proposed for forecasts in the context of V2G scheduling from the perspective of forecast value. Firstly, we conducted meticulously designed experiments to expose the limitations of forecast quality metrics in the context of V2G scheduling, as well as reveal three key findings. Subsequently, to address computational challenges and enhance representativeness of scheduling results, statistical features of EV charging are used to construct the aggregate model of EV fleet. Then, a reliable metric called V2G scheduling value error (V2G-SVE) is proposed to evaluate the degradation rate of scheduling performance as the score for forecasting performance. Finally, extensive case studies provide compelling evidence for the effectiveness and broad applicability of V2G-SVE. Beyond proposing an evaluation metric, this paper also aims to provide valuable insights about potential direction of improvement for future load forecasting technology.</description></item><item><title>Factoring Electrochemical and Full-Lifecycle Aging Modes of Battery Participating in Energy and Transportation Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10533267</link><description>As the world transitions towards sustainable alternatives, transportation electrification emerges as a pivotal strategy within deep decarbonization initiatives undertaken by governments globally. Central to this shift is the role of batteries, specifically those in energy and transportation systems. However, a key challenge often overlooked is the impact of battery aging on the economy and longevity of electric vehicles (EVs). The pressing need to understand and mitigate the costs and implications of battery aging forms the crux of this research. This paper aims to improve the lifecycle economy of EVs participating in energy and transportation systems by factoring in the electrochemical aging modes of the battery. In the first stage, battery electrochemical aging features are modeled by learning cell fading rate under different healthy states from the Stanford experimental dataset. Then, by comprehensively quantifying the impact of depth of discharge, C-rate, state of health, and state of charge, this paper establishes a full lifecycle degradation model to model battery aging under different working conditions and aging stages. In the second stage, battery electrochemical aging features are further integrated into vehicle energy management to realize the effective utilization of BESS in energy and transportation systems. With the proposed energy management scheme, vehicle batteries with different electrochemical aging stages can be flexibly utilized under full lifecycles. The effectiveness of the proposed methodologies is verified under the cases of EVs participating in energy and transportation systems. Results in this paper validate the necessity of factoring battery electrochemical aging features in BESS management and provide a new perspective for further improving the total economy of transportation electrification.</description></item><item><title>AdaptEdge: Targeted Universal Adversarial Attacks on Time Series Data in Smart Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10488456</link><description>Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a key technique in smart grid operations for task classification of power quality disturbances (PQDs) nomenclature PQDsPower Quality Disturbances. Even though these models have considerably improved the efficiency of power infrastructure, their susceptibility to adversarial attacks presents potential difficulties. For the first time, we introduce a novel algorithm called Adaptive Edge (AdaptEdge), nomenclature AdaptEdgeAdaptive Edge which effectively employs targeted universal adversarial attack to deceive DL models working with time series data. The unique contribution of this algorithm is its ability to maintain a delicate balance between the fooling rate and the imperceptibility of perturbations to human observers.

To maintain the security of power systems, it is critical to develop efficient locational detectors for FDIAs. However, designing FDIA detectors that could model the inherent underlying graph structures of smart grids and spatially correlated measurement data residing on both branches and buses such that FDIAs in the edge space could be detected and located, remains an open problem. In this work, we propose an alternative graph representation for smart grids, regarding both the power flows on branches and power injections on buses, such that we could simultaneously process these data in the edge space. We propose a Hodge Aggregation Graph Neural Network (AGNN)-based FDIA detector, leveraging the Hodge theory and exploiting the Hodge Laplacian into the AGNN. We further develop a Hodge Aggregation Graph Attention Network (AGAT)-based FDIA detector to enhance the locational detection performance of the Hodge AGNN-based detector, by utilizing the graph attention mechanism. Illustrative simulation results demonstrate the superior locational detection performance of the proposed detectors, compared to the other state-of-the-art FDIA detectors.</description></item><item><title>Homomorphic Encryption-Based Resilient Distributed Energy Management Under Cyber-Attack of Micro-Grid With Event-Triggered Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504611</link><description>Privacy disclosures and malevolent data intrusions targeting adversarial agents pose significant menaces to cyber-physical systems, a reality that extends to the intricate realm of micro-grid energy management.

Even though various defending methods have been studied, it is still challenging to mitigate the damaging impact of LR attacks. In this paper, we propose a phase shifting transformers (PST) based mitigation method utilizing the widely deployed PST devices in optimal power flow (OPF), which can further improve the performance of existing mitigation methods. Specifically, a tri-level optimization is formulated and solved by the column and constraint generation (C&amp;amp;CG) decomposition method in the PST-based mitigation method, which gives the optimal set of PSTs for phase angle adjustment. Since a large amount of binary variables are introduced in the C&amp;amp;CG method, an approximate solution method of the tri-level optimization is presented to reduce computing burden without significantly affecting the optimality in large power systems. Simulations in the PJM 5-bus, IEEE 14-bus, IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus test systems verify the effectiveness and applicability of the PST-based mitigation method.</description></item><item><title>Experimental Cybersecurity Evaluation of Distributed Solar Inverters: Vulnerabilities and Impacts on the Australian Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10508264</link><description>The increasing adoption of solar power globally presents an environmentally sustainable alternative to traditional energy sources. However, integrating solar distributed generation (DG) systems into the power grid introduces complexities that can impact the grid&#8217;s reliability and security. While information and communication technologies have significantly improved the management and control of solar DG systems, they concurrently introduce new cybersecurity vulnerabilities. This study explores the security and stability challenges introduced by solar DG systems, with a specific focus on the vulnerabilities in commercial solar inverters.

LFC utilizes communication channels to generate control signals, thus it is potentially vulnerable to cyber-attacks and faults. This work considers a cyber-physical model for LFC in which the adversary compromises the resources of the cyber layer to inject a stealthy false data injection attack (FDIA) vector. The FDIA injects the best-effort stealthy error into the data collected by the LFC, corrupting the control center&#8217;s calculations and leading to incorrect control signals. To effectively manage this complex decision-making scenario, a game theory-based framework is established to analyze the interaction between the controller and the attacker. Based on the model, an FDIA defense mechanism based on a bi-level differential game is proposed. The experiments conducted on a three-region interconnected power system based on the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate that the proposed strategy can effectively maintain the stability of the frequency and inter-regional power deviation within acceptable limits, even in the presence of FDIAs.</description></item><item><title>Transferability-Oriented Adversarial Robust Security-Constrained Optimal Power Flow</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10521912</link><description>Security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) aims to achieve an economical operation while considering the security issues during contingencies. Data-driven security assessment methods can provide security constraints for SCOPF and have been widely developed in the smart grid community to deal with the challenges arising from the increased penetration of renewable energy resources and the deployment of power electronic devices. Nevertheless, it has been recognized that the machine learning model is vulnerable to adversarial examples, and the power system communication network is prone to cyber attacks, which affects the decision-making of security assessment and SCOPF. To this end, a transferability-oriented adversarial robust security-constrained optimal power flow (TOAR-SCOPF) is proposed to diminish the potential security risks from attacks, formulated as an attacker-defender problem. To alleviate the conservatism of TOAR-SCOPF, a more realistic scenario with unknown features and unknown selected machine learning models is considered in this work by developing a novel transferability-oriented adversarial attack (TOA) method for data-driven security assessment while considering the power system&#8217;s physical constraints to bypass the bad data detection mechanism. Case studies are conducted based on the IEEE 39-bus and IEEE 68-bus systems, respectively, to explore the vulnerability and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TOAR-SCOPF.</description></item><item><title>Voltage Calculations in Secondary Distribution Networks via Physics-Inspired Neural Network Using Smart Meter Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10517953</link><description>The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) leads to voltage issues across distribution networks, necessitating voltage calculations by utilities. Electric model-free voltage calculation offers an enticing solution. However, most researches mainly focus on primary distribution networks ignoring secondary distribution networks and commonly overlook extreme voltage case calculations, which require the model&#8217;s extrapolation abilities. In addressing the gaps, this paper presents a customized physics-inspired neural network (PINN) model, the structure of which is inspired by the derived coupled power flow model of primary-secondary distribution networks. To ensure precision and rapid convergence, a crafted training framework for the PINN model is proposed. The PINN&#8217;s &#8220;structure-mimetic&#8221; design enables superior extrapolation for unseen scenarios and enhances physical information awareness. We demonstrate this through two applications: hosting capacity analysis and customer-transformer connectivity. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed PINN model are validated on two public testing systems and one utility distribution feeder model.</description></item><item><title>Modularized Bilinear Koopman Operator for Modeling and Predicting Transients of Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10527356</link><description>Modularized Koopman bilinear form (M-KBF) is presented to model and predict the transient dynamics of microgrids in the presence of disturbances. As a scalable data-driven approach, M-KBF divides the identification and prediction of the high-dimensional nonlinear system into the individual study of subsystems, and thus, alleviates the difficulty of intensively handling high volume data and overcomes the curse of dimensionality. For each subsystem, Koopman bilinear form is established to efficiently identify its model by identifying isotypic eigenfunctions via the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) method with an eigenvalue-based order truncation. Extensive tests show that M-KBF can provide accurate transient dynamics prediction for the nonlinear microgrids and verify the plug-and-play modeling and prediction function, which offers a potent tool for identifying high-dimensional systems with reconfiguration feature. The modularity feature of M-KBF enables the provision of fast and precise prediction for the power grid operation and control, paving the way towards online applications.</description></item><item><title>A Generic Transient-Performance-Improved Framework for Privacy-Preserving Distributed Microgrid Controls</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10539270</link><description>Existing studies about the privacy-preserving distributed (PP-Di) controls of islanded AC microgrid (MG) rely on adding the decaying disturbance into communications, such as correlated decaying noise and exponentially decaying disturbance.

The proposed integration method is applied to motion control of autonomous road vehicles, providing safe motion. The RL-based control agent is used to determine the steering angle and reference velocity of the vehicle to achieve high-performance motion. The chosen reward function is used to achieve different driving behaviors, e.g. high-velocity motion with minimal lap time, path following, or the limitation of control energy. The RL-based control through Proximal Policy Optimization method during episodes is performed. Safe motion is achieved by using a supervisory control framework which is based on the robust $\mathcal {H}_\infty$ control method, and able to keep limits on lateral path tracking error. The effectiveness of the proposed control through simulation examples with comparisons to predictive control methods is illustrated.

However, two major problems hinder its implementation, including the inaccuracy of the EV charging model and the overlook of varieties in EV ownership. To facilitate real-world implementation, this paper tailors a market-based mechanism to incentivize EVs to provide frequency regulation services. Firstly, a detailed EV charging model considering the battery equivalent circuit and AC-DC conversion loss is proposed. The nonconvexities are approximated and convexified with accuracy guarantee. Then, based on the self-interest behavior of EVs, a non-cooperative game is adopted to model the competition in providing frequency regulation service. The aggregative game is used to approximate the original non-cooperative game. Thereby, the existence, uniqueness, and approximation accuracy of the aggregative equilibrium is theoretically proved. Moreover, the rolling look-ahead iterative frequency regulation service clearing mechanism for EV parking lot is designed based on the decentralized equilibrium searching algorithm of the aggregative game. Finally, the effectiveness, computational efficiency, and approximation accuracy of the proposed market-based mechanism are validated by a series of numerical tests with EV populations at 50, 100, 200, 300, 600, and 900.</description></item><item><title>Minimizing Energy Consumption in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10517312</link><description>We consider a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system that consists of distributed multi-antenna access points (APs) connected to a central processing unit (CPU), and APs coherently serve a set of single-antenna user equipments (UEs) in the same frequency-time resource in downlink (DL) communications. Serving all UEs by all APs leads to inefficient use of spectral resources as well as energy under low traffic load. This work focuses on minimizing the energy consumed to transmit a bit in the cell-free massive MIMO system for given spectral efficiency (SE) requirements. First, we propose an algorithm to achieve the max-min fairness in DL communications while minimizing the total power consumption of the cell-free system. Secondly, we present an algorithm to reduce the total power consumption for a given minimum target SE of the system by temporarily switching off a set of APs that is not contributing to overall system performance. Finally, we suggest a technique to reduce the average number of state transitions of APs in a system with dynamic UEs, over a period of time. It minimizes the average transition power consumption over a period where large-scale fading values change multiple times. The numerical results show that the proposed algorithms reduce the overall energy consumption of the system compared to the situation where all APs are active.</description></item><item><title>STAR-RIS-Assisted Communication Radar Coexistence: Analysis and Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10509821</link><description>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is expected to play a prominent role among emerging technologies in future wireless communications. In particular, a communication radar coexistence system is degraded significantly by mutual interference. In this work, given the advantages of promising reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), we propose a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS)-assisted radar coexistence system where a STAR-RIS is introduced to improve the communication performance while suppressing the mutual interference and providing full space coverage. Based on the realistic conditions of correlated fading, and the presence of multiple user equipments (UEs) at both sides of the RIS, we derive the achievable rates at the radar and the communication receiver side in closed forms in terms of statistical channel state information (CSI). Next, we perform alternating optimization (AO) for optimizing the STAR-RIS and the radar beamforming. Regarding the former, we optimize the amplitudes and phase shifts of the STAR-RIS through a projected gradient ascent algorithm (PGAM) simultaneously with respect to the amplitudes and phase shifts of the surface for both energy splitting (ES) and mode switching (MS) operation protocols. The proposed optimization saves enough overhead since it can be performed every several coherence intervals. This property is particularly beneficial compared to reflecting-only RIS because a STAR-RIS includes the double number of variables, which require increased overhead. Finally, simulation results illustrate how the proposed architecture outperforms the conventional RIS counterpart, and show how the various parameters affect the performance. Moreover, a benchmark full instantaneous CSI (I-CSI) based design is provided and shown to result in higher sum-rate but also in large overhead associated with complexity.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Joint Spectrum Sensing and Resource Allocation Scheme in Cognitive Internet of Vehicles Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10521827</link><description>With the rapid development of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), the cognitive radio-based IoV (CIoV) network is widely used to overcome the lack of spectrum resources. In this paper, a novel joint spectrum sensing and resource allocation (JSS-RA) scheme in the CIoV system is investigated. The JSS-RA process is divided into two phases. In the spectrum sensing phase, our scheme considers the dynamic vehicular environment to adjust the decision threshold individually for each vehicle. In the resource allocation (RA) phase, we first propose a general utility-efficiency function. The various parameters contained in this function enable its transformation into many mainstream objective functions. Subsequently, the RA issue is formulated as a joint orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) symbol and power optimization, which is also known as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). We solve the original optimization by decomposing it into two subproblems. The theorems prove that the global optimum solution can be obtained by combining the results of two decomposed subproblems. Besides, the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm is discussed. Finally, numerical simulations verify the excellent performance and robustness of our JSS-RA scheme.</description></item><item><title>Secure SWIPT in the Multiuser STAR-RIS Aided MISO Rate Splitting Downlink</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10572362</link><description>Recently, simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs) have emerged as a novel technology that provides $360^{\circ}$ coverage and new degrees-of-freedom (DoFs). They are also capable of manipulating signal propagation and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). This paper introduces a novel STAR-RIS-aided secure SWIPT system for downlink multiple input single output rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) networks. The transmitter concurrently communicates with the information receivers (IRs) and sends energy to untrusted energy receivers (UERs). The UERs are also capable of wiretapping the IR streams. We assume that the channel state information (CSI) of the IRs is known at the information transmitter, but only imperfect CSI for the UERs is available at the energy transmitter. By exploiting RSMA, the base station splits the messages of the IRs into common and private parts. The former is encoded into a common stream that can be decoded by all IRs, while the private messages are individually decoded by their respective IRs. We find the precoders and STAR-RIS configuration that maximizes the achievable worst-case sum secrecy rate of the IRs under a total transmit power constraint, a sum energy constraint for the UERs, and subject to constraints on the transmission and reflection coefficients. The formulated problem is non-convex and has intricately coupled variables. To tackle this challenge, a suboptimal two-step iterative algorithm based on the sequential parametric convex approximation method is proposed. Simulations demonstrate that the RSMA-based algorithm implemented with a STAR-RIS enhances both the rate of confidential information transmission and the total spectral efficiency. Furthermore, our method surpasses the performance of both orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and non-OMA (NOMA).</description></item><item><title>FR2 5G Networks for Industrial Scenarios: Experimental Characterization and Beam Management Procedures in Operational Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10520933</link><description>Industrial environments constitute a challenge in terms of radio propagation due to the presence of machinery and the mobility of the different agents, especially at mmWave bands. This paper presents an experimental evaluation of a FR2 5G network deployed in an operational factory scenario at 26 GHz. The experimental characterization, performed with autonomous mobile robots that self-navigate the industrial lab, leads to the analysis of the received power along the factory and the evaluation of reference path gain models. The proposed assessment deeply analyzes the physical layer of the communication network under operational conditions. Thus, two different network configurations are assessed by measuring the power received in the entire factory, providing a comparison between deployments. Additionally, beam management procedures, such as beam recovery, beam sweeping or beam switching, are analyzed since they are crucial in environments where mobile agents are involved. They aim for a zero interruption approach based on reliable communications. The results analysis shows that beam recovery procedures can perform a beam switching to an alternative serving beam with power losses of less than 1.6 dB on average. Beam sweeping analysis demonstrates the prevalence of the direct component in Line-of-Sight conditions despite the strong scattering component and large-scale fading in the environment.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Objective MDP-Based Routing in UAV Networks for Search-Based Operations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10520934</link><description>Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems have gained widespread recognition due to their versatility and autonomy. Their deployment for disaster mitigation and management operations is seen as one of their most important applications over the past decade. In such UAV networks, routing plays a crucial role in determining network performance parameters such as network lifetime, data transmission latency, and packet delivery ratio. This paper presents a novel routing mechanism - Multi-Objective Markov Decision Based Routing (MOBMDP) for UAV networks carrying out search-based operations. MOBMDP models routing decisions in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework and uses Q-learning to take decisions. It compares routing paths using three metrics, viz., Remaining Energy of the Minimum Energy Node (REMEN), Power Distance ratio (PD), and Expected Delay (ED). Amongst these metrics, PD is a novel metric proposed by this work. PD simultaneously optimizes the energy efficiency and energy distribution in the network. Further, MOBMDP uses a novel reinforcement learning inspired method to estimate transmission delay in a given path. Intensive simulation studies compare MOBMDP to four state-of-the-art routing protocols. Results show a significant improvement in network lifetime, packet delivery ratio, energy efficiency, average data transmission delay, and error in delay estimation.</description></item><item><title>A Blockchain-Enabled Vehicular Edge Computing Framework for Secure Performance-Oriented V2X Service Delivery</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10508967</link><description>Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) has emerged as a promising paradigm to enable low-latency Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) services by bringing computing resources closer to vehicles.

MBS and SBS are deployed to accommodate a large number of users for the purpose of achieving higher data rates, coverage, and improved outage performance. Recognized for its spectrum efficiency, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) emerges as a viable multiple-access technique for sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. To maximize power efficiency and reduce outage probability, the power amplifier at the base station is operated close to saturation, which results in nonlinear distortions. Thus, it is vital to understand the fundamental performance guarantees of practical NOMA-enabled HCN systems (HCN-NOMA) under nonlinear distortions introduced by high power amplifiers (HPA). In this paper, we employ an analytical performance evaluation of HCN-NOMA using stochastic geometric approach consisting of a multi-tier architecture with nonlinear distortions produced by HPA. We compare and highlight the impact of HPA operating in the linear and nonlinear regions on orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and NOMA in multi-tier HCN. The performance is assessed and compared in terms of outage probability, system throughput, and energy efficiency. It is observed that the performance is improved by up to 96.6% in HCN employing NOMA versus OMA while considering the nonlinear region of operation of HPA.</description></item><item><title>Towards Beam Hopping and Power Allocation in Multi-Beam Satellite Systems With Parameterized Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10522975</link><description>The simultaneous optimisation of beam hopping and power allocation is a crucial technique for enhancing the performance of Multi-Beam Satellite (MBS) systems. However, the previous joint optimisation approaches cannot well handle with the issues of high-dimensional state space and discrete-continuous hybrid action space. In this paper, we propose a joint optimization approach based on parameterized reinforcement learning to simultaneously regulate beam hopping and power allocation for MBS systems (called DeepMBS). In DeepMBS, a multi-objective problem is firstly formulated to optimize system throughput and energy efficiency. Then, the optimization problem is modelled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and the original deep Q-network is extended with a parameterized action space to simultaneously determine the beam hopping (discrete action) and power allocation (continuous action). In addition, we design an empirical filtering mechanism to enhance the performance of DeepMBS. Finally, the results of extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DeepMBS can gain a better performance in terms of throughput and energy efficiency compared to the baseline algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed DeepMBS (EFM) algorithm demonstrates superior accuracy and sensitivity in capturing changes of communication demands.</description></item><item><title>Energy-Efficient Task Offloading for Distributed Edge Computing in Vehicular Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10518091</link><description>The rapid growth of intelligent connected vehicles fosters the development of Internet-of-Vehicle (IoV) applications. Due to the complex traffic environments, integrated sensing, communication and computation (ISCC) technology would be seen as an efficient paradigm to support a plethora of IoV applications, which causes such a surge of computation-intensive tasks that the task computation with a single server node cannot keep energy-efficient under the strict delay constraints. Inspired by the idea of distributed computing, a scheme of distributed edge computing-based task offloading for ISCC is designed and various assisted edge nodes (AENs) are introduced in a stochastic geometry approach to alleviate the dilemma of energy consumption. After analyzing the proposed joint optimization problem for energy minimization, a double-iteration joint optimization algorithm (DIJOA) is developed to derive the solution. The results of the performance evaluation not only verify the plausibility of the proposed model, but also indicate that the introduction of AENs can significantly reduce system energy consumption and the proposed algorithm outperforms other schemes by over 2.5% in energy consumption, which corroborates the superiority of the proposed scheme through numerical simulations.</description></item><item><title>Queuing Analysis of Energy Harvesting-Aided NOMA-MEC Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10521755</link><description>Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and energy harvesting (EH) have emerged as promising technologies to improve the energy efficiency and capacity of mobile edge computing (MEC) network. In this network, the mobile users utilize harvested energy to support the tasks computed locally or offloaded to MEC server through NOMA transmission. We propose an analytical framework to comprehensively explore the performance of the task processing procedure under EH-aided NOMA-MEC network. Specifically, taking into account the EH constraint, local computing capacity, and NOMA offloading constraint, a four-dimensional Markov chain is introduced to model the task processing in each mobile user. To obtain the steady state of this Markov chain, we employ queuing theory to construct a discrete-time Geo/G/1 queue. By deriving the successful computation probability and the successful offloading probability, the mean response time for task completion is derived, which is a critical performance metric for the network. Numerical simulations are provided to verify the accuracy and facilitate the performance of the proposed framework.</description></item><item><title>Offloading of Tasks With Tight Delay Requirements via Combined Half and Full Duplex UAV Relays</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10508505</link><description>In this paper, we focus on offloading of computationally demanding tasks with tight processing delay requirements (hundreds of ms) from user equipments (UEs) to multi-access edge computing servers while exploiting unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as relays. Traditionally addressed problem jointly optimizing an offloading decision and an association of the UEs to the UAVs is, in our work, enriched by optimization of the relaying via UAVs through selection between half-duplex (HD) and full-duplex (FD) under a constraint on the maximum processing delay of individual tasks. To solve this complex problem, we also optimize the length of relaying time slots in HD and the transmission power allocation for the UEs and the UAVs in FD. Then, we transform the problem to one-to-many matching and propose a low-complexity greedy algorithm for the joint offloading decision and UEs association solved together with the duplex selection. We show that our proposal reduces the sum energy consumed by the UEs and UAVs for the tasks offloading by up to 40% compared to related works.</description></item><item><title>Photovoltaics and Agriculture Nexus: Exploring the Influence of Agrivoltaics on Food Production and Electricity Generation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10613921</link><description>Photovoltaic (PV) installations contribute to more sustainable solutions in satisfying clean energy requirements and are essential to global efforts to mitigate climate change. The PV development has extensive space requirements, complicated by the increasing competition for land due to rising population growth and food demand. By installing solar panels on agricultural land, agrivoltaic (APV) offers a resource-efficient solution to the persistent problem of competition for arable lands. This study presents a systematic review of the impact of APV applications on crop yields, agricultural product quality, plant growth microclimate, power generation, human comfort level, economic benefits, and social welfare. In total, 138 APV studies were reviewed in five typical agricultural scenarios, including open-field farming, greenhouse, aquaculture, livestock farming, and forestry, and 34 articles summarized the main metrics for evaluating APV performance. The majority of studies indicate positive impacts of APV on open-field agricultural practices. APV coverage of less than 20% on the greenhouse roof has minimal adverse effects. Livestock farming APV helps reduce heat stress and improve animal welfare. Deploying APV panels in aquaculture fishery mitigates the rise in water temperature and improves water quality. The quantitative analysis and investigation of the impact of APV on agricultural production in this study help develop efficient APV systems worldwide.</description></item><item><title>Improvement of Laser Contact Opening in Bifacial PERC Solar Cells by Optimizing the Dashed Pattern</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10577474</link><description>The laser contact opening in passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) is essential for establishing contact between silicon and aluminum. On bifacial PERC solar cells, dashed patterns are commonly employed as an alternative to continuous openings to mitigate excessive losses associated with passivation film removal. In this work, we investigate the optimization of dashed patterns in detail. First, under the condition of the same 50% opening ratio, the optimal total length of segments is determined to be 1.2 mm. Subsequently, testing various opening ratio patterns on wafers with different resistivities reveals that low-resistivity wafers are better suited for low opening ratio patterns. Finally, simulation analyses using Quokka2 software assess the variations in power loss associated with different opening patterns, the simulation results align with those of experiments. This work provides a guidance for the rear-side laser opening pattern design of bifacial PERC solar cells.</description></item><item><title>Development of APCVD BSG and POCl3 Codiffusion Process for Double-Side TOPCon Solar Cell Precursor Fabrication</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10599136</link><description>This article presents a commercially viable process for fabricating a high-quality double-side tunnel oxide passivating contact (DS-TOPCon) cell precursor using atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition deposited boron silicate glass and ex situ POCl3 diffusion in a single high-temperature step, eliminating the need for additional masking and diffusion processes. A two-tier temperature profile was developed, involving a preannealing at above 900 &#176;C in nitrogen ambient followed by POCl3 diffusion at 840 &#176;C. We investigated the effect of varying preannealing temperatures, ranging from 875 to 950 &#176;C, on the passivation quality and metal-Si contact properties of both n-TOPCon and p-TOPCon layers. The resultant DS-TOPCon cell precursor after silicon nitride passivation exhibited an excellent iVOC of close to 730 mV. In addition, a rapid asymmetric poly-Si thinning technique, developed in this work, enabled adjustment of the front n+ poly-Si thickness while maintaining the rear p+ poly-Si thickness. Two types of DS-TOPCon cell architectures can be fabricated: i) full-area thin (&#8776;40 nm) n-TOPCon layer on the front and ii) selective-area thick (&#8776;200 nm) n-TOPCon fingers underneath the metal grid. Device simulations suggest that full-area DS-TOPCon cell with 40 nm n+ poly-Si and selective-area DS-TOPCon cell with 200 nm n+ poly fingers on the front, fabricated from our current DS-TOPCon cell precursor, can achieve cell efficiencies of 22.1% and 23.5%, respectively. Detailed power loss analysis and device simulation reveal that further improvements in material and device parameters have the potential to push the cell efficiencies of DS-TOPCon cell structure beyond 25%, making it a promising alternative to fabricate high-efficiency next-generation solar cells at low cost.</description></item><item><title>CdSe With Mixed Zincblende and Wurtzite Phases Grown on Lattice-Matched InAs Substrates Using Molecular Beam Epitaxy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10584072</link><description>The II&#8211;VI compound semiconductor CdSe, which has both zincblende (ZB) and wurtzite (WZ) phases with bandgap energies of 1.67 and 1.74 eV, respectively, is an ideal candidate material for the top cell in a tandem solar cell with a Si bottom cell to achieve higher power conversion efficiency. In this work, molecular beam epitaxy growth of CdSe thin films on lattice-matched InAs(100) substrates reveals a single-phase ZB structure with high crystallinity and a low defect density. In contrast, all CdSe layers grown on InAs(111)B substrates have mixed ZB and WZ phases in coexistence, as confirmed by high-resolution X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and photoluminescence (PL) measurements. The PL efficiencies of the CdSe layers grown on (111)B substrates are substantially lower than those grown on (100) substrates. This result is attributed to defects at the boundaries between the two different phases. Postgrowth annealing of CdSe layers grown on InAs(111)B at 250&#8211;450&#8201;&#176;C converts most of the CdSe ZB material into the WZ phase, as evidenced by improved PL efficiency and TEM images. Density functional theory simulations confirm that the formation energy difference between the ZB and WZ phases for CdSe is very small compared with other conventional compound semiconductors, which is in good agreement with the experimental observations.</description></item><item><title>Photovoltaic Cable Connectors: A Comparative Assessment of the Present State of the Industry</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10596700</link><description>The consequences of failure for balance-of-systems components (such as photovoltaic (PV) cable connectors) include offline module string(s); low system voltage; arc, ground, insulation, and overtemperature faults; triggered fuse(s); system shutdown; and fire. The degradation modes for connectors are studied here through an industry survey and its subsequent examination, which are compared with field-degraded specimens. A total of 117 specimens were obtained from a variety of locations and climates or accelerated tests. A failure analysis for connectors from PV installations was developed (and applied to 54 specimens), including nondestructive examinations (photography, a custom resistance&#8211;current scan, and X-ray computed tomography) and destructive examinations (featuring milling of the external plastic, extraction of the internal convolute spring, and potting and polishing in cross section). Surface and through-thickness composition of the metal pins and springs was quantified using scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to verify the base polymer materials and compare the chemical structure of the connector body, bushing, end nut, and o-ring. Thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry were used to further verify the degradation of the same polymeric components.</description></item><item><title>Irradiance Monitoring for Bifacial PV Systems&#8217; Performance and Capacity Testing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10614655</link><description>Three standards for photovoltaic (PV) performance and capacity testing are evaluated for bifacial PV system reporting: performance ratio, ASTM E2848, and a new draft of IEC 61724-2. In this context, challenges and recommendations for rear irradiance instrumentation are described for three types of bifacial irradiance sensors&#8212;horizontal albedometer, backward-facing reference cells (or pyranometer), and bifacial reference module. A year of operating field data for single-axis tracked bifacial and monofacial systems was collected, including periods of high surface albedo due to snow ground cover. If snowy conditions are included, we found that all three methods performed comparably to the monofacial baseline case, but only if rear-measured irradiance is incorporated into the expected energy calculation. The lowest RMS error was obtained by following the draft IEC 61724-2 standard and using a calibrated bifacial reference module for bifacial irradiance resource. If measured rear irradiance is unavailable, field conditions either need to be filtered to avoid variable (snowy) albedo or an albedometer measurement can be used in conjunction with modeled rear irradiance along with the draft IEC procedure. Additional practical factors are described, including the proper placement of rear irradiance sensors and the proper interpretation of IEC 61724-1 bifacial performance ratio calculations.</description></item><item><title>A Global Nonlinear Model for Photovoltaic Modules Based on 3-D Surface Fitting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10568301</link><description>The main objective of this work is to propose a global nonlinear model (GNLM), valid under varying solar irradiance (G) and temperature (T) conditions, generating characteristic curves that closely replicate the actual behavior of the evaluated modules. The proposed GNLM incorporates a technique that combines surface polynomial fitting based on numerical optimization. This integration results in the creation of unique adaptable surfaces for each parameter, providing them with flexibility. Additionally, the research also aims to investigate other nonlinear global models for photovoltaic modules and conduct a comparative study of accuracy. The proposed model demonstrated significantly superior results compared with the best model evaluated in the literature for xSi modules, with a normalized mean absolute error in power (NMAEP) percentage difference of 98.21% and a normalized root mean square deviation (NRMSD) difference of 25.60%. In contrast, for mSi modules, the results showed a slight improvement over the same model, with an NMAEP percentage difference of 26.19% and an NRMSD difference of 1.52%. Similarly, for CdTe modules, there was an NMAEP percentage difference of &#8722;0.84% and an NRMSD difference of 12.82%.</description></item><item><title>Abrasion of PV Antireflective Coatings by Robot Cleaning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10568306</link><description>The growing use of photovoltaic (PV) cleaning machines (&#8220;robots&#8221;) raises the risk of abrasion to the antireflective coating (ARC) on modules&#8217; front glass. ARC abrasion is often studied via accelerated lab tests, however field tests are needed to achieve real-world abrasion conditions. In this study nine types of PV modules and five types of ARC coupons were subjected to 18 months of dry-brush robot cleaning in the desert climate of Doha, Qatar. Three cleaning schedules were tested: daily, weekly, and never (reference samples subject to weathering alone). Modules&#8217; power (Pmax), current (Isc), and reflectivity changes were measured and compared between the various cleaning schedules. It was found that the abrasion resistance of PV modules varied greatly. Five kinds of module showed greater losses with more frequent cleaning, while the other four did not. Lab profilometry of the coupons similarly found large variability of the depth and quantity of scratches for different ARCs, because of the difference in ARC durability between modules, and the likelihood that different cleaning robots will vary in their harshness, it is recommended to test specific robot/module pairs in the field to be confident of their ARC degradation rate.</description></item><item><title>A Method for the Estimation of Missing Strings in Very-Large-Scale Photovoltaic Power Plants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10613882</link><description>This article presents a novel methodology to detect missing strings in very-large-scale photovoltaic (VLSPV) systems, utilizing only data acquired at the stringbox level.

The proposed bifacial as well as commercial PVs are modeled based on the developed mathematical framework. PV systems with the proposed and commercial panels are investigated. Simulation results show that the developed model accurately portrays the values achieved in the experimental testbed for the proposed panel. Performance study of the proposed panel-based PV system produced the highest energy with space consideration in contrast to commercial panels while being economically effective.</description></item><item><title>An Electrical-Thermal Co-Simulation Model of Chiplet Heterogeneous Integration Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10614207</link><description>Chiplet heterogeneous integration (CHI) is one of the important technology choices to continue Moore&#8217;s law. However, due to the characteristics of high power and low supply voltage in CHI systems, heavy currents need to flow through the power delivery network (PDN), and the Joule heating effect will result in the overall temperature increase of the CHI system. Meanwhile, the high temperature will cause the current as well as the performance of the system to degrade and a series of reliability problems will occur. In this article, an effective electrical-thermal coupling model is proposed to predict the steady-state temperature distribution of a 2.5-D CHI system considering the Joule heating effect and the temperature effect on the IR drop. The equivalent electrical conductivity model is also built up to describe the design features of the redistribution layer (RDL), bump, and through silicon via (TSV) structures based on the electrical-thermal duality. Furthermore, the governing equations for voltage distribution and temperature distribution are solved simultaneously by utilizing the finite volume method (FVM) with nonuniform mesh to realize the electrical-thermal co-simulation of the multiscale CHI system. The model application is further performed to investigate the influence of the model parameters on the voltage drop and temperature distribution of the CHI system. The verified systems and simulated results of the present investigation demonstrate the viability and accuracy of voltage and temperature field co-simulation and indicate that the new proposed electrical-thermal model is helpful in thermal and voltage drop analysis of packaging structures with the Joule heating effect and can be adopted to assist in the physical design optimization of 2.5-D CHI or 3-D heterogeneous stacked chips.</description></item><item><title>A Dual-Mode Buck Converter with Light-Load Efficiency Improvement and Seamless Mode Transition Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10591729</link><description>In order to improve the efficiency over a wide load range, a power converter of the Internet of Things (IoT) usually works in dual modes, which are pulsewidth modulation (PWM) and pulse frequency modulation (PFM). A mixed load detection scheme is adopted to enable the appropriate modes under different loads, whose analog detector has an accurate detection in the heavy load, and the digital load detection improves the light-load efficiency. When the power converter operates in different modes, the control loops are different. Meanwhile, a seamless mode transition technique (SMTT) is presented in this article to improve the transient response during mode change between PWM and PFM. A test chip was fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu $ m standard CMOS process, and the chip area is  $1.59\times 1.37$  mm2. The experimental results show that the efficiency is above 85.3% under  $V_{\text {IN}}=3.3$  V,  $V_{\text {OUT}}=1.8$  V, and in the load range from 1 to 300 mA, while peak efficiency can reach 96.1% at 100-mA load. Compared to the case without the proposed technique, the under/overshoot voltage can be reduced by above 55% during the mode transition.</description></item><item><title>Design and Analysis of a New Three-Stage Feedback Amplifier Utilizing Signal Flow Graph Domain Inspection Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10609834</link><description>In this article, the design strategy with the analysis in the graph domain and changing the signal flow graph (SFG) of an amplifier are employed according to the graph rules at the system level. A three-stage amplifier, which expands the dual-path structure and buffering-based pole relocation amplifier through the graph domain inspection by using the graph rules, is proposed. By adding order of denominator in main fraction of the equivalent impedance of active zero block, the proposed amplifier can effectively increase the driving ability while enhancing the amplifier&#8217;s stability for a large range of capacitive load. The second pole is located at a higher frequency to increase the phase margin (PM). Circuit implementation of the proposed amplifier is simulated in 0.18- $\mu $  CMOS standard technology with 0.004-mm2 active area and 8.8- $\mu $  power consumption. Post-layout simulation results show 130 dB in dc gain, with a 670-kHz unity-gain frequency, while the amplifier uses a 400-fF compensation capacitor. The amplifier has obtained a PM of 60.4&#176; at C $_{\text {L}} =3.7$  nF. An average slew rate (SR) of 0.38 v/ $\mu $  s was measured when the proposed amplifier was in unity-gain configuration to drive a 3.7-nF load capacitor.

The proposed conjugation method provides an internal high-impedance node, by which the transconductance of the amplifier is significantly increased. Since the central node of the conjugated CMs is virtually grounded for small differential signals, the cascode devices of the diode-connected topologies can be employed as an extra differential pair causing a further enhancement in transconductance. Moreover, the large signal behavior of the circuit shows that the conjugated CMs are capable of copying a dynamic current with a higher gain in comparison with a traditional CM amplifier. This advantage results in faster charging and discharging of the output capacitive load, which provides a larger slew rate (SR) without increasing the quiescent current. The proposed amplifier was manufactured with TSMC 0.18- $\mu $ m CMOS technology occupying a silicon area of  $55.5\times 48.9~\mu $ m. Experimental results at a supply voltage of 1.8 V show a gain bandwidth (GBW) of 104.9 MHz, a dc gain of 79.1 dB, and an SR of 55.7 V/ $\mu $ s for a capacitive load of 10 pF, while the circuit consumes 489- $\mu $ W power.</description></item><item><title>A 20-V Pulse Driver Based on All-nMOS Charge Pump Without Reversion Loss and Overstress in 65-nm Standard CMOS Technology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10633274</link><description>This article proposes a high-efficiency all-nMOS bidirectional charge pump (CP) cell and constructs a CP-based high-voltage (HV) pulse driver based on it. Double-diode substrate isolation (DDSI) can extend the maximum supported voltage in a bulk CMOS process, but it requires an all-nMOS implementation of CP cells. Existing all-nMOS CPs either do not support the bidirectional charge transfer required for HV pulse drivers, or achieve it with additional penalties such as reversion charge loss and overstress on transistors. The proposed all-nMOS CP with novel gate voltage control strategies is the first one reported in the literature that can support the bidirectional charge transfer required for HV pulse drivers without suffering from reversion loss and threshold voltage loss or causing overstress on transistors. A ten-stage CP-based HV pulse driver is implemented in a 65-nm CMOS process utilizing this cell. Postlayout simulation results demonstrate that it can reliably generate 20-V HV pulses from a 2.5 V supply for a 15 pF // 200 k $\Omega $  load at 55 kHz. The driver exhibits a peak power efficiency of 46.4% and occupies an area of 0.262 mm2.</description></item><item><title>Model-Based Study on the Limit of the Dynamic Load Regulation Performance of a Digital Low Dropout Regulator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10601616</link><description>A digital low dropout (DLDO) regulator is one of the most critical building blocks in on-chip power management for its technology portability, voltage scalability, and other benefits associated with digital-oriented design. A key metric of DLDOs is the dynamic load regulation performance, often measured as the maximum current that a DLDO can quickly supply upon a significant load step under a voltage droop constraint (usually 10% of the output voltage). Previous works focused on architecture and circuit techniques to improve this metric. However, limited research focuses on the model development for the dynamic load regulation performance. To fill this gap, in this article, we propose the analytical models of the maximum load current of the standard DLDOs employing feedback and feedforward control laws. The developed models shed light on the impact of various design parameters on the total load current of a DLDO, with which both circuit and system designers can navigate the design space quickly and effectively.</description></item><item><title>An Injection-Locked and Sub-Sampling Clock Multiplier With a Two-Step SC DAC Achieving 2.67% Jitter Variation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10571831</link><description>This article presents an injection-locked clock multiplier (ILCM) using a digitally controlled frequency-tracking loop (FTL) with an integral two-step switched-capacitor (SC) digital-to-analog converter (DAC). Conventionally, the DAC resolution needs to be increased for low noise at the cost of degraded monotonicity due to device mismatch. To overcome this tradeoff, the proposed DAC utilizes the SC technique to achieve fine steps. With only two capacitors involved in charge transfer, the DAC is inherently monotonic, avoiding the boundary-crossing issue and the mismatch calibration. A control-voltage-tracking loop (CVTL) further suppresses the quantization noise by balancing the up and down step sizes and helps achieve a 16-bit-level voltage step. The FTL is sub-sampling and utilizes a bang-bang phase detector (BBPD). Locking at 700 MHz, the ILCM achieves a 0.9-ps integrated jitter, a -125-dBc/Hz phase noise at a 1-MHz offset, and a small jitter variation of 2.67% under different supply voltages and temperatures. With FTL, the spur is around -56 dBc from the prototype fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS process. The chip occupies a core area of 0.054 mm2 and consumes  $689~\mu $ W from a 1.8-V supply, achieving an FoM of -242.5 dB.</description></item><item><title>Toward Efficient Asynchronous Circuits Design Flow Using Backward Delay Propagation Constraint</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10579860</link><description>In recent years, asynchronous circuits have gained attention in neural network chips and Internet of Things (IoT) due to their potential advantages of low power and high performance. However, design efficiency of asynchronous circuits remains low and faces challenges in large-scale applications because of the lack of electronic design automation (EDA) support. This article presents a new bundled-data (BD) asynchronous circuits&#8217; design flow using traditional EDA tools, including a new backward delay propagation constraint (BDPC) method. In this method, control paths and data paths are analyzed together in a tightly coupled approach to improve the accuracy of static timing analysis (STA). Compared with other design flows, the proposed design flow and constraint method show significant advantages in aspects of STA accuracy, design efficiency, and design applicability, and solving the congestion issues of field-programmable gate array (FPGA) in a previous work. An asynchronous RISC-V processor was implemented to verify the method, with selective handshake technology to further reduce power. Compared with the synchronous processor, the asynchronous processor achieves a 17.4% power optimization on the TSMC 65-nm process and a 48.3% dynamic power savings on the FPGA while maintaining the same frequency and resource utilization.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Two-Stage Pipelined Compute-in-Memory Macro for Accelerating Transformer Feed-Forward Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10614387</link><description>Transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various applications. However, deploying transformer models on resource-constrained platforms is still challenging due to its dynamic workloads, intensive computations, and substantial memory access. In this article, we propose a two-stage pipelined compute-in-memory (CIM) macro for effectively deploying and accelerating the feed-forward network (FFN) layers of transformer models. Two independent CIM arrays are designed to execute the two distinct linear projections in FFN layers, which are interconnected by co-designed analog rectified linear unit (ReLU) circuits to realize the nonlinear activation function. The analog multiply-and-add (MAC) results from the first CIM array are streamed directly to the analog ReLU circuits, and subsequently to the next CIM array for performing another linear projection. This architecture eliminates the need for analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs) for internal results&#8217; staging, thereby enhancing overall macro efficiency and reducing computing latency. A proof-of-concept macro is fabricated using TSMC 65-nm process and achieves 4.096 TOPS peak throughput, 4.39 TOPS/mm2 area efficiency, and 49.83 TOPS/W energy efficiency. To map transformer models onto the proposed macro, we quantize the FFN layers of BERTMINI model under per-token granularity for activations and per-tensor granularity for weights using quantization-aware training (QAT), which exhibits excellent accuracy across multiple benchmarks.</description></item><item><title>Area Efficient 0.009-mm2&#160;28.1-ppm/&#176;C 11.3-MHz ALL-MOS Relaxation Oscillator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10576630</link><description>This article presents an ultrasmall area on-chip relaxation oscillator with low-temperature sensitivity. In this design, a virtual resistor mainly composed of a complementary to absolute temperature (CTAT) voltage reference circuit is implemented to replace the real resistor for efficient temperature compensation, which counterbalances the inherent proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT) property of the original relaxation circuit of the oscillator. The conventional capacitor is also replaced with a MOS capacitor to complete the ALL-MOS oscillator circuit with two prime advantages, one of which is larger capacitance to area density, and the other is better matching with critical MOSFETs. Implemented in a 0.18- $\mu $ m TSMC standard CMOS process, the proposed relaxation oscillator has achieved a temperature coefficient of 28.17 ppm/&#176;C over the temperature range from  $- 25~^{\circ }$ C to  $+ 125~^{\circ }$ C at 11.39-MHz oscillation frequency. This circuit consumes  $243.1~\mu $ W under 1.3-V power supply. Along with the abovementioned excellent performance, the oscillator achieves an ultrasmall core chip area of 0.009 mm2, which is almost one order less than most of the prior arts&#8217; in the same process.</description></item><item><title>Protecting Parallel Data Encryption in Multi-Tenant FPGAs by Exploring Simple but Effective Clocking Methodologies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10579855</link><description>Capitalizing on their versatility and high-performance attributes within heterogeneous designs, increasingly number of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are integrated into cloud data centers by cloud service providers (CSPs). While CSPs intend to reduce the cost by sharing one board among multiple users (called multi-tenant FPGA), hardware security problems such as side-channel attacks restrict it from spreading commercially. Existing research works have underscored the feasibility of remote side-channel attacks targeting a singular advanced encryption standard (AES) module on multi-tenant FPGAs, but they have not looked into the scenario of parallel data encryption on multiple AES modules for a single tenant, which is possible due to the small resource consumption of one AES module. In this work, we scrutinize correlation power analysis (CPA)-based side-channel attacks on parallel data encryption modules and develop two simple yet effective protective methods based on clocking methodologies&#8212;clocking phase shift and small frequency shift. The former technique adopts an identical clock frequency but with distinctive clocking phase to parallel encryption modules while the latter implements slightly different clock frequencies for parallel encryption modules. Experimental results show that both the methods can effectively increase the minimum required power traces for successful CPA, thus instituting a natural protective barrier for parallel data encryption.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Cost Quadruple-Node-Upsets Resilient Latch Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10614215</link><description>In this article, a low-cost quadruple-node-upsets resilient latch (LCQRL) design is proposed. To meet the high-reliability demands of safety-critical applications, the latch integrates nine soft-error-interceptive modules (SIMs) to form robust feedback loops, ensuring complete resilience to quadruple-node upsets (QNUs). Each Sim comprises ten CMOS transistors and a clocked inverter. Notably, C-element (CE) and dual interlocked storage cell (DICE) modules are not employed in this circuit, resulting in a small area and low power consumption. The simulation results verify the complete QNU self-recoverability and cost-effectiveness of this design. Compared with the existing radiation-hardened QNU resilient latches, the LCQRL latch demonstrates significant improvements in area, power consumption, and area-power&#8211;delay product (APDP) by 47.8%, 63%, and 75.5%, respectively. Furthermore, it exhibits low sensitivity to process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Neural Fields Accelerator Design for a Millimeter-Scale Tracking System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10579788</link><description>This brief introduces a compact-size hardware accelerator for dynamic neural fields (DNF) used in object tracking.

The proposed structure employs a new high-gain stage as a feedback network between the input node of each cell and the common node of the circuit to reduce the sensitivity of the output current to the loser signals, especially when they are close to the winner. In addition, another network is employed that senses the amount of the output/winner current and adjusts the bias current of the gain stages. This ensures that the drain-source voltage of the input transistor in the winner cell matches the behavior of the output transistor&#8217;s drain-source voltage, enhancing the accuracy as well as the input dynamic range (DR) of the structure. Moreover, since the circuit works properly with a minimum supply voltage of only  $V_{\text {GS}} + V_{\text {eff}}$ , it is a promising candidate for applications in emerging technologies with low supply voltage requirements. Based on the proposed structure, a three-input WTA circuit is designed and fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu $  m CMOS technology. According to the measurement results, the proposed circuit exhibits a maximum error of 1.5% for the input signal range of  $60~\mu $  A when the input frequency is 100 kHz. The silicon area occupied by the circuit is  $33~\mu $  m  $\times 65~\mu $  m.</description></item><item><title>Securing Against Side-Channel Attacks With Wide-Range In Situ Random Voltage Dithering on Async-Logic AES Engine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10555024</link><description>We present a wide-range in situ random voltage dithering (WIS-RVD) on async-logic advanced encryption standard (AES) engine to counteract side-channel attacks (SCAs). There are three contributions in this brief. First, we propose the WIS-RVD based on a dual-rail asynchronous-logic (async-logic) AES engine, leveraging on the self-timed clockless operations for robust encryption under dynamic voltage and timing variations. Second, we propose an in situ voltage dithering to dither the supply voltage instantaneously during the encryption, without the requirement of additional control circuits for clock modulation, to increase the SCA resistance. Third, we propose a wide-range voltage swing technique that spans from 0.3 V (subthreshold) to 1.1 V (above threshold), obfuscating the transistor&#8217;s current models between subthreshold and threshold voltage to further enhance SCA resistance. We perform comprehensive SCA evaluations with 50-M power and EM measurements, and the SCA evaluations show that our proposed WIS-RVD on async-logic AES accelerator can resist SCAs with 50-M measurements, i.e.,  $\gt 2083\times $  and  $\gt 2778\times $  improvement for power and EM SCAs, respectively, when compared to the standard synchronous-logic AES.</description></item><item><title>A Hardware and Software Co-Design for Energy-Efficient Neural Network Accelerator With Multiplication-Less Folded-Accumulative PE for Radar-Based Hand Gesture Recognition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10559442</link><description>This work presents a novel lightweight neural network (NN) model and a dedicated NN accelerator for radar-based hand gesture recognition (HGR).

The proposed topology is bases on a modified dual-path (DP) hybrid power stage structure and elevates the inductor de-energizing voltage to enhance  $I_{L,\mathrm {DC}}$  reduction. With a dual-branch interleaved cross-coupled structure, it reduces the required number of SC cells, thereby lowering costs. Moreover, the converter attains a seamless switching-phase transition around VCR of 0.5, ensuring smooth operations and simplifying control complexity. A stable efficiency is maintained across the entire VCR range by balancing inductor DC resistance (DCR) loss and switch/path conduction loss.

ER4 can convert the energy that would otherwise be wasted in conventional regulating rectifiers to generate an additional regulated output voltage. The ER4 system regulates and provides two different output voltages without the need for low dropout regulators thanks to the proposed dual-output comparator. This comparator can efficiently generate two gate control signals for regulating dual-output voltages, maximizing power conversion efficiency (PCE). In addition, the dual-output comparator adopts a pulsewidth memorizer (PWMem), a current replica, and a current bleeding technique to prevent incident high-surge back current. The 0.77-mm $^{2}~0.18$ - $\mu $ m CMOS ER4, which was also equipped with back/forward data telemetry functions, verified that the secondary regulation voltage can be generated in a wide range from 1 to 4.5 V while maintaining the first regulation voltage at 4.5 V at the carrier frequency of 6.78 MHz. The peak PCE of 92.74% was achieved with the output power of 107.5 mW.

The limited maximum stable amplitude (MSA) problem due to the high-order-shaped large quantization error ( $E {_{\mathrm{ 1}}}$ ) in the previous single-loop DNC DSM is alleviated by adopting an M-0 MASH architecture, where  $E {_{\mathrm{ 1}}}$  is low-order shaped within the first stage. With a zeroth-order second stage and digital cancellation filter, only the second-stage quantization error ( $E {_{\mathrm{ 2}}}$ ) is present in the final output, where it is shaped aggressively by the conjunction of the first-stage noise-transfer function (NTF) and DNC. Fabricated in 28-nm CMOS, the prototype demonstrates that a high-order CT DSM can be realized with low-order analog loop filters through the combination of MASH and DNC architecture, achieving peak values of signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and dynamic range (DR) of 97.4, 98.4, and 100.2 dB, respectively, in a 25-kHz bandwidth while consuming only 260 $~\mu \text{W}$  from a 1.1-V supply.

However, challenges still lie in large memory cells, network mapping, and IR-drop variation to realize efficient CIM implementation. In this work, a 28-nm 36 Kb static random-access memory (SRAM) CIM engine with nondestructive-read (NDR) cell and weight update energy saving is used for multiply-accumulate (MAC) acceleration in artificial intelligence (AI) inference and train applications. A 4T1T SRAM bit-cell is proposed with NDR and records the smallest cell size of  $0.173~\mu $ m2. The power-ON self-load-0 feature of the 4T1T cell saves the weight update energy and latency for writing 0. The shared-path dual-mode read (SPDMR) brings fewer circuit overheads to support both FF and BP paths. The bit-interleaving weight mapping (BIWM) speeds up the BP path without slowing FF. IR-drop-aware adaptive clampers (IRDAA-Cs) with hierarchical read word-lines (RWLs) and read bit-lines (RBLs) apply possibly accurate voltages on near/far cells. The engine achieves an EE of 263.1/412.1 TOPS/W, as well as an area efficiency (AE) of 2.5/4.9 TOPS/mm2 for FF/BP process @1-bit weight/activation with 74.4%&#8211;78.3% reduction in weight update energy.</description></item><item><title>Cryo-CMOS Dual-Qubit Homodyne Reflectometer Array With Degenerate Parametric Amplification</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10614653</link><description>In quantum computers, the quantum state discrimination of the physical quantum bits (Qubits) occupies ~80% of the quantum error correction (QEC) cycle. The RF reflectometry or dispersive readout determines the Qubit state by monitoring the RF reflection of the attached high-Q resonant tank. Compared to their dc counterparts, the RF reflectometers enjoy a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), low drifting, and fast speed. As a result, a high-fidelity, single-shot, scalable reflectometer array based on cryogenic CMOS (Cryo-CMOS) ICs is in demand for the future large-scale Qubit array ( $10^{3} {\sim } 10^{6}$  Qubits). However, the classic Cryo-CMOS heterodyne reflectometers, consisting of MOSFET-based LNA, mixer, and baseband blocks, suffer from high noise temperature and dc power. To address these issues, the Cryo-CMOS parametric circuitry based on varactors is explored. In this article, a dual-Qubit homodyne reflectometer array with 2 RX channels and 1 TX channel is demonstrated. In the RX, the degenerate parametric amplifier (DPA) enjoys a Q-enhanced,  $\lambda _{\mathrm { RF}}/2$  differential-mode (DM) resonator for the high-gain parametric amplification. The common mode (CM) RF input of DPA interacts with the DM resonator by a nonreciprocal, dynamic mode coupling (DMC). It eliminates the necessity of a circulator and the potential oscillation of DPA. The scalability challenge of the DPA&#8217;s noise temperature  $T_{\mathrm { noise}}$  versus the environment temperature  $T_{\mathrm { env}}$  is also investigated. In the TX, a current-mode logic (CML) divider with interstate locking and a vector modulator (VM) is implemented to achieve fast modulation for the spur and noise rejection. Measured at 4.2 K, the implemented 65 nm Cryo-CMOS chip presents a  $4.5{\sim }7$  GHz bandwidth, 52 dB peak RF gain, and 78 K noise temperature, and generates a 10 MHz TX pulse train with -22 dBm RF power and 30 dB tunability.

However, the high cost of computation and memory footprint make its inference inefficient. Although digital compute-in-memory (CIM) is a promising hardware architecture with high accuracy, Transformer&#8217;s attention mechanism raises three challenges in the access and computation of CIM: 1) the attention computation involving Query and Key results in massive data movement and under-utilization in CIM macros; 2) the attention computation involving Possibility and Value exhibits plenty of dynamic bit-level sparsity, resulting in redundant bit-serial CIM operations; and 3) the restricted data reload bandwidth in CIM macros results in a significant decrease in performance for large Transformer models. To address these challenges, we design a CIM accelerator called CIM Transformer (CIMFormer) with three corresponding features. First, the token-pruning-aware attention reformulation (TPAR) is a technique that adjusts attention computations according to the token-pruning ratio. This reformulation reduces the real-time access to and under-utilization of CIM macros. Second, the principal possibility gather-scatter scheduler (PPGSS) gathers the possibilities with greater effective bit-width as concurrent inputs to CIM macros, enhancing the efficiency of bit-serial CIM operations. Third, the systolic X $\mid $ W-CIM macro array efficiently handles the execution of large Transformer models that exceed the storage capacity of the on-chip CIM macros.

Emphasizing three key features, the LOG-CIM significantly achieves high energy efficiency and memory density using LOGQ: 1) exponential parallel data mapping (EPDM) not only facilitates efficient shifted alignment and data accumulation, optimizing the processing pipeline for LOGQ complex computations but also achieves a 51.5% improvement in energy efficiency as a result; 2) the implementation of a zero-aware dual-word-line (ZADU) cell, which not only enhances parallelism but also reduces computation power by lowering read power 88.9% for 89.3% bit sparsity; and 3) shift-addition peripheral (SAP) logic, which maximizes throughput by performing the addition of different bit positions from two data read by the ZADU cell before they enter the adder tree, thereby enhancing 24.3% energy efficiency. The LOG-CIM is fabricated in 28-nm CMOS technology and occupies a 5.832 mm2 with a total of 48-kB on-chip CIMs. It achieves 192 TOPS/W using conventional data mapping at 4-b INT weight and 4-b input activation and 116.4 TOPS/W using EPDM at 4-b LOGQ weight and 8-b INT input activation at 120-MHz clock and 0.85-V supply voltage with the ResNet-50 @ ImageNet dataset. When using the 4-b LOGQ weight for inference, the energy efficiency was 3.54 times higher than the 8-b INT weight with similar accuracy. During training, using 4-b LOGQ weight to reach the same accuracy increases epoch compared with using only 8-b INT weight, but consequentially saves 68.7% in relative total energy.

However, its remarkable performance comes at the cost of substantial computational complexity, posing limitations on deploying transformers from cloud to edge due to power and throughput constraints. There are two main challenges in designing a transformer accelerator for practical tasks. First, a transformer has inconsistent bottlenecks due to input length changes: for short inputs, such as using vision transformer (ViT) for ImageNet or bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) for general language understanding evaluation (GLUE), the linear layer of the model becomes the computational bottleneck. In contrast, for long inputs, such as high-resolution images or long-text tasks, attention computation becomes the bottleneck. Second, even for a given input length, different layers in the model exhibit various computational characteristics and workloads, such as matrix sizes and data reuse strategies. This article introduces Ayaka, a versatile transformer accelerator designed to address these issues. Ayaka uses a cross-layer sparse prediction approach based on random projection (RP), enabling simultaneous sparsification of attention computation and linear layers, thereby enhancing throughput for various bottlenecks for different input lengths. Furthermore, Ayaka optimizes the sparse attention computation by leveraging the input translation invariance of softmax. In addition, Ayaka features a heterogeneous dataflow processing element (HDPE) design, dynamically adjusting stationary matrix operands based on the current computation to maximize on-chip data reuse and reduce memory footprint. With these features, Ayaka is so far the first accelerator that accelerates the whole attention layer. Evaluation of 12 typical models and tasks shows that it achieves a peak energy efficiency of 49.7 TOPS/W, which is 1.20&#8211; $258.9{\times }$  higher than the state-of-the-art works.</description></item><item><title>A 73.8k-Inference/mJ SVM Learning Accelerator for Brain Pattern Recognition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10559984</link><description>Machine learning (ML) has been widely adopted in neural signal processing and support vector machine (SVM) stands out for its efficacy given limited training data.

Kernel transformation reduces the processing element (PE) array&#8217;s hardware complexity by 42%. Sparsity-aware skipping eliminates redundant computations, leading to latency reduction. The design space of the PE array is explored to minimize the hardware cost. Data scheduling is applied to improve the PE utilization. Overall, the processing latency for the PE array is reduced by 96%. For PE array implementation, the area of the data exchanger is reduced by 93% by utilizing the chained interconnect. By integrating multiple sorters into one cross-cluster sorter, the sorter area is reduced by 52%.

Built upon existing phased arrays, this scheme integrates an auxiliary-path vector modulator (VM) into each antenna element, which in turn, forms an interference-canceling beam. By spatially combining the array factors (AFs) of the main beam and the interference-canceling beam, a deep spatial notch is created while ensuring minimal main-beam power degradation. Unlike the conventional zero-forcing method that requires matrix inversion in digital for spatial notch creation, our scheme enables the computation of antenna weights in analog, significantly reducing the computational cost and latency. Leveraging this new notch steering scheme, we develop a 28-GHz four-element fully connected (FC) hybrid beamforming TX array using the GlobalFoundries 45-nm CMOS Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) process. It is capable of simultaneously transmitting two independent, wideband data streams (DSs) in the same polarization toward two directions. In probing-based measurements, each TX channel delivers 19.7-dBm OP1 dB, 20.4-dBm  ${P} {_{\text {SAT}}}$ , and 30.6% peak power-added efficiency (PAE) at 29 GHz, demonstrating state-of-the-art TX linearity and efficiency. In over-the-air (OTA) measurements, the packaged TX array achieves 29.8-dBm EIRP1 dB and is able to steer a spatial notch outside the &#8722;10-dB beamwidth of the main beam, with a notch depth of &gt;35 dB and a main-beam power degradation of &lt; 0.8 dB. Moreover, in spatial multiplexing demonstrations, the TX array is capable of transmitting a 400-MHz 64-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signal to the intended receiver (RX) in the first DS, while suppressing the co-channel continuous-wave or wideband modulated interference created by the second DS with a high SINR.</description></item><item><title>A Compact Millimeter-Wave Reconfigurable Dual-Band LNA With Image-Rejection in 28-nm Bulk CMOS for 5G Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10536110</link><description>This article presents a reconfigurable dual-band low noise amplifier (LNA) for 5G millimeter-wave (mmWave) applications in the TSMC 28-nm bulk CMOS process. The reconfigurable LNA is based on a two-stage amplifier design with switchable triple-coupled transformer and capacitor technologies applied to the inter-stage and output matching networks. The switchable triple-coupled transformer can change the self-inductance of the transformer coils by tuning the magnetic flux entering the coils. To suppress the image frequency interference, magnetic&#8211;electric hybrid coupling is integrated into the inter-stage matching network, which introduces a transmission zero, resulting in a high image rejection ratio. The measured result shows that the low band has a peak gain of 18.1 dB with a 3-dB bandwidth of 23.8&#8211;33.5 GHz, and the high band has a peak gain of 18.9 dB with a 3-dB bandwidth of 34.4&#8211;41.4 GHz. The image rejection ratio is better than 32.7 dBc with an intermediate frequency of 8 GHz. The measured NF is better than 3.5 dB at both bands. The IP1dB is -19 to -15.1/-18.5 to -15.2 dBm in the low/high band. The fabricated LNA has a very compact core size of 0.09 mm2, and the total power consumption is only 14 mW.</description></item><item><title>Design and Analysis of a Fractional Frequency Synthesizer With &lt;90-fs Jitter and &lt;&#8211;103-dBc Spurious Tones Using Digital Spur Cancellation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10531278</link><description>In this article, we describe an advanced multi-output fractional frequency synthesizer (FFS) featuring an innovative digital spur cancellation technique.

To address the issues of increased power consumption and susceptibility to noise due to reduced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the use of data bus inversion (DBI) is implemented and investigated. By adopting the DBI technique in PAM-4 signaling, the driver power and supply fluctuations can be mitigated while preserving the pin overhead of one for the PAM-4-modulated DBI flag. On every single channel of the TX, the addition of a capacitive-coupled feed-forward equalizer (CC-FFE) is utilized to alleviate inter-symbol interference (ISI) effects. In addition, a reference impedance (ZQ) calibration method enabling the precise adjustment of ZQ values using variation-mitigated on-chip resistors is proposed. By utilizing the proposed ZQ calibration method, the driver&#8217;s output impedance can be precisely adjusted under practical operating conditions while maintaining the off-chip cost for one reference resistor. The single-channel TX operates at data rates of up to 38 Gb/s while consuming 26.16 mW of power, which corresponds to a calculated energy efficiency of 0.688 pJ/bit. A 16.3% power dissipation reduction was measured in the drivers as a result of the PAM-4 DBI.</description></item><item><title>A Fully Integrated Nine-Ratio Switched-Capacitor Converter With Overlapped-Conversion-Ratio Modulation for IoT Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10549516</link><description>This article presents a fully integrated step-down switched-capacitor (SC) converter with nine voltage conversion ratios (VCRs) that regulates an output load voltage ( $V_{\text {OUT}}$ ) of 0.1&#8211;3.67 V with an input voltage of 2.5&#8211;5 V.

Concretely, the wideband spectrometer performs NMR spectroscopy with nuclear spins from 1H, 19F, and 2H with a spectral resolution down to 0.07 ppm to determine structures of molecules containing these nuclear spins; it can also perform NMR with the nuclear overhauser effect (NOE), which is an important modality that further enhances the capability for molecular fingerprinting (we demonstrate the NOE by reading the 19F NMR signal that is enhanced via heteronuclear magnetization transfer from 1H spins). The wideband operation of the CMOS RF transceiver IC is made possible by integrating a delay-locked loop (DLL) with a broad locking range. The RF receiver (RX) part of the IC achieves an input-referred noise less than 1.2 nV/ $\surd $  Hz across the entire bandwidth of 1&#8211;100 MHz, while the RF transmitter (TX) part employs a digital power amplifier.</description></item><item><title>A 1.01-V 8.5-Gb/s/pin 16-Gb LPDDR5x SDRAM With Advanced I/O Circuitry for High-Speed and Low-Power Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10529258</link><description>For low-power 8.5-Gbps operation, 4th-generation 10-nm 16-Gb LPDDR5x DRAM I/O circuits and control methods are proposed in this article.

Power consumption optimisation could be improved by a comprehensive analytical modeling of the characteristics of critical blocks in a system. Dynamic range (DR) has a strong effect on the power consumption of analog circuits, and is determined by circuit non-linearity and noise level.

The NCGFB design technique enables to cancel parasitic capacitances of cables and electrodes at the IA input in order to boost the input impedance. The negative capacitance is generated through feedback loops containing digitally programmable capacitor banks that can compensate for an extra input capacitance of up to 100 pF. A chopping technique is also introduced to enhance the noise performance of NCGFB IAs with input impedance boosting. The proposed amplifier is based on the capacitively-coupled IA (CCIA) architecture with additional circuit-level innovations to increase input impedance and improve noise performance. Two NCGFB loops have been added to further boost the input impedance. These NCGFB loops include a low-pass filter (LPF) to suppress ripples from the chopping prior to feeding the signal back to nodes at which capacitances are cancelled. We present an analysis to verify the stability of the loops as well as their effects on boosting the input impedance. The full symmetry of the NCGFB loops enables the use of identical capacitor banks to maintain a high common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR).

FHSs are attached to the magnetic recording heads in modern hard disk drives (HDDs) to monitor the head-disk distance known as &#8220;fly height&#8221; by measuring the FHS resistance variation. The magnitude of the sensor signal serves as a measure of the proximity between the head and the disk surface which must accurately be controlled to minimize the fly height, thereby increasing the storage capacity of HDDs. The proposed interface includes two parts: 1) a dual-mode precise bias circuit that accurately provides a differential bias with a programmable common-mode voltage to the FHS in both voltage (V) and current (I) modes without requiring any calibrations, as well as featuring fast and smooth transient response, 2) front-end gain stages that create two separate signal paths with low- and high-frequency responses, called LF and HF blocks, utilized for controlling the fly height and mapping the roughness of the disk surface, respectively. The proposed bias circuit demonstrates high-impedance loading behavior on the sensor terminals in both V- and I- modes to have a unity signal gain at the sensor port and deliver it to the front-end amplifiers, resulting in an improvement of the overall noise performance of the interface. In addition, the bias noise power at the output of the LF block is suppressed to the extent of one order of magnitude thanks to deploying a noise cancellation technique. A low-noise and wide-bandwidth front-end is implemented for the HF block that eliminates the need for configuring the bias loop for having a low cutoff frequency, resulting in a reliable design with reduced complexity. Additionally, degenerated differential pairs with resistive loads, split tail currents, and Caprio&#8217;s quad offering low gain variation over the temperature and process are implemented as the front-end gain stages.

Different from the traditional TCR-based PA designs that focus solely on broadband load-pull matching or TCR transimpedance, the intrinsic design knowledge of the proposed method utilizes the mechanism of joint-design between PA active circuits and TCR networks. By combining this knowledge with an optimization-oriented genetic algorithm (GA), an initial TCR solution that achieves low-ripple and broadband PA output response can be rapidly synthesized, in the sense that the superior initial population, not as random as that in traditional GA, can improve the GA convergence and reduce the algorithm iterations. Simulated results show that this work achieves about 4 times speed improvement in TCR synthesis than the traditional GA. The proposed method can efficiently synthesize the optimal TCR parameters for multi-stage PA to obtain the user-defined output power within a target bandwidth. As a proof of this work, a cascode-based PA for FMCW radar application is designed in 110-nm CMOS process, aiming to realize a peak 14-dBm output power and 50% 1-dB fractional bandwidth (FBW).

Conventionally, improving the SAR ADC speed compromises the signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) and energy efficiency due to the high precision requirement and the sequential bit-cycling. In this design, the proposed SCS scheme reduces the parasitic capacitance in the sampling path and the settling error of the capacitive digital-to-analog converter (CDAC) with low SNDR and hardware penalties. In addition, to reduce reference ripples, active reference buffers generally consume high power while the passive methods may degrade the SNDR or occupy large areas. To efficiently reduce reference settling errors, an area-efficient SPRS is developed, which suppresses the reference settling error through the split reference segmentation. The prototype chip is fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS process and occupies an area of 0.57 mm2. Measurements show the ADC achieves a peak SNDR of 89.2 dB at 8 MS/s with a 9.5-mW power consumption. The Schreier-figure-of-merit (FoM) is 175.4 dB.</description></item><item><title>A Time-to-Voltage Converter-Based MPPT With 440 &#956;s Online Tracking Time, 99.7% Tracking Efficiency for a Battery-Less Harvesting Front-End With Cold-Startup and Over-Voltage Protection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10621014</link><description>This paper introduces a time-to-voltage converter-based maximum power point tracking (TVCB-MPPT) for harvesting photovoltaic energy into a super-capacitor using a single solar cell.

Instead, a frequency doubler can be used to derive a reference signal with twice the frequency of the crystal oscillator, but conventional PLLs are highly sensitive to the crystal oscillator&#8217;s duty cycle error in such cases. Prior solutions to this problem involve calibration techniques which impose convergence speed versus accuracy tradeoffs. In contrast, this paper proposes a system modification which makes a PLL immune to such duty cycle errors without the need for calibration. The technique is presented and analyzed in the context of a delta-sigma frequency-to-digital converter ( $\Delta \Sigma $ -FDC) based PLL. Analysis and behavioral simulations with nonideal circuit parameters show that the worst-case convergence time is at least 10 times faster than that of the prior techniques. Additionally, the proposed  $\Delta \Sigma $ -FDC includes other modifications which improve its performance relative to comparable prior  $\Delta \Sigma $ -FDCs.</description></item><item><title>A 28-/60-GHz Dual-Band Receiver Front-End With Sideband-Selection Technique in 65-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10620212</link><description>This article presents a dual-band receiver front-end based on a reconfigurable Hartley architecture with double frequency conversion for millimeter-wave wireless communication. By controlling working states of band-select switches, the receiver is able to reach different RF bands without increasing or altering local-oscillator (LO) and intermediate-frequency bands. To reduce power consumption and save chip area, RF quadrature mixers are co-designed with the last stage of a dual-band low-noise amplifier and reuse its dc current. In addition, a self-mixing frequency tripler with a transformer-based compact hybrid is developed to multiply an input LO and provide quadrature LO signals for the RF mixers. The prototype receiver is demonstrated in a 65 nm CMOS process. Measurement results show that the receiver successfully covers two frequency bands of 24.6~28 GHz and 55.6~60 GHz, and the corresponding peak conversion gains are up to 24.5 dB and 26.3 dB, respectively. In these two bands, the minimum single-sideband noise figures are 7.5 and 7.8 dB. The tested image-rejection ratio of the dual-band receiver is better than 30 dB in both 26.5~30.0 GHz and 57.5~60.5 GHz bands. Besides, the receiver also demonstrates its capability of supporting up to 256QAM modulation and 3.2-Gb/s data-rate transmission.</description></item><item><title>A Balanced CMOS Compatible Ternary Memristor-NMOS Logic Family and Its Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638758</link><description>Balanced ternary digital logic circuits based on memristors and MOSFET devices are introduced. First, balanced ternary minimum gate TMIN, maximum gate TMAX and ternary inverters are designed and verified by simulation. Next, logic circuits such as ternary encoders, decoders and multiplexers are designed using these three basic gates. For further validation, a ternary 3&#8211;1 encoder was hardware-implemented successfully using in-house fabricated memristors and MOS transistors. Two different design approaches, namely the decoder-based method and the multiplexer-based method are introduced and applied to realize combinational logic circuits such as balanced ternary half-adder, multiplier, and numerical comparator. We simulate the circuits using 50nm CMOS technology parameters and BSIM models and present comparisons and analyses of the two design methods in view of the power consumption and component device counts, which can guide subsequent research and development of integrated multi-valued logic circuits. The decoder-based method has advantages both in terms of component numbers and power consumption, but the multiplexer-based method has the advantages of being based on a simple operating principle and ease of implementation.</description></item><item><title>Hardware-Efficient SoftMax Architecture With Bit-Wise Exponentiation and Reciprocal Calculation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10640134</link><description>The SoftMax function is one of the activation functions used in deep neural networks (DNN) to normalize input values to the range of (0,1). With the advent of DNN models including the Transformer, operations utilizing SoftMax have gained significant attention, and the efficient hardware implementation of such operations has become a prominent issue in hardware realization. Implementing SoftMax often involves exponential and division operations, which can be a significant bottleneck in terms of hardware cost and performance. Various efforts have been made to address this challenge, and this paper introduces a novel approach to efficiently implement SoftMax. In most previous works, the maximum input value is subtracted from all the input values to ensure numerical stability. In the proposed approach, the maximum value is replaced with a different value to reduce the hardware complexity with ensuring numerical stability. Additionally, in exponential operations, simple Look-Up Tables (LUTs) with only one entry each are used for bit-wise calculations, and the reciprocal of the total exponential sum is computed to replace division with multiplication. Applying the proposed methods reduces the computational complexity significantly compared to the previous log-sum-exp approach. As a result, the proposed 8-bit SoftMax accelerator achieves a high operating frequency of 3.12GHz and a high throughput of 25G inputs/s. It also improves area efficiency and power consumption by at least 2 times. From an accuracy perspective, furthermore, it is associated with similar or even better accuracy compared to previous works.</description></item><item><title>Process-Variation-Aware In-Memory Computation With Improved Linearity Using On-Chip Configurable Current-Steering Thermometric DAC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10621041</link><description>The in-memory computation (IMC) is a potential technique to improve the speed and energy efficiency of data-intensive designs. However, the scalability of IMC to large systems is hindered by the non-linearities of analog multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations and process variation, which impacts the precision of high bit-width MAC operations. In this paper, we present an IMC architecture that is capable of performing multi-bit MAC operations with improved speed, linearity, and computational accuracy. To improve the speed/linearity of the IMC-MAC operations, the image and weight data are applied by using the pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and thermometric techniques, respectively. Although the PAM technique improves the speed of the IMC-MAC operations, it has linearity issues that need to be addressed. Based on the detailed linearity analysis of the IMC-MAC circuit, we proposed two approaches to improve the linearity and the signal margin (SM) of the IMC architecture. The proposed configurable current steering thermometric digital-to-analog converter (CST-DAC) array is employed to provide the PAM signals with various dynamic ranges and non-linear gaps that are required to improve the linearity/SM. The proposed combined PAM and thermometric IMC (PT-IMC) architecture is designed and fabricated in the TSMC 180-nm CMOS process. The post-silicon calibration of the design point mitigates the process-variation issues and provides the maximum SM (close to the simulation results). Furthermore, the proposed PT-IMC architecture performs MNIST/CIFAR-10 data set classification with an accuracy of 98%/88%. In addition, the PT-IMC architecture achieves a peak throughput of 12.41 GOPS, a normalized energy efficiency of 30.64 TOPS/W, a normalized figure-of-merit (FOM) of 3039, a loss in the SM of 8.3% with respect to the ideal SM, and a computational error of 0.41%.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Scaled E-Tree-Based SRAM Design and Optimization With Interconnect Focus</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638740</link><description>SRAM performance is highly dominated by interconnects as technology scales down because of the significant parasitic resistance and capacitance in the interconnect.

Accordingly, a coarse-grained reconfigurable array (CGRA) is considered the most effective architecture for achieving high speed, low power, and high flexibility for implementing LWC algorithms. However, existing CGRA designs for cryptography focus only on improvements to outdated 8/32-bit algorithms, suffer from large area requirements, and have long compilation times. To address these issues, this paper proposes a new CGRA-based accelerator named LiCryptor to support various 8/32/64-bit LWC algorithms with high speed and small area. Three innovative ideas are proposed to enable LiCryptor to achieve these goals: a compact multi-grained processing element array (M-PEA), a shared 8/32/64-bit arithmetic logic unit (ALU), and an assembly-like inline directive (AID) mapping method. The LiCryptor has been successfully implemented and verified on the Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA. Real-time performance evaluation across various LWC algorithms on FPGA shows that LiCryptor is 1.33 to 4 times better in execution time and 3.4 to 153 times better in power-delay products (PDP) compared to today&#8217;s most powerful CPUs. Notably, evaluation of AID mapping on the ARM Cortex-A53 CPU of the ZCU102 FPGA shows that its compilation time is less than 1.5 ms for most LWC algorithms, at least 2,333 times faster than CFG mapping in current CGRAs. Moreover, experimental results on 45nm ASIC technology show that the LiCryptor significantly outperforms existing CGRAs and other reconfigurable designs in terms of throughput and area efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Balanced Sparse Matrix Convolution Accelerator for Efficient CNN Training</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10612221</link><description>Sparse Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) training is well known to be time-consuming due to significant off-chip memory traffic. To effectively deploy sparse training, existing accelerators store matrices in a compressed format to eliminate memory accesses for zeros; hence, accelerators are designed to process compressed matrices to avoid zero computations. We have observed that the compression rate is greatly affected by the sparsity in the matrices with different formats. Given the varying levels of sparsity in activations, weights, errors, and gradients matrices throughout the sparse training process, it becomes impractical to achieve consistently high compression rates using a singular compression method for the entire duration of the training. Moreover, random zeros in the matrices result in irregular computation patterns, further increasing execution time. To address these issues, we propose a balanced sparse matrix convolution accelerator design for efficient CNN training. Specifically, a dual matrix compression technique is developed that seamlessly combines two widely used sparse matrix compression formats with a control algorithm for lower memory traffic during training. Based on this compression technique, a two-level workload balancing technique is then designed to further reduce the execution time and energy consumption. Finally, an accelerator is implemented to support the proposed techniques. The cycle-accurate simulation results show that the proposed accelerator reduces the execution time by 34% and the energy consumption by 24% on average compared to existing sparse training accelerators.</description></item><item><title>Layer-Wise Mixed-Modes CNN Processing Architecture With Double-Stationary Dataflow and Dimension-Reshape Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10620270</link><description>With the development of convolutional neural networks (CNN) across various domains, the growth in network structure complexity and computational load has increasingly become a research focus in the deployment of neural networks. The key to current research on neural network accelerators lies in striking a balance between computational accuracy and energy efficiency. This paper proposes a software-hardware co-design to strike the balance for CNN edge applications. On the hardware side, a 3-dimensional tensor engine (3D-TE), achieved with reconfigurable Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), is introduced for efficient convolution computation. We optimize the CNN dataflow on 3D-TE using a dimension reshaping method for feature maps rearrangement, and a double stationary dataflow scheduling to reduce memory access. This paper adopts a configurable approximate multiplier design based on Boolean Matrix Factorization (BMF) based logic synthesis applied in the architecture of TPU. The proposed 3D-TE, characterized by its configurable precision, enables the TPUs to dynamically adapt the bitwidth of features and weights in response to varying precision requirements. On the software side, a hessian-guided layer precision mapping is adopted to reduce unnecessary computational overhead, and a progressive re-training approach is proposed to enable a better approximation configuration and higher power reduction. Fabricated on 28-nm CMOS, this work achieves an optimized energy efficiency of 14.9 TOPS/W and 12.1 TOPS/W for ResNet56 and MobileNetV2 respectively, with 0.6V supply voltage and 150MHz clock frequency, representing an improvement of  $1.33\times \sim 8.28\times $  over the state-of-the-art works.</description></item><item><title>Constant Power-Constant Voltage Battery Charging Based on a Loss-Free Resistor Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638741</link><description>A constant power (CP)-constant voltage (CV) protocol for battery charging is implemented in a conventional boost converter with output filter (BOF) by imposing loss-free resistor (LFR) behavior during the CP phase. To compare on equal basis the performance of the new CP-CV technique with the classical constant current (CC)&#8211;CV protocol, the latter is also implemented in the same power stage. The CC phase in BOF is attained by imposing a G-gyrator of type II behavior to the converter. A versatile controller uses the same voltage regulation loop for both protocols during the CV phase and a slightly different loop for the CP and CC phases. The latter loop is based in both CP and CC phases on the sliding-mode control (SMC) of the input inductor current of BOF, which in steady-state is made proportional to the input voltage in the LFR case or to the output voltage in the gyrator implementation. To compensate for the slow variations of the battery voltage during the CC phase, a proportional-integral (PI) current regulator has been added in the gyrator realization. The comparison of the corresponding experimental results shows identical behavior in both approaches in the measured waveforms, component stress, efficiency and external temperature. The simplicity of the CP-CV implementation based on LFR allows the extension of the proposed protocol to other hard-switching converters.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive Impedance Matching System With Fast Optimization Control Algorithm for Wireless Power Transfer via Magnetic Coupling Resonance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10634540</link><description>For a magnetic coupling resonant wireless power transfer (MCR-WPT) system, the most challenging design issue is to maintain the reasonable transfer efficiency and the output power, especially over varying transmitting distances. To address this issue, this study proposes an adaptive impedance matching (AIM) system with a fast optimization control algorithm for the MCR-WPT system. By dynamically monitoring system input impedance variations at a given frequency, the matching system can be automatically activated. The matching precision is enabled by combining an amplitude-phase measurement circuit, a Pi-type impedance matching (IM) network, and the local optimization algorithm. Experimental comparisons show a significant improvement in the transfer efficiency. The maximum improvement is over 32.6%. The results also show that the local optimization algorithm helps the MCR-WPT system to effectively overcome the efficiency challenges caused by parasitic parameters, resulting in a maximum improvement of 19.8%. The stability of the output power is also significantly improved, with a 27.8% reduction in oscillation amplitude compared to the scenario without the local optimization algorithm, and a 60.0% reduction compared to the scenario without the IM network. The output power range (1.55 - 2.21 W) could meet the power requirements of most implantable medical devices. Moreover, this system adopts a control algorithm of tracking the theoretically optimal matching solution through Microcontroller Unit (MCU) computation, leading to a notable enhancement in matching accuracy.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive On-Off-Delay Compensation Scheme Based on Dead-Time and Rectified-Current Sampling for Ampere-Current-Level Series-Series Wireless Power Receivers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10634544</link><description>This article presents an adaptive on-off-delay compensation scheme for Ampere-current-level series-series (SS) wireless power receivers (RXs) to enhance both the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and the power delivering capability (PDC). The proposed off-delay compensation is realized by injecting an adaptive offset which is adjusted by sampling the rectified current. The proposed on-delay compensation is realized by inserting adaptive delays which are adjusted by sampling the dead time of the active full-wave rectifier. The proposed scheme was applied in a dual-mode resonant regulating rectifier which was fabricated in 0.18- $\mu $ m CMOS technology, and the regulated output voltage was set to 3.3 V. Measurement results demonstrated that the proposed scheme can effectively compensate for the on-off-delay as the RX input AC current varies from 0.7 to 2 A, corresponding to the coil distance varies from 26 to 42 mm. A measured peak PCE of 92.93% was achieved when the load current and coil distance were 0.945 A and 38 mm, respectively. Compared to the cases without delay compensation, the measured RX PDC increased from 495 mW to 1435.5 mW when the coil distance was 26 mm. Additionally, the measured PDC increased from 2557.5 mW to 4075.5 mW when the coil distance was 42 mm.</description></item><item><title>Modular Expansion Method for Wireless Power Transfer Systems With Arbitrary Topologies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10652249</link><description>Modular parallel inverter technology can enhance the power level and redundancy of wireless power transfer (WPT) systems, contributing to standardized production. It serves as an effective method for realizing high-power systems. However, inappropriate selection of compensation components can negatively affect the system&#8217;s efficiency, power factor, and the flexibility of modularization. This paper analyzes two key properties of modular-parallel-inverter WPT (MPI-WPT) systems: module number flexibility and modular deviation suppression. Firstly, to assess the modular deviation suppression of the system, its definition and calculation method are provided. Secondly, the expansion condition to achieve modular flexibility is examined, highlighting that the modular system needs to be a fully resonant system. Subsequently, an expansion design methodology from a single WPT system to an MPI-WPT system is proposed, ensuring the preservation of the original properties of the system during its extension. Finally, the parallel characteristics of MPI-WPT systems were experimentally verified.</description></item><item><title>A Novel CHB-Based Photovoltaic Grid-Tied System Integration of Centralized Energy Storage and Its Power Security Domain</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10623759</link><description>Due to differences of solar irradiance, ambient temperatures, or inconsistent degradation of photovoltaic (PV) modules, the unbalanced output power between cascaded H-bridge (CHB) legs will lead to the unbalanced or even distorted grid currents between three phases. This article proposes a novel CHB-based PV grid-tied system integrating centralized energy storage (CHB-PV/ES), which can realize power balanced operation by utilizing the centralized energy storage (ES) interconnecting the CHB three-phase sub-modules (SMs) by isolated DC/DC converter.

The configuration and security domain of PV and centralized ES SMs are critical factors for CHB-PV/ES, which are thoroughly analyzed in this article to ensure safe system operation. The simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed CHB-PV/ES scheme.</description></item><item><title>Impedance Matching Through a Reconfigurable Relay Coil Achieving Maximum Wireless Power Transfer Under Variations of Coupling Coefficient and Load Resistance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10614874</link><description>In this work, a 6.78 MHz three-coil wireless power transfer (WPT) system was presented, which consists of a transmitter (TX) coil, a reconfigurable relay coil (RRC), and a receiver (RX) coil. We analytically derived the critical coupling boundary and impedance matching (IM) condition in the strong-coupling regime for the first time. Under the variation of either coupling coefficient  $\boldsymbol {k}$  or load resistance  $\boldsymbol {R}_{\text {L}}$ , we proposed to achieve the IM condition on both TX and RX sides by adjusting the RRC&#8217;s inductance through electronically selecting its constituting loops. This eliminates the coupling tuning related with the mechanical position change. To obtain the optimum loop inductance in the RRC, we simply measured the voltage and current on the TX side without requiring information of  $\boldsymbol {k}$  or  $\boldsymbol { R}_{\text {L}}$ . This eliminates the RX-to-TX communication link. We implemented a prototype WPT system by including a class-D power amplifier (PA) and a rectifier, and the effectiveness of IM was verified under variations of  $\boldsymbol {k}$  and  $\boldsymbol {R}_{\text {L}}$ . Compared with the system without IM, the transmission ratio  $\boldsymbol { S}_{{21}}$  and load power  $\boldsymbol {P}_{\text {Load}}$  were respectively increased from 66.5 % to 77.9 % and 4.2 W to 10.2 W at  $\boldsymbol {k} = 0.15$  and  $\boldsymbol {R}_{\text {L}} = 20~\Omega $ . Furthermore, the performance improvement of our system for the wireless charging of multiple RX coils was demonstrated.</description></item><item><title>Model-Independent Observer-Based Critically Damped Terminal Voltage Stabilization for Single Machine Infinite Bus Systems via High-Order Pole-Zero Cancellation Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10637471</link><description>The proposed cascade-type feedback system stabilizes the terminal voltage of single machine infinite bus (SMIB) systems using two measurements: power angle and terminal voltage. The resultant control law only requires the nominal system parameters of the SMIB, and the observer removes any model dependence. This paper provides several contributions. First, the high-order pole-zero cancellation (PZC) technique constructs the observer to estimate the time derivatives of the terminal voltage and power angle measurements without any SMIB model information. Second, the high-order PZC technique enables the outer loop to estimate the desired power angle reference along the critically damped dynamics for the terminal voltage. Third, the observer-based proportional-double integral-derivative control law for the inner loop exponentially stabilizes the power angle error by reducing the closed-loop order to 2 through the high-order PZC technique. A MATLAB/Simulink implementation of the proposed cascade-type feedback system validates the effectiveness of the proposed solution.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid-Bridge-Based Dual-Active-Bridge Converter With an Asymmetric Active-Neutral-Point-Clamped Three-Level Bridge</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10634536</link><description>Hybrid-bridge based dual-active-bridge (DAB) converter comprised of three-level (3L) and two-level (2L) full-bridge (FB) is promising to be a good candidate for medium voltage DC (MVDC) grids. By applying a corresponding modulation strategy proposed in this paper with multiple working patterns, a wide voltage conversion gain can be obtained. However, given that the conventional neutral-point-clamped (NPC) DAB converter has potential risk losing the control of the voltage conversion gain in backward and forward modes, an asymmetric active-neutral-clamped (A-ANPC) 3L structure is employed in the proposed converter to overcome this issue. Afterwards, to ensure a smooth working pattern transition, a simplified control strategy is proposed. The backflow power remains constant regardless of working conditions, and the zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) can be achieved for all power switches under the proposed modulation strategy. The operation principle, characteristics, and performances of the proposed converter are analyzed in detail and experimentally verified.</description></item><item><title>An RRAM-Based Hierarchical Computing-in-Memory Architecture With Synchronous Parallelism for 3-D Point Cloud Recognition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10520717</link><description>Point clouds have important applications, such as computer vision, autonomous driving, and robotics.

In this topology, a crude user-provided calibration signal is applied and alternatively sampled by all the interleaved channels. Based on the digitized codes of the calibration signal, which is independent of the input signal, multiple estimation algorithms could be used to extract these mismatches. To avoid interrupting the normal signal conversion operation, an extra sub-ADC channel is employed to cycle through and substitute for the interleaved channels to sample the analog input. The FPGA-based hardware implementation results show that the proposed calibration architecture combined with a statistics-based timing skew estimation method, successfully compensates the timing skew mismatch, with an input of DC voltage, single tone near Nyquist and random signal, respectively. Compared with traditional reference-ADC-based calibration schemes, except for the signal-independent characteristic, the proposed scheme avoids time-variant input impedance problem and achieves constant convergence time regardless of the inputs.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-GHz Inverter-Based ASDM With Distortion Cancellation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10531049</link><description>This brief proposes and demonstrates an asynchronous sigma-delta modulator (ASDM) which is based entirely on pseudo-digital inverters.

Prior works employ space compression to improve exploration efficiency but focus only on single layers or partial spaces, failing to prevent expansion as network model depth increases. Therefore, in this brief, we propose the LCDSE framework to address the dilemma of space expansion. LCDSE clusters similar layers into blocks as coarse-grained optimization units to constrain parameters and prune redundant design space. Compared to former frameworks, LCDSE achieves up to  $4\times $  delay speedup,  $7.9\times $  energy-delay-product decrease and  $2.5\times $  area-delay-product reduction along with time cost saving by up to  $11.3\times $ , demonstrating its superior optimization efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Predefined-Time Observer-Based Fast Power Allocation for Battery Energy Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10527370</link><description>This brief deals with the power allocation problem of battery energy storage systems (BESSs), in which battery units work cooperatively to not only meet the power demand of microgrid but also satisfy the constraint of state-of-charge (SoC).

In contrast to the current findings, where the settling-time is difficult to ascertain, the settling-time can be provided in advance here. Then, observer-based power allocation strategy is further proposed, which enables BESSs to allocate the unbalanced power rapidly and balance SoC dynamically. Simulation results are given to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Safety Control for Constrained Uncertain Robotic Systems: A Neural Network-Based High-Order Control Barrier Function Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10538425</link><description>In this brief, a neural network-based high-order control barrier function (NNHoCBF) is proposed to address the safety control problem of constrained uncertain robotic systems, where the radial basis function-based neural network is introduced to reconstruct uncertain robotic systems. By proving the non-negative nature of NNHoCBFs, Lyapunov-like conditions are obtained to ensure the constraint satisfaction of uncertain robotic systems. Moreover, to ensure the safe tracking control for constrained uncertain robotic systems, a minimum energy quadratic program (QP) with Lyapunov-like conditions is constructed as constraints on nominal control inputs, and the safe tracking controllers of robotic systems are then obtained by solving the minimum energy QP. Consequently, the safety and tracking performances of constrained uncertain robotic systems can be guaranteed simultaneously. Finally, simulation tests on a two-link robotic system are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller.</description></item><item><title>Hardware-Friendly Approximation for Swish Activation and Its Implementation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10510410</link><description>This paper addresses the challenges associated with implementing the Swish activation function in hardware.

Compared to standard SNNs, liquid state machine (LSM), the spiking variant of reservoir computing, exhibits advantages in image classification, and are especially more promising in speech recognition. However, LSM-based neuromorphic processors suffer from weight storage overhead in resource-constrained edge applications. To address this, we propose ghost reservoir: a memory-efficient LSM based neuromorphic processor enabling on-chip spike-time-dependent plasticity-based backpropagation (BP-STDP) learning. For the LSM reservoir layer, we adopt a stateless-neuron model and an on-the-fly weight re-generation scheme to avoid the storages for both membrane potentials and weights. For the readout learning layer, a stochastic weight update approach is implemented to reduce the memory bit-width. These techniques contribute to an aggregate of a 482.5 KB on-chip memory reduction on the FPGA prototype. Implemented on the very-low-cost Xilinx Zynq-7010 device, our prototype achieved real-time processing, demonstrated comparably high on-chip learning accuracies of 94.93%, 84.65%, and 92% on the MNIST, N-MNIST, and FSDD datasets, respectively. These experimental results indicate that our LSM-based lightweight neuromorphic design is quite suitable for speech and visual recognition tasks in many resource-constrained edge intelligent applications.</description></item><item><title>A Contention-Free Wordline Supporting Circuit for High Wordline Resistance in Sub-10-nm SRAM Designs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10542405</link><description>A contention-free wordline supporting (CFWLS) circuit is proposed for SRAM in sub-10 nm technologies. The CFWLS resolves the problem of performance degradation caused by significant RC delays with increasing wordline interconnect resistance. A low-skewed sensing inverter utilizes a diode-connected PMOS to detect the wordline rising transition with negligible contention. A supporting PMOS supplies charge to the end of the wordline. By using a replica signal of the wordline enable (WLENt), sufficient charge can be supplied during the entire evaluation phase. The proposed CFWLS has a noise-tolerant characteristic because it complements the floating node by using a pull-up path in the sensing inverter. The WL rising time is improved by 48-57% in post-layout simulation compared to the conventional SRAM without a supporting circuit. The clock-to-bitline (half-VDD) delay is also improved by 20%, while the energy and area overheads of CFWLS are only 7% and 1.7%, respectively. In the test-chip measurements, the read delay for a pass is improved by 180 ps (16%) in sub-3 nm technologies.</description></item><item><title>A Novel 5L Boosting Inverter With Reduced Spike Current</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475701</link><description>This brief introduces a novel five-level inverter with a single DC source that uses only seven power switches and one capacitor.

Improved by the traditional VD power stage, the dual-output DC voltages are achieved by adding a power transistor. Thanks to the proposed power stage topology, the dual-output DC voltages realize full-wave rectification charging and a voltage conversion ratio (VCR) greater than 1 can be realized, which benefits the robustness of the WPT system under the loosely coupled link. The SPFM control is proposed to regulate the dual-output voltages sequentially. Under the SPFM control, each operating phase occupies an independent rectification cycle to avoid channel conduction problems. Moreover, to gain better power conversion efficiency (PCE), the offset current delay compensation technique is used. The proposed regulating rectifier is fabricated in 180nm CMOS process, occupying an area of 0.45mm2. The measurement results show that the proposed dual-output regulating rectifier outputs DC voltages at 3.3V and 2.5V respectively with ripples of 65.4mV and 52.7mV and achieves fast load transient responses. The maximum PCE and VCR are achieved at 90% and 1.67, respectively.

The power flow in ESS can be separated into a low-frequency component due to daily interaction between average generation and consumption patterns, and a high-frequency component due to radical increase/decrease in generation/load demand. The former can be catered by utilizing high energy density ESS like a battery, whereas the latter necessitate fast response ESS like a supercapacitor. This envisages the requirement of a Hybrid ESS (HESS) consisting of a battery and a supercapacitor. To address this requirement a novel Four-port Converter (FPC) to integrate solar Photo-Voltaic (PV) and HESS with DC load/grid is proposed in this brief. The resultant system is named Four-Port Solar PV-based Hybrid Energy Storage DC System (FPSHDS). Key features of the FPSHDS in comparison to existing schemes are: it&#8217;s all four ports (a) are inductively interfaced enhancing overall system reliability, (b) facilitates bidirectional power flow enhancing flexibility in interfacing PV, HESS, and DC load/grid, and (c) have a common ground eliminating leakage current concerns for solar-PV system.

In this regard, a novel detection technique based on the multiplicative watermarking and Luenberger observer is developed to identify covert attacks applied to the system. In the presented detection strategy, a special watermark generator filter produces a dummy signal on the original signal transmitted through the insecure communication channels. In addition, there is a watermark equalization filter at the end of the communication channel, which cancels out the impact of the watermark signal, resulting in the recovery of the original signal. A PI controller tuned by the deep reinforcement learning algorithm and dependent on the Luenberger observer is utilized as the secondary frequency control strategy to mitigate the impacts of the convert attacks. The OPAL-RT real-time emulator-based results show the proposed defense strategy successfully detects and mitigates the covert attacks imposed on the system.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Single-Switch High-Gain DC&#8211;DC Converter With Active Switched Inductor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10520660</link><description>This brief presents a non-isolated, novel single-switch high-gain DC-DC converter with an active switched inductor (NSSHG-ASI) designed for fuel-cell and photovoltaic (PV) powered systems.

The embedding layers with large memory capacity requirement and high bandwidth demand have been identified as the bottleneck of personalized recommendation inference. To mitigate the memory bandwidth bottleneck, near-memory processing (NMP) would be an effective solution which utilizes the through-silicon via (TSV) bandwidth within 3D-stacked DRAMs. However, existing NMP architectures suffer from the limited memory bandwidth caused by hard-to-scale TSVs. To overcome this obstacle, integrating the compute-logic near memory banks becomes a promising but challenging solution, since large memory capacity requirement limits the use of 3D-stacked DRAMs and irregular memory accesses lead to poor data locality, heavy TSV data traffic and low bank-level bandwidth utilization. To address this problem, we propose RecPIM, the first in-memory processing system for personalized recommendation inference using near-bank architecture based on 3D-stacked memory. From the hardware perspective, we introduce a heterogeneous memory system combined with 3D-stacked DRAM and DIMMs to accommodate large embedding tables and provide high bandwidth. By integrating processing logic units near memory banks on DRAM dies, our architecture can exploit the enormous bank-level bandwidth which is much higher than TSV bandwidth. Then, we integrate a small scratchpad memory to exploit the unique data reusability of DL-based personalized recommendation systems. Furthermore, we adopt a unidirectional data communication scheme to avoid additional cross-vault data transfer. From the software perspective, we present a customized programming model to facilitate memory management and task offloading. To reduce the data communication through TSVs and enhance the utilization of bank-level bandwidth, we develop an efficient data mapping scheme by partitioning the vector into smaller subvectors. Experimental results show that RecPIM achieves up to  $2.58\times $  speedup and 49.8% energy saving for data movement over the state-of-the-art NMP solution.</description></item><item><title>A High-Efficiency Power Obfuscation Switched-Capacitor DC&#8211;DC Converter Architecture</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10509707</link><description>Side-channel attacks (SCAs) have been shown to be very effective in breaking cryptographic engines.

To enhance energy efficiency of such error-resilient applications, state-of-the-art (SoA) CGRAs exploit approximation techniques, while maintaining an acceptable accuracy for the final quality of result (QoR). However, such CGRAs suffer from overheads of utilizing separate Add/Mul/Div units. We propose GREEN as an energy-efficient CGRA, which enables synergistic effects of a chain of approximation and optimization techniques in various levels of abstraction, from application-, to architecture-, to circuit-level, in a cross-layer hierarchy. Enabling this, GREEN offers different levels of energy-accuracy tradeoffs through the flexibility of its small processing elements (PEs), each of which can support various functionalities and precision-adaptability in a single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) or multiple instruction, multiple data (MIMD) manner. Experimental results obtained with Synopsys Design Compiler and Cadence Innovus at 45-nm CMOS technology node demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed SISD/SIMD/MIMD CGRA over the accurate and SoA counterparts. In particular, the MIMD mode of GREEN enables up to  $6.6\times $  higher throughput while dissipating 21% less energy than the accurate counterpart. Moreover, the end-to-end evaluation of GREEN variants on eight single- and multikernel applications from classification, bio-signal (ECG/EEG), and image/video processing domains demonstrates significant performance improvement, compared to the accurate CGRA. In particular, GREEN-MIMD not only speed-ups the ECG QRS detection by 49% and consumes 43% less area and 66% less energy than the accurate CGRA, but also maintains the heartbeat detection accuracy at 100%. GREEN implementations is available at https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/pd-downloads.</description></item><item><title>STATION: State Encoding-Based Attack-Resilient Sequential Obfuscation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10502250</link><description>The unauthorized duplication of design intellectual property (IP) and illegal overproduction of integrated circuits (ICs) are hardware security threats plaguing the security of the globalized IC supply chain. Researchers have developed various countermeasures, such as logic locking, layout camouflaging, and split manufacturing, to overcome the security threat of IP piracy and unauthorized overproduction. Logic locking is a holistic solution among all countermeasures since it safeguards the design IP against untrusted entities, such as untrusted foundries, test facilities, or end-users, throughout the globalized IC supply chain. There are well-known logic locking techniques for combinational circuits with well-established security properties; however, their sequential counterparts remain vulnerable. Since most practical designs are inherently sequential, it is essential to develop secure obfuscation techniques to protect sequential designs. This article proposes a sequential obfuscation technique, STATION, building on the principles of finite state machine encoding schemes. STATION is resilient against various attacks on sequential obfuscation&#8212;input-output (I/O) query attacks and structural attacks, including the ones targeting sequential obfuscation&#8212;which have broken all state-of-the-art sequential obfuscation techniques. STATION achieves good resilience and desired security against various I/O and structural attacks, which we ascertain by launching 9 different attacks on all tested circuits. Moreover, STATION ensures tolerable overheads in power, performance, and area, such as 8.75%, 1.22%, and 5.63% on the largest tested circuit, containing 102 inputs, 7 outputs,  ${6.1\times 10^{4}}$  gates, 7 flip flops, 100 states, and  ${3.0\times 10^{3}}$  transitions.</description></item><item><title>RE-Specter: Examining the Architectural Features of Configurable CNN With Power Side-Channel</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10509603</link><description>As domain-specific training data is recognized as valuable intellectual property, acquiring well-trained weights in convolutional neural networks (CNN) has emerged as a new threat to the neural network design community. To design a CNN accelerator that is resilient to side-channel threats, it is crucial to have an accurate and efficient security-driven framework at the early design stage. However, there is no standard way to perform root-cause analysis on the power side channel that exists in FPGA-based CNN accelerators. Therefore, we build RE-Specter, a framework that facilitates security-driven design space exploration (DSE) across various building components, combination patterns, and parallelism configurations in CNNs. The goal is to fully understand the power side-channel effects resulting from architectural modifications or optimization decisions. We further compare the benchmarks considering precision, resource utilization, and power side-channel leakage. Finally, we experimentally explore the design space of various architectural features. The experimental results show that low-bit precision delivers more secure architectures ( $68.9\times $  among DSPs,  $2439\times $  among LUTs) in measurement-to-disclosure (MTD), but mixed-precision strategies are necessary to maintain the model accuracy.

The execution span of each AC real-time tasks can be split into a couple of parts: 1) the mandatory part, execution of which offers a result of acceptable quality, followed by 2) the optional part, which can be executed partially or completely to refine the initially obtained result in order to increase the result-accuracy, while respecting the time constraint. In this article, we introduce a novel hybrid offline&#8211;online scheduling strategy, ARCTIC, for AC real-time tasks. The goal of real-time scheduler of ARCTIC is to maximize the results-accuracy (QoS) of the task set with opportunistic shedding of the optional part, while respecting system-wide constraints. During execution, ARCTIC retains exclusive copy of the private cache blocks only in the local caches in a multicore system and no copies of these blocks are maintained at the other caches, and improves performance (i.e., reduces execution-time) by accumulating more live blocks on-chip. Combining offline scheduling with the online cache optimization improves both QoS and energy efficiency. While surpassing prior arts, our proposed strategy reduces the task rejection rate by up to 25%, whereas enhances QoS by 10%, with an average energy&#8211;delay&#8211;product gain of up to 9.1%, on an 8-core system.</description></item><item><title>MCAM: Memductance Components Adaptive Model for Efficient Modeling of Memductance of Memristive Devices for Neuromorphic Circuits and Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10494379</link><description>As an emerging technology, memristive devices have flourished to develop energy-efficient computing systems in the form of emerging nonvolatile memories (eNVMs), synaptic connections, and logic design, which could play a critical role in microelectronic design. In neuromorphic applications, the power-off state of a nonvolatile memristor is crucial, as it determines the learning and forgetting of embedded synaptic efficacy. Due to the complexity of the transport mechanisms contributing to the memristor current, memristor modeling remains a critical challenge. The memductance of memristors includes both volatile and nonvolatile components, which can be modeled using a memductance components adaptive model (MCAM). The MCAM enables researchers to model the memductance of memristors, which can be used in neuromorphic applications and logic design. Mathematical explanations and two physical models of memristors extracted from experimental results demonstrate the model&#8217;s accuracy. The application of MCAM for synaptic updates in spiking neuromorphic systems is also shown.</description></item><item><title>Systematic Generation of Memristor-Transistor Single-Phase Combinational Logic Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10488036</link><description>The objective of our research is to create efficient methods and tools for the quick and thorough assessment of emerging digital circuit devices, facilitating the adoption of promising ones. In this work, we develop methods and tools for hybrid technology that combines memristors with MOS transistors and demonstrates their effectiveness. Although several types of memristor-transistor logic have been proposed, 15 years of research has created a small set of logic cells. We propose a systematic method for generating new and efficient memristor-transistor single-phase combinational logic cells. At the core of our approach is a cell enumerator, which enables us to explore a wide range of cell designs, including nonintuitive ones, and a data-driven inductive learning method, which identifies new properties of such cells and scales up our explorations. In conjunction with other completely new tools, these create a comprehensive and definitive library of logic cells. Our new cells provide significant improvements or significantly distinct Pareto-optimal alternatives for the few logic functions for which prior research has created cells. Importantly, our methods enable us to discover a previously unknown synergistic operation between memristors and transistors that occurs for specific cell topologies. We harness this synergy to develop a method for adding memristors to low-area pass-transistor circuits such that they produce strong output voltages and low power, including for patterns that cause ratioed operation. We have also developed a new memristor-transistor logic family, namely controlled-AND (cAND)/controlled-OR (cOR), which includes many of the best cells.

However, previous efforts for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) focus on neural architecture search (NAS) while lacking HW architecture search (HAS), thus limiting the full potential of co-design. Although expanding the scope of HAS offers performance potential, the exponentially increased joint search space presents a formidable challenge. To address this, we propose a deep and efficient framework NAF, which jointly searches for Networks and Accelerators for FPGAs in a balanced co-search space. First, we adjust the NAS space and then introduce a block-level bitwidth search on the software side. Meanwhile, we design a HW-friendly quantization algorithm to facilitate HW efficiency and accuracy. Second, we design a dataflow-configurable HW unit with computation and memory access optimizations for quantized multiplication. Based on this, we incorporate critical heterogeneous multicore architecture exploration on the HW side. Third, to enable rapid HW feedback in the enlarged HAS space, we perform resource and performance modeling and design a fast HW generation algorithm based on the genetic algorithm. Specifically, we apply optimization techniques, like mapping space pruning, greedy bandwidth allocation, and coarse-grained search, to speed up this process. We validate NAF in edge and cloud scenarios. Experimental results show that NAF efficiently explores a significantly larger joint space and provides high-quality solutions. Compared with previous state-of-the-art co-design works, the searched convolutional neural network-accelerator pairs improve the throughput by  $2.07\times \sim 7.10\times $  and energy efficiency by  $1.41\times \sim 2.27\times $  under similar accuracy on the ImageNet dataset.</description></item><item><title>Cascade: An Application Pipelining Toolkit for Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504565</link><description>While coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs) have emerged as promising programmable accelerator architectures, they require automatic pipelining of applications during their compilation flow to achieve high performance. Current CGRA compilers either lack pipelining altogether resulting in low application performance, or perform exhaustive pipelining resulting in high power and resource consumption. We address these challenges by proposing Cascade, an end-to-end open-source application compiler for CGRAs that achieves both state-of-the-art performance and fast compilation times. The contributions of this work are: 1) a novel post place-and-route (PnR) application pipelining technique for CGRAs that accounts for interconnect hop delays during pipelining but in a unique way that avoids cyclic scheduling and PnR, 2) a register resource usage optimization technique that leverages the scheduling logic in CGRA memory tiles to minimize the number of register resources used during pipelining, and 3) an automated CGRA timing model generator, an application timing analysis tool, and a large set of existing and novel application pipelining techniques integrated into an end-to-end compilation flow. Cascade achieves 8 -  $34\times $  lower critical path delay and 7 -  $190\times $  lower energy-delay product (EDP) across a variety of dense image processing and machine learning workloads, and 3 -  $5.2\times $  lower critical path delay and 2.5 -  $5.2\times $  lower EDP on sparse workloads, compared to a compiler without pipelining. Cascade mitigates the performance and energy-efficiency drawbacks of existing CGRA compilers, and enables further research into CGRAs as flexible, yet competitive accelerator architectures.</description></item><item><title>EnsGuard: A Novel Acceleration Framework for Adversarial Ensemble Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10502340</link><description>To defend against various adversarial attacks, it is essential to develop a robust and high computing efficiency defence framework. Adversarial ensemble learning is the most effective technique for defending against adversarial example attacks, which constructs ensembles of multiple Deep neural networks (DNNs) with adversarial training to obtain stronger defense. However, ensemble models run noticeably slower on existing DNN accelerators than single-model inference. Deploying ensemble models on the existing DNN accelerators leads to many critical issues such as the underutilization of hardware resources. To tackle emerging challenges, we propose EnsGuard, a dynamic asymmetric multicore systolic array architecture for adversarial ensemble learning inference to fully exploit both static and dynamic parallelism of ensemble models. Specifically, on the hardware level, we propose a novel instruction set extension and develop efficient architecture components to fully exploit the new hardware abstraction of scattered idle computing cores, and use them to dynamically create on-the-fly neural processing units (fNPUs). Moreover, we propose a computing power recycle mechanism to run on-the-fly models (small models) on fNPUs by carefully orchestrating execution order of ensemble models for maximizing hardware resources and bandwidth utilization. On the software level, EnsGuard adopts an integrated hardware/randomized ensemble co-design optimizer aiming at winning both faster inference and higher adversarial robustness. On top of that, a multimodel mapping method based on decision tree is proposed to enable the interleaving of different DNN executions both spatially and temporally, and mitigate straggler problems. Evaluation with a diverse set of workloads shows significant gains in throughput ( $4.4\times $ ) and energy reduction ( $3.2\times $ ).</description></item><item><title>Secure Delegated Variational Quantum Algorithms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10505905</link><description>Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) can train parameterized quantum circuits via classical optimizers to find approximate solutions to some important problems. They can overcome the limitations of existing quantum technologies only allowing for a few qubits and small circuit depth and are considered as one of the most promising methods for achieving quantum advantages in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. In this article, we propose secure delegated VQAs by utilizing quantum homomorphic encryption (QHE) for users with limited quantum power to delegate the task of running VQAs to remote quantum servers while still keeping the training data private. First, a client-friendly QHE scheme that allows quantum servers to perform calculation on encrypted data is proposed to be suitable for VQAs. Then, delegated VQAs based on the given QHE scheme are presented, where servers can train the ansatz circuit using the encrypted data. Finally, a delegated variational quantum classifier to identify handwritten digit images is given as a specific example of delegated VQAs and simulated on the cloud platform of Original Quantum to show the feasibility. Secure delegated VQAs will provide significant technical support for future quantum cloud services.</description></item><item><title>AutoAI2C: An Automated Hardware Generator for DNN Acceleration on Both FPGA and ASIC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10508183</link><description>Recent advancements in deep neural networks (DNNs) and the slowing of Moore&#8217;s law have made domain-specific hardware accelerators for DNNs (i.e., DNN chips) a promising means for enabling more extensive DNN applications. However, designing DNN chips is challenging due to: 1) the vast and nonstandardized design space and 2) different DNN models&#8217; varying performance preferences regarding hardware micro-architecture and dataflows. Therefore, designing a DNN chip often takes a large team of interdisciplinary experts months to years. To enable flexible and efficient DNN chip design, we propose AutoAI2C: a DNN chip generator that can automatically generate both FPGA- and ASIC-based DNN accelerator implementation (i.e., synthesizable hardware and deployment code) with optimized algorithm-to-hardware mapping, given the DNN model specification from mainstream machine learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch). Specifically, AutoAI2C consists of two major components: 1) a Chip Predictor, which can efficiently and reliably predict a DNN accelerator&#8217;s energy, latency, and resource consumption using the proposed graph-based intermediate accelerator representation and 2) a Chip Builder, which can generate and optimize DNN accelerator designs by automatically exploring the design space based on targeting metrics and the Chip Predictor&#8217;s performance feedback. Extensive experiments show that our Chip Predictor&#8217;s predictions differ by &lt;10% from real-measured ones. Furthermore, AutoAI2C generated accelerators can achieve performance comparable to or better than state-of-the-art accelerators, achieving up to a  $2.12\times $  throughput improvements or  $2.4\times $  latency reduction with the same level of hardware resource usage, or reducing energy consumption by up to  $1.6\times $ , when running the same DNN workloads.</description></item><item><title>Intelligent Inverse Designs of Impedance Matching Circuits With Generative Adversarial Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10492453</link><description>Impedance matching circuits (IMCs) are crucial modules in radio frequency (RF) front-end components, devices, and systems, affecting the performance of the whole systems. However, the design process of IMCs has to require intense manual interventions with high computational costs. To alleviate this problem, a novel scheme for inversely designing IMCs is presented in this work based on neural network technology. Such IMC inverse design framework consists of two mapping-based deep neural networks (DNNs). The first one is an untrained generative adversarial network (GAN) that maps from the design requirements to the regularized S-parameters curves. The second one is an inversion network that maps from the S-parameters and the target impedance to the designed circuit parameters. With the cascaded GAN and inversion network, an efficient method for designing IMC-based filtering antenna is introduced, which takes about 1/17 the time compared to the traditional EM-based design and optimization methods. Further, three power amplifiers (PAs) with multiple IMCs are inversely-designed based on the proposed framework. In experimental demonstration, the elaborate prototypes are fabricated and measured, where the measured results fully satisfy the demand performance.</description></item><item><title>ChatEDA: A Large Language Model Powered Autonomous Agent for EDA</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10485372</link><description>The integration of a complex set of electronic design automation (EDA) tools to enhance interoperability is a critical concern for circuit designers.

This article proposes a deep-testing method for identifying Trojans of particular concern to middle-to-high-end users, with a focus on illegal instructions. A hidden instruction Trojan can employ a low-probability sequence of normal instructions as a boot sequence, which is followed by an illegal instruction that triggers the Trojan. This enables the Trojan to remain deeply hidden within the processor. It then exploits an intrusion mechanism to acquire Linux control authority by setting a hidden interrupt as its payload. We have developed an unbounded model checking (UMC) technique to uncover such Trojans. The proposed UMC technique has been optimized with slicing based on the input cone, head-point replacement, and backward implication. Our experimental results demonstrate that the presented instruction Trojans can survive detection by existing methods, thus allowing normal users to steal root user privileges and compromising the security of processors. Moreover, our proposed deep-testing method is empirically shown to be a powerful and effective approach for detecting these instruction Trojans.</description></item><item><title>One-Shot Online Testing of Deep Neural Networks Based on Distribution Shift Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10494391</link><description>Neural networks (NNs) are capable of learning complex patterns and relationships in data to make predictions with high accuracy, making them useful for various tasks. However, NNs are both computation-intensive and memory-intensive methods, making them challenging for edge applications. Hence, hardware AI accelerators architectures based on computation-in-memory (CiM) architectures with nonvolatile memristive crossbars are gaining attention. Although memristive devices offer benefits, such as power efficiency, parallelism, and nonvolatility, they suffer from nonidealities, leading to various faults and parameter variations, both during manufacturing and lifetime operations. This can lead to faulty computations and, in turn, degradation of post-mapping inference accuracy, which is unacceptable for many applications, including safety-critical applications. Therefore, proper testing of NN hardware accelerators is of utmost importance for functional safety. In this article, we propose a one-shot testing approach that can test NNs accelerated on memristive crossbars with only one test vector, making it very suitable for online testing applications. Our approach can consistently achieve 100% fault coverage across several large topologies with up to 201 layers and challenging tasks like semantic segmentation. Nevertheless, compared to existing methods, the fault coverage is improved by up to 24%, the memory overhead is only 0.0123 MB, a reduction of up to  $19980\times $  and the number of test vectors is reduced by  $10000\times $ .</description></item></channel></rss>
