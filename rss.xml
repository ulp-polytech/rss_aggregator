Both the losses and the maximum temperature are very difficult to obtain/estimate due to the high complexity, change of losses in the core with respect to the average temperature, or the variation of the losses of the windings derived from the construction of the litz wire and the high-frequency effects. This article proposes the use of a real-time estimator, based on artificial neural networks trained from finite element method simulations capable of predicting with an error less than 2% in all cases both the maximum internal temperatures and the losses of a medium frequency transformer, with forced convection, which implies a very complex thermal behavior."/></item><item><title text="How MagNet: Machine Learning Framework for Modeling Power Magnetic Material Characteristics"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10232863"/><description text="This article applies machine learning to power magnetics modeling. We first introduce an open-source database&#8212;MagNet&#8212;which hosts a large amount of experimentally measured excitation data for many materials across a variety of operating conditions, consisting of more than 500 000 data points in its current state. The processes for data acquisition and data quality control are explained. We then demonstrate a few neural network-based power magnetics modeling tools for modeling the core losses and $B$&#8211;$H$ loops. The neural network allows multiple factors that may influence the magnetic characteristics to be modeled in a unified framework, where the nonlinear behaviors are captured with high accuracy and high generality. Neural network models are found to be effective in compressing the measurement data and predicting the material characteristics, paving the way for &#8220;neural networks as datasheets&#8221; to assist power magnetics design.

This study proposes a multifaceted stray parameter extraction method based on high-frequency oscillation characteristics of switching transient. Unlike existing methods that rely on waveform amplitude accuracy and channel sampling synchronization, the proposed method requires less precision in these areas. Hence, it is more resilient to signal attenuation and mismatch issues, making it a robust solution. First, the mathematical analysis of the oscillation behavior in the turn-off transients is presented. Next, the relationship of the oscillation frequency with the parameters in a second-order and a fourth-order model is analyzed. A novel extraction method and the corresponding design of the extraction kit are then presented. The effectiveness is verified by the extraction application in various components in a high-power converter, including copper and laminated busbars, dc-link capacitors, and semiconductor power modules. The robustness and frequency algorithm were improved and verified by Monte Carlo trials. Both partial and total loop parameter extraction tests validate that the proposed method can accurately obtain values in the order of 10 nH and offers high test precision, simple operation, and low extraction error."/></item><item><title text="Thermal Network Models for Toroidal and E-Core Inductors in Still Air"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10255306"/><description text="Thermal management of inductors and transformers is critical to the design of power converters. Thermal network models can provide quick and accurate temperature predictions, making them ideal for circuit thermal design and optimization. Although there are several thermal models for magnetic components in still air, various factors difficult their application. Challenges include limited experimental validation for a single component orientation, inappropriate heat transfer correlations, arbitrary selection of thermal parameters, and the necessity for heat transfer coefficient calibration. This study developed thermal network models capable of predicting maximum temperature rise for horizontally and vertically oriented magnetic components based on toroidal and E-shaped cores in still air (natural convection) without introducing any empirical or numerical adjustment coefficients. Heat transfer coefficients were calculated for each surface of the magnetic components, based on existing correlations. The models were validated with CFD data and experimentally in a purpose-built facility to acquire the component temperature distribution and measure and control the power losses. When compared with the experimental data, the thermal network results presented averaged deviations below the experimental uncertainty of 2.0 $^{\circ }$C for the temperature rise. Therefore, the model has proven to be a suitable tool for predicting temperature and enabling the optimization of magnetic components."/></item><item><title text="Sensorless Starting Control Method Based on Rotor Current Characteristics of Excitation System for a Brushless Synchronous Starter/Generator at Low Speed"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10227563"/><description text="For an aviation brushless synchronous starter/ generator system, rotors of the main exciter (ME) and main machine (MM) rotate synchronously. Meanwhile, abundant current harmonic in ME's rotor, which is caused by a rotating rectifier, contains rotor position information. Then, the rotor position of MM can be obtained indirectly by signals of ME. In this article, based on rotor current characteristics of the excitation system, the estimated rotor current of ME and MM is employed innovatively for rotor position estimation at low speed. First, the harmonic current characteristics in ME's rotor winding are analyzed, and the low-order harmonic can be used for rotor position increment estimation. However, the rotor current of ME cannot be measured directly. Fortunately, in dq coordinate, it can be estimated by the measurable signal in stator winding. Furthermore, by operations of rotation transformation and low-pass filtering, rotor position increment can be obtained. Meanwhile, by injecting low-frequency rotating signals into MM's stator, the initial rotor position of MM can be obtained by sampling the estimated main field current at a fixed point. Finally, by combining rotor position increment and initial rotor position, sensorless starting control can be realized. The proposed method can avoid the influence of MM's operating state and experiments verify the effectiveness."/></item><item><title text="Two-Parameter Identification Method of Deadtime Effect Voltage Error Model During Self-Commission"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10229318"/><description text="An identification method is presented for the arctan two-parameter model, which describes the deadtime effect voltage error of permanent magnet synchronous motor drives' three-phase voltage source inverter (VSI) during self-commission.

In the EME, the widely used conventional voltage sensing (CVS) method with low-pass filters and analog-to-digital conversion in digital signal processors (DSP) is susceptible to phase delay and noise. To deal with the disadvantage of the CVS method, the IAPV method is introduced with the pulsating voltage signal digitally transmitted and directly processed by the DSP.

Due to the special connection, the zero-sequence circuit of a PMSM drive fed by the proposed four-leg inverter can not only be used to tolerate an open-phase fault (OPF) but also to boost the dc-bus voltage. According to the analytical modeling and equivalent circuit, it is revealed that the four-leg inverter-based PMSM drive is similar to a two-stage drive under healthy operating conditions. When an OPF occurs, the motor can be normally operated with only two active phases. Under postfault conditions, the remaining phase-currents are not sinusoidal any more. Besides, the trajectory of the postfault current vector is not a standard circle. The traditional field-oriented control strategy can still be adopted in the drive. However, the references of the $d$-axis current and neutral current have to be modified by injecting specific components. A differential flatness-based controller is proposed to track the time-varying current references. Experiments are carried out on a 1.2-kW PMSM test-bench to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme."/></item><item><title text="A Novel Turn Fault Detection Strategy Based on High-Frequency Neutral-to-Ground Voltages"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10234547"/><description text="With the increasing application of permanent magnet (PM) machines, the drive reliability should be guaranteed for safety-critical applications. As a severe stator winding short-circuit fault, turn fault causes excessive fault current and affects the machine's stable operation. Thus, this article proposes a new turn fault detection strategy based on high-frequency (HF) neutral-to-ground voltages (NTGVs) with HF injection. The electrical signal response to the turn fault is analyzed by analytical model and the expressions of the estimated three-phase NTGVs are derived by considering the HF signals only. The estimated NTGVs are identical under healthy condition; however, this is not the case under turn fault. To eliminate the influence of speed and load, HF voltages are injected and the HF NTGVs are processed to construct the fault indicator. The calculation of NTGVs only requires phase current and drive signals from the control system, eliminating the need for additional voltage sensors and hardware circuits. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed detection strategy are demonstrated by extensive experiments via a PM machine drive."/></item><item><title text="A Coupled Inductor-Based High-Gain ZVS DC&#8211;DC Converter With Reduced Voltage Stresses"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10236003"/><description text="In this article, a new coupled inductor-based high voltage gain dc&#8211;dc converter with continuous input current and reduced semiconductor stresses (with respect to the competitive topologies) is presented. The coupled inductor windings are used in the voltage multiplier cells to increase the boost factor of the converter. The proposed topology achieves a high efficiency due to: 1) soft switching of the main and auxiliary switches along with the power diodes; 2) active clamp circuit based coupled inductor leakage energy recycling to the output; 3) improved output-side power diodes reverse recovery performance because of a reduced falling current rate due to the presence of leakage inductance; 4) lower on-state resistance and lower conduction losses in the semiconductor switches because of the reduced voltage rating of the switches. The performance of the converter is evaluated analytically to demonstrate efficiency improvement, reduced semiconductor stress, and high voltage gain capabilities. Furthermore, a detailed comparative study is presented. The proposed topology is found to be superior compared to recent state of art configurations. Through simulation studies and experimentation on a 250 W prototype, the proposed concept is validated."/></item><item><title text="Current Integral Comparison-Based Power Loss Balancing Control for Full-Bridge Modular Multilevel Converters"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10238812"/><description text="Power loss management is one of the most important challenges for improving the reliability of modular multilevel converters (MMCs).

A novel flux observer based on an enhanced second-order generalized integrator (SOGI) with a limit cycle oscillator is proposed to improve the robustness of sensorless PMSM drives. Based on the SOGI structure, the proposed method constructs a nonlinear oscillator with a self-excited oscillation function that can maintain the flux trajectory oscillation even in the absence of the input stator electromotive force. The enhanced observer can converge the stator flux trajectory to its expected state under external disturbances and reduce position estimation error. Moreover, the proposed limit cycle oscillator can improve the harmonic suppression ability of the SOGI-based flux observer. The convergence and robustness of the enhanced observer are both investigated, demonstrating that the proposed method can improve the performance of the flux observer. The effectiveness of this method is verified by experiments on a 2.2-kW PMSM drive platform."/></item><item><title text="Speed Controller Design for Electric Drives Based on Decoupling Two-Degree-of-Freedom Control Structure"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10247616"/><description text="In the speed control of electrical machine servo systems, the two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) control has attracted considerable attention due to its ability to optimize both the system's reference tracking performance and disturbance suppression performance. However, the existing 2DOF control structures have the shortcoming that the coupling relationship of the reference tracking performance regulation and disturbance suppression performance regulation results in cumbersome controller design and parameter tuning. To address the shortcoming, this article proposes a new decoupling 2DOF control structure consisting of the control law and the observer. First, to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed control structure in reducing the complexity of controller design and parameter tuning, the design process and performance comparison of the speed controllers based on conventional control structures and the proposed control structure are presented in detail. Furthermore, to illustrate the advantages of the proposed structure in increasing the flexibility of controller design, four decoupling 2DOF speed controllers are designed for four typical speed servo conditions. Subsequently, the system stability is proved by analyzing the distribution of the characteristic roots, and parameter tuning guidelines for the four decoupling 2DOF speed controllers are provided.

The previous research has proposed a senseless control method robust to the single open-phase fault (SOPF) to improve the reliability of the drive system. To further enhance the robustness of the sensorless control system of the DTM, the effect of the double open-phase fault (DOPF) on the HFSI is analyzed and unified with that of the SOPF. It is found that both SOPF and DOPF can cause the varying amplitude and negative sequence harmonics of the high-frequency currents in the &#945;&#946;-subspace. To solve these problems, a transformation method is introduced to transform them into multiple harmonics. Then, an adaptive filter-based rotor position estimation method is proposed. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed HFSI-based sensorless control method can accurately estimate the rotor position under health, SOPF, and DOPF conditions without any fault-diagnosis method."/></item><item><title text="Output Performance Model and Three-Phase Nine-State Control for Doubly Salient Electromagnetic Generator"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10261298"/><description text="The doubly salient electromagnetic generator (DSEG) is sought in aircraft applications because of its simple structure and high reliability.

On this basis, a three-phase nine-state (TPNS) control for DSEG systems based on the active rectifier is also proposed. In contrast to conventional control strategies, the TPNS strategy could improve the power capacity of the DSEG system. Furthermore, losses were suppressed and system efficiency was enhanced.

They are compact and put less voltage stress on power switches. To provide multidc outports with fewer power switches, a cascaded half-bridge-based multilevel multiport bridgeless PFC is proposed in this article. Compared with cascaded full-bridge multilevel PFC, the number of switches per power cell for the proposed PFC is reduced by half while maintaining the same dc outports. Due to the multilevel voltage, the volt&#8211;second on the boost inductor decreases, reducing the current ripple of the proposed PFC by $2n$ times with the same boost inductance as the conventional totem-pole PFC. By splitting the power into $2n$ cells with low voltage, the total switching losses are also reduced by $2n$ times with the same equivalent switching frequency. In addition, the proposed rectifier also reduces conduction losses as lower voltage switches with smaller conduction loss are adopted in half-bridge cells compared with conventional totem-pole PFC rectifiers. Finally, these benefits are analyzed and validated with experiments."/></item><item><title text="Passivity-Based Design of Passive Damping for LCL-Type Grid-Connected Inverters to Achieve Full-Frequency Passive Output Admittance"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10244071"/><description text="The frequency-domain passivity theory suggests that incorporating passive output admittance in grid-connected inverters (GCIs) can effectively mitigate system instability issues. This theory has been widely recognized and applied in design guidelines for active damping (AD) and passive damping (PD) methods tailored explicitly for LCL-type GCIs. However, AD methods have a limitation in that they can only reshape the output admittance of GCIs to be passive (with a nonnegative real part) up to the Nyquist frequency. This limitation arises from the inherent characteristics of the digital control system. Similarly, existing passivity-based PD design cases primarily focus on addressing instability issues that occur below the Nyquist frequency. To overcome this limitation and achieve full-frequency passive output admittance, this article introduces a resistor&#8211;capacitor (RC) branch-based PD scheme. It provides a comprehensive design guideline that can be applied to different scenarios involving inverter-side or grid-side current control, regardless of whether AD methods are utilized. By incorporating this RC-PD scheme, the designed GCIs achieve full-frequency passive output admittance, effectively preventing potential harmonic oscillations both below and above the Nyquist frequency. Finally, comparative experimental results for different cases are demonstrated to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach."/></item><item><title text="Impedance-Based Stability Analysis and On-Site Stability Evaluation of Three-Phase Active Voltage Conditioner Embedded System"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10261310"/><description text="The active voltage conditioners (AVCs), which refers to a class of series voltage compensators in this article, have been employed in increasingly complex applications in recent years.

The proposed technique is based on the device turn-off delay time interval, which as we discovered, decreases during the device gate oxide degradation (DGOD) process. Therefore, this article proposes a practical fully analogue circuit to capture the device turn-off delay time and convert it to a dc voltage as the final output of the CM circuit. The DGOD precursor output can be effectively used to assess the health status of IGBT gate oxide layer during the device real-time operation. Two different types of 600 V/60 A discrete IGBTs from different manufacturers are used in the experimental verification process. In addition, the proposed CM technique is applied to a 500 W boost dc&#8211;dc converter to evaluate the applicability of the proposed CM technique to real-world converter operation.

The proposed converter features continuous input and output currents while significantly reducing the filter capacitance requirement. As a result, the need for an electrolytic capacitor is eliminated, leading to improved overall system reliability. In continuous conduction mode (CCM), when the driving signals of the two switches have a phase difference of 180$^{\circ }$ and their duty cycles satisfy the constraint relationship of $d_\mathrm{2}$ = 1/(2-$d_\mathrm{1}$), the proposed converter automatically achieves current sharing between the two input inductors throughout the entire duty cycle range.

It often requires high response times. In recent years, a new type of DCCB topology called forced resonant DCCB (FR-DCCB) has attracted widespread attention. It requires only a small amount of power electronic devices to provide mechanical switch zero crossing with LC circuit. And this topology offers advantages, such as multiple zero-crossing points, low cost, and the potential for faster response time. However, compared with the traditional DCCB solutions, the breaking process of FR-DCCB is extremely complex, which leads to the lack of mature control methods and parameter design theories. Therefore, to further improve the performance of FR-DCCB, this article proposes an efficient resonance control method based on the real-time feedback correction and a fast reclosing control method based on closing surge energy recovery, respectively, and also forms a complete optimization parameters design method. In addition, the parameters design method is presented to significantly reduce the oscillation time of FR-DCCB, thereby improving its response speed to meet engineering requirements.

An asymmetric form of positive and negative reactive power disturbance (RPD) is presented so that there always exists a certain total amount of disturbance in the system. To decrease the disturbance amplitude without expanding the nondetection zone (NDZ), a positive feedback of frequency difference is added to the disturbance. A RPD synchronization method without communication among inverters is proposed so that the averaging effect caused by unsynchronized reactive disturbances can be eliminated and the island can be detected in a multiple distributed generator (DG) system.

However, the driving mode of partial excitation in segmented power supply brings some problems, such as unbalanced parameters of three-phase, the transient inductance of winding changing with secondary position, and distortion of armature reaction magnetic field. This article proposes a new topology with the minimum unit winding segmented to solve the problems of unbalanced inductance parameters and distortion of armature reaction magnetic field in winding segmented permanent magnet linear synchronous motors (WS-PMLSM). An analytical model of inductance distortion in the end coils of a moving-magnet PMLSM is established and compared with the nonend coil inductance to summarize the mechanism of inductance unbalance in WS-PMLSM. Based on the model of winding transient inductance changing with secondary position, the changing law of transient inductance is expounded. An analytical method of the air gap magnetic field based on virtual winding is proposed, and the formation mechanism of magnetic field distortion caused by partial excitation is revealed.

However, the performance and stability of ESO will be degraded in the face of amplified high-frequency (HF) perturbation caused by inductance parameter mismatch. To solve the above problem, an enhanced ESO-based MFPCC method is proposed in this article. On the basis of constructing the discrete equation of ESO, an accurate and fast calculation of inductance parameter is proposed, which is real-time convergence to the actual value by deadbeat control principle, and fed back to the lumped disturbance and current observation calculation. It effectively eliminates the effects of HF perturbation on ESO. Simultaneously, the inductance and compensated lumped disturbance obtained from ESO are provided to the MFPCC command voltage calculation module, further improving the parameter robustness of MFPCC. The stability of the proposed ESO is ensured by the design of observer gain. Experiments are carried out on 1-kW surfaced permanent magnet synchronous machines test bench.

The relationship between the measured HF currents and scaling errors is derived. It shows that the amplitudes of the HF currents are proportional to the scaling errors, based on which three HF current control loops are subsequently designed to eliminate the measured HF currents and compensate the scaling errors. The designed HF controller is independent from the main current and torque regulators, and thus, it can be used for initial scaling gain calibration or periodically used during normal machine operation. Different from general three-phase machine systems, the generated HF current components only exist in z1z2 subspace, and thus, no extra torque ripples will be produced. The experimental results validate the proposed control algorithm."/></item><item><title text="Improved Adaptive CCS-MPCC for Distorted Model Parameters Mitigation of IPMSM Drives"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10138767"/><description text="In this article, a robust adaptive model continuous-control-set model predictive current control (CCS-MPCC) method is proposed for interior permanent magnet synchronous motors (IPMSMs) considering the existing disturbances, unmodeled dynamics, and parameter variations. The novel aspect of this research is that it merges the improved dynamic and useful properties of model predictive control, which includes easy implementation and fast dynamic response, together with the most effective criterion of an adaptive controller (i.e., robustness to model uncertainties), that result in enhanced dynamic and steady-state control performance despite unknown and changing disturbances. Unlike the conventional CCS-MPCC approach that heavily depends on the accurate knowledge of the system model to attain improved control performance, the proposed method achieves satisfactory control performance (e.g., fast dynamic response, smaller steady-state error, and low total harmonic distortion (THD) on stator current) by stabilizing the state errors to approach zero and compensating for variations in the model parameters using the designed feedback control terms and adaptive control terms, respectively. The stability of the proposed control method is ensured by the state errors asymptotically decaying to zero.

The proposed modeling scheme has a simpler form of expression and a more straightforward physical concept than the traditional scheme. To completely compensate for the aforementioned deviation, a levitation position eccentricity compensation scheme for BM based on the tracking of the minimum antieccentric levitation current is proposed in this article. The proposed scheme takes the amplitude of the antieccentric levitation current vector as the index, which characterizes the degree of eccentricity of the rotor and dynamically adjusts the rotor levitation position in two dimensions and, finally, makes the rotor stably levitated at the optimal point, where the amplitude of the antieccentric levitation current vector is minimum.

To solve this issue, a novel single-stage ac/dc converter by incorporating the interleaved discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) boost cell and an LLC cell is proposed. Different from the existing topology, in the proposed converter, two capacitors employed for splitting the ac input voltage into two parts are placed before the rectifier bridge. Thus, the voltage across each power factor correction (PFC) cell is halved and the bus voltage can be significantly reduced. Furthermore, two high-frequency diodes and one filter capacitor are omitted, which helps improve the zero-crossing distortion of the input current. More importantly, the circuit efficiency is thus increased. Hence, low bus voltage, low component count, and high efficiency are the main advantages of the proposed converter.

The proposed optimal design focuses on the circulating energy minimization by adjusting the transformer turns ratio according to the maximum gain of resonant tank. This makes the root mean square value of resonant current and turn-off current stationary even though the resonant tank change. Thus, designers can select resonant tank optimized for the converter specifications without considering the conduction and switching losses. By the proposed optimal design, the efficiency degradation at worst case, which is a significant issue of the fuel cell system with wide output voltage range, can be minimized. In addition, for the fuel cell converter with wide input voltage range, a phase shift control that operates the full-bridge inverter with a constant effective duty cycle according to the fuel cell voltage is proposed.

This causes severe mismatches between the inductance of the multiple winding in a single core, making the implementation more complex. Therefore, in this article, a novel modularization method is proposed for a matrix-connected UC bank. The proposed method achieves cell balancing, module balancing, and demagnetization with less number of components. Moreover, the proposed method uses a single pair of complementary pulsewidth modulation signals with a 50% duty ratio for all switches.

Yet the WPT gain of a conventional system is normally dependent on the magnetic components such as coils or inductors, making it difficult to customize the output for interoperability. This article presents a gain variable WPT topology for CC output customization, which only employs capacitance tuning to provide sufficient freedom in gain regulation. To break the gain limitation of S-S compensation, which is the simplest with gyrator characteristics for CC output, a capacitive or inductive component is paralleled to the coil as SP-S or S-PS compensation. A thorough analysis based on the Y-&#916; transform indicates that the gain is restrictively variable with the parallel component. An S-CLC-compensated topology without an independent inductor is further proposed to avoid those restrictions with as few additional components as possible. The inductor in the topology, coupled with the transmitter coil and integrated into the receiver coil, extends the gain variable range. A complete design process of the topology is presented to realize efficient WPT and CC output customization with a wide variable-gain range and misalignment tolerance. Analytical and simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the gyrator-gain variation by capacitance tuning. Finally, the performance of the WPT topology is evaluated by experimental results on a scaled-down prototype."/></item><item><title text="Single-Transmitter-Controlled Multiple-Channel Constant Current Outputs for In-Flight Wireless Charging of Drones"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10138760"/><description text="This article proposes a single-transmitter-controlled multiple-channel constant current outputs scheme, which can energize multiple hovering drones over the air simultaneously.

Its physical insight is attributed to the unstable limit cycle (ULC) in the phase space according to the bifurcation theory. The GFM inverters whose operating point locates outside of ULC will lose synchronism with the grid. The decrease of the proportional gain of DVC will diminish the ULC, resulting in fewer operating points converging to the new EP and a higher risk of LOS.

Consequently, engineers may need to tune the controller parameters by trial and error to design the control systems that achieve desired performance. In digital control, sinusoidal references of power converters are discrete-time sequences. Based on this, we present a digital design technique for the PR controllers and demonstrate the design process using a 13.2-kW grid-connected inverter prototype. The design ensures the sinusoidal reference's tracking-error sequence converges at the desired rate. The advised design technique's merits include the following conditions: 1) the tracking-error convergence rate, phase margin, and cutoff frequency have clear mathematical relations, allowing engineers to uniquely determine the controller parameters by specifying any two indicators; 2) with the tuned controller parameters, the tracking-error sequence can converge at the desired rate; and 3) the resultant controller can be partitioned into one proportional term and two resonant terms; the first two terms are construed as a standard PR controller digitally implemented via the zero-order-hold method, whereas the second resonant term guarantees the tracking-error sequence converging in the desired manner. A case study results confirm the digital PR controller's efficacy."/></item><item><title text="An Effective PQ-Decoupling Control Scheme Using Adaptive Dynamic Programming Approach to Reducing Oscillations of Virtual Synchronous Generators for Grid Connection With Different Impedance Types"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10138733"/><description text="The power coupling of the virtual synchronous generator (VSG) in the grid-connected mode may aggravate power oscillation because of a resistance-inductive line.

Instabilities caused by PLL frequency coupling have been widely discussed. For DVL, past studies have analyzed the effect of DVL parameters on the degree of frequency coupling, but it is quite unclear how DVL parameters affect the inverter stability and how DVL can be designed under the weak grid. Hence, by fully considering the abovementioned frequency coupling, an accurate admittance model of photovoltaic grid-connected inverter is established in this article. By deriving the modified admittance matrix, the effects of grid impedance and DVL parameters on the frequency coupling are clearly studied. In addition, by modeling the equivalent inverter output impedance, the impact of DVL on the inverter stability under the weak grid is revealed. As proved, the increase of DVL bandwidth ${f}_{vbw}$ and grid impedance will aggravate the frequency coupling, but the current distortion does not necessarily increase. Meanwhile, the increase of ${f}_{vbw}$ helps to improve the inverter stability under the weak grid. Accordingly, a novel design for DVL in the weak grid is proposed. Experiments verify the correctness of the analysis and design."/></item><item><title text="A Multiport Current-Fed IIOS Dual-Half-Bridge Converter for Distributed Photovoltaic MVDC Integration System"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10124858"/><description text="The input-independent output-series (IIOS) dc&#8211;dc converter structure possesses the capability to achieve high voltage gain, single-stage power conversion, and multiport independent control, which is suitable for distributed photovoltaic (PV) power collection system.

The existing methods generally use image information as control variables and estimate the image Jacobian matrix online, thus possessing issues relating to convergence, and image Jacobian matrix singularities. Therefore, this article proposes a novel methodology dubbed infinite homography-based uncalibrated visual servoing (IHUVS), in which the visual control of the robot end-effector pose is decomposed into its rotational and translational components. The corresponding rotational controller designs the visual servoing task function using the relationship between the infinite homography matrix and rotation matrix, and employs the Kronecker product to derive linear equations for rotational control, as well as to conduct the associated task error analysis. Meanwhile, the translational controller utilizes Kalman filtering for online estimation of the Jacobian matrix that is required by the proportional control scheme. The robot end-effector motion in the Cartesian space is generated via the IHUVS method, without knowing the camera's intrinsic parameters and the robot hand&#8211;eye relationship.

Considering unknown Cartesian feature positions, this article presents a robot dynamics-based homography-based visual servoing (HBVS) controller for the 3-D pose regulation of eye-in-hand robot arms with monocular cameras. The uncertain depth is represented into a linear form of its Cartesian feature position, and a composite learning law is applied to estimate position parameters accurately, resulting in exact depth estimation.

Ahead of implementations, one of the most vital motion properties of the MMs, i.e., the fundamental spin motility should be characterized for better utilization. To fulfill the precise characterization of MMs, it is of great value to develop an electromagnetic field generator with high accuracy. One electromagnetic field generator usually equips its coils with iron cores to enhance the generated magnetic field (MF) strength, which may also bring in unwanted nonlinear and temperature-dependent dynamic properties. The complex properties usually make the coils hard to control to maintain consistent good performances. To generate a desirable MF under varying temperature conditions, this study develops a model prediction adaptive control (MPAC) approach to regulate the coil system adaptively. Validation tests show that, compared with the prevalent MPC method, the MPAC approach can generate a more accurate MF at different ambient temperatures. As an application, the MPAC-controlled MF generator is utilized to characterize the MM's spin motility, and a nonlinear dynamic model is established, which can properly describe the MM's spin behavior under various excitation conditions."/></item><item><title text="Self-Supervised Antipodal Grasp Learning With Fine-Grained Grasp Quality Feedback in Clutter"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10124855"/><description text="It is a challenging goal in robotics to make a robot grasp like a human being in a cluttered environment.

An adaptive actuator driver for ac contactors is proposed based on the coil impedance estimation and mathematical equations between the coil impedance and excitation control parameters. The coil impedance estimation and its error correction are established through the voltage balance equation when the contactor is in the open position. The coil inductance estimation is established through the zero-state response equation when the contactor is in the closed position. The mathematical equations are established based on the equivalence of the electromagnetic force under different excitation methods, the power consumption model, and the control system's transfer function. A geometric feature of the flux linkage waveform is established to identify whether a contactor is in the closed position and realize the self-transition of the driver's working state. Then, self-tuning regulators for the excitation control parameters are realized. This driver has a plug-and-play function for ac contactors and can reduce the contactor's power consumption.

The prominent feature of DIDM was that the inertial force was in diagonal direction by using the designed piezoleg with square cross section. The vertical component of the inertial force reduced the friction force and even made the robot jump to achieve a larger step displacement. The experimental results indicated that the proposed DIDM increased the step displacement successfully. The increase effect was optimal when the vertical component of the inertial force was equal to the horizontal one, and the realized step displacement was as high as 156% to the deformation of the inertial unit in motion direction. Moreover, the force and displacement responses of the driving foot in vertical direction were measured, which indicated that the robot realized jumping action to increase the step displacement under DIDM, and the maximum speed realized by DIDM was 2.3 times of that achieved by the traditional inertial driving method.

To eliminate this difficulty and enrich the multiwing chaos, we construct a simple three-dimensional autonomous system with only two symmetric stable equilibria, and further introduce a sawtooth wave modulation function to configure more equilibria. The highlight is that multiwing chaotic attractors can be generated from system with two or multiple stable node-foci. This characteristic indicates that the attractors can be hidden oscillating and are difficult to be located in the small neighborhoods of equilibria, which makes the system has good concealment performance for security applications.

In order to obtain more accurate resonant frequency, an improved position sensorless resonant frequency tracking control method is proposed in this article. In this method, the adjustable model is constructed based on the mechanical dynamics equation of LOM to track the system resonant frequency. A hybrid terminal sliding-mode observer (HTSMO) is designed to replace the conventional reference model, which can obtain more accurate velocity reference signal for adjustable model by introducing the current error feedback link, thereby further improving the resonant frequency tracking accuracy. Moreover, a second-order generalized integrator is introduced to filter the estimated velocity signal of HTSMO. The filtered velocity signal is not only used for the adjustable model to track the resonant frequency, but also used to obtain the smooth piston stroke signal for the stroke closed-loop control. Comprehensive simulation and experimental results have proved the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed method."/></item><item><title text="Formation Tracking of Mobile Robots Under Obstacles Using Only an Active RGB-D Camera"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10142958"/><description text="This article attempts to achieve leader-follower formation tracking for mobile robots under obstacles with only one RGB-D camera on the follower. In contrast, most existing research employs at least two sensors, including a camera and a LiDAR. However, the limited field of view of RGB-D cameras introduces three significant challenges: 1) intermittent observation of the leader, 2) partial detection of obstacles, and 3) conflicting observations of the leader and obstacles. To overcome these difficulties, we first propose a controller that enables the follower to achieve continuous observation and formation tracking of the leader without obstacles and depth images. To address the partial detection of obstacles, we design a rotating device that allows the camera to actively extend its observation range and resolve conflicts with leader detection. Based on camera feedback and the proposed controller, a multiobjective controller is presented that enables the follower to achieve formation tracking and obstacle avoidance simultaneously, without requiring communication or leader velocity. Simulations and experiments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of our methods."/></item><item><title text="Adaptive Position Constrained Assist-as-Needed Control for Rehabilitation Robots"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122875"/><description text="In rehabilitation practice, motivating patients with neurological injuries to actively increase muscle activity and ensure their safety are important. Therefore, this study proposed a position-constrained assist-as-needed (AAN) control method for rehabilitation robots. A human&#8211;robot interaction system with position constraints was first established based on prescribed performance. Aiming at implementing the AAN strategy, the robot assistance level metric (RALM), a constructed global continuous differentiable function incorporating dead zone and saturation characteristics, was introduced to quantify the robotic assistance and facilitate seamless operation. To bridge the gap between the position constraints and the AAN strategy, a sliding manifold was constructed for the constrained human&#8211;robot dynamic system, where RALM was regarded as a weight factor to achieve a human-dominated mode, a robot-dominated mode, and their smooth transition, regarded as a human&#8211;robot shared mode. The stability of the closed-loop system was guaranteed by using the Lyapunov theory, and the proposed controller was verified by several physical experiments on a knee exoskeleton driven by pneumatic muscles."/></item><item><title text="Impedance Circle Modeling and Dynamic Characteristics Analysis of Contactless Energy Transfer System Under Load Variations in Rotary Ultrasonic Machining"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10130770"/><description text="In rotary ultrasonic machining, contactless energy transfer (CET) is developed to transmit energy to the transducer at the series resonant frequency or resonant frequency of the transducer.

Efficient PD detection is the significant foundation of electrical system maintenance. This article proposes a transformer-based multilevel filtering (TBMF) framework for PD detection. It creates the multilevel filtering mechanism to be robust to large-scale industrial measurements contaminated with a variety of background noises and plenty of invalid information. The primary filtering innovatively creates the principle of possible PD measurements to replace feature extraction and reduce manual intervention. For the first time, multiple transformer-based algorithms are introduced to the PD detection field to process the possible PD measurements without relying on the sequence order. The secondary filtering then refines the segmentation-level results from the primary filtering and outputs the overall detection results. Multiple numerical algorithms, artificial intelligence models, and intelligent metaheuristic optimization have been adopted as methodologies of the secondary filtering. The TBMF framework is experimentally verified by extensive field trial data of medium-voltage overhead power lines. Its detection accuracy reaches 96.1$\%$, which outperforms other techniques in the literature. It provides an economic and complete PD detection solution to maintain the economical and safe operation of power systems."/></item><item><title text="FedCAE: A New Federated Learning Framework for Edge-Cloud Collaboration Based Machine Fault Diagnosis"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122855"/><description text="With the coming of the industrial Big Data era, data-driven fault diagnosis models emerge recently and show potential results in many studies. However, it is impractical to collect massive high-quality data in actual industrial applications, which strongly reduces the performance of fault diagnosis models. Therefore, multiple data owners are motivated to share their own data for training a brilliant model with the aggregated dataset. Notwithstanding, it is unrealistic to share data due to the potential conflict of interest. For addressing the issue of data island, a new federated framework namely FedCAE is proposed for fault diagnosis. In this framework, each client is equipped with a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) trained by its corresponding local data. Then, all CAEs are uploaded to a server and aggregated to a global CAE according to an adaptive weighted selection mechanism. Afterwards, the global CAE is downloaded to all clients for extracting low-level features from local datasets by its encoder and uploading these features to train a global fault diagnosis classifier in the server. At last, the classifier is downloaded to all clients for completing their own diagnosis tasks. Experiment results on two bearing datasets suggest FedCAE offers a promising solution on confidential decentralized learning."/></item><item><title text="Adaptive Local Flaw Detection Based on Magnetic Flux Leakage Images With a Noise Distortion Effect for Steel Wire Ropes"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122866"/><description text="A steel wire rope (SWR) is widely used in industrial scenarios because of its high strength and toughness. To avoid accidents that local flaws (LFs) can cause, SWRs should be inspected regularly. Magnetic flux leakage (MFL) image detection, which is a common SWR inspection method, is inevitably influenced by shaking noise and strand noise. Although noise-reduction methods for these two types of noise have been proposed, the phenomenon of noise distortion has not received enough attention. In this article, we investigate the noise distortion phenomenon on the MFL image and finds that the distorted noise severely affects the performance of existing noise-feature-oriented denoising methods. To solve this problem, we adopt a target-feature-oriented (TFO) denoising method. Specifically, the removal of noise is avoided; instead, an LF-enhancement-based denoising process is proposed. Moreover, to localize LFs in denoised images, a three-stage adaptive localization method mainly based on disjoint region analysis is proposed. The experimental results show that the proposed TFO denoising method significantly improves the denoising performance for images that distorted noise influences. In addition, the proposed adaptive localization method improves the intelligence of the localization process and has better localization performance for images with distorted noise."/></item><item><title text="Lightweight AC Arc Fault Detection Method by Integration of Event-Based Load Classification"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10130787"/><description text="As the main cause of electrical fires, arc fault detection attracts lots of attention in recent years. However, with the growing complexity of electric loads, arc fault detection becomes more difficult.

Then, arc detection method is developed for each load category, which is achieved through sequential forward floating selection. Its performance is validated by the experiment data and comparison with other reported methods. Meanwhile, the selection of classifiers, sampling rate, and sampling periods for arc fault detection are also discussed in detail. The results show that the proposed method not only achieves a high fault detection performance but also keeps a relatively low sampling rate and short sampling period.

Conventional subspace methods, such as multiple signal classification (MUSIC) identify parameters containing frequency and direction of arrival by calculating pseudospectra without physical amplitudes. However, the real value of amplitude plays a significant role in fault diagnosis and condition monitoring. Additionally, due to hardware limitations and increased frequency, uniform (Nyquist) sampling becomes challenging. Nonuniform sampling, an alternative to high-rate sampling is common in practice. Consequently, nonuniform (sub-Nyquist) signal processing methods are urgently required. In this article, a generalized subspace method (GSM) is proposed to bridge the pseudospectrum with the real spectrum. The proposed method is a supplement to the existing subspace methods and is applicable to both uniform and nonuniform sampling. In the GSM, the Fourier coefficient of the autocorrelation function is derived by signal subspace from the perspective of basis matching. Then, an alias-free real power spectrum is obtained by combining the power spectrum reconstructed by GSM with the classical pseudospectrum. Finally, simulation and experiment demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in power spectrum reconstruction. Even under the dual influence of undersampled and nonuniform, the proposed method is still effective."/></item><item><title text="Time&#8211;Frequency-Multisqueezing Transform"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10138769"/><description text="In the real world, most signals encountered are nonstationary. It is essential to extract a time&#8211;frequency (TF) characteristics in such signals for the accurate description. Two parameters are usually applied to quantify the TF characteristics of a nonstationary signal, i.e., instantaneous frequency (IF) and group delay (GD). A postprocessing strategy was adopted by two recently developed techniques, the synchrosqueezing transform (SST) and the time-reassigned SST to accurately capture the change rules of IF and GD, respectively. However, due to the diversity of modes in complex nonstationary signals, no existing technique has been used to effectively estimate both IF and GD simultaneously. To solve this problem, in this article, a postprocessing analysis technique termed as TF-multisqueezing transform is proposed, where a so-called chirp rate discrimination criterion is established by considering the Gaussian window in the short-time Fourier transform. The proposed method can accurately categorize nonstationary signals containing harmonic- and impulsive-like components to achieve a concurrent description and ensure the recovery of original signals. The proposed method is validated by numerical simulation and real signal analyses."/></item><item><title text="Online Magneto-Thermal Coupled Model of PMECCs Using Measured Boundaries"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122876"/><description text="Online modeling of the magneto-thermal coupled field (MCF) in permanent-magnet eddy-current couplings (PMECCs) has long been challenging since it exists in the copper layer and cannot be directly measured. This article proposes an online magneto-thermal coupled model (OMCM) to reconstruct the MCF using measured boundaries. The magnetic field (MF), eddy-current field (ECF), and temperature field (TF) in the MCF are coupled in an identical space-time united discretization system. Virtual boundary nodes are added to the system, which can adapt to different boundary conditions in electromagnetic and thermal analysis. The measured data of single-point sensors are spanned to continuous boundary conditions. An approximate solution of the MCF is derived based on the measured boundaries and the general solutions of Laplace's equation and Poisson's equation in magneto-thermal analysis. The three-dimensional distribution of the MF, ECF, and TF at each spatial node and time segment can be simultaneously calculated in matrix form by the OMCM. Furthermore, the output torque is estimated and compared with the conventional methods. A verification process is carried out to assess the reconstructed results, showing that the OMCM can yield results close to the verification sensors for various slips and air gaps."/></item><item><title text="Reinforcement Learning-Based Automation of Time-Frequency Domain Reflectometry"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10124845"/><description text="Advanced reflectometry, which can be used to estimate the location of defects in electrical cables with high accuracy, has undergone continuous development based on advanced signal processing techniques.

Therefore, this article proposes a real-time fault diagnosis method based on time series feature pattern recognition of signals in TCU. First, the time series pattern of GSOC caused by different fault sources is established. Second, the feature extraction method of time series pattern is carried out based on the fusion of engineering knowledge, variational mode decomposition and signal selection. Thirdly, the time series feature patterns of GSOC are identified to determine the most likely fault type of GSOC by Gaussians mixture model-Hidden Markov model.

The previous BTP multistep prediction model only extracts spatial features in the high-level layers, leaving the spatial features in the low-level layers not learned. Specifically, the previous model only considers the relationships between the process variables and BTP, ignoring the spatial coupling relations among process variables. Further, the existing loss function is mainly based on Euclidean distance, which cannot learn dynamic information of multistep prediction sequence. To tackle these problems, in this article, we propose a 3-D convolution-based BTP multistep prediction model to simultaneously capture spatial&#8211;temporal features. First, the 3-D convolution is employed to capture the spatial&#8211;temporal features from low-level to high-level layers at the same time.

With the development of advanced forecast technology, the valuable reference of massive forecast data accumulated by the prediction platform in scenario generation is ignored. To this end, we propose a new paradigm based on scenario generation for energy storage planning considering source-load uncertainties. First, a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) is constructed under weakly supervised learning. The network can extract the prediction errors between predicted data and measured data to generate source-load profiles. The loss function of the network is redesigned to adapt to the data generation task. To match the planning process, scenario generation and reduction algorithms are embedded in the GAN. Then, an energy storage sizing model considering battery health constraints is established. Case studies show that the proposed method can accurately portray the local fluctuation characteristics of source-load power and properly reduce conservatism compared with the model-driven method."/></item><item><title text="Optimization of Communication Network for Distributed Control of Wind Farm Equipped With Energy Storages"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10093063"/><description text="Consensus based distributed control schemes have been widely applied to different operation scenarios of wind farms (WFs).

This paper proposes an optimal design method of the WF communication network for the consensus based re/active power regulation control of the WF, in which each individual wind turbine (WT) is equipped with an energy storage (ES) unit. Firstly, the basic model of the WT equipped with ES is presented, and the consensus based control scheme of the power regulation is described. Secondly, the optimization model for the communication network is constructed, so as to speed up the convergence rate, improve the communication survivability and reduce the communication links in the control. Thirdly, this paper proposes a bi-level alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based solving framework, which decomposes the optimization into sub-problems. Finally, the performances of the control using the designed optimal communication network are tested and compared with other networks in the control, and the results verify the superiority of the proposed method."/></item><item><title text="Parameter Optimization for Var Planning of Systems With High Penetration of Wind Power: An Adaptive Equivalent Reduction Method"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10107491"/><description text="Voltage-related issues such as dramatic voltage fluctuation, lack of Var reserves, become more prominent in high wind power penetration (HWPP) system, leading to increasing of large-scale cascading trip risks within 100&#8211;200 ms. During the cascading process, fast dynamic Var support, which is strongly related to internal parameters of Var devices, is quite crucial for HWPP system security. If device parameters optimization is also considered in the Var planning, it will be more promising to achieve less investment cost and guarantee transient security for HWPP system. However, the complex control elements and numerous internal parameters optimization cause a huge computational burden of planning issues. Therefore, this paper proposes an adaptively parameter order equivalent reduced optimization (APO-ERO) approach to efficiently and accurately solve the Var planning problem with parameter allocation. First, the original high-order Var device model is adaptively reduced to an optimal low-order model that minimizes the reduced order error. Next, an equivalent low-order optimization model in the upper layer and an inverse mapping parameter allocation model in the lower layer are established to relieve the computational burden. Finally, the two different test systems with HWPP verify that the proposed method can improve computational efficiency on the premise of guaranteeing accuracy."/></item><item><title text="Optimal Transmission Switching With Uncertainties From Both Renewable Energy and N-K Contingencies"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10129825"/><description text="This article focuses on the $N-k$ security-constrained optimal transmission switching (OTS) problem for variable renewable energy (VRE) penetrated power grids. A new three-stage stochastic and distributionally robust OTS model is proposed. The first stage has the primary purpose to schedule the power generation and network topology based on the forecast of VRE. The second stage controls the power generation and voltage magnitudes of voltage-controlled buses in response to VRE uncertainty, and the third stage reacts to $N\!-\!k$ contingencies additionally by line switching and load shedding. The VRE and $N\!-\!k$ contingencies, considering different availability of their probability distributions, are tackled by stochastic and distributionally robust optimization, respectively. By adopting stage-wise realization of uncertainties in VRE and contingencies, the associated corrective controls with different mechanisms can be handled separately and properly, which makes the proposed OTS model more realistic than existing two-stage ones. For solving the proposed OTS model, its tractable reformulation is derived, and a solution approach that combines the nested column-and-constraint generation algorithm and Dantzig&#8211;Wolfe procedure is developed. Finally, case studies include a simple IEEE network for illustrative purposes and then real system networks to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach."/></item><item><title text="Solar-Mixer: An Efficient End-to-End Model for Long-Sequence Photovoltaic Power Generation Time Series Forecasting"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10104151"/><description text="The expansion of photovoltaic power generation makes photovoltaic power forecasting an essential requirement. With the development of deep learning, more accurate predictions have become possible. This paper proposes an efficient end-to-end model for solar power generation that allows for long-sequence time series forecasting. Two modules comprise the forecasting model: the anomaly detection module and the forecasting module. Singular values are detected and corrected by the anomaly detection module. And in the forecasting module, the series is first divided into different intervals. After that, the divided data is passed through a decomposition module embedded in the neural network, and each interval is encoded as high-dimension vectors. These vectors are fed into the mixing layer, which is used to learn the relationship between intervals and channels after the encoding process. Every mixing layer comprises two different layers: the channel-mixing layer allows communication between different channels, and the interval-mixing layer allows communication between different intervals. This neural network is purely dependent on the multilayer perceptron, resulting in a network with low system latency and low training cost. The experiments results not only show the model proposed in this paper can make accurate long-sequence time series forecasts for photovoltaic power generation at three sites but also show that the model can defeat the state-of-the-art model in long-sequence photovoltaic power generation time series forecasting work."/></item><item><title text="Energy Management in Integrated Energy System Using Energy&#8211;Carbon Integrated Pricing Method"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10184030"/><description text="The interdependence of different energy forms and flexible energy interaction among multiagents in an integrated energy system (IES) are significant for reducing carbon emissions.

Herein, inevitable water and power interactions unlock significant benefits for the integrated energy network in the form of water-energy nexus models. In this work, a holistic water-energy nexus model is developed for the operation of cooperative prosumers equipped with 100% renewables in the modern interconnected energy structure. The model is empowered by the transactive energy technology to allow prosumers to cooperatively share multi-energy with each other for reliably serving power and water in a deregulated environment. The proposed model also benefits from hydrogen-based energy conversion units that not only improve the flexibility of prosumers in reliable energy supply but also increase their economic achievements by selling the produced gas to the gas grid. As prosumers are targeted for fully clean energy production, their contributions in the energy interactions are under the high level of risks associated with renewables&#8217; intermittences. Due to this, a risk-averse stochastic operational model is proposed that enables the decision-maker to adopt optimal strategies against the uncertain fluctuations in the system. The effectiveness of the proposed model is examined considering prosumers located in Chicago, USA. According to the obtained results, the model can affordably facilitate the realization of Chicago's plans for achieving the goal of equipping with 100% renewable energy sources for a fully clean multi-energy generation."/></item><item><title text="Dynamic Coupling Analysis and Small-Signal Stability for Multi-Parallel PLL-Synchronous VSC-Based Renewable Energy Plants During Asymmetrical LVRT"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10109833"/><description text="Studying the small-signal stability for multi-parallel voltage source converter (VSC)-based renewable energy plants (REPs) during the fault steady-state of low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) in weak grid is significant for designing a stabilized controller to ensure and improve success of LVRT. Different from the independent grid-connected system and symmetric condition, in the asymmetrical fault steady-state, there are more complicated dynamic interactions between the positive-sequence (PS) and negative-sequence (NS) systems as well as between the REPs in multi-fed grid-connected system. This study unveils the dynamic coupling mechanism between REPs by deduced small-signal model during asymmetric LVRT, which provides a solid foundation for designing the novel stabilized controllers. The influence of this dynamic coupling effect between REPs on the system's small-signal stability in the asymmetrical fault steady-state is analyzed. It's shown that the dynamic coupling between REPs will be aggravated by the deteriorating asymmetrical fault, and it will cause the existing stabilized controller's performance decreasing or even invalid. Combining with small-signal stability analysis, the asymmetric fault degree's influencing mechanism on small-signal stability of multi-fed grid-connected system is revealed from the perspective of self-damping and mutual damping. Finally, simulations and experiments are carried out to validate analysis results."/></item><item><title text="Implications of Future Price Trends and Interannual Resource Uncertainty on Firm Solar Power Delivery With Photovoltaic Overbuilding and Battery Storage"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10121691"/><description text="Generation from solar is inherently variable. Through a strategic combination of excessive capacity expansion (i.e., overbuilding) and battery storage, the variable solar generation can be cost-effectively firmed up, in that, it is able to meet the required generation target with absolute certainty. Firming up solar generation implies additional cost, which can be quantified through the firm kWh premium. This paper proposes a new model for the optimization of firm kWh premium through either a mixed-integer linear program or a bilinear program, depending on whether a generic or detailed battery model is used. The (bi)linear-program formulation greatly reduces the complexity of the original iterative approach. Additionally, since the firm kWh premium is a function of photovoltaic and battery prices, we show how future price change can affect the economics of firm power delivery and whether true grid parity can be eventually achieved. Lastly, the sensitivity of the firm kWh premium to photovoltaic modeling uncertainty and inter-annual solar resource uncertainty is analyzed."/></item><item><title text="Fast Frequency Regulation From a Wind Farm-BESS Unit by Model Predictive Control: Method and Hardware-in-the-Loop Validation"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10094032"/><description text="The integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) into the power system requires an upgrade of the adopted management and control solutions.

The control is based on Model Predictive Control technique, whereas the regulation service is defined according to the technical requirements of the Italian Transmission System Operator (TSO). The approach is also tested via Hardware-In-the-Loop simulations. More specifically, tests are carried out by implementing the control algorithm on a Raspberry Pi board that communicates with a real BESS and with a real-time simulator implementing a benchmark power system.

Photovoltaic systems with different inverters, control strategies and fault-ride-through dynamics; grid connection points with varying electrical distances and voltage dynamics were unified in the developed model by ensuring that the power characteristics before and after aggregation were equivalent. The results of this study imply that the DPV systems in an area differ substantially in terms of output dynamics, and these dynamic features should be quantified during equivalent modeling. The proposed method obtained superior results to relevant previous methods that do not consider the fault ride throughs and voltage dynamics."/></item><item><title text="A New Multi-Resolution Closed-Loop Wind Power Forecasting Method"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10077762"/><description text="By the increasing number and size of wind farms, wind generation forecasting has become a basic requirement for their connection to the power grid; otherwise, power system operators and electricity market participants cannot make the right decisions and may incur significant costs and penalties. In this paper, a new multi-resolution closed-loop wind power forecasting method with a difference signal feedback loop is proposed. Within the proposed method, wind power is initially predicted in two different resolutions (such as with hourly and sub-hourly time steps) by two low/high-resolution pre-predictors and then the inconsistency between their predictions is measured through the difference signal. The generated difference signal is used as a guide for the two low/high-resolution wind power post-predictors. If their wind power forecasts are inconsistent, the difference signal is updated and used as the feedback for the low/high-resolution post-predictors. This closed-loop forecasting-updating process is iterated until the post-predictors reach consistent results. To evaluate the performance of the proposed multi-resolution closed-loop method, it is tested on two different real-world wind farms and the results are compared with the results of several other widely used/recently published wind power forecast methods using various error metrics and different forecast horizons."/></item><item><title text="Risk-Aware Operating Regions for PV-Rich Distribution Networks Considering Irradiance Variability"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10141679"/><description text="This article proposes a framework to identify, visualize, and quantify risk of potential over/under voltage due to annual energy consumption and PV generation growth.

(ii) Variable solar irradiance profiles that allow a broader range of PV generation scenarios for sunny, overcast, and cloudy days. The proposed framework uses multivariate-$t$ copulas to model temporal correlations between random variables to generate synthetic scenarios. A probabilistic power flow is computed using the generated scenarios to define critical static operating regions. Results show that classical approaches may underestimate the maximum PV capacity of distribution networks when local irradiance conditions are not considered. Moreover, it is found that including annual energy consumption growth is critical to establishing realistic PV installation capacity limits.

In this study, a large-scale generalized kernel-based regression model is proposed to solve the above problem. First, a generalized loss function, which can model both symmetric and asymmetric error distributions, is designed for model training. Then, the Nystr&#246;m technique is employed to get the approximate kernel matrix, based on which an eigenvalue-based kernel regression framework is constructed. Next, a large-scale generalized kernel-based regression model is developed with model parameters tuned using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Before WPC modeling, a three-step data processing method based on isolation forest is designed to process missing data, irrational data, and outliers in the collected data. The WPC modeling results on four large-scale wind datasets demonstrate that the proposed model generates accurate WPCs with high efficiency. Furthermore, the effect of turbulence intensity on WPC modeling and the effectiveness of LSGKRM with multivariate inputs are also verified."/></item><item><title text="Uncertainty-Aware Trading of Congestion and Imbalance Mitigation Services for Multi-DSO Local Flexibility Markets"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10070801"/><description text="The design of Local Flexibility Markets (LFMs) for energy and reserve dispatch of Renewable Distributed Energy Resources (RDERs) has recently been a topic of wide research. However, in an scenario with high penetration of RDERs deployed among different Distribution System Operators (DSOs) jurisdictions, further operational requirements concerning congestion and imbalance mitigation services may lay down. In this context, the relationship between capacity and energy products and the uncertainty management scheme becomes essential for procuring of RDERs flexibility. This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware Multi-DSO LFM. This market setting uses flexibility products to mitigate congestions and imbalances among different DSOs. First, capacity products hold back the flexibility of the RDERs in anticipation of contingencies. Then, energy products are activated within each time slot if the event finally occurs. LFM is solved in a coordinated and decentralised fashion using the properties of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), preserving participants' privacy. Uncertainty of RDERs and energy events duration are modelled using chance-constraint linear optimisation.

Control co-design, whereby the device and control design are considered concurrently, has resulted in improved designs in many industries, but remains rare in the wave energy community. In this paper we demonstrate the use of a new open-source code, WecOptTool, for control co-design of wave energy converters, with the aim to make the co-design approach more accessible and accelerate its adoption. Additionally, we highlight the importance of designing a wave energy converter to maximize electrical power, rather than mechanical power, and demonstrate the co-design process while modeling the PTO's components (i.e., drive-train and generator, and their dynamics). We also consider the design and optimization of causal fixed-structure controllers.

Due to their fast response and capability to operate in different loading conditions, they can be used as responsive loads providing support to AC grid during transients. This paper suggests taking one step further and using hydrogen electrolyzers to provide grid-forming services to the grid. As a result, the electrolyzer's role is elevated from supporting the grid (responsive load) to actively participating in forming voltage and frequency of the grid. The grid-forming capability of electrolyzer is linked to its hydrogen production constraints, which can potentially pose limitations on the grid-forming services. Besides the grid-forming mode, two additional operating modes, i.e., DC voltage mode and constant power mode, are proposed to ensure a safe operation of the electrolyzer in case of adversary interaction between grid-forming operation and hydrogen production constraints. This paper also studies the impacts of grid-forming services on the electrolyzer's physical features such as hydrogen stack temperature and efficiency. Comprehensive simulations are conducted on a low-inertia test network whose topology is inspired by a portion of the transmission grid in South Australia to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed concept under various operational conditions of the electrolyzer and upstream AC grid. Moreover, the practical feasibility of the proposed control system is experimentally validated by conducting hardware-in-the-loop tests."/></item><item><title text="Chance-Constrained Joint Dispatch of Generation and Wind Curtailment-Load Shedding Schemes With Large-Scale Wind Power Integration"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10104113"/><description text="Wind curtailment (WC) and load shedding (LS) are indispensable measures to mitigate the operational risk in high-renewable power systems.

While GES can be characterized by different types of uncertainty, the literature mostly focuses on decision-independent uncertainties (DIUs), such as exogenous stochastic disturbances caused by weather conditions. Instead, this manuscript focuses on newly-introduced decision-dependent uncertainties (DDUs) and considers an optimal GES dispatch that accounts for uncertain available state-of-charge (SoC) bounds that are affected by incentive signals and discomfort levels. To incorporate DDUs, we present a novel chance-constrained optimization (CCO) approach for the day-ahead economic dispatch of GES units. Two tractable methods are presented to solve the proposed CCO problem with DDUs: (i) a robust reformulation for general but incomplete distributions of DDUs, and (ii) an iterative algorithm for specific and known distributions of DDUs. Furthermore, reliability indices are introduced to verify the applicability of the proposed approach with respect to the reliability of the response of GES units. Simulation-based analysis shows that the proposed methods yield conservative, but credible, GES dispatch strategies and reduced penalty cost by incorporating DDUs in the constraints and leveraging data-driven parameter identification. This results in improved availability and performance of coordinated GES units."/></item><item><title text="Efficient Partial Shading Detection for Photovoltaic Generation Systems"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10111045"/><description text="Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) is the core technology for harvesting maximum power from Photovoltaic Power Generation Systems (PVGS). Global MPPT (GMPPT) algorithms have been broadly proposed in the past few years for PVGSs under Partial Shading (PS); however, most of these algorithms make the speed of MPPT slower and consequently lead to more tracking losses when there is no PS. Therefore, an efficient PS Detection (PSD) for PVGSs is proposed in the paper. The proposed PSD estimates the solar irradiance and temperature of a PVGS by the characteristic output function and measured voltages and currents. The occurrence of PS can then be detected by the estimated solar irradiance and temperature along with the proposed PS factor. After the PS condition of a PVGS was determined, the appropriate MPPTs can be chosen to track the MPP effectively and efficiently. This can accelerate MPPT performance, reduce tracking time, and improve power generation efficiency. Simulation results show that the detection accuracy of the proposed PSD can exceed 99% under different PS and temperature conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the validity and performance of the proposed PSD for PVGSs."/></item><item><title text="Decentralized Energy Management of Microgrid Based on Blockchain-Empowered Consensus Algorithm With Collusion Prevention"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10075483"/><description text="The concern for privacy and scalability has motivated a paradigm shift to decentralized energy management methods in microgrids. The absence of a central authority brings significant challenges to promote trusted collaboration and avoid collusion. To address these issues, this paper proposes a blockchain-empowered microgrid energy management framework, which adopts a novel consensus-based algorithm with a collusion prevention mechanism. Aiming at social welfare maximization, the energy management problem is formulated into a convex and decomposable form, which can be solved in a decentralized manner. To prevent the collusion between malicious agents, we propose a random information transmission mechanism empowered by the blockchain smart contract to replace the time-invariant communication topology.

Most research on secondary frequency regulation has only focused on realizing steady-state operation objectives, that is, frequency restoration and power sharing. However, improving the dynamic performance of secondary frequency control is of great importance, especially in synchronous distributed energy resources. These synchronous units can introduce undesired oscillation modes, which may cause the instability conditions of MGs. To improve the dynamic performance of islanded MGs, a membership-function (MF) -based control strategy is proposed. The proposed strategy can trade-off between transient frequency regulation and frequency error elimination using the MF values calculated by the time-stamped synchronized measurements of distribution-level phasor measurement units. Besides, considering the time-varying communication delays in secondary frequency control loops, an adaptive delay compensator is proposed. The weights of the proposed compensator are updated by real-time delay measurements to compensate for the phase lag of control signals. Therefore, the adverse effect of communication delays on secondary frequency control is weakened effectively. Numerical simulations on an IEEE 34-bus system and a typical 40-bus islanded MG system demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method in the secondary frequency regulation of islanded MGs."/></item><item><title text="A Risk-Based Planning Approach for Sustainable Distribution Systems Considering EV Charging Stations and Carbon Taxes"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10081007"/><description text="Adopting distributed energy resources (DERs) is the key to a low-carbon future in electrical distribution systems (EDS). However, integrating DERs increases the uncertainties in the distribution system expansion planning (DSEP). Thus, the long-term DSEP faces a planning risk brought by the uncertainty of demand, electric vehicle (EV) demand, renewable production, and energy prices. Therefore, this work proposes a novel model for the multi-period planning of EDSs and DERs considering conditional value at risk (CVaR) to manage fluctuations in generation cost and carbon emissions. The proposed mathematical model aims to minimize the net present cost related to investment, operation, and risk. Unlike previous approaches, uncertain behavior of demand growth per planning period is addressed, and the risk is evaluated from two perspectives: planning costs and carbon taxes. Investments in substations, lines, renewable distributed generation, EV charging stations, and energy storage systems are considered. The uncertainties associated with the variability of renewable generation and demand are modeled through a set of scenarios. Finally, the model was evaluated using the 24 and 54-bus EDS. Thus, the proposal is a flexible tool that can be used for different purposes (e.g., carbon taxes, budget limits)."/></item><item><title text="Integrated Assessment of the Reliability and Frequency Deviation Risks in Power Systems Considering the Frequency Regulation of DFIG-Based Wind Turbines"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10158432"/><description text="Recently, frequency regulation strategies have been widely adopted in the operation and control of doubly fed induction generator-based wind turbines (DFIG-WTs). Thus, wind power, which is becoming an increasingly important energy source, is expected to play a significant role in both power generation and frequency regulation in modern power systems. Under such circumstances, maintaining the reliability and frequency of power systems at a designated level may be more challenging due to inherent uncertainties in wind power generation. In this article, the integrated assessment of the reliability and frequency deviation risks of power systems with a high penetration level of wind power is investigated. A multi-time scale analytical framework is proposed to calculate the integrated reliability and frequency deviation indices. The coupling between the reliability and frequency deviation is further addressed by developing a novel frequency-sensitive reliability model of the electric generator. Frequency deviations under supply/demand fluctuations and device failures are analyzed, and the power system frequency regulation process is modeled with the fuzzy adaptive virtual inertial response of DFIG-WTs and energy storage system (ESS). Furthermore, IEEE-RTS79 is used to verify the validity of the proposed model and solution method."/></item><item><title text="Active Power Control of Wind Turbine Generators Considering Equilibrium Point Optimization Under Passive Rotor Speed Variation Mode"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10185144"/><description text="With the deepening penetration of wind generation in power systems, it is urgent that wind turbine generators (WTG) can have active power control (APC) capabilities, i.e., WTG can adjust active power output according to the power command from wind farms. The improvement of APC performance is closely related to the rotor speed variation (RSV) mode and the optimal setting of stable equilibrium points (SEP). Compared with the active RSV with the same SEP, the passive RSV no longer focuses on the rotor speed tracking and has lower power response discrepancy and drive-train loads. However, limited by the realization principle, APC based on passive RSV overlooks the optimization and setting of SEP, which makes the rotor speed of WTG easily reach the bound of the variable-speed range and leads to speed overshoot and power drops. Hence, this paper proposes an APC method with additional pitch angle compensation. Consequently, WTG under passive RSV has the ability of optimizing and setting SEP. On this basis, the compensation pitch angle is dynamically optimized according to the predicted wind speed. The experimental results show that the proposed strategy can effectively reduce speed overshoot and power drops while taking full advantages of passive RSV."/></item><item><title text="Multi-Timescale Coordinated Control With Optimal Network Reconfiguration Using Battery Storage System in Smart Distribution Grids"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10083248"/><description text="This paper focuses on the global optimality of the relaxed solutions of a multi-timescale co-optimization problem.

The optimal switching plan is computed on a daily basis. The proposed multi-timescale co-optimization model is formulated as a mixed-integer second-order cone program to achieve global optimum. The objective is to reduce power losses and improve load balancing among feeders. The proposed co-optimization framework satisfies the grid security constraints by employing the accurate DistFlow branch equations and exact linearization of the OLTC model. To ensure radiality, the limitation of widely used spanning tree constraints is addressed by combining them with single-commodity flow constraints.

This article proposes the conservative sparse neural network (CSNN) embedded frequency-constrained unit commitment (FCUC) with converter-based DERs, including the learning and optimization stages. In the learning stage, it samples the inertia parameters, calculates the corresponding frequency, and characterizes the stability region of the sampled parameters using the convex hulls to ensure stability and avoid extrapolation. For conservativeness, the positive prediction error penalty is added to the loss function to prevent possible frequency requirement violation. For the sparsity, the NN topology pruning is employed to eliminate unnecessary connections for solving acceleration. In the optimization stage, the trained CSNN is transformed into mixed-integer linear constraints using the big-M method and then incorporated to establish the data-enhanced model. The case study verifies 1) the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of high accuracy, fewer parameters, and significant solving acceleration; 2) the stable system operation against frequency violation under contingency."/></item><item><title text="Analysis of Subsynchronous Oscillation Caused by Multiple VSCs With Different Dynamics Under Strong Grid Connections"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10103179"/><description text="It is known that multiple voltage source converters (VSCs) with similar dynamics may induce subsynchronous oscillations (SSOs), particularly under weak grid connections. This study investigated the small-signal stability of multiple VSCs with different dynamics, utilizing both the model with default parameters and the model that accounts for deviations in VSC dynamics. The results indicates that the DC voltage control loops of the VSCs may cause growing SSOs even under strong grid connections. The direction and amplitude of the deviations are affected by the differences between the actual and default parameters. The impact of deviations is the largest when all the parameters are larger or smaller than the default parameters. However, the impact is reduced when some of the parameters are larger and others are smaller than the default parameters. On this basis, two reduced-order stability analysis methods were proposed to quickly and accurately assess the SSO risk in the power system.

The continuous increase in the penetration rate of uncertain PV power generation requires it to actively participate in the frequency and voltage regulation of weak microgrid systems. Finite control set-model predictive control (FCS-MPC) for voltage source converter (VSC) shows remarkable advantages in fast dynamic response and robustness compared with traditional cascaded linear control methods. However, the traditional FCS-MPC method for VSC without considering the DC-link voltage dynamics of the PV generators will face oscillations of power and frequency in PV-based microgrids. In this paper, to suppress the low-frequency oscillation issue caused by PV generations, an improved FCS-MPC (I-FCS-MPC) strategy considering the DC-link dynamics of PV generation is proposed, in which the AC side and DC side of the VSC are comprehensively considered to enhance the dynamic performance of the PV-based microgrids. Moreover, a DC-link voltage regulation mechanism is introduced, enabling the PV generators to operate in the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) mode.

However, unbalanced faults or voltage dips may stimulate synchronverters to generate excessive currents and cause instantaneous active and reactive power oscillations at twice the grid's fundamental frequency. Therefore, this article proposes three fault ride-through (FRT) strategies to remedy these power oscillations and the unlimited current generation during unbalanced faults. The first strategy is based on an instantaneous active and reactive control that significantly reduces power oscillations. The second strategy relies on an average active and reactive control that ensures the delivery of average active and reactive power and maintains sinusoidal phase currents. Finally, the third FRT strategy employs a comprehensive instantaneous active and reactive control to eliminate power oscillations and maintain sinusoidal currents simultaneously. The proposed FRT strategies are equipped with a power management controller that delivers the required active and reactive power during normal operation and limits the inverter's phase currents during faults. Further, the proposed FRT strategies maintain the intrinsic features of synchronverters and ensure seamless activation of the proposed FRT strategies. Comparative results confirm the efficacy of the proposed strategies to reduce power oscillations, limit current generation, maintain synchronverters&#8217; intrinsic features, and comply with grid codes."/></item><item><title text="Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Control of a Hydrostatic Wind Turbine-Based Farm"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10109125"/><description text="This paper leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to develop an efficient control system for a wind farm comprising a new type of wind turbines with hydrostatic transmission.

The infinite Gaussian mixture model is adopted to better model the asymmetric and heterogeneous conditional distribution of the wind power given the wind speed. The conditional variational autoencoder is composed of an encoder and a decoder network. The encoder infers the state of the latent random variable given the wind speed and wind power, while the decoder learns the observational conditional distribution of the wind power given the wind speed and latent variable. With a well-trained conditional variational autoencoder, the conditional probability density function of the wind power could be estimated through the decoder network by sampling the latent random variable from its prior distribution. Wind turbine supervisory control and data acquisition datasets are used in experiments to validate advantages of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other benchmarking deterministic and probabilistic wind power curve models with the lower continuous ranked probability score and more reliable and sharper prediction intervals.

The PSSR is irrelevant to operation states and its boundaries can be approximated by hyperplanes (HPs). Benefit from these, the PSSR can dramatically simplify complicated optimal scheduling problems, such as deliverable energy flexibility scheduling. However, calculating the PSSR boundaries corresponding to all the power flow security constraints indiscriminately will theoretically produce lots of HPs to bound the whole PSSR and thus make solving of the PSSR-based optimal scheduling challenging. In fact, the whole PSSR is the intersection of the regions bounded by all the HPs within practical power injection ranges, and only a few HPs, called the critical boundary hyperplanes (CHPs), can bound it. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the CHPs before applying them to the optimal scheduling as power flow security constraints, so as to accelerate the solution.

However, existing approaches are easily caught in a quandary among accuracy, efficiency, and scope of applicability. This paper presents a dual-level surrogate structure (DLSS) for dealing with the IPEF calculation of an integrated energy system (IES) in an accurate and efficient manner. The structure accommodates electricity, heat, and gas, attaining a high-level balance among precision, speed, and range of applicability. At the lower level of DLSS, a sparse polynomial chaos expansion (sPCE) model is employed to directly map random input variables to output boundary values, saving massive repetition of deterministic calculation. At the upper level of DLSS, a heterogeneous-learning-based multiple energy flow (HL-MEF) model is proposed to accelerate the indispensable deterministic MEF calculation for online sampling, thereby easing the computational burden of sPCE training. Finally, numerical results on a real-world electricity-heat-gas system demonstrate that the proposed DLSS can solve the IPEF problem at nearly 400 times the speed of the standard double-layer Monte Carlo simulation (DLMCS) with guaranteed accuracy."/></item><item><title text="Collaborative Scheduling of Port Integrated Energy and Container Logistics Considering Electric and Hydrogen-Powered Transport"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10100958"/><description text="To improve energy efficiency and reduce pollution emissions of ports with electricity and hydrogen substitution, this paper proposes a collaborative scheduling method of port integrated energy and container logistics considering electric and hydrogen-powered transport.

Moreover, to simplify the complexity of PCLS scheduling which involves the allocation and operation of each type of container logistics equipment, an assembly line of port container logistics (ALPCL) model based on flexible job-shop scheduling (FJSS) is further constructed. Then, a distributed algorithm based on the Benders decomposition (BD) embedded with an improved non-dominated sorting genetic (INSGA-II) is designed to realize optimal dispatch with limited data exchange and great solution efficiency.

To this end, we first develop a novel TOU and DC-aware energy scheduling (TDAS) algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (RL). It learns the policy for a single EMS which optimally determines the amount of on-grid energy consumption considering its stored energy, system uncertainties, and both tariffs without requiring any a priori information about the uncertainties. Based on the TDAS algorithm, we develop a cooperative multi-residential TDAS (Co-TDAS) algorithm using federated RL. In the algorithm, each EMS cooperatively learns a central policy that can be used for any EMS with diverse environments and utilizes it distributedly. Through simulations with real datasets, we demonstrate that our TDAS algorithm achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines with perfect a priori information. Moreover, it outperforms the baselines even with small errors on the information. We also show that the Co-TDAS algorithm learns the policy that can be utilized in different EMSs, even in newly arrived ones, and accelerates its learning speed via cooperative learning."/></item><item><title text="Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Explainable Pricing Policy for Virtual Storage Rental Service"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10068282"/><description text="The shared community energy storage system (CESS) can reduce energy storage costs by exploiting the complementarity of end-users and economies of scale.

It explores a novel path to learn price elasticity by using graph deep learning, and can accurately assess consumers&#8217; energy consumption behaviors under different prices. Then, to avoid unfair evaluation of demand response, two indexes are proposed as auxiliary measures to assess energy consumption behavior learning models. At last, a customized dynamic pricing model based on the temporal price elasticity perceptron model is proposed. It can develop consumer&#8217;s time-varying demand response potential. This potential is first defined in this paper to measure what potentials of shifting/curtailing energy during a period a consumer has.

However, there lacks of a theory to quantify the data sufficiency for the energy-storage control problem. Meanwhile, demand data samples include privacy information while the storage managers have to procure the data from data owners. Thus, it is necessary to determine the relationship between the data size and the storage-control performance. In addition, a growing number of studies have proposed many storage-control policies. However, we are unknown how to theoretically verify their data-use efficiency. Here, we develop the sample complexity theory of storage-control problem, which enables us to theoretically measure the data-use efficiency of the control strategy and assess the data value. We proposed the sample-based dynamic programming (SDP) algorithm that is both cost-minimization and data-use efficient.

This paper proposes a privacy-preserving STLF framework for residential energy users. The framework enables users to collaboratively train an STLF model without exchanging their load data. The system works in two stages: (i) a federated user clustering method is developed to divide the users into multiple clusters based on load pattern similarity. Instead of aggregating the users&#8217; data to do clustering, the developed method determines the user clusters in a distributed manner. (ii) after the user clustering stage, a hierarchically federated STLF model training is developed, which applies federated learning principles to facilitate intra- and inter-user cluster model training. In the process, the individual users also do not expose their load data. Further, an asynchronous communication mechanism is designed and integrated into the framework, making it high fault-tolerant and adaptable to the residential environment with communication uncertainties. Comprehensive experiments based on a real Australian load dataset are conducted to validate the system. The simulation results show that the proposed framework can effectively train the load forecasting model with a fast coverage rate and achieve up to 37.25% prediction accuracy improvement (in terms of the Mean Absolute Percentage Error metric) compared with the other benchmark methods."/></item><item><title text="Reliant Monotonic Charging Controllers for Parallel-Connected Battery Storage Units to Reduce PV Power Ramp Rate and Battery Aging"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10057008"/><description text="The inherited intermittency of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems impacts the power grid by creating power fluctuations, which are mitigated by the integration of battery energy storage systems (BESS) augmented with a smoothing controller. However, the conventional charging and discharging schemes result in a repetitive and chaotic state of charge (SOC) which might degrade the BESS performance. This paper proposes a reliant monotonic charging/discharging controller (RMCC) to reduce battery degradation while maintaining smoothing efficiency. In this configuration, two battery units operate concurrently, one charging, and the other discharging, which helps to reduce battery cycles and extend BESS lifetime. In addition, the paper presents a smart RMCC (S-RMCC) controller to control the operation of a BESS made up of an even number of battery units greater than two. The controller forecasts the short-term irradiance and identifies the existence of power ramps using a ramp event detector. Hence, the forecasted irradiance is then utilized to obtain the PV output power and to compute the forecasted needed charging and discharging energy to compensate for PV power intermittency. These estimates are then compared to the remaining energy of battery units to determine whether to work with the entire BESS system or a subset of units. The proposed controllers were tested for battery degradation, ramp rate reduction, and power smoothing efficiency. The battery degradation is significantly minimal when using RMCC-operated units, accounting for 0.1877% and 0.1918%, as compared to 9.1514% when using a single BESS for smoothing."/></item><item><title text="Energy Optimization Management Strategy for DC Nano-Grid Cluster With High Comprehensive Energy Efficiency"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10058743"/><description text="Nano-grid (NG) clusters (NGCs) have the potential to serve as an essential configuration for future low-voltage distribution networks.

However, these inverters exhibit certain stability issues when integrated in low-strength areas of the grid. To enhance the grid strength in a GFLI-dominant area, virtual synchronous generators (VSGs) can be installed. If the VSG and the GFLI are investigated as a paralleled system, despite the benefits brought by the VSG, in some cases, the transient angle instability process, caused by a voltage sag, is accelerated, making the whole system more prone to instability. Therefore, this paper aims to study the transient angle stability of a paralleled VSG-GFLI system via investigating the voltage at a common bus between the two IBRs. Subsequently, a stable region of the voltage angles of the two IBRs is determined. Based on this stable region, the stability margin of the paralleled system can be determined and used to quantitatively evaluate the system stability. Moreover, an additional control loop is proposed to improve the transient stability of the paralleled system in this paper. The proposed controller can adaptively reduce the power set-point of the VSG to avoid a complete failure of the VSG even when no stable equilibrium point exists during a voltage sag. The stability investigation and performance evaluation of the proposed method are conducted in PSCAD/EMTDC and experimentally validated."/></item><item><title text="Distributed Cooperative Event-Triggered Control of Cyber-Physical AC Microgrids Subject to Denial-of-Service Attacks"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10077801"/><description text="This paper addresses the event-triggered distributed cooperative secure secondary control for islanded cyber-physical inverter-based ac microgrids (MGs) under the energy-limited denial of service (DoS) attacks.

AHO allows converters to operate in either grid-connected and islanded operating modes. However, the application of this control strategy is limited due to the inherent problem in simultaneous controlling active and reactive power output of GFCs. This paper presents a modification in AHO control structure, and adopts a wide-band grid impedance estimation to improve the dispatchability of AHO in grid-connected mode. The impedance estimation algorithm is embedded into the control loop of AHO, and requires only the measurement of the voltages and currents at the point of common coupling. Thus it is cost-effective and practical. The performance of the proposed method is validated in both simple-structure, and large low-voltage benchmark distribution systems, using MATLAB/Simulink software and the real-time Opal-RT platform. The simulation results confirm the high-accuracy of the estimation and the capability of AHO in simultaneously controlling active and reactive power with zero steady-state errors. Additionally, this paper discusses the small-signal stability and Lyapunov large signal stability of the proposed AHO and compares it to existing methods."/></item><item><title text="An Auto-Tuned Robust Dispatch Strategy for Virtual Power Plants to Provide Multi-Stage Real-Time Balancing Service"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10097549"/><description text="To fully exploit the flexible potential of distributed energy resources (DERs) in providing balancing service to the power system, Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) act as control centers to conduct the optimal real-time dispatch of their managed DERs.

The proposed hierarchical model utilizes a reinforcement learning model, deep deterministic policy gradient, in the IHR controller to dispatch DERs and EVs locally, while a central controller ensures the feasibility and deliverability of the dispatched solution. More specifically, the IHR controller determines the energy dispatches and sends the required net active power as well as the upper and lower boundaries of net reactive power of the IHR to the central controller. The central controller performs power flow analysis and adjusts the received net active power and determines the net reactive power dispatch of each IHR. The proposed model is implemented on IEEE 123-bus test power distribution system with different penetration of DERs and EVs. The simulation results showcase the efficacy of the proposed model in capturing the energy flexibility of DERs and EVs to reduce the operation cost of power distribution system. Further, the robustness and computational efficiency of the proposed model compared to optimization model in dispatching DERs and EVs while meeting the power distribution system constraints is highlighted."/></item><item><title text="Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring Method for Multi-Energy Coupling Appliances Considering Spatio-Temporal Coupling"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10054431"/><description text="The multi-energy coupling (MEC) appliances couple electricity, gas, heat, and cold, of which the gas, heat, and cold have long transient processes.

However, existing works still exhibit limitations in terms of trading architecture and pricing schemes. In addition, the existing multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) methods suffer from computational overload caused by the exploration of joint and hybrid action space during centralized training. In this paper, we propose a P2P energy trading paradigm based on hierarchical hybrid MADRL to maximize the trading profits among multiple heterogeneous MGs. First, we design a novel hierarchical structure of the MC agent to model the coupled interaction between flexible demands scheduling and autonomous quotation. Then, a P2P market that employs an improved mid-market rate (IMMR) pricing scheme is proposed to incentivize participation in local trading. Furthermore, to handle hybrid discrete-continuous action space and reduce computational complexity, we propose a hierarchical hybrid multi-agent double deep Q-network and deep deterministic policy gradient (hh-MADDQN-DDPG) algorithm to split the optimal policy learning-workload into a sequence of two sub-tasks. The DDQN for flexible demands scheduling and DDPG for energy trading. Numerical results of simulation I demonstrate that our hh-MADDQN-DDPG with IMMR increases 25% of the trading profits averaged over the baselines. Results of simulation II show that our hh-MADDQN-DDPG provides higher profits compared with the existing methods while maintaining better computational performance and scalability."/></item><item><title text="Distributed Coordination of Charging Stations With Shared Energy Storage in a Distribution Network"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10077802"/><description text="Electric vehicle (EV) charging stations have experienced rapid growth, whose impacts on the power grid have become non-negligible. Though charging stations can install energy storage to reduce their impacts on the grid, the conventional &#8220;one charging station, one energy storage&#8221; method may be uneconomical due to the high upfront cost of energy storage. Shared energy storage can be a potential solution. However, effective management of charging stations with shared energy storage in a distribution network is challenging due to the complex coupling, competing interests, and information asymmetry between different agents. To address the aforementioned challenges, this paper first proposes an equilibrium model to characterize the interaction among charging stations, shared energy storage, and the distribution network. We prove that the equilibrium coincides with the centralized optimization result with trading prices equaling the value of dual variables at optimum. Then, to achieve the efficient equilibrium, a distributed coordination mechanism with a prediction and a correction step is developed to guide the behaviors of different agents with proof of convergence. Numerical experiments and comprehensive performance comparisons are conducted to validate the theoretical results and show the advantages of the proposed mechanism."/></item><item><title text="Reliability Assessment of Cyber-Physical Distribution System Using Multi-Dimensional Information Network Model"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10049159"/><description text="In the smart grid era, power distribution system (PDS) has gradually become a cyber-physical system with distinctly different modes of operation and control.

Indeed, NTL could lead to serious damage ranging from massive financial losses to loss of reputation resulting from poor power quality. With advances in metering infrastructure technologies, the availability of user data has fueled the emergence of data-driven methods in NTL detection. Among these methods, deep learning (DL) is an indisputable alternative to conventional human-centric approaches. Typically, modeling based on NTL data is subject to three main challenges, including (i) missing information; (ii) class imbalance; and (iii) data complexity. In this context, this paper contributes to solving these three main problems while paying more attention to data complexity related to cardinality. Accordingly, a multiverse recurrent expansion with multiple repeats (MV-REMR) algorithm is proposed in this paper. MV-REMR is able to provide deeper representations than ordinary DL networks and take advantage of different trained deep network responses to build an efficient model. For MV-REMR efficiency analysis, a realistic NTL dataset is considered. As a result, MV-REMR has shown that it can achieve what is considered excellent feature mapping proven by both scatter visualization and variations in widely used classification metrics. Moreover, MV-REMR shows its ability to marginalize the distance of data classes with superior performance. In addition, thanks to the new mapping scheme, MV-REMR shows its ability to correct outliers resulting from errors in missing values filling techniques. Finally, a comparison with some recent successful works also confirms the superiority of the MV-REMR model."/></item><item><title text="Chaotic Systems-Based Secure Communication Scheme for Detection of Wind Turbines"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10057029"/><description text="With the popularity of the Industrial Internet of Things, there are huge security challenges in the storage and transmission of image information.

The scheme is based on the image diffusion method of chaotic systems. By utilizing the sensitivity of the chaotic systems to the initial conditions and parameters, and using the parameters as the key to realizing the encryption and decryption of the image. Furthermore, a large amount of image information will be acquired in real-time during the inspection process of the fan blades by UAVs. Due to the limited computing and storage resources of UAVs, C-E-D three-layer architecture is adopted, which can effectively offload the complex tasks to the edge and cloud to significantly reduce UAVs latency and energy consumption.

However, in this paper, we show that DEMS is still insecure and in risk of economic loss by proposing and analyzing a novel attack called Collusion Attack between a Storage and a Load (CASL). In CASL, a distributed energy storage device colludes with a load by injecting an abnormal extra power supply to the load in a secret way through using two secret functions. In this way, the colluding pair behaves as normal ones in both computational and communicational viewpoints. We theoretically prove the convergence of DEMS in presence of the attack, and derive an upper bound of the social welfare losses of DEMS caused by CASL. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CASL through simulations."/></item><item><title text="Self-Healing Secure Blockchain Framework in Microgrids"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10061596"/><description text="Blockchain has recently been depicted as a secure protocol for information exchange in cyber-physical microgrids.

To enhance cybersecurity in a not only feasible but also cost-effective manner, this paper proposes a cost-benefit-based cyber-defense strategy for a hybrid AC/DC grid. First, this paper establishes a spatial-temporal dual cyber-attack evaluation model, in which the cyber-attack-induced frequency and voltage deviations are modelled in both a spatially and temporally dual manner. Then, the proposed cost-benefit-based cyber-defense strategy is modelled as a VSC commitment problem to achieve the trade-off between maximizing the cyber-defense benefits and minimizing the cyber-defense costs. The VSC commitment problem is then mathematically convexified into a mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) problem, which could be efficiently solved in an event-triggered manner against unfolding cyber-attack events.

The mechanisms and strategies for detecting and designing LR attacks resulting in overflow on lines have been the focus of different studies. But fewer studies have been done to detect LR attacks that cause cascading failures. This paper presents a mechanism for identifying LR attacks that, besides causing overflow on lines, have the potential to generate cascading failure. A novel LR attack scheme with cascading failure potential is first proposed for this purpose. The detection mechanism has a basic exploitable structure based on analyzing the estimated cyber load data through the energy management system and a deep learning network. The performance evaluation of the detection mechanism is implemented with regard to the IEEE standard 118-bus system. Various attack scenarios under different conditions (topologies, target lines, and attack load level variations  $(\alpha)$ ) are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results clearly show an acceptable level of accuracy for the proposed mechanism, which can distinguish between LR attacks via the overload purpose while also showing the system&#8217;s secure state."/></item><item><title text="An Underestimated Cybersecurity Problem: Quick-Impact Time Synchronization Attacks and a Fast-Triggered Detection Method"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10076910"/><description text="For cybersecurity concerns in smart girds, this paper has focused on the vulnerability analysis and defense technique against the Time Synchronization Attack (TSA).

Intolerable timing errors have been imposed on the server within a few tens of seconds, and it hasn&#8217;t reported any alarms.

False data injection attacks (FDIAs) represent a major type of cyberattacks that cannot be detected by the traditional bad data detection (BDD). The majority of existing researches focus on how to detect FDIAs, while little attention has been paid to obtaining the exact attack locations, which are crucial for deploying countermeasures in time. In this paper, we propose a neural network-based approach for online localizing FDIAs in AC power systems. The approach transforms the multi-dimensional time series measurements to their time-frequency and spectral graph representations, to jointly capture the temporal and spatial correlations in the spectral domain. The spectral decomposition could better characterize the latent properties of measurements, such as auto-correlations of a bus and key dependency between buses, which would be poorly represented in the time domain and vertex domain. Specifically, the proposed approach first adopts the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and a two-channel convolutional neural network (2C-CNN) to model the spectral-temporal correlations. Then the spectral-spatial relationships are modeled with a graph convolutional network (GCN), which combines the nodal admittance matrix and physical property of power systems. The prior physical knowledge further improves our approach&#8217;s interpretability and localization performance. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach with comprehensive case studies on various standard test systems. Numerical results indicate the superiority of our approach over baselines."/></item><item><title text="Destabilizing Attack and Robust Defense for Inverter-Based Microgrids by Adversarial Deep Reinforcement Learning"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10089185"/><description text="The controllers of inverter-based resources (IBRs) can be adjustable by grid operators to facilitate regulation services.

Distribution networks include a large amount of different loads at various aggregation levels, such as individual consumers, low-voltage feeders, and transformer stations. It is impractical to develop individual (or so-called local) forecasting models for each load separately. Additionally, such local models also  $(i)$  (largely) ignore the strong dependencies between different loads that might be present due to their spatial proximity and the characteristics of the distribution network,  $(ii)$  require historical data for each load to be able to make forecasts, and  $(iii)$  are incapable of adjusting to changes in the load behavior without retraining. To address these issues, we propose a global modeling framework for load forecasting in distribution networks that, unlike its local competitors, relies on a single global model to generate forecasts for a large number of loads. The global nature of the framework, significantly reduces the computational burden typically required when training multiple local forecasting models, efficiently exploits the cross-series information shared among different loads, and facilitates forecasts even when historical data for a load is missing or the behavior of a load evolves over time. To further improve on the performance of the proposed framework, an unsupervised localization mechanism and optimal ensemble construction strategy are also proposed to localize/personalize the global forecasting model to different load characteristics. Our experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms naive benchmarks by more than 25% (in terms of Mean Absolute Error) on real-world dataset while exhibiting highly desirable characteristics when compared to the local models that are predominantly used in the literature.

This addresses the privacy and communication concerns as the agents do not need to share local observations, enhances the computational efficiency and scalability as all calculations are conducted at local agents, and does not rely on high-precision system modeling which is required by model-based methods. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed strategy are verified by comparing its performance against multiple benchmarks."/></item><item><title text="Detection of Grid-Signal Distortions Using the Spectral Correlation Function"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10234138"/><description text="This study proposes a novel method for signal detection and feature extraction based on the spectral correlation function, enabling improved characterization of grid-signal distortions.

This leads to the near-field regime where the wavefront is no longer planar but spherical, bringing new opportunities and challenges for communications and positioning. In this article, we improve the near-field positioning technology from the classical spherical wavefront model (SWM) to the more accurate and true electromagnetic propagation model (EPM). A generic near-field positioning model with different observation capabilities for three electric field types (vector, scalar, and overall scalar electric field) is developed based on the complete EPM. For these three observed electric field types, the Cram&#233;r-Rao bound (CRB) is adopted to evaluate the achievable estimation accuracy. The expressions of the CRBs for different electric field observations are derived by combining electromagnetic propagation concepts with estimation theory. Closed-form expressions can be further obtained as the terminal is assumed to be on the central perpendicular line (CPL) of the receiving antenna surface. Moreover, the above discussions are extended to the system with multiple receiving antennas. In this case, the CRBs using various electric field types are derived and the effect of different numbers of receiving antennas is deeply investigated. Numerical results are provided to quantify the CRBs and validate the analytical results. Also, the impact of different system parameters, including electric field type, wavelength, size of the receiving antenna, and number of antennas, is evaluated."/></item><item><title text="A Novel Model for Ship Trajectory Anomaly Detection Based on Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10151936"/><description text="The use of traditional methods in anomaly detection of multi-class ship trajectories showed some limitations in terms of robustness and learning ability of trajectory features. In view of this, an anomaly detection model for ship trajectory data based on Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GMVAE) is proposed in this study using an unsupervised classification method. The proposed model modifies Variational Autoencoder (VAE) by changing the inferential distribution of prior distribution and approximate posterior to the Gaussian mixture model. A high-dimensional hidden space is constructed to learn the features of multi-class trajectory data, and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method is applied to measure the error between the reconstructed trajectory and the original trajectory in order to judge whether the ship trajectory is abnormal. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from the US coastal areas are used to verify the proposed model, and the results are compared with other commonly used models in a manually labeled dataset. The research results indicate that the detection rate of the proposed model is 91.26%, and the false alarm rate is 0.68%, which performs the best. Using the Gaussian mixture model to describe the distribution of hidden space can improve the learning ability of multi-class trajectories of VAE, thus increasing the robustness of the model.

However, extremely dynamic and rapidly changing environmental conditions such as wind prevent UAVs from maintaining a minimum safe distance and cause them to lose Connectivity. Furthermore, the UAVs near the swarm's edge will be more sensitive to connectivity failure. This study presents a thorough examination of the impact of wind on the connectivity of a large-scale swarm. The correlation between the number of UAVs needed to sustain swarm connectivity and characteristics like UAV speed, mass, wind speed, and drag force is also explored. From the results, the number of UAVs that do not maintain the minimum safe distance are seen to increase with increasing absolute value difference between the UAV and wind speed. Moreover, the number of critical UAVs is seen to decrease as the speed of UAVs increases relative to the mean wind speed for the same percentage of change in distance relative to the expected distance to be covered with the flight speed. Extending on these findings, a novel algorithm for updating UAV locations in a swarm in a constantly changing environment is also provided in order to maintain intra-UAV connectivity between individual UAV's. In this regard, a thorough examination of the impact of flying and maneuvering tactics selection is offered. As a result of comprehensive study, the proposed approach for updating UAV locations in uncertain conditions obtained a reduction in average outage probability of around 35%, 10%, and 40% using three distinct approaches, respectively, in contrast to earlier efforts.

In the face of harsh, complex working conditions and multiple unknown disturbances, the difficulty of research is determining how to comprehensively integrate the benefits of various subsystems to improve the stability of dynamics. Based on the dynamic model of the DD-6WS CVC, a coupled active disturbance rejection controller (ADRC) is designed to improve the robustness of path tracking in emergency obstacle avoidance. First, the preview path information is optimized by the tracking differentiator (TD), and then the six-wheel steering control quantity is computed using model predictive control (MPC). Using the extended state observer (ESO), the total lateral disturbance is estimated and compensated. Second, the heading state quantity and disturbance estimation value are incorporated into the nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode control (NFT-SMC) so that the direct yaw moment control (DYC) can achieve yaw stability in real time. Finally, the optimal distribution of six-wheel drive torque is completed. Experiments validate the algorithm's effectiveness and high robustness under multiple coupling disturbance. The results demonstrate that, in comparison to MPC and the linear quadratic regulator (LQR), the proposed algorithm has superior control characteristics and effectively enhances the robustness of the DD-6WS CVC in-phase steering path tracking."/></item><item><title text="Hierarchical Decision-Making Framework for Multiple UCAVs Autonomous Confrontation"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10149438"/><description text="Autonomous decision-making for air confrontation between unmanned combat aerial vehicles remains hard to be designed due to dynamic situations and complex interactions.

However, the privacy issues of these models become a problem. Raw data collected from individual companies could cause business concerns and data privacy issues. In this article, we propose a Federated Learning (FL) based framework for traffic demand prediction (FedTDP), to solve this problem without sacrificing the prediction performance. In our framework, the model can encapsulate the spatial and temporal correlation of traffic demand data via LSTM and GCN respectively. Moreover, by associating FL with the spatio-temporal model, no raw data is uploaded to the centralized server, and only model parameters are required. Furthermore, a Shapley value-based reward mechanism is proposed to evaluate the contribution of ride-sourcing companies and can be used as a means to distribute rewards accordingly. Finally, a real-world case study of Hangzhou City, China, is conducted. More than 16 million real-world ride-sourcing requests collected from 8 ride-sourcing companies are used, covering most of the ride-sourcing travel demand across the city.

Off-road vehicular scenes can be abstracted as multi-agent systems, and trajectory prediction is a critical process for context understanding. Agents compete and cooperate other to pursue their individual targets, which makes trajectories complicated and changeable. Hence, in order to derive precise predictions, it is necessary to reason how agents interact with each other. However, current prediction algorithms lack a unified and appropriate method for spatiotemporal reasoning. Previous methods mainly rely on vehicle-lane constraints to capture features, which is only applicable in structured environments. To address this issue, this article proposes a novel off-road multi-agent trajectory prediction framework called SA-LSTM. This framework comprises situation awareness extraction and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) prediction backbones. Based on the analysis of agents&#8217; movement patterns, we decompose actions into the maintenance of previous movements and the strategy variations in response to environment situations. In situation awareness extraction, risk field and pooling layers are applied to filter interpretable awareness. As for prediction backbones, proper LSTM networks are selected to adapt the task features. In short-term predictions, a residual mechanism is used to preserve physical inertia, while for long-term predictions autoregression process is applied. We also establish a multi-agent dataset based on human-manipulated chase-and-run tasks to train and validate the performance of SA-LSTM. Experiments show that compared with the best baseline model at each prediction length, SA-LSTM reduces the mean absolute error by 7.27%, 32.99%, and 28.07% at the prediction time of 0.6, 3.0, and 6.0 seconds, respectively, proving better prediction accuracy."/></item><item><title text="Perceptual Interaction-Based Path Tracking Control of Autonomous Vehicles Under DoS Attacks: A Reinforcement Learning Approach"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10155261"/><description text="This paper considers the distributed optimal path tracking control problem of autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) with matched uncertainties under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

In considered platoon systems, each vehicle broadcasts its predicted state as beacon information to its neighbouring vehicles through the vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET). To reduce the communication burden in the VANET, each vehicle proactively determines the next sampling time instant by solving the stochastic self-triggered DMPC problem at the sampling time instant. The self-triggered problem is formulated by utilizing local vehicle states and asynchronous beacon information from its neighbours. Consequently, the proposed scheme reduces the communication load dramatically in the VANET while maintaining a satisfactory control performance compared to periodic time-triggered stochastic DMPC. To handle the state coupling between vehicles, e.g., for collision avoidance or communication connectivity purpose, probabilistic coupled state constraints are incorporated into the DMPC problem. Based on the information on stochastic disturbance, the probabilistic coupled state constraints are transformed into deterministic forms using the stochastic tube-based method. Theoretical analysis has shown that closed-loop platooning is quadratically stable at triggering time instants. Numerical examples illustrate the efficacy of the proposed control method in terms of data transmission reduction."/></item><item><title text="Cloud-Based Connected Vehicle Control Under Time-Varying Delay: Stability Analysis and Controller Synthesis"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10159455"/><description text="The emergence of connected vehicles and cloud-based control technologies promise great benefits to transportation systems.

The proposed model of SIs allows the participation of DERs in the reactive power compensation to mitigate voltage issues of DN due to utilizing high penetration level EVs. Besides, the proposed model of SIs enables DERs to increase their dispatchability. The performance of the proposed model is examined in the case studies using the IEEE 33-bus system and the 123-bus system. It is illustrated in the case studies that the solar dispatchability increases by 12% when the proposed volt/VAR model is utilized for IEEE 33-bus system. Besides, it is illustrated in the case studies that the voltage profile of buses remains in the desired operating range when the proposed model is leveraged, even if the penetration level of EVs increased to 40%."/></item><item><title text="Two-Dimensional DOA Estimation via Matrix Completion and Sparse Matrix Recovery for Coprime Planar Array"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10148803"/><description text="The coprime planar array (CPPA) can obtain a larger virtual aperture using the sum-difference co-array (SDCA).

To accurately complete the missing elements in the SDCA, we construct an optimization problem based on the truncated nuclear norm regularization (TNNR) by constraining the conjugate flip symmetry property of the virtual array and the noise term. Moreover, we derive a complex-valued sparse matrix recovery algorithm based on the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding (FISTA) method avoiding using Kronecker product operations between dictionary matrices, which aims to reduce the computational complexity of the conventional vector-form sparse recovery algorithms. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can achieve a larger virtual aperture and lower computational complexity, improving the angle estimation performance.

The focus is on the potential benefits of including a heat pump in the thermal management system for waste heat recovery, and charging point planning, in a way to achieve optimality in time, energy, or their trade-off. An optimal control problem is formulated, in which the objective function includes the energy delivered by the charger(s), and the total charging time including the actual charging time and the detour time to and from the charging stop. To reduce the computational complexity, the formulated problem is then transformed into a hybrid dynamical system, where charging dynamics are modeled in the domain of normalized charging time. Driving dynamics can be modeled in either trip time or travel distance domains, as the vehicle speed is assumed to be known a priori, and the vehicle is only stopping at charging locations. Within the hybrid dynamical system, a binary variable is introduced for each charging location, in order to decide whether to use or skip a charger. This problem is solved numerically, and simulations are performed to evaluate the performance in terms of energy efficiency and time. The simulation results indicate that the time required for charging and total energy consumption are reduced up to $30.6 \,\% $ and $19.4 \,\% $, respectively, by applying the proposed algorithm."/></item><item><title text="Multivariate Variance-Based Genetic Ensemble Learning for Satellite Anomaly Detection"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10155492"/><description text="Proactive diagnosis of spacecraft issues and response to conceivable hazards has attracted considerable interest.

In this article, we first leverage the eigenvalues of covariance metrics of a multivariate time series to determine the anomaly score at each timestamp. Then, the anomaly scores are fed to various machine learning models. After that, we employ a Multivariate Variance-based Genetic Ensemble (MVVGE) learning method to ensemble the results of several models based on their corresponding performance.

A new set of triangular DQ transmitting (Tx) coils for wireless EV chargers is newly proposed in this article for large longitudinal, lateral, and diagonal displacement tolerances. The proposed coil set consists of two layers, i.e., D-Tx and Q-Tx, where each Tx layer has two triangular coils of the same magnetic polarity diagonally, facing each other to generate a more uniform coupling coefficient between Tx and Rx w.r.t. the misalignments. In practice, diagonal misalignment tolerance is an important design criterion to deliver load power to EV because the worst scenario of misalignment is when longitudinal and lateral misalignments occur at the same time, i.e., diagonal misalignment. To solve these misalignment issues, the DQ transmitters were optimally designed to obtain uniformed output voltage against wide range of the diagonal misalignment situations. A prototype of an inductive power transfer (IPT) system having the proposed triangular DQ Tx coils for 3.5 kW wireless EV chargers was fabricated and experimentally verified with a switching frequency of 85 kHz, which can satisfy J2954 WPT1 class in the society of automotive engineers (SAE).

To further improve the connections in an IoT network, we propose a general NOMA scheme that serves multiple IoT users. Since the IoT devices are generally homogeneous, a user fairness-oriented power allocation scheme is designed for the proposed NOMA scheme. Besides, for comparison purposes, the benchmark orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme and its corresponding user fairness transmission scheme are also proposed. The closed-form expressions of average block error rates for secondary users are derived over Nakagami-$m$ channels in both NOMA and benchmark OMA scheme. Simulation and analysis results show that a faraway primary network will benefit the spectrum sharing. In addition, shorter packets and more different channel conditions improve the NOMA gains over OMA. Besides, power allocation factors are found to be capable of achieving user fairness and the fairness transmission is achieved by the proposed scheme. Interestingly, when the channel differences are bigger enough, paring an extra NOMA user nearly does not affect the previous system performance."/></item><item><title text="Channel Estimation in RIS-Assisted MIMO Systems Operating Under Imperfections"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10137372"/><description text="The promising gains of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, in terms of extended coverage and enhanced capacity, are critically dependent on the accuracy of the channel state information. However, traditional channel estimation (CE) schemes are not applicable in RIS-assisted MIMO networks, since passive RISs typically lack the signal processing capabilities that are assumed by CE algorithms. This becomes problematic when physical imperfections or electronic impairments affect the RIS due to its exposition to different environmental effects or caused by hardware limitations from the circuitry. While these real-world effects are typically ignored in the literature, in this article we propose efficient CE schemes for RIS-assisted MIMO systems taking different imperfections into account. Specifically, we propose two sets of tensor-based algorithms, based on the parallel factor analysis decomposition schemes. First, assuming a long-term model &#8211; where the RIS imperfections, modeled as unknown phase shifts, are static within the channel coherence time &#8211; we formulate an iterative alternating least squares (ALS)-based algorithm for the joint estimation of the unknown phase deviations and the communication channels. Then, we develop the short-term imperfection model, which allows both amplitude and phase RIS imperfections to be non-static with respect to the channel coherence time. We propose two iterative ALS-based and closed-form higher-order singular value decomposition-based algorithms for jointly estimating the channels and the unknown impairments. We also investigate the computational complexity and the identifiability of the proposed algorithms and study the effect of various imperfections on the CE quality.

The aim of the proposed LPI-based transmit resource scheduling (LPI-TRS) strategy is to optimize the LPI performance of the D-MIMO systems meanwhile satisfy the target tracking accuracy requirement by the proper transmit resource management design. Different from the existing research, we introduce a cascading mathematical model to describe the intercept process with the specific intercept receiver. A cascading product of the probabilities of interception and detection deduces the probability of report $ P_{R}$ for the interceptor, to evaluate the LPI performance of one transmit radar node. Accordingly, the maximum $ P_{R}$ is employed, for the overall D-MIMO radar systems, to perform as the global LPI performance metric. Based on the min-max criterion, by minimizing the global LPI metric, a novel non-convex optimization problem is formulated wherein the requirements for target tracking performance and the system resource limitation are considered as the constraints.

The time-frequency waveform design of OFDM for dual-functional radar-communications (DFRC) is critical to achieve the future communication and sensing requirements. Therefore, we propose a novel method to minimize Cram&#233;r-Rao bounds (CRBs) of the delay and Doppler estimation to improve radar performance of an OFDM DFRC system. Although some methods are proposed in the literature to improve the CRBs, these methods either require feedforward signaling or subcarrier reservation. However, it is possible to exploit the constellation extension of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) to achieve lower CRBs without these requirements. Therefore, the proposed method provides a transparent communication along with the CRB minimization for conventional OFDM systems. For the evaluation of the proposed method, CRB and symbol error rate (SER) are considered in the simulation results. Furthermore, the theoretical SER analysis of the proposed method is derived to understand the effects of CRB minimization on the communication performance."/></item><item><title text="Hybrid SAG-FSO/SH-FSO/RF Transmission for Next-Generation Satellite Communication Systems"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10138622"/><description text="Recent advances demonstrate satellite communication (SatCom) as a potent enabler for future Terabit/s global connectivity.

Despite their ability to deliver high-throughput transmissions, FSO communications are weather-dependent and susceptible to atmospheric turbulence. Hybrid FSO/RF and space-air-ground (SAG) FSO transmissions are possible solutions to increase the reliability of FSO-based transmission systems. A strategically deployed unmanned-aerial vehicle, acting as a relay, can successfully mitigate the adverse effect of atmospheric turbulence, while the hybrid FSO/RF transmission can address weather-dependent effects. These solutions can also be integrated to create a system with significantly improved performance and reliability. To evaluate the performance of the resulting integrated transmission system, we analyze the outage probability and average symbol error probability in this work. Asymptotic expressions are also derived to obtain further insight into the system behavior and calculate the overall diversity gain.

To reduce the computational complexity incurred by the maximum likelihood (ML) detection, we propose two low-complexity detections, namely the match correlation (MC) detection and the optimal low complexity (OLC) detection. MC and OLC approaches separate the dispreading from the demodulation in the detection, which achieves a significant reduction of the computational complexity over ML detection demonstrated by the analysis of the computational complexity measurements. We present a thorough analysis for the upper bound on the average bit error probability (ABEP) of the ML detection and the bit error probability (BEP) of the OLC detection of RIS-CIM, which is verified by numerical simulations. Numerical simulations also demonstrate that the proposed RIS-CIM performs better in terms of the error performance of ML detection than several existing CIM and RIS-related schemes at a given SE setting. In addition, the proposed ML and OLC detections achieve an error performance close to the ML detection under various measures of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the increasing SE in the simulations. Moreover, RIS-CIM can utilize a large number of reflective elements at the RIS-aided relay to offset the performance degradation caused by the improvement of SE."/></item><item><title text="Explicit Performance Limit for Joint Range and Direction of Arrival Estimation in Phased-Array Radar Sensors"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10141676"/><description text="For radar sensors in vehicle safety systems, it is of importance to establish a fundamental performance limit for the estimation accuracy of targets.

Based on the joint a posteriori probability density function, we define range-DOA entropy error (RDEE) as the entropy power of range and DOA. With normalized a posteriori entropies in low and high SNRs, the closed-form approximation for the theoretical RDEE is derived. The explicit theoretical RDEE is comprehensive and captures the effect of the SNR, the number of elements, and the ratio of the signal bandwidth to the carrier frequency. RDEE is compared with CRB and ZZB by a numerical simulation. The result shows RDEE and ZZB are almost identical in low SNR. Under high SNR, RDEE degenerates to ZZB."/></item><item><title text="IRS-User Association in IRS-Aided MISO Wireless Networks: Convex Optimization and Machine Learning Approaches"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10143313"/><description text="This article concentrates on the problem of associating an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to multiple users in a multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink wireless communication network.

In addition, we theoretically derive the probability of PA misdetection, PA collision, and successful PA detection under typical NTN line-of-sight (LoS) channel conditions. Simulation results verify that the proposed two-stage PA detector (TSPD) achieves performance close to the theoretical upper bound in terms of successful PA detection probability. The TSPD also shows a significantly greater successful PA detection probability than the conventional PA detector using orthogonal PAs while satisfying the random access requirement for the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) standard. Moreover, compared to the conventional PA detector for non-orthogonal PA, which adopts an interference cancellation scheme, the TSPD achieves up to 25.6 times lower detection complexity."/></item><item><title text="User Association for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces Aided Cell-Free Networks"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10152474"/><description text="Cell-free (CF) network can efficiently suppress inter-cell interference and enable multiple base stations (BSs) to serve users cooperatively without being affected by cell boundaries. However, to further increase the network capacity, a large number of BSs need to be deployed, resulting in high cost and power consumption. To tackle this problem, econfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a cost-effective technology to enhance energy and spectral efficiency of wireless communications. In this article, we consider an RIS-aided CF network by exploiting their complementary advantages where each user assisted by a dedicated RIS can associate with multiple BSs. We first characterize each user's average signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in the RIS-CF network. Then, we formulate an SINR balancing problem to maximize the minimum SINR among all users by designing the BS-user associations. Despite of the non-convexity and combinatorial feature of this problem, a two-step fractional linearization algorithm is developed to solve it optimally. Specifically, we transform a nested mixed-integer linear fractional program (MILFP) into a solvable mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem through the generalized fractional programming and reformulation-linearization method. Finally, we provide numerical results to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm compared to other benchmark schemes."/></item><item><title text="Distributed Scheduling for Status Update With Heterogeneous Services Under the IRSA Protocol"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10158509"/><description text="The peak age-of-information (AoI) performance in irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA) is revisited in this paper with a particular focus on heterogeneous networks, where types of users may have different numbers of users, active probabilities, and sensitivities to AoI.

In this article, the joint active and passive beamforming optimization of access points (APs) and RISs for the RISs-empowered cell-free network in the presence of channel state information (CSI) estimation errors is investigated. By taking the CSI estimation errors into account, we start with deriving the expression of a tight lower bound on the exact sum-rate, which is taken as the optimization criteria. Then, a robust joint beamforming optimization algorithm is proposed to obtain the highest sum-rate by using the lower bound, so as to obtain the best result out of the worst-case. In addition, a counter-intuitive but interesting result can be concluded via rigorous mathematical derivations that CSI estimation errors always impact the optimization of active transmitting beamforming matrices of APs, but surprisingly have no impact on the optimization of passive reflecting beamforming matrices of RISs when the covariance matrices of CSI estimation errors seen from two sides of each channel are proportional to an identity matrix. Simulation results demonstrate that RISs can considerably improve the sum-rate of the conventional cell-free network, and confirm the resilience of the proposed algorithm against CSI uncertainty."/></item><item><title text="Joint Design of Access and Backhaul in Densely Deployed mmWave Small Cells"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10153707"/><description text="With the rapid growth of mobile data traffic, the shortage of radio spectrum resource has become increasingly prominent. Millimeter wave (mmWave) small cells can be densely deployed in macro cells to improve network capacity and spectrum utilization. Such a network architecture is referred to as mmWave heterogeneous cellular networks (HetNets). Compared with the traditional wired backhaul, The integrated access and backhaul (IAB) architecture with wireless backhaul is more flexible and cost-effective for mmWave HetNets. However, the imbalance of throughput between the access and backhaul links will constrain the total system throughput. Consequently, it is necessary to jointly design of radio access and backhaul link. In this article, we study the joint optimization of user association and backhaul resource allocation in mmWave HetNets, where different mmWave bands are adopted by the access and backhaul links. Considering the non-convex and combinatorial characteristics of the optimization problem and the dynamic nature of the mmWave link, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) based scheme to maximize the long-term total link throughput of the network. The simulation results show that the scheme can not only adjust user association and backhaul resource allocation strategy according to the dynamics in the access link state, but also effectively improve the link throughput under different system configurations."/></item><item><title text="STAR-RIS Assisted Downlink Active and Uplink Backscatter Communications With NOMA"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10153701"/><description text="A simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) assisted downlink (DL) active and uplink (UL) backscatter communication (BackCom) framework is proposed.

Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is exploited in both DL and UL communications for improving the spectrum efficiency. The system weighted sum rate maximization problem is formulated for jointly optimizing the FD BS active receive and transmit beamforming, the STAR-RIS passive beamforming, and the DL NOMA decoding orders, subject to the DL user's individual rate constraint.

Therefore, this article exploits the spatial selectivity of massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) to reduce the collision issue when massive M2M devices initiate random access simultaneously. In particular, a beam-based random access protocol is first proposed to make efficient use of the limited uplink resources for massive M2M devices.

Herein, the system is comprised of a primary network and a secondary network with $n$-transmitting users. Primary and secondary users exploit an underlay spectrum leasing scheme to transmit signals to a relay station (RS), which forwards the signals to the corresponding receivers. Two phases of data transmission are assumed. In Phase I, the secondary transmitters employ uplink NOMA to transmit the symbols. The RS then uses downlink NOMA to broadcast the received symbols in Phase II. We employ the maximum ratio combining decoding scheme and propose a successive-interference-cancellation concept with ($n+1$) stages to decode the symbols at the primary and secondary receiving ends, respectively. Considering a transmission power constraint imposed at the secondary transmitters, we derive the closed-form expressions for achievable rate and outage probability for both primary and secondary users. Simulation results manifest that, compared with the conventional cooperative orthogonal multiple access-based spectrum leasing scheme, the proposed CNOMA-SL exhibits improved performance in terms of both achievable rate and outage probability. It is also revealed that the system performs better when the RS takes the lease of the whole spectrum. Furthermore, if more interference power is allowed to the primary receiver, the secondary users reach higher achievable rates."/></item><item><title text="Joint Energy and Information Precoding for NOMA-Based WPCNs Aided by Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10160160"/><description text="In a wireless powered communication network (WPCN), wireless energy acquisition is weak due to the fading characteristic of wireless link, which makes it hard to supply the energy. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising performance enhancement technology for WPCNs, which can improve the energy and spectral efficiency, expand the network coverage, and thus improve the throughput. This article proposes a new framework for energy harvesting and information transmission of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based WPCNs aided by RIS. The total transmission capacity is maximized by joint optimization of energy precoding, information precoding, and the phase shift of RIS, which turns out to be a non-convex problem. Under the multi user scenario, we propose a joint optimization algorithm combing alternating optimization (AO), semidefinite relaxation (SDR), and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods, which is called ASS algorithm for short. Numerical results prove that compared with the non-RIS system, the ASS can increase the throughput of the system under multiuser scenario by 502.49%. For the system under single scenario, the energy precoding and information precoding are determined respectively by using the beamforming and the traditional maximal ratio combining (MRC) algorithm.

In such systems, learning efficiency is severely degraded by limited communication resources and device heterogeneity in terms of local data distribution and computation capability, especially for synchronous FL mechanisms where the training of each round should wait for the slowest device. To tackle this issue, asynchronous FL is proposed, which allows the devices with powerful computation and communication capabilities exchanging information with the server more frequently. However, this asynchronous FL framework faces a new challenge of low accuracy caused by the imbalanced local model updating. To overcome the shortage of both synchronous and asynchronous FLs, we propose an enhanced online semi-asynchronous FL mechanism between the edge-device layers, where each device trains its local model with the newly generated data and each edge server aggregates a number of local models based on their arrival order in each round. Particularly, devices with faster training speeds would fully utilize the idle time by training their local models repetitively. Meanwhile, synchronous FL with an edge elastic update strategy is adopted to the cloud-edge layers for personalized information exchange. Considering the continuous data generation feature, we formulate the objective problem as an online Markov Decision Process (MDP) to realize efficient communication-and-computing HHFEL via joint device selection and resource allocation. Due to the non-convex and combinatorial problem structure, we develop a hybrid Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) approach with low computational complexity to adapt the device selection and resource allocation strategies.

As a remedy, virtual network embedding (VNE) can enable diverse virtual network requests (VNRs) to share the same substrate network resources to improve resource utilization. However, existing works are few and mainly rely on heuristic methods, whose static embedding strategies cannot be optimized according to the resource state. In this article, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) aided load-balanced VNE algorithm (DRL-LBVNE) for the regional satellite networks, where we first build a low-cost regional satellite network scenario and derive its multi-fold coverage constraints.

Due to the spectrum sharing, the communication network and the radars cause interference to each other, which reduces the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the radars as well as the data rate of the CUs. Therefore, a major problem is to maximize the sum rate of the CUs while guaranteeing their QoS requirements of data transmissions and the SINR requirements of multiple radars. To achieve the objective, we formulate a new problem that optimizes i) common rates of the CUs, ii) transmit power of the common message of the CUs, iii) transmit power of the private messages for the intended CUs, and iv) transmit power of the radar systems. The problem is non-convex, and thus we propose two algorithms. The first sequential quadratic programming (SQP) as the state-of-the-art in nonlinear programming method can quickly return a local optimal solution. The second is an additive approximation scheme (AAS) which solves the problem globally in a reasonable amount of time. Simulation results show the significant improvement of the AAS compared with the SQP in terms of sum rate. Furthermore, with the AAS, the sum rate of the CUs only slightly decreases when the radars' SINR is significantly increased.

However, Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is an import problem need to be solved. Especially, in the Vehicle Sharing System (VSS), the data authority is hard to be guaranteed based on the current technology. VSS provides the users with a convenient way to access vehicles nearby. However, the driving data security which can be used to record the driving conditions cannot be guaranteed by either cloud server or the vehicle. The camera in the cab is also not accepted because it will leak the user's privacy. This article solves this problem based on the cryptography with the public auditing technology. We design a multi-signature scheme so that the OBU and the PDA equipment of the vehicle renter can jointly sign a signature as a meta data for the driving information and upload it to the cloud server together with the raw data. In the event of a dispute, such as a vehicle accident, anyone can conduct an integrity checking with batch jobs on the stored data in the cloud server, so that the cloud and the vehicle renter cannot deny these information. We think that our scheme can be used to prevent some obvious data modification in cloud or as a part of the reference for accident identification. We also use the provable security technology to prove that our protocol is secure, and we realize its core algorithms. The experimental result shows that our scheme is efficient."/></item><item><title text="A Cooperative Relative Localization System for Distributed Multi-Agent Networks"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10153705"/><description text="While absolute position information is inaccessible for multi-agent networks due to the lack of global reference in GNSS-challenged or infrastructure-free scenarios, relative pose information among the agents can be obtained via agent cooperation.

The scheme also incorporates a back calibration step that utilizes the position estimates of the listener agents to further improve the localization accuracy of the backbone topology. Moreover, a multi-sensory information fusion scheme is developed for dynamic scenes, where a coordinate transformation method is proposed to reduce the accumulated error caused by the coordinate misalignment.

However, they may also introduce intolerable ambiguity problems for signal tracking, ranging, and positioning. In order to take advantage of high-precision subcarriers in subcarrier modulated signals for unambiguous ranging and positioning, we propose a Carrier Assisted Robust Unambiguous Positioning Technique (CARUPT), which consists of a Carrier Assisted Kalman filter (CA-Kalman) module and an Observation Cycle-slip Detection (OCD) module. The CA-Kalman module utilizes the undifferenced code and subcarrier observations and time-differenced carrier observations derived from two-dimensional tracking to resolve subcarrier ambiguities in the position domain. The OCD module includes a carrier-involved Subcarrier Cycle-slip Detector (SCD) and a high-order difference-based Carrier Cycle-slip Detector (CCD) so as to avoid the impact of subcarrier and carrier cycle slips on the robust resolution of subcarrier ambiguities.

However, it is crucial to strike a balance between the quality and the diversity of video content when deciding the placement strategies of video caching. In this study, we examine the feasibility of implementing a layered caching scheme utilizing scalable video coding (SVC) in three-dimensional (3D) multi-UAV networks with cache capabilities. The objective is to investigate the minimization of the cumulative video access delay experienced by all GUs through the joint design of layered scalable video caching, user-UAV association, and 3D UAV deployment. This approach enables the network to offer video services across a range of quality levels. We have formulated an intricate mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem which poses a significant challenge to solve directly. Then we decompose the formulated problem into three interrelated sub-problems and put forth specific algorithms designed to address each component, i.e., layered caching strategy and UAV's two-dimensional (2D) deployment optimization with penalty based difference-of-convex (penalty-DC) framework, user-UAV association optimization with bipartite graph based linear programming (LP) relaxation, as well as UAV altitude optimization with successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Then we introduce a highly efficient iterative algorithm that employs an alternate optimization approach for three sub-problems until convergence. Our simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm surpasses other benchmark schemes significantly in terms of mitigating video access delay."/></item><item><title text="Two-Stage Self-Adaptive Task Outsourcing Decision Making for Edge-Assisted Multi-UAV Networks"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10144676"/><description text="This paper proposes a two-stage novel algorithm for intelligent edge-assisted multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) surveillance services. In the first stage, multiple UAVs determine their optimal positions to detect as many target faces as possible for efficient surveillance using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL). Multi-UAVs must be coordinated and optimally positioned for effective surveillance depending on the target person's location. It is also significantly important to consider the battery performance of the UAVs. In the second stage, every single UAV performs face identification in monitored areas, where two sequential scheduling methods make decisions: (i) edge selection for remote computing via max-weight scheduling and (ii) transmit power allocation scheduling to deliver the images to scheduled edges for time-average energy consumption minimization subject to stability. The identification execution requires computing power, and its complexity and time depend on the number of faces in the captured image. Consequently, the task cannot be fully executed by an individual UAV in high image arrival regimes or images with a high density of faces. In those conditions, UAVs can leverage computing support from nearby edges capable of AI-based face identification tasks. Importantly, computing task distribution should be energy-efficient and delay-minimal due to constraints imposed by the UAV system's characteristics and applications. We remark that selected edges should complete their computing tasks with similar delay to minimize idle time among the edges, which is why we chose min-max scheduling. To summarize, our proposed novel two-stage algorithm accomplishes efficient multi-UAV positioning corresponding to user-defined weight (overlapped threshold) and minimizes UAVs' transmission power while preserving stability constraints."/></item><item><title text="Uncertainty-Aware Task Offloading for Multi-Vehicle Perception Fusion Over Vehicular Edge Computing"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10146522"/><description text="Multi-vehicle perception fusion is an emerging advanced vehicular application providing Vehicle Users (VUs) with comprehensive driving assistance. This involves each VU's individual vehicular perception tasks and additional fusion tasks at the end. However, performing these perception fusion applications on some VUs may not be feasible due to the applications' high computing complexity. Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) server, which is collocated with a Road-side Unit, together with VUs' Vehicular Local Computing (VLC) units can be used to support these perception fusion applications through task offloading. Achieving this edge-collaborated perception fusion with task offloading involves multiple challenges: (i) frequently varying uplink channel conditions, (ii) sequential and parallel task dependencies, and (iii) uncertain task composition induced by unknown object detection outputs in the dynamic driving environment. In this article, a real-time mechanism is proposed to minimize the end-to-end delay of an edge-collaborated multi-vehicle perception fusion application by addressing these challenges.

Through offloading, the performances such as the execution delay as well as the energy consumption can be effectively improved, which can significantly enhance the quality of user experience. Given the dynamics and randomness of computation requests arrival, the energy in the battery, the radio network environment, and the computation resource in the MEC server, it is a challenge to perform efficient offloading. Based on these problems, this article proposes dynamic optimization schemes with queuing theory for the cases of the static subchannel and dynamic subchannel during a time slot separately in 5G MEC heterogeneous networks with multiple MDs equipped with the function of energy harvesting. In the schemes, offloading decisions and radio allocation strategies will be dynamically coordinated. They are also jointly allocated along with changing wireless communication resources and computation demands aiming to minimize the system average execution delay. Specifically, it is assumed that the offloading requests can be transmitted through either macro base stations or small base stations. In the case of the static subchannel, a joint resource allocation and computation offloading scheme based on Lyapunov optimization and Simulated Annealing Genetic Algorithm (SAGA) is put forward.

However, the perception of standalone intelligence inevitably suffers from occlusions. A new paradigm, Cooperative Perception (CP), comes to the rescue by sharing sensor data from another perspective, i.e., from a cooperative vehicle (CoV). Due to the limited communication bandwidth, it is essential to schedule the most beneficial CoV, considering both the viewpoints and communication quality. Existing methods rely on the exchange of meta-information, such as visibility maps, to predict the perception gains from nearby vehicles, which induces extra communication and processing overhead. In this article, we propose a new approach, learning while scheduling, for distributed scheduling of CP. The solution enables CoVs to predict the perception gains using past observations, leveraging the temporal continuity of perception gains. Specifically, we design a mobility-aware sensor scheduling (MASS) algorithm based on the restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) theory to maximize the expected average perception gain. An upper bound on the expected average learning regret is proved, which matches the lower bound of any online algorithm up to a logarithmic factor. Extensive simulations are carried out on realistic traffic traces. The results show that the proposed MASS algorithm achieves the best average perception gain and improves recall by up to 3.1 percentage points compared to other learning-based algorithms. Finally, a case study on a trace of LiDAR frames qualitatively demonstrates the superiority of adaptive exploration, the key element of the MASS algorithm."/></item><item><title text="Lightweight and Secure Multi-Factor Authentication Scheme in VANETs"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10155263"/><description text="The idea of a smart city and the utilization of vehicles are emerging rapidly.

However, the high dynamics of UAVs and the instability of the wireless links often result in certain UAVs temporarily losing connection with the group, rendering them incapable of participating in the group key agreement process. Regrettably, existing literature on group key agreement does not consider this issue, which makes them not applicable to UANET. To address this issue, we propose a threshold authenticated group key agreement protocol (TAGKA) that can resist the disconnection of group members. Then, considering that the temporarily disconnected UAVs need to obtain the latest group key after the communication links are recovered, we design a group key recovery protocol.

With the motivation to address the above issues simultaneously, in this article, we propose a sanitizable cross-system ciphertext authorization scheme (SI-APRE) for secure communication in ICVs. Our SI-APRE enables the conversion of the ciphertext generated with the original recipient's identity into a new ciphertext bound to the access policy, so that other new authorized recipients can also access the raw data.

However, most of the existing antenna array configurations are deprived of a universal design approach. This manuscript introduces a universal array designing framework (UADF), which can employ different antenna arrays and exhibit multiple desirable properties. The UADF is based on effectively cascading three identical levels that can be nested to another M-times, with only its initial level to be configured by the antenna array. Thus, it inherits the characteristics of configuration used in the initial level and simultaneously embeds a good balance between key features in terms of low cost, easier construction and extension, reliability, robustness, more DOFs, larger continuous virtual aperture, and higher spatial efficiency. Moreover, the UADF enjoys closed-form expressions for the array configuration and DOFs. We employed different antenna arrays to demonstrate the usefulness of UDAF, which is also confirmed via numerical experiments."/></item><item><title text="Robust Target Positioning for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Assisted MIMO Radar Systems"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10149128"/><description text="The direction of arrival (DOA) based multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar technique has been widely utilized for ubiquitous positioning due to its advantage of simple implementability. On the other hand, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has received considerable attention, which can be deployed on the walls and objects to strengthen the positioning performance. However, RIS is usually not equipped with a perception module, which results in the tremendous challenge for RIS-assisted positioning. To tackle this challenge, this article propose the fundamental problem of DOA-based target positioning in RIS-assisted MIMO radar system. Unlike conventional DOA estimation systems, the beneficial role of RIS is investigated in MIMO radar system, where a nonconvex $\ell _{p}$ promoting function is exploited to estimate DOA task. By adjusting the reflecting elements of the RIS, the proximal projection iterative strategy is developed to obtain the feasible solution. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results illustrate that the proposed scheme can achieve remarkable positioning performance and shed light on the benefits offered by the adoption of the RIS in terms of positioning performance."/></item><item><title text="Unsynchronized Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces With Pulse-Width-Based Design"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10148796"/><description text="In this correspondence, we present a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) that reflects an incident signal to the desired direction, depending on the pulse width. This unique reconfigurability emerges by virtue of the transient response of the embedded nonlinear circuits within the RIS unit cells. The RIS does not need any control lines connected to the unit cells or precise synchronization with the base station, leading to reduced complexity of the RIS system yet allowing automated beamforming characteristics in accordance with the incident pulse width. To verify this scheme, an RIS system model using binary phase shift keying is considered, in which the RIS wireless link is connected to a single transmitter at the input and two receivers at the output. Numerical demonstrations show that modulated signals are received with contrasting bit-error rates in the two receivers, consistent with the aforementioned pulse-width-based beam control."/></item><item><title text="Joint Power Allocation and Passive Beamforming for RIS-Assisted Wireless Energy-Constrained Systems With Multi-User Scheduling"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10149523"/><description text="In this paper, we consider a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted wireless communications system with multi-user scheduling, where a pilot-embedded data transmission is carried out from a selected user to an access point (AP) with the aid of an RIS. Specifically, by taking into account a transmit energy constraint, we propose a joint passive beamforming and power allocation optimization (JPB-PAO) scheme for the RIS-assisted wireless system, in which a problem of joint optimization on the pilot power, data power, and RIS's phase shifts is formulated for maximizing the achievable rate of the user-AP transmission. To this end, we propose a Dinkelbach and majorization-minimization (DMM) aided JPB-PAO (termed as DMM-JPB-PAO) scheme for the sake of obtaining a semi-closed form expression of the optimal RIS phase shifts, based on which a closed-form solution of power allocation is derived. Moreover, we adopt the widely used semidefinite relaxation (SDR) algorithm as a baseline to solve the JPB-PAO problem, which is referred to as the SDR-JPB-PAO. Numerical results show that our proposed DMM-JPB-PAO achieves almost the same achievable rate as the SDR-JPB-PAO at a much lower computational complexity. Meanwhile, DMM-JPB-PAO scheme yields a higher achievable rate than the passive beamforming optimization with fixed power allocation (PBO-FPA) scheme and the random passive beamforming with fixed power allocation (RPB-FPA) scheme."/></item><item><title text="A Unified Framework Analysis for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Aided Coordinated NOMA Systems"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10149381"/><description text="This article presents a unified framework analysis for the performance of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided coordinated non-orthogonal multiple access (C-NOMA) systems where the discrete phase-shift alignment and imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) are investigated.

To assess the system characteristic, the users' outage probability (OP) and ergodic capacity (EC) expressions are evaluated and derived in terms of approximate closed-form and asymptotic expressions.

The first stage calculates the prior for sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) using orthogonal matching pursuit list (OMPL) exploiting the grid sparsity of the cascaded channel, and the second stage employs the prior to obtain the accurate estimation using SBL.

To make the most of THz UM-MIMO systems, acquisition of accurate channel information is crucial. However, the THz channel acquisition is not easy due to the humongous pilot overhead that scales linearly with the number of antennas. In this article, we propose a novel deep learning (DL)-based channel acquisition technique called Transformer-based parametric THz channel acquisition (T-PCA) for the THz UM-MIMO systems. By learning the complicated mapping function between the received pilot signal and the sparse channel parameters (e.g., angles, distances, path gains) using Transformer, T-PCA can make a fast yet accurate channel estimation with a relatively small amount of pilot resources. Moreover, using the attention mechanism of Transformer, we can promote the correlation structure of the received pilot signals in the feature extraction, thereby improving the channel parameter estimation quality significantly. From the simulation results, we demonstrate that T-PCA is effective in acquiring the THz channel information and reducing the pilot overhead."/></item><item><title text="Semantic Sensing Performance Analysis: Assessing Keyword Coverage in Text Data"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10143708"/><description text="In this paper, to provide the theoretical reference for semantic sensing performance, the stochastic geometry tool is used to make the quantitative coverage performance analysis of the semantic keywords.

The formation of a parasitic oxide at this junction was hypothesized to act as a source for contact deterioration after annealing. However, no experimental proof could be obtained so far. In this contribution, we simultaneously investigate the contact resistivity and nanoscopic structure of the electron contact of a SHJ solar cell in the annealing temperature range between 140 $^\circ \text{C}$ and 240 $^\circ \text{C}$. For this purpose, micro transfer length measurements, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, and electron&#8211;energy loss spectroscopy as well as energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in a (scanning) transmission electron microscope are applied. A minimum contact resistivity of around 120 $\text{m}\Omega {\text{cm}^{2}}$ is obtained at 160 $^\circ \text{C}$. At higher temperatures, the contact resistivities increase rapidly. This contact degradation correlates with the thickening of a parasitic silicon oxide layer found at the ITO/a-Si junction and an increase in Si oxidation state within this interlayer. Additionally, Ag from the metallization diffuses into the Si, which may induce deep acceptor trap states. Furthermore, a TiO${}_{\text{x}}$ layer with ${\text{x}}\sim {1}$ is proven between ITO and the AgPdTi metallization, which does not impair the current transport."/></item><item><title text="Extended FF and VOC Parameterizations for Silicon Solar Cells"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10251700"/><description text="This work is concerned with maximal and currently obtained fill factors of crystalline silicon solar cells. Recent research activities have led to a drastically decreased recombination in the volume as well as at the surfaces and interfaces of crystalline silicon solar cells. As a result, open-circuit voltages $({{V}_{\text{OC}}})$ and fill factor $({\textit{FF}})$ values increased significantly. In order to classify how good the achieved improvements are, it is necessary to know the maximum achievable values. Unfortunately, there is no explicit expression for the ${\textit{FF}}$ in terms of other characteristic solar cell parameters. For this reason, the empirical ${\textit{FF}}_{0}$-relation by Green is widely used to predict upper ${\textit{FF}}$ bounds for a given ${V}_{\text{OC}}$. In order to evaluate to what extent Green's relation is a good approximation to recently obtained values, we study ${\textit{FF}}$&#8211;${V}_{\text{OC}}$ relations for ideal resistance-free single junction silicon solar cells limited by intrinsic recombination using state-of-the-art analytical models.

In the performance calibration chain of mainstream single-junction PV technologies, common reference cell types include Si, KG-filtered Si, and GaAs cells. For emerging multijunction (MJ) PV technologies, such as CdTe/Si and perovskite/Si, Si reference cells with colored glass near-infrared-longpass (LP) filters like Schott RG-715 and 850 glass have been proposed. They offer a better spectral response that matches the bottom junctions of the emerging MJs, which could lead to lower uncertainties in performance measurements. However, this article reveals a prominent decrease in short-circuit current (ISC) during National Renewable Energy Laboratory's primary calibration over the course of minutes when using this type of LP-filtered reference cell, which could result in unacceptable measurement errors. Unlike quartz or KG filter glasses, LP colored glass filters demonstrate temperature-sensitive cut-on wavelength. When incident irradiance reaches these LP-filtered reference cells, the increased temperature due to light absorption causes a shift of the cut-on to longer wavelength. As a result, the device ISC exhibits a continuous decrease (approximately a 2.5% drop with RG850 LP filter in a 5-min duration) even when the device temperature is controlled at 25&#8201;&#176;C. To address the temperature gradient issue between colored glass LP filter and the reference cell, we propose the direct integration of thin-film LP semiconductor layer on reference cells. This type of LP-filter-integrated cell has shown minimal temperature-related ISC variation and can serve as a more reliable reference cell source for accurate performance measurements."/></item><item><title text="Measuring the Absorber Doping Concentration of Si, CdSeTe, and Perovskite Solar Cells Using Injection-Dependent Quasi-Steady-State Photoluminescence"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10252134"/><description text="There are few doping concentration measurement techniques that are contactless and usable for all semiconductors.

We demonstrate the operation of GaAs LPC devices under orders of magnitude of irradiances up to 150 W/cm2 in a monochromatic laser simulator with an active cooling stage. The steady-state open-circuit voltage (VOC) as a function of irradiance is known to droop at high irradiance as the result of junction heating, but the junction temperature can be difficult to measure by conventional methods. Fast, transient VOC measurements under these extreme operating conditions are used here to determine the junction temperature. Empirical VOC temperature coefficients of the devices at each irradiance of interest are determined and used as an integral part of this technique. We show that the thermal design of different LPC devices strongly affects the operating temperature of the junctions. Knowledge of the operating temperature can be a strong tool for understanding the nature of loss mechanisms and improving the design for the operation of photovoltaic LPCs at high irradiances. This technique can be used for laboratory devices during initial design as well as to characterize mass-produced and packaged devices for quality control."/></item><item><title text="Doped GaInAs/GaP Quantum Well Superlattice Solar Cells With 27.5% Efficiency"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10250926"/><description text="Quantum wells can extend the absorption range of a solar cell and are typically placed in the intrinsic region of the device to enable efficient carrier collection via drift. Thick intrinsic regions are needed for significant absorption in the low bandgap quantum wells, resulting in a large depletion region recombination and ultimately a solar cell with a low fill factor (FF). However, in quantum well superlattice solar cells where tunneling plays a dominant role in carrier transport, collection by carrier diffusion may be possible, relieving the requirement for quantum wells to be placed in the intrinsic region. Here, we investigate doping in stress-balanced quantum well superlattice solar cells using thin 2 nm GaP barriers. Doping reduces J02 depletion region recombination and improves the solar cell FF up to 86.7%, but very high doping eventually reduces the carrier collection, leading to a tradeoff in efficiency. We show that the barrier thickness also plays an important role in carrier collection, and we demonstrate high efficiency 27.5% single-junction devices with a doped superlattice."/></item><item><title text="InP-Based Tunnel Junctions for Microconcentrator Photovoltaics"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10246256"/><description text="To further improve the performance of mechanically stacked microconcentrator photovoltaic devices, we have studied high-transparency tunnel junctions for inclusion in triple junction solar cells that are fully lattice-matched to InP.

Independent engineering firms typically build forecasts for large PV plants through the use of the PVsyst software, where monthly soiling losses are one of many inputs to the P50 model. Subsequently, long-term performance distributions are constructed through a Monte Carlo analysis that includes various factors, such as satellite irradiance modeling uncertainty, uncertainty in the PVsyst model, and long-term irradiance variability. Often the PVsyst model uncertainty is increased to account for sites with significant soiling concerns but no systematic method has been presented in the literature to specifically include soiling variability within long-term performance uncertainty. In this work soiling information from 16 sites in the U.S. Southwest are combined with 24 years of rainfall data to generate 24 years of energy production with soiling losses and then subsequently generate probability of exceedance values (e.g., P50, P90, P95&#8230;).

However, flooding and high wind events were found to have an extremely long tail extending to 60% loss, showing that these discrete events can pose a substantial risk to PV systems. Besides the short-term impact of lost production due to outages, we also found a statistically significant increased performance loss rate (PLR) for high wind events above 90 km/h, by comparing PLR before and after these events. Similarly, hail events caused higher PLR for hail sizes of and above 25 mm indicating that more stringent hail testing for PV modules is required.

The immediate impact on power due to these cracks can be readily measured, but it is also known from accelerated testing that the cracks can worsen over time. However, it is not clear how to predict the extent of future field degradation due to cracked cells, which requires a calibrated accelerated test. We describe progress toward such a test. In particular, we report on the outdoor aging of modules with cracked cells for nearly two years. We find that modules with cracked cells degraded in the field an average of 0.5% absolute more than uncracked modules over a period of 21 months. We also characterize the modules with multitemperature electroluminescence and find that the degradation is associated with cell fragments that become electrically isolated. We compare the weathering outdoors with the two types of accelerated tests: thermal cycling and a novel accelerated test, dynamic mechanical acceleration (DMX). DMX can apply thousands of pressure cycles at a frequency of approximately 10 Hz and pressures &lt;200&#8201;Pa, which are relevant to the wind-driven pressure cycles experienced by modules outdoors. We find that the thermal cycles designed to reproduce the cumulative temperature change from the field overestimate field degradation and can excite noncell-crack degradation. DMX results were promising, reproducing degradation levels similar to those observed outdoors over 21 months with a test that can be performed in less than an hour."/></item><item><title text="Role of Solar Photovoltaics for a Sustainable Energy System in Puerto Rico in the Context of the Entire Caribbean Featuring the Value of Offshore Floating Systems"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268669"/><description text="The Caribbean and Puerto Rico are lagging in ramping renewable energy (RE) capacities.

As far as the defect formation within the silicon bulk is concerned, the key parameters of the fast-firing step are the peak firing temperature (FT) and the band velocity vband of the conveyor belt, where the latter mainly defines the cooling ramp after the firing peak. In this contribution, we show that the extent of LeTID and the dependence on the applied temperature during degradation increase strongly with increasing measured FT (from 680 &#176;C to 800 &#176;C), vband (from 2.8 to 7.2 m/min), and the refractive index n of the hydrogen-rich silicon nitride layer deposited on the wafer surfaces (from 2.07 to 2.37). Through temperature-dependent degradation experiments, we determine an activation energy of EA = (0.55 &#177; 0.10) eV of the LeTID mechanism in Ga-doped Cz&#8211;Si, which is independent of FT and vband. From this observation we conclude that a single defect activation mechanism is most likely responsible for the examined LeTID effect, independent of the firing conditions. However, the concentration of recombination-active defect centers after LeTID depends critically on FT, vband, and n, which we attribute to variations of the in-diffused hydrogen concentrations from the silicon nitride layers during firing. Our experiments hence point towards an involvement of hydrogen in the LeTID mechanism observed in Ga-doped Cz&#8211;Si."/></item><item><title text="Bandgap Engineered Double-Cation/Double-Halide Quasi-Cubic Perovskite for Highly Efficient (&gt;36%) Indoor Photovoltaics"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10227528"/><description text="Double-cation- and double-halide-based perovskites are well known for their better structural stability and improved efficiency in photovoltaics compared to single-cation-based perovskites.

By adding Sn to structure (PEA)2GeI4, it was possible to notice a redshift of the absorption edge and band gap shrinking in the visible light range, which demonstrates the special optical characteristics of structure (PEA)2Sn0.5Ge0.5I4 for photovoltaic applications. It is revealed that (PEA)2Sn0.5Ge0.5I4 compound has a suitable bandgap and high optical absorption and conductivity in the visible region. In addition, low reflectivity, high absorption, high conductivity, and high dielectric constant imply that these materials have a high potential for use in photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices, including optical detectors, LED, solar cells, etc."/></item><item><title text="Extrapolating CIGS Module Performance From Laboratory Cell Performance Using IEC61853 Standard Reference Climatic Profiles"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10275138"/><description text="In general, cell development and optimization is performed w.r.t. the cell performance parameters under standard test conditions (STC).

Experimental measurements indicate that the sample with the thinnest p-GaN layer presents an early turn-on, which is not present for thicker p-GaN layers. Through technology computer aided design (TCAD) simulations, we show that the early turn-on is due to the insufficient V-pit planarization, as demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy analysis. V-pits penetrate the junctions, and locally put the quantum well region in closer connection with the p-side contact. The results provide insight on the role of V-pits on the electrical performance of high-periodicity quantum well devices, and demonstrate the existence of a trade-off between the need of a thin p-GaN (to limit short-wavelength absorption) and a thicker p-GaN, to favor V-pit planarization."/></item><item><title text="Spectral Mismatch Uncertainty Estimation in Solar Cell Calibration Using Monte Carlo Simulation"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10254528"/><description text="A solar cell is characterized using a solar simulator and a reference cell in accordance with standard testing conditions. Deviations between the spectral responsivities of the reference cell and the cell being studied, and deviations of the spectral irradiance of the light source used from the specified air mass 1.5 introduce systematic errors in the calibration of solar cells. These errors are corrected with the so-called spectral mismatch (SMM) correction factor. We demonstrate a Monte Carlo simulation-based analysis of the uncertainties present in an SMM correction factor taking into account the possible spectral correlations of the input parameters, such as the spectral irradiance and the spectral responsivities of the reference cell and the solar cell under test. We also perform a detailed uncertainty analysis of the subcomponents of the SMM factor mainly arising from the spectral irradiance incident on the solar cell. In order to test our estimates, we present a comparison of the uncertainties by six other independent calculations carried out by other institutes. We obtain the worst-case, average, and best-case scenario uncertainties of the SMM correction factor by assuming components to be severely correlated, partially correlated, and not correlated, respectively. The corresponding expanded uncertainties (k $=$ 2) are 1.26%, 0.44%, and 0.06%.

Nonuniform partial shading on one cell is seldom discussed. However, partial shading in real life is not usually in homogeneous irradiance. To fully examine the PV behavior under partial shading conditions, a cell has to be divided into several subcells to model nonuniform complex shading patterns. Therefore, this article develops a comprehensive mathematical PV model based on a single-diode model covering shading area, shading transmittance, and avalanche breakdown effect on reverse-biased cells. It simulates the output of subcells, cells, submodules, and modules by the calculation of explicit Lambert W function. The proposed model is validated in experimental tests, and its average relative error is under 5%. Compared with other related studies, the proposed model has a decent tradeoff between computation time and model accuracy. The characteristics of the $I\text{--}V$ curves based on the proposed model and measured data reveal almost the same information about shading patterns. It demonstrates to be a valuable tool in the application of fault diagnosis."/></item><item><title text="Diagonal Shadows Could Cause Arcs in Thin-Film Modules With P4 Scribes"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10246249"/><description text="Thin-film photovoltaic (PV) modules are often made using monolithic integration (MLI), regardless of absorber technology. MLI modules sometimes use a fourth pattern of scribe lines, P4, to divide modules into parallel substrings of cells. We simulated diagonal shadows in such modules and show that they cause a voltage difference across P4. This voltage can be enough to cause an arc across P4. An arc inside a PV module can cause burned polymers and broken glass. Such packaging failures create a risk of fire or electric shock in any PV module. These hazards go beyond the permanent loss of efficiency that vertical shadows can cause. We propose several solutions to this potential problem."/></item><item><title text="Influence of Temperature Coefficient and Sensor Choice on PV System Performance"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268072"/><description text="Owing to the well-known temperature dependence of photovoltaic (PV) module performance, it is important to correct the performance ratio with respect to temperature. In this study, temperature coefficients given by the manufacturer for three different PV cell technologies are compared with experimentally obtained temperature coefficients for a PV park situated in southern Norway. Three irradiance estimation methods are used to calculate these experimental temperature coefficients. The results show that they can differ significantly from the ones provided in the datasheet of the manufacturer for all three PV systems, but whether the temperature coefficient value increases or decreases depends on the systems and/or the irradiance estimation method. Furthermore, by analyzing nine clear sky days at different times of the year, it is found that the seasonality of the performance ratio can be significantly reduced when employing the experimental temperature coefficient rather than the datasheet temperature coefficient. As such, it may be more relevant to correct the performance ratio with experimental temperature coefficients rather than with the temperature coefficient from the system datasheet, especially for systems that experience large temperature differences. It is also found that the irradiance estimation method can significantly impact the experimental temperature coefficient. This study shows that the choice of irradiance estimation method and temperature coefficient can affect the performance interpretation of solar PV systems and must then be considered carefully."/></item><item><title text="Photovoltaic Module Temperature Estimation and Sensor Malfunction Detection Algorithm Based on Kalman Filter"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10274486"/><description text="This article presents a photovoltaic module temperature estimation and sensor malfunction detection algorithm based on the Kalman filter. At a given instant, an initial estimate of the temperature is determined through a chosen thermal model, which in this research was a dynamic linear regression empirical approach, and compared with the temperature sensor's measurement using the Kalman filter. This comparison results in a gain, which is then used to determine the final and more accurate temperature estimation through a weighted average between the initial estimated value and the temperature sensor's measurement. The method detects a possible malfunction of the temperature sensor and classifies the defect as sensor off/not measuring or with noisy measurements when the differences between the values estimated by the model used and those measured by the instrumentation become sufficiently significant. The proposed methodology was tested against data recorded in a photovoltaic laboratory at the University of S&#227;o Paulo, Brazil, and the results indicate that this solution can accurately assess the modules' temperature and detect temperature sensor malfunctioning, both on clear and cloudy days, on both temperature sensor shutdowns and noise-corrupted measurements situations."/></item><item><title text="Albedo-Dependent Bifacial Gain Losses in Photovoltaic Modules With Rear-Side Support Structures"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268048"/><description text="Bifacial photovoltaic (PV) modules can generate power even from rear-side solar irradiance. Consequently, the rear side of the bifacial PV module must not be hindered by structures. However, structures such as beams are often installed behind modules to ensure structural strength and for various other reasons. In such cases, the output power of the bifacial module is reduced because of partial shading on the rear side. This study entailed an analysis of the albedo dependence of the bifacial gain losses in bifacial modules due to inherent partial shading produced by rear-side support structures (e.g., mounting, frame, and beams). An analysis method combining ray tracing and electrical circuit simulation was implemented and verified through field experiments. The results demonstrate that the bifacial gain decreases nonlinearly at high albedo when the beam is closely attached to the rear side of the module. This loss is reduced by half upon placing the beam at a distance equivalent to the thickness of the beam from the module. The results also indicate the mismatch loss caused by each part of the module's support structure."/></item><item><title text="Predicting Warranty Risk of PV Modules"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10298200"/><description text="Photovoltaic devices degrade during their lifetime, just like any other technology. Degradation rates, and thus the lifetime of products, are currently not well understood. This lack of understanding results in stakeholders being exposed to unquantified risks and subsequently insufficient securities being set aside. It is shown that one cannot rely on a singular degradation rate of module's datasheet when it comes to assessing potential failure rates or warranty risks. Aging rates will vary in the field due to normal production variability. The existing approach that accepts a module type as reliable when a single certification test is passed cannot explain failures seen in the field nor provide any quantitative prediction. To address this problem, a methodology is developed that, in principle, predicts the likelihood of warranty claims in different operating environments. The method generates probability distributions of module performance for 25 years with typical degradation patterns seen for different degradation modes. The risk of failure is calculated from these distributions according to warranty conditions typical in the industry. The results show that over a quarter of the modules may be at risk of warranty failure at the end of warranty period. Furthermore, when the calculation is made considering that the degradation is exponential rather than linear, there is a risk of observing roughly five times more warranty cases five years after installation. Unlike current practices, this probabilistic warranty risk calculation approach can provide quantitative results, and help stakeholders better assess likely performance reduction of photovoltaic (PV) assets."/></item><item><title text="Comparative Evaluation of Solar Power Smoothing Techniques Considering Battery Degradation"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10237120"/><description text="The intermittent and volatile nature of renewable energy sources (RESs) has introduced new technical challenges that affect the secure and reliable grid operation.

Thus, reliable and timely detection and mitigation of arc faults are critical. DC arc detection methods typically use time or frequency spectrum variations of the circuit current or voltage to differentiate the arcing event from other system events. Since practical systems include power electronics and maximum-power-point tracking, any detection scheme must perform robustly in the electrical environment that these components establish in the dc power system. A capacitor placed in parallel with the main system is an effective sensor for series arc fault detection and localization applicable in this complex electrical environment. This article shows that the analysis of the amplitude, polarity, and spectrum characteristics of the capacitor current and voltage resulting from perturbations caused by the arc provides an effective method to identify and localize faults.

However, the operation of the maximum power point tracking controller and the effect of partial shading will lower the fault current to be unable to trigger the protection devices. Thus, it is difficult to detect and locate the faults accurately. It is necessary to study the characteristics of LG and LL faults for fault detection. This article determines the voltage characteristics of the LG and LL faults with the consideration of fault impedance and partial shading. The fault detection and location algorithm based on fault voltage behavior is established and developed on MATLAB.

While the physics of irradiance attenuation due to aerosols are well understood, complex atmospheric conditions and lack of detailed atmospheric measurement make them impractical for industry or small-scale solar users to calculate its impact on PV power generation. Simple, empirical models to quantify the overall effect from real-world observations are scarce. In this study, we make use of both the experimental approach as well as large-scale real-world observational data from more than 15 sites to empirically evaluate the impact of air pollution on PV production using only common weather parameters. We show that the impact of PM2.5 on irradiance and, hence, PV output is approximately linear at low and moderate levels of PM2.5, with a 100 &#956;g/m3 increase corresponding to a reduction of around 15 &#177; 5% relative under clear sky conditions, which is broadly consistent with previous preliminary results reported from literature. This effect saturates at higher PM2.5 concentrations beyond 300 &#956;g/m3 and is reduced at high cloud coverage. The methodology developed in this study represents a viable path towards establishing a common ground for standards.

In this article, a 1-year dataset from a high-precision meteorological station at the Green Energy Research facility is utilized, along with electrical parameters from a polycrystalline silicon c-Si PV module exposed during the study period, to forecast PV power. In addition, the accuracy of using satellite data for PV power forecasting is investigated, considering the growing trend of its utilization in recent research. Regression techniques, such as linear regression with interaction, tree regression, Gaussian process regression, ensemble learning for regression, response surface methodology, SVM cubic, and artificial neural network (ANN), are employed for PV power prediction, using both ground measurement data and satellite data. Comparatively lower accuracies are observed when using satellite data across all regression methods, in contrast to the higher accuracies achieved with ground-based measurements. Notably, the Gaussian process regression method demonstrates high accuracy (R2 = 0.25 for satellite data and R2 = 0.94 for ground-based data). Furthermore, the ANN approach further enhances the accuracy of PV power forecasting, yielding R2 = 0.42 for satellite data and R2 = 0.96 for ground-based data. These findings emphasize the need for caution when relying on satellite data for PV power forecasting, even when employing advanced ANN approaches.

In addition, with the increasing complexity of modern integrated circuit design, current floorplanning techniques encounter the &#8220;curse of dimensionality&#8221; and struggle to optimize large-scale cases. To address these challenges, this article proposes a novel end-to-end learning-based approach for thermal-aware fixed-outline 3-D IC floorplanning.

However, thermal issues are predominant in 3-D-SOCs due to the vertical stacking nature of chips which multiplies the transistor power density by the number of dies within the stack. Also, the reduced lateral heat spreading with aggressive die thinning degrades the ON-chip thermal performances. In this article, we investigate the thermal performance analysis of 3-D-SOC and compare the results with the 2-D-SOC designs for a MemPool multicore SOC with shared L1 scratchpad memory (SPM). Simulation results reveal that the 3-D-SOC using memory-on-logic (MOL) configuration increases the ON-chip maximum temperature by more than 20% compared with the baseline 2-D-SOC and the logic die temperature is relatively higher (3.6%) than the memory die.

This requires costly postlayout transistor-level simulations for performance evaluation (in the order of days), making not always feasible a systematic exploration of design space before integration due to computation time. To overcome this bottleneck, this work will show that the dynamic behavior can be theoretically predicted using a time-varying effective reference, the behavior of which is analytically described compactly.

Two differential amplifiers, a single-stage differential amplifier (SSDA) and a folded-cascode amplifier (FCA), employing the proposed CAAZ technique, are designed and simulated in a standard 180-nm CMOS process. Simulation results verify the higher performance of the proposed CAAZ compared to the conventional counterparts."/></item><item><title text="A Digital Low Dropout (LDO) Voltage Regulator Using Pseudoflash Transistors"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292792"/><description text="In this article, we present a pseudoflash-based digital low dropout (Digital LDO) voltage regulator. The novelty of our pseudoflash-based Digital LDO (PFD-LDO) voltage regulator lies in the fact that we use pseudoflash (or alternately, flash) transistor subarrays for voltage regulation. By changing the threshold voltage (and thereby, the ON resistance) of these transistors, we can use the same design to meet different regulator specifications. The threshold voltage can be programed either at the factory by the manufacturer or in the field by the user. This gives the manufacturer the ability to offer a family of LDO regulators with a single design, a significant economic advantage. In addition, aging effects and temperature variations are effectively erased since the threshold voltage of the pseudoflash (or flash) transistors can be tuned to a fine degree in the field. Similarly, process variations can be canceled after manufacturing in the factory. These advantages are absent in traditional LDO regulators. Our design uses two subarrays. A coarse subarray is used to reduce the recovery time and output voltage overshoot/undershoot, while a fine subarray regulates the output voltage, minimizing the output voltage ripple. Unlike state-of-the-art LDO regulators, our design can realize multiple specifications with the same circuit. For example, we demonstrate that the  $V_{\mathrm{ out}}$  of the proposed PFD-LDO regulator can range from 0.7 to  $1.7 {V}$  when the supply voltage  $V_{\mathrm{ IN}}$  ranges from 0.8 to  $1.8 {V}$ , using the same circuit design. Over this voltage range, the proposed PFD-LDO regulator achieves  $V_{\mathrm{ shoot}}&lt; 573 \text {mV}$ ,  $t_{\mathrm{ rec}}&lt; 0.50 \mu \text {s}$ , and  $V_{\mathrm{ ripple}}&lt; 7.4 \text {mV}$  when the  $I_{\max }$  ranges from 15 to 250 mA."/></item><item><title text="A 55-nm Three-Stage Operational Transconductance Amplifier With Single Cascode Miller Compensation for Large Capacitive Loads"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10296839"/><description text="With the scaling down of the transistor technology, intrinsic gains of the devices are continuously dropping.

To achieve a high dc gain, a gain enhancement (GE) circuit is used in the first stage to boost the overall voltage gain to above 100 dB. To obtain a stable frequency response, a cascode Miller compensation scheme together with the GE circuits are used to push the nondominant complex pole to higher frequency and adjust the  $Q$ -factor. The proposed three-stage OTA is implemented in a 55-nm low-power (LP) CMOS process and occupies an area of 0.005 mm2. A current consumption of  $157 \mu \text{A}$  can be measured with a supply voltage of 1.2 V. The measured results show that this three-stage OTA can achieve stable frequency and transient step responses when driving 2.5-to-30-nF capacitive loads.

Specifically, we design a novel conversion-free data format, expanding the single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) instruction set and optimizing the microarchitecture design to improve the performance. We also arrange the inference schedule to guarantee scalability on multicores. The experimental results show that the proposed accelerator maintains high multiply&#8211;accumulation (MAC) utilization for all common operators and achieves high performance with 4&#8211; $7\times $  speedup against NVIDIA RTX2080Ti GPU.

Moreover, these devices are constrained in terms of ON-chip storage, data transmission capacity, and power. Thus, handling a large amount of data is difficult with these devices, making it necessary to compress these data for storage and transmission. Lossless or near-lossless data compression solves this problem, ensuring that no relevant physiological/clinical information is lost in the compression process. Therefore, low-power, resource-efficient, and lossless VLSI architectures are proposed in this article to compress multichannel ECG/VCG data.

Therefore, in this article, we propose a methodology to design 3-D stacking synaptic memory for power-efficient operations and yield rate improvement of neuromorphic systems. In this proposed methodology, the synaptic weights are stacked on top of the processing elements (PEs), and these weights are split into multiple subsets placed in different layers. Furthermore, with the support of 3-D technology, the supply voltage of each layer can be controlled independently which leads to power reduction by scaling down or turning off the supply voltage of the memory layer(s) containing the least significant bits (LSBs) while maintaining acceptable accuracy. On top of that, this work also proposes a methodology to deal with the low yield rate issue by treating the defective memory cells as noises. In our evaluation with the CMOS 45 nm technology, the energy per synaptic operation (SOP) for MNIST classification, when undervolting two upper memory layers (from 1.1 to 0.8 V), reduces by 21.62% while the accuracy only reduces sightly by 0.51%.

To address these challenges, this article proposes TensorCache to reconstruct memory architecture with static random-access memory (SRAM)-based In-Cache Computing for efficient tensor computations in GPGPUs. It provides an innovative digital SRAM processing-in-memory (PIM) solution by transforming the cache array into large-scale PIM units, effectively mitigating the significant performance and energy consumption losses caused by data movement. To enable efficient hardware-software co-design for TensorCache, a decoupled architecture-based SRAM-PIM macro (SPM) is introduced at the hardware level, supporting in-memory bit-parallel comparison (IMBC) and near-memory radix-4 booth encoder (NRBE) for efficient mixed-precision floating-point (FP) tensor computations. At the software level, a programming model leveraging the GPGPU&#8217;s flexible programmability is proposed to bridge the gap between application demands and mismatched hardware/software interfaces.

Also, enhancing memory density is essential for implementing compact and efficient artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Implementing multiple states in a single memory cell decreases the resistance between states, making it difficult to sense the current. Thus, incorporating ADCs in multilevel cells (MLCs) further increases the design cost. This article proposes an ADC-less reprogrammable RRAM-based IMC architecture.

The potential performance drawbacks resulting from these link failures have become a critical challenge in the design of reliable network-on-chip (NoC) systems. Fault-tolerant routing algorithms have proven to be effective strategies for handling this issue by diverting packets away from failed links to prevent congestion. However, these algorithms often result in excessive packet diversion, especially in the presence of a higher failure rate, which can significantly constrain the network&#8217;s behavior. This article introduces a novel NoC design with reconfigurable multifunctional channels (RMC_NoC). This design dynamically adapts the channel functions in response to network conditions to ensure that packets from failed links follow their original paths. In addition, it presents a channel buffer bubble flow control mechanism that can resolve congestion by redistributing congested traffic within the channel buffer. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach ensures superior network communication even in the presence of permanent link failures, with minimal area overhead and power consumption. Moreover, our system exhibits lower latency and higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art fault-tolerant methods across various link failure rates.

PERA is applicable to different granularity from a multiplexer to a switch-matrix (SM) level. We examine the efficiency of the proposed architecture with different topologies, structures, and parameters of routing resources. We further propose a routing algorithm to reduce the scattered use of resources and hence to take advantage of opportunities of power gating in routing resources. Our experiments using a versatile place and route (VPR) toolset on the FPGA architecture similar to commercial chips over an extensive set of circuits from Microelectronics Center of North Carolina (MCNC), International Workshop on Logic Synthesis (IWLS), Verilog to routing (VTR), and Titan benchmarks indicate that PERA reduces the static power consumption by 43.3%. This improvement is obtained at the expense of 7.4% area overhead. PERA along with the optimized routing algorithm offers a total routing leakage power reduction of up to 64.9% when compared to nonpower-gating architectures and 6.9% when compared with the conventional routing algorithm across all benchmark circuits and architectures with various wire segment lengths.

To suppress the fractional spurs caused by the mismatches of the delay cells of an RO, an individual-delay-cell-controllable digital loop filter (IDC-DLF) was used to calibrate the mismatches. Since the IDC-DLF equalizes the intervals between the quadrature signals of the RO, it can also naturally guarantee a precise quadrature relationship without any additional calibration. The 1st-stage PLL was designed based on a subsampling architecture, and it used a digital-to-analog converter (DAC)-based quantization error ( ${Q}$ -error) cancellation, dual-clock-phase generator, and a third-order curve fitting digital predistortion (TCF-DPD) to achieve ultra-low phase noise.

To improve the power extraction, various interface circuits using a flip process have been proposed, such as synchronized switch harvesting on inductor (SSHI) rectifier and synchronized switch harvesting on capacitor (SSHC) rectifier. The flip process reduces the influence of large  $C_{\text {P}}$  and the charge loss by using external elements. However, to extract high power, each rectifier requires a bulky inductor with a high quality factor (Q) and numerous external capacitors, respectively, which increases the system&#8217;s volume.

Besides, a second-order fully passive NS SAR ADC is presented in the backend stage of the overall pipelined SAR architecture, which only calls for a single additional small-size input pair in the comparator, mitigating the noise penalty from the high-order passive NS scheme. Furthermore, a two-step floating inverter amplifier (FIA) is introduced, alleviating the severe gain variation over process-voltage-temperature (PVT) in the conventional one-step counterpart and eventually allowing the energy-efficient open-loop FIA to fit our architecture. With partial time interleaving, the ADC in a 28-nm CMOS process runs at 400 MS/s, achieving 25 MHz bandwidth and 77.2 dB nominal signal-to-noise-and-distortion-ratio (SNDR) with 8 $\times $  OSR. It consumes 2.03 mW power from a 1-V supply and exhibits a 178-dB Schreier figure-of-merit (FoMS). The SNDR of the ADC deviates less than 3-dB from the nominal performance within &#8722;24% to +18% gain error."/></item><item><title text="A 10-mW 10-ENoB 1-GS/s Ring-Amp-Based Pipelined TI-SAR ADC With Split MDAC and Switched Reference Decoupling Capacitor"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10238425"/><description text="This article presents a 12-bit 1-GS/s ring-amp-based analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with a pipelined and time-interleaved successive approximation register (TI-SAR) hybrid architecture.

A ring amplifier (ring-amp) is used in this architecture to significantly reduce the power of residue amplification by about ten times over a prior work. A high-speed PVT-robust ring-amp with split input by splitting the multiplying DAC (MDAC) is proposed to guarantee the performance of the ring-amp under low supply voltage. To improve the power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) of the reference buffer and lower the reference noise without degrading the reference settling speed, a switched reference decoupling capacitor (de-cap) technique is proposed. Flash ADC and backend successive approximation register (SAR) ADCs are also optimized to meet the challenging power efficiency requirement. The ADC implemented in a 28-nm CMOS process achieves 62.5-dB SNDR for Nyquist input.

This paper proposes a spatio-temporal video denoising co-processor to suppress an image sequence&#8217;s spatial and temporal noise. Temporal denoising is achieved by merging the current and previous frames at the pixel level in which the current frame is processed by a spatial filter. After exploiting noise estimation and motion detection, the Wiener filter calculates the merge ratio. Rather than buffering the entire previous frame, the JPEG-like codec can dynamically adjust the compression ratio through a predefined quantization table to satisfy the designed on-chip storage. The experimental results demonstrate that the spatio-temporal denoising co-processor can effectively eliminate the fluctuation of the grayscale value of the noise in videos. Simultaneously, the adaptive codec can reduce the storage space consumption for the frame buffer by at least 80% of the original size. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully integrated spatio-temporal denoising co-processor without any external memory. Additionally, the grayscale, RGB, and RAW versions of the co-processor are also implemented on the Stratix V FPGA platform and synthesized in 28nm CMOS technology."/></item><item><title text="A Low-Power Keyword Spotting System With High-Order Passive Switched-Capacitor Bandpass Filters for Analog-MFCC Feature Extraction"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10210692"/><description text="This paper presents a low-power high-accuracy key-word spotting (KWS) system based on analog passive switched-capacitor (SC) bandpass filters (BPF).

Unfortunately, such RZ DACs are significantly more sensitive to clock jitter than their non-return-to-zero (NRZ) counterparts, particularly at high clock rates, and they typically consume more than twice the power of comparable NRZ DACs. This paper proposes, demonstrates via simulation, and rigorously analyzes a calibration technique which circumvents the need for RZ pulse shaping by adaptively measuring and cancelling ISI over the DAC&#8217;s first Nyquist band.

Also, due to the reduction of hardware resources in the proposed model, it is possible to implement a much larger number of neurons (between 4 and 12 times) relative to the original model on a single zynq board."/></item><item><title text="Secure and Efficient Two-Party Quantum Scalar Product Protocol With Application to Privacy-Preserving Matrix Multiplication"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10190204"/><description text="Secure two-party scalar product (S2SP) is a promising research area within secure multiparty computation (SMC), which can solve a range of SMC problems, such as intrusion detection, data analysis, and geometric computations. However, existing quantum S2SP protocols are not efficient enough, and the complexity is usually close to exponential level. In this paper, a novel secure two-party quantum scalar product (S2QSP) protocol based on Fourier entangled states is proposed to achieve higher efficiency. Firstly, the definition of unconditional security under malicious models is given. And then, an honesty verification method called Entanglement Bondage is proposed, which is used in conjunction with the modular summation gate to resist malicious attacks. The property of Fourierentangled states is used to calculate the scalar product with polynomial complexity. The unconditional security of our protocol is proved, which guarantees the privacy of all parties. In addition, we design a privacy-preserving quantum matrix multiplication protocol based on S2QSP protocol. By transforming matrix multiplication into a series of scalar product processes, the product of two private matrices is calculated without revealing any privacy. Finally, we show our protocol&#8217;s feasibility in IBM Qiskit simulator."/></item><item><title text="Design of a Compact Superconducting RSFQ Register File"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10254238"/><description text="In comparison to the widely-used CMOS circuits, superconducting Rapid Single Flux Quantum (RSFQ) circuits offer advantages such as fast operating frequency and low power consumption, making them a potential direction for development in the post-Moore era of digital circuits. However, designing RSFQ CPUs faces challenges, one of which is the need for a compact register file. This is because, under current RSFQ circuit process conditions, the memory module typically occupies a large chip area. This paper proposes a newly-designed Write-controllable Non-Destructive Read Out cell (WNDRO) that can limit the data writing pulse input to change the internal state of the cell. Based on the WNDRO, a compact RSFQ register file is designed that can realize random, non-destructive data reading. Additionally, a global write strategy is applied to omit the data write routing circuit and the reset control module, and the circuit design of the read and write control module is optimized. In comparison to general designs, the proposed compact register file design will save a large number of Josephson Junctions and effectively reduce the chip area. Additionally, this paper proposes several optimization logic designs for RSFQ CPU designers as a reference."/></item><item><title text="Optimizing FPGA-Based DNN Accelerator With Shared Exponential Floating-Point Format"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10218392"/><description text="In recent years, low-precision fixed-point computation has become a widely used technique for neural network inference on FPGAs. However, this approach has some limitations, as certain neural networks are difficult to quantify using fixed-point arithmetic, such as those involved in super-resolution scaling, image denoising, and other scenarios that lack sufficient conditions for fine-tuning. Furthermore, deploying a floating-point precision neural network directly on an FPGA would lead to significant hardware overhead and low computational efficiency. To address this issue, this paper proposes an FPGA-friendly floating-point data format that achieves the same storage density as int8 without sacrificing inference accuracy or requiring fine-tuning. Additionally, this paper presents an FPGA-based neural network accelerator that is compatible with the proposed format, utilizing DSP resources to increase the number of DSP cascading from 7 to 16, and solving the back-to-back accumulation issue of floating-point numbers. This design achieves comparable resource consumption and execution efficiency to those of 8-bit fixed-point accelerators. Experimental results demonstrate that the accelerator proposed in this study achieves the same accuracy as the native floating point on multiple neural networks without fine-tuning, and remains high computing performance. When deployed on the Xilinx ZU9P, the performance achieves 4.072 TFlops at 250 MHz, which outperforms the previous works, including the Xilinx official DPU."/></item><item><title text="High-Throughput Rate-Flexible Combinational Decoders for Multi-Kernel Polar Codes"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10252139"/><description text="Polar codes have received growing attention in the past decade and have been selected as the coding scheme for the control channel in the fifth generation (5G) wireless communication systems. However, the conventional polar codes have only been constructed by binary ( $2\times 2$ ) kernel, which poses block length limitation to powers of 2. To attain more flexible block lengths, multi-kernel polar codes are proposed. In this paper, a combinational architecture for multi-kernel polar codes with high throughput is proposed based on successive cancellation decoding algorithm. The proposed scheme can decode pure-binary, pure-ternary ( $3\times 3$ ), and binary-ternary mixed polar codes. The decoder&#8217;s architecture is rate-flexible, meaning that a new code rate can be assigned to the decoder at every clock cycle. The proposed architecture is validated by FPGA implementation, and the results reveal that a code of size  $N=81$  achieves the coded throughput of 1664.5 Mbps. A Python-based polar compiler is also proposed to automatically generate the HDL modules for target decoders.

Hence, it is crucial to study quantum-resistant cryptosystems. After four rounds of evaluation, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has decided to standardize CRYSTALS-Kyber as one of the public-key post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms. In the hardware design of CRYSTALS-Kyber, the polynomial-related calculations are the most time-consuming. In this paper, we present a highly-efficient hardware architecture for CRYSTALS-Kyber. Firstly, we propose the CRYSTALS-Kyber-oriented conflict-free memory mapping scheme with two modes. Based on this scheme, we construct the mixed radix-2/4 NTT/INTT algorithm, which has no pre- or post-processing, for the first time. By using the &#8220;lazy-last-layer&#8221; trick, the available memory bandwidth of NTT is temporarily increased, and the average performance of NTT is improved. Besides, the point-wise-multiplication (PWM) is performed in a single memory bank by cooperating with the two modes of our memory mapping scheme. This avoids the waste of memory bandwidth, thus avoiding the usage of large FIFOs for the sampled data. Last, we propose an efficient modular multiplier for CRYSTALS-Kyber, and we merge the divide-by-2 operations in the finite field into modular adders and subtractors to reduce resource consumption. This design, which supports all three security levels, is implemented on Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA with 7.3k LUTs, 3.2k FFs, 2.2k Slices, 5 BRAMs, and 4 DSPs.

However, in order to completely cover the design space for today&#8217;s complicated circuits, supervised ML requires a large number of labeled samples which is time-consuming to provide. Furthermore, a separate dataset must be collected for each circuit topology making all other previously gathered datasets useless. In this paper, we first present a database including labeled and unlabeled data. We use neural networks to determine the behavior of complicated topologies by combining the more simple ones. By generating such unlabeled data, the time for providing the training set is significantly reduced compared to the conventional approaches. Using this database, we propose a fully-automated analog circuit generator framework, AnGeL. AnGeL performs all the schematic circuit design steps from deciding the circuit topology to determining the circuit parameters i.e. sizing. Our results show that for multiple circuit topologies, in comparison to the state-of-the-art works while maintaining the same accuracy, the required labeled data is reduced by 4.7x - 1090x. Also, the runtime of AnGeL is 2.9x - 75x faster."/></item><item><title text="A Compact Model of Threshold Switching Devices for Efficient Circuit Simulations"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10225437"/><description text="In this paper, we present a new compact model of threshold switching devices which is suitable for efficient circuit-level simulations.

This macro model was extended to develop a physical model that describes the processes that occur during the threshold switching. The physical model derived comprises a delay structure with few electrical components adjacent to the second junction. The delay model incorporates an internal state variable, which is crucial to transform the descriptive model into a compact model and to parameterize it in terms of electrical parameters that represent the component&#8217;s behavior.

This is based on the consideration that in many cases the conventional design of each subsystem equipped with only one controller cannot achieve stability and satisfactory bumpless transfer performance simultaneously. The upper level switching determines which subsystem to be active while the lower level switching chooses which controller from the two controllers of the active subsystem to be switched on. The dual design of the switching and controllers makes the closed-loop switched system asymptotically stable with a satisfactory bumpless transfer performance.

Nevertheless, the corresponding design is difficult to implement due to numerical issues. Thus, the method of asymptotic power series expansion is applied to provide an approximate solution to the regulator equation. Then, a time-continuous state feedback controller is designed by combining the Chang transformation approach and the low-gain feedback technique, which results in a semi-global bounded output regulation of the closed-loop system. Furthermore, to reduce control updates, a dynamic event-triggered control scheme is proposed which ensures the exclusion of Zeno behavior by maintaining a strictly positive time between any two triggering moments, regardless of the initial state of the system. Additionally, an observer-based event-triggered control scheme is proposed to cater to the practical scenario in which system state information is unavailable.

The interface provides the isolation channel for a main driver/power switch and the one for the control feedback of the dc-dc converter providing the isolated power supply. Driver and power control channels adopt an RF carrier of 2 GHz and 1.2 GHz, which are modulated by a pulse width modulated signal of 2 MHz and 0.5 MHz, respectively. The interface includes a continuously operating offset compensation approach, which overcomes not only the strong variations due to the large process tolerances of the GaN technology, but also offset drifts due to temperature variations. An accurate pulse width modulated signal with a large duty cycle variation in both channels was achieved. The isolation interface adopts a 6-V power supply, which delivers a quiescent current of 6.3 mA and 7.5 mA to the driver and power control channels, respectively, assuming a signal with a duty cycle of 50%."/></item><item><title text="The Intrinsic Communication in Power Systems: A New Perspective to Understand Synchronization Stability"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10224064"/><description text="The large-scale integration of converter-interfaced resources in electrical power systems raises new threats to stability which call for a new theoretical framework for modelling and analysis.

The considered system is reduced to a set of linear equations by expanding the involved functions in the triangular orthogonal polynomials. While the unknowns (system parameters) can now be obtained by solving the linear equations, however, it is an overdetermined system that is usually inconsistent. In addition, there is no guarantee that the estimated parameters will predict the states nicely outside the time range from which the samples are given. Hence, the upper bound on the error (in the state prediction) is minimized, which depends only on the system parameters and is obtained using the Parseval-Plancherel identity, Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, and the Mean Value theorem. Consequently, an optimization problem is set up to minimize the accumulated error subject to the set of linear equations. The proposed technique is validated numerically where the estimated parameters are found to be close to the true values."/></item><item><title text="A New Cycle-Node Commutator Approach for Stability Analysis of Switched Systems With Transfer-Restricted Switching"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10102653"/><description text="This brief proposes a new approach to addressing the global exponential stability (GES) of switched systems with all unstable subsystems under transfer-restricted switching.

The number of sensitive nodes is an essential performance metric for evaluating single event multiple node upset (SEMNU). The smaller the number of sensitive nodes, the less is the charge sharing between them, thereby lowering the possibility of SEMNU. This brief proposes a novel highly radiation tolerant with lowest sensitive nodes (HRLS) read circuit for differential spin orbit torque magnetic random access memory (DSOT-MRAM).

Previously, a fractional-order SD (FO-SD) has been designed to achieve a compromise between the robustness and the DF. However, this method may suffer from two limitations. First, it only considers the Jacobi-Anger expansion-based beampattern synthesis. Second, it cannot control the DF in spherically isotropic noise field. To address these problems, we propose a general approach to the design of the FO-SD, which is a linear combination of two SDs with the integer order that can be designed with any beampattern synthesis method. Moreover, the proposed approach is able to control the WNG and the DF in both spherically and cylindrically isotropic noise field.

Full sequence program or FSP can program multiple pages in a word line at a time, thereby improving write throughput. Unfortunately, large-grained FSP operations coarsely aggregate consecutive logical pages on the same word line, which adversely affects the parallelism and latency of read requests. Moreover, FSP smooths the program latencies for different types of pages, whereas the pages still exhibit various read latencies. Multiple read latencies and lower read parallelism noticeably deteriorate the completion efficiency of read requests: SSD performance is degraded. To address this issue, we propose an FSP data allocation scheme called FSPDA that incorporates the physical structure characteristics of multibit 3-D NAND, aiming to bolster the read performance of 3-D NAND Flash-based SSDs. FSPDA embraces two distinctive and vital features. First, according to the distance between logical pages, FSPDA allocates logical pages to specified parallel units and stipulates that consecutive logical pages must be assigned to different planes, thus improving read parallelism and data locality. Second, to further reduce read latency, FSPDA employs cache hits to determine hot and cold data to be placed to low-latency and high-latency pages, respectively. We compare FSPDA with two state-of-the-art schemes&#8212;OSPADA and single-operation-multiple-location&#8212;in terms of multiplane read (MPR) counts, read response time, and GC counts under eight real-world workloads.

We propose a new automated method, called TREAD- M3 D, that provides a near-optimal MONO3 D DNN accelerator architecture in terms of systolic array size, SRAM organization, partition across 3-D layers, and operating frequency, for a given DNN, optimization goal, and temperature constraint. TREAD- M3 D incorporates circuit- and architecture-level models to evaluate the power and performance characteristics of different partitions. Our method reveals valuable insights and enables tradeoff analysis for achieving high energy efficiency in MONO3 D systolic arrays. In comparison to recent works that adopt a fixed partition choice to design MONO3 D DNN systems, TREAD- M3 D yields up to 22% higher energy efficiency. Using TREAD- M3 D, we further demonstrate that temperature unawareness not only leads to infeasible configurations due to temperature violations but also over-estimates energy-delay-product benefits by up to 24%."/></item><item><title text="PcGC: A Parity-Check Garbage Collection for Boosting 3-D NAND Flash Performance"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10138612"/><description text="Garbage collection or GC running in the controller of 3-D NAND flash-based solid-state disks&#8212;SSDs&#8212;plays a critical role in the performance of storage systems. SSD manufacturers have developed various GC solutions based on internal data movement or IDM to mitigate the impacts of GC on request latency. Due to the circuit characteristics of flash memory, the existing IDM-based GC strategies are restricted by page parity during data movement: odd pages must be migrated to odd pages, and even pages to even pages. When migrating two consecutive pages with the same parity, the free page between the two migrated pages will be wasted after the migration is complete. This ever-increasing page waste problem inevitably deteriorates the storage space utilization of flash memory, thereby degrading the overall performance of 3-D NAND flash-based SSDs. To address this issue, we propose a parity-check GC scheme called PcGC to revamp SSD performance by alleviating page waste during GC. We build a parity-check unit in PcGC to facilitate checking the parity of migrated valid pages and destination pages. According to the parity results offered by the parity-check unit, PcGC dynamically adjusts the migration order of valid pages during the course of GC. In doing so, PcGC fundamentally averts page waste caused by the page parity restriction, thereby enhancing 3-D NAND flash performance. We quantitatively evaluate the performance of PcGC in terms of wasted pages, storage utilization, GC counts, write amplification, and average response time. We compare PcGC against the two state-of-the-art schemes&#8212;Amphibian and Tiny-tail flash (TTflash). The experimental results derived from the nine real-world workload traces unfold that compared with Amphibian and TTflash: 1) PcGC curtails the number of wasted pages by up to 91.4% with an average of 53.75%; 2) cuts back the number of GC counts by up to 52.2% with an average of 11.9%; and 3) slashes average write response time by up to 77.8% with an average of 13.0%."/></item><item><title text="Automatic Op-Amp Generation From Specification to Layout"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10185586"/><description text="The operational amplifier is a key building block in analog systems.

The behavioral-level description of the opamp is represented by the directed acyclic graph (DAG) and a customized variational graph autoencoder is proposed to embed the discrete graph representation into a low-dimensional continuous space. The topology of the opamp can thus be optimized in the latent space, which greatly improves the optimization efficiency. The sizing algorithm based on  ${g_{m}/I_{d}}$  methodology can guarantee the quality of transistor-level circuit implementation.

It addresses the challenges of the typically small number of examples for network training and the existence of multiple solutions, of which impractical values for integrated circuit implementation. We address these issues by restricting the learning to one component size at a time, thanks to a cascade of dedicated shallow neural networks (SNNs), where each network constrains the prediction of the next ones. Moreover, the SNNs are individually tuned by a genetic algorithm for the prediction order and accuracy. This reduction of the solution space at each step allows the use of small training sets, and the introduced constraints between SNNs handle component interdependencies. The method is successfully validated on three different types of RF microcircuits: 1) a low-noise amplifier (LNA); 2) a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO); and 3) a mixer, using 180 and 130-nm CMOS implementations. All the predictions were within 5% of the true values, both at the component and performance levels, and all the responses were obtained in less than 5 s, after 4 to 47 min.

A hybrid knowledge-guided and data-driven technique (HKDT) that combines prior knowledge of on-chip inductors with a machine learning approach is proposed for designing a millimeter-wave on-chip deformable spiral inductor (DSI). First, a DSI, whose shape is no longer limited to a regular polygon and can be adapted to any rectangular region, is presented. Next, an expanded Wheeler formula is proposed to estimate the inductance of the DSI. Then, two approximate expressions with fitting parameters are deduced for the frequency responses of the inductance and quality factor. After that, two prior knowledge-guided Gaussian process regression (GPR) surrogate models are presented for the inductance and quality factor, with which the feature dimensions of the training data can be significantly reduced. Both models can achieve higher prediction accuracies in the frequency range of interest with lower computational complexity than the traditional GPR model with frequency-domain features when they are used for machine learning-assisted optimization (MLAO). Finally, an automatic inductor synthesis method is implemented by using a multibranch MLAO algorithm, and two examples are presented to validate the proposed synthesis method and illustrate its great capabilities. Ultimately, the HKDT can be extended to and applied for the efficient synthesis of other circuit elements with high accuracy."/></item><item><title text="REX-SC: Range-Extended Stochastic Computing Accumulation for Neural Network Acceleration"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10146489"/><description text="Deep learning has grown in capability and size in recent years, prompting research on alternative computing methods to cope with the increased compute cost.

A key factor in the success of STL has been that of quantitative robustness, and the development of efficient algorithms for computing the robustness values over traces. The real-valued quantitative robustness of a signal with respect to an STL property quantifies the degree of satisfaction or violation of the property by the signal. In this work, we introduce a notion of robustness for a more expressive logic, timed STL (TSTL), which can be seen as timed propositional temporal logic (TPTL) with predicates defined over real-valued signals. This logic can express many natural engineering requirements that STL cannot. We also develop algorithms for computing this robustness value over traces in the pointwise semantics. While the robustness computation for general TSTL formulas is PSPACE-hard due to the PSPACE-hardness of the monitoring problem for TPTL, for the special case of one variable TSTL, a fragment of TSTL which is still more expressive than STL, we develop an optimized algorithm which computes robustness in time linear in the length of the trace.

In this article, we propose a scalable test generation framework to address the above challenges. Our threat model assumes that an adversary may exploit rare events consisting of rare signals (states) as well as rare branches (transitions). We show that the rare branch coverage problem can be mapped to the rare signal coverage problem.

Security evaluation in design stages, from a model or from a simulation, is complicated and hard to argue for correctness. Extensive literature exist on attacks utilizing EM signals. However, both frontiers of simulatability and modeling of the radiation have shown rather little research effort in the past in the SCA context. On simulatability prior work investigated utilization of complete EM physical solvers, such as COMSOL, HFSS which require much effort from the user/engineer to model the electronic environment, or alternatively used simulated (SPICE) currents within IC&#8217;s design kits and from it provide analytical estimation. On the modeling side, efforts were mainly limited to either: a specific EM component (e.g., magnetic), very limited scope of the model, or a limited connection with real-life IC. The main contributions of this research are: 1) providing a fully analytical model of the radiated signal considering the ground plane of the substrate and the medium change from oxidation layers to other mediums, such as air or plastic, utilizing EM theory-of-images for both E and H fields; 2) providing methodologies to simulate EM signals on IC-technologies (by adapting Cadence EMX tool); and 3) demonstrating little error between the analytical and simulated models and linking cryptographic SCA security metrics to the analytical tools.

They exploit the vulnerability of speculative execution to illegally access private data, and transmit them through timing-based covert channels. While new vulnerabilities are discovered continuously, the covert channels can be categorized to two types: 1) Persistent Type, in which covert channels are based on the layout changes of buffering, e.g., through caches or TLBs and 2) Volatile Type, in which covert channels are based on the contention of sharing resources, e.g., through execution units or issuing ports. The defenses against the persistent-type covert channels have been well addressed, while those for the volatile-type are still rather inadequate. Existing mitigation schemes for the volatile type such as Speculative Compression and Time-Division-Multiplexing will introduce significant overhead due to the need to stall the pipeline or to disallow resource sharing. In this article, we look into such attacks and defenses with a new perspective, and propose a scheduling-based mitigation scheme, called SpecWands. It consists of three priority-based scheduling policies to prevent an attacker from transmitting the secret in different contention situations. SpecWands not only can defend against both interthread and intrathread-based attacks but also can keep most of the performance benefit from speculative execution and resource-sharing. We evaluate its runtime overhead on SPEC 2017 benchmarks and realistic programs. The experimental results show that SpecWands has a significant performance advantage over the other two representative schemes."/></item><item><title text="Mex+Sync: Software Covert Channels Exploiting Mutual Exclusion and Synchronization"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10171237"/><description text="The mutual exclusion and synchronization mechanism (MESM) is a basic process management mechanism in modern operating systems.

However, the candidates of the first several subkeys shared by collision chains are still repeatedly detected, which happens very frequently and brings huge computational overhead. To alleviate this, we propose a highly efficient collision-optimized attack named collision tree (CoTree). This collision detection tool exploits tree structure to store the chains created from the same subchain on the same branch, thus significantly reducing the storage requirements. It then benefits from the properties of both tree and collisions and exploits a top-down tree building procedure and traverses each node only once when detecting their collisions with a candidate of the subkey currently under consideration. Finally, unlike the traditional top-down node removal, CoTree launches a bottom-up branch removal procedure to remove the chains unsatisfying the collision conditions from the tree after traversing all the considered candidates of this subkey, thus avoiding the traversal of the branches satisfying the collision condition. These strategies make our CoTree significantly alleviate the repetitive collision detection, and our experiments verify that it significantly outperforms the existing works."/></item><item><title text="Joint Protection Scheme for Deep Neural Network Hardware Accelerators and Models"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10143985"/><description text="Deep neural networks (DNNs) are utilized in numerous image processing, object detection, and video analysis tasks and need to be implemented using hardware accelerators to achieve practical speed. Logic locking is one of the most popular methods for preventing chip counterfeiting. Nevertheless, existing logic-locking schemes need to sacrifice the number of input patterns leading to wrong output under incorrect keys to resist the powerful satisfiability (SAT)-attack. Furthermore, the DNN model inference is fault tolerant. Hence, using a wrong key for those SAT-resistant logic-locking schemes may not affect the accuracy of DNNs. This makes the previous SAT-resistant logic-locking scheme ineffective on protecting DNN accelerators. Besides, to prevent DNN models from being illegally used, the models need to be obfuscated by the designers before they are provided to end-users. Previous obfuscation methods either require a long time to retrain the model or leak information about the model. This article proposes a joint protection scheme for DNN hardware accelerators and models. The DNN accelerator is modified using a hardware key (Hkey) and a model key (Mkey). Different from previous logic locking, the Hkey, which is used to protect the accelerator, does not affect the output when it is wrong. As a result, the SAT attack can be effectively resisted. On the other hand, a wrong Hkey leads to substantial increase in memory accesses, inference time, and energy consumption and makes the accelerator unusable. A correct Mkey can recover the DNN model that is obfuscated by the proposed method. Compared to previous model obfuscation schemes, our proposed method avoids model retraining and does not leak model information."/></item><item><title text="Security-Aware Resource Binding to Enhance Logic Obfuscation"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10178684"/><description text="Logic obfuscation mitigates the unauthorized use of design IP by untrusted partners during integrated circuit (IC) fabrication.

As a result, it has been shown to be difficult for obfuscation to inject sufficient gate-level error to derail application-level function while maintaining resilience to SAT-style attacks. In this work, we explore use of architectural knowledge during the resource binding phase of high-level synthesis to automate the design of locked architectures capable of high-corruption and SAT resilience simultaneously. To do so, we bifurcate logic obfuscation schemes into two families based on their error profile: distributed error locking and critical minterm locking. We then develop security-focused binding/locking algorithms for each locking family and use them to bind/lock 11 MediaBench benchmarks. For distributed error locking, our proposed security-aware binding algorithms designed locked circuits capable of corrupting a typical application for 52% more wrong keys than a circuit bound with conventional algorithms.

Flash storage vendors gradually adopt the high-density, low-reliability, and cost-efficient multiple-level cell (MLC) NAND flash memory chip as the major storage medium. Unfortunately, MLC NAND flash memory also brings about the critical issue of the high raw bit error rate. To resolve this issue, vendors adopt the more complex error correction code [such as low-density parity-check (LDPC)].

The performance of SpMV is mainly determined by the number of multiplications between nonzero matrix elements and the corresponding vector values per cycle. On the one side, the off-chip memory bandwidth limits the number of nonzero matrix elements transferred from the off-chip DDR to the FPGA chip per cycle. On the other side, the irregular vector access pattern poses challenges to fetch the corresponding vector values. Besides, the read-after-write (RAW) dependency in the accumulation process shall be solved to enable a fully pipelined design. In this work, we propose an efficient FPGA-based SpMV accelerator with data reuse-aware compression. The key observation is that repeated accesses to a vector value can be omitted by reusing the fetched data. Based on the observation, we propose a reordering algorithm to manually exploit the data reuse of fetched vector values. Further, we propose a novel compressed format called data reuse-aware compressed (DRC) to take full advantage of the data reuse and a fast format conversion algorithm to shorten the preprocessing time. Meanwhile, we propose an HLS-friendly accumulator to solve the RAW dependency. Finally, we implement and evaluate our proposed design on the Xilinx Zynq-UltraScale ZCU106 platform with a set of sparse matrices from the SuiteSparse matrix collection. Our proposed design achieves an average  $1.18\times $  performance speedup without the DRC format and an average  $1.57\times $  performance speedup with the DRC format w.r.t. the state-of-the-art work, respectively."/></item><item><title text="Resource- and Workload-Aware Model Parallelism-Inspired Novel Malware Detection for IoT Devices"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10164284"/><description text="The wide adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to better connectivity along with seamless communication and smart computation capabilities across the network. Despite being deployed widely across the globe, IoT devices are prominently exploited for security vulnerabilities due to the lack of inherent security measures. Among multiple threats, malicious applications also known as malware is a pivotal security threat for IoT devices. Lack of security traits and limited resources are the primary hindrances for the adoption of existing malware detection techniques in IoT devices. Furthermore, the existing techniques assume the availability of all the device resources for malware detection. However, for IoT devices deployed for critical real-world applications, the available on-device resources for a given task, including malware detection are minimal compared to the overall available resources. To address this primary challenge, this work introduces a novel resource- and workload-aware model-parallelism-inspired malware detection for IoT devices. The device first analyzes the available resources for malware detection using a lightweight regression model. Depending on the available resources, ongoing workload executions, and communication costs, the malware detection task is either performed on-device or offloaded to neighboring IoT nodes with sufficient resources. To ensure data integrity and user privacy, instead of offloading the whole malware detection, the classifier is partitioned and distributed over multiple nodes and further integrated at the parent node for malware detection. Experimental analysis shows that the proposed technique can achieve a speed-up of  $9.8\times $  compared to on-device inference while maintaining a malware detection accuracy of 96.7%."/></item><item><title text="NPRC-I/O: An NoC-Based Real-Time I/O System With Reduced Contention and Enhanced Predictability"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10168011"/><description text="All systems rely on inputs and outputs (I/Os) to perceive and interact with their surroundings.

However, with the continued growth of architectural complexity in modern safety-critical systems, satisfying such real-time requirements has become increasingly challenging due to complex I/O transaction paths and extensive hardware contention. In this article, we present a new Network-on-Chip (NoC)-based Predictable I/O system framework (NPRC-I/O) which reduces this contention and ensures the performance and time-predictability of I/O operations. Specifically, NPRC-I/O contains a programmable I/O command controller (NPRC-CC) and a run-time reconfigurable NoC ( $\text{R}^{2}$ NoC), which provides the capability to adjust I/O transaction paths at run time. Using this flexibility, we construct an end-to-end transmission latency analysis and an optimization engine that produces configurations for NPRC-I/O and the I/O traffic in a given system.

However, state-of-the-art works presented that the SSD always suffers from significant read performance degradation. One of the most critical reasons is access interference between read and write operations. This is because the read and write latency gaps are more pronounced for the latest nand flash in SSDs. In this article, an interference reduction scheme is proposed to improve performance. This is motivated by the observation from several server workloads, where read and write operations can be easily separated based on access characteristics. Considering that SSDs are always organized with many parallel units (PUs), the basic idea of this work is to partition the PUs of the SSD into different areas and place data in the corresponding area according to access characteristics. Then, the interference can be optimized by issuing read and write requests to the different areas. To realize the above design, several approaches are proposed: first, an access characteristic-based data placement and migration method is proposed for read and write request separation. Second, to further adapt the parallel requirement for different workloads, a workload-based partitioning scheme is proposed to determine the number of PUs for read and write areas. Finally, based on partitioned SSD, a hot-data driven wear-leveling method is further proposed to balance the wearing of PUs in read and write areas.

To address this issue, we propose EdgeCompress, a comprehensive compression framework to reduce the computational overhead of CNNs. In EdgeCompress, we first introduce dynamic image cropping (DIC), where we design a lightweight foreground predictor to accurately crop the most informative foreground object of input images for inference, which avoids redundant computation on background regions. Subsequently, we present compound shrinking (CS) to collaboratively compress the three dimensions (depth, width, and resolution) of CNNs according to their contribution to accuracy and model computation. DIC and CS together constitute a multidimensional CNN compression framework, which is able to comprehensively reduce the computational redundancy in both input images and neural network architectures, thereby improving the inference efficiency of CNNs. Further, we present a dynamic inference framework to efficiently process input images with different recognition difficulties, where we cascade multiple models with different complexities from our compression framework and dynamically adopt different models for different input images, which further compresses the computational redundancy and improves the inference efficiency of CNNs, facilitating the deployment of advanced CNNs onto embedded hardware.

The NoCs are used in multi/many-core processors; this domain is experiencing increased threats because of hardware Trojan (HT) embedded in the multicore processing systems due to the presence of third-party entities in the system-on-chip (SoC) design pipeline. Protecting user and system level privacy becomes important in such multi core systems to enable trust. By embedding an HT in an NoC, the adversary can snoop on important insights regarding the applications executing on the system or the user profile information. An attack of such calibre can compromise privacy, thereby enabling more advanced attack on the entire system. This work demonstrates the capability of a traffic analysis attack when a few HTs are embedded in the NoC switches of a multi/many-core processor. The attack is capable of exposing sensitive information to an external malicious attacker who can then analyze the payload data with sophisticated machine learning (ML) techniques to infer the applications executing on the system. We also evaluate the performance of a generative adversarial network (GAN) strengthened attacker model that offers more robustness for data paucity scenarios. We propose a simulated annealing-based randomized routing algorithm based defense for NoCs, thus thwarting the attack.

Besides, the cost of message flow graph construction is large and may account for more than 50% of the total delay; 2) the feature aggregation has a large amount of data access and relatively small amount of computation, which leads to low on-chip data reuse, only 10% of dense computing; and 3) without the optimization of sparse computing units, simple memory bank and cross bar architecture can easily lead to bank access conflict and load imbalance, reducing the utilization of computing units to less than 60%. In order to solve the above problems, we propose a algorithm-hardware co-design scheme to accelerate GNN inference, which includes three technologies: 1) a reuse-aware sampling method is proposed for minibatch inference scenarios, which reduces 30% of the calculation and improves the on-chip reusability of local data; 2) through the nodewise parallelism-aware quantization, the features and weights are quantized to integers with eight or four bits, which reduces the amount of memory access by at least four times; and 3) an accelerator supporting the above technologies is designed and evaluated, and different operations are supported by the sampling-inference integration architecture. The multibank on-chip memory pool is designed to support data reuse, and edge stream reordering is used to reduce data access conflicts, improving the utilization of computing units by  $1.5\times $ . Combined with the above technologies, the experiments show that our design achieves  $9.2\times $  speedup and  $29\times $  energy efficiency improvement compared with the Deep Graph Library framework running on servers equipped with CPU and GPU."/></item><item><title text="Partial Sum Quantization for Reducing ADC Size in ReRAM-Based Neural Network Accelerators"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10179130"/><description text="While resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) crossbar arrays have the potential to significantly accelerate deep neural network (DNN) training through fast and low-cost matrix&#8211;vector multiplication, peripheral circuits like analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) create a high overhead. These ADCs consume over half of the chip power and a considerable portion of the chip cost. To address this challenge, we propose advanced quantization techniques that can significantly reduce the ADC overhead of ReRAM crossbar arrays (RCAs). Our methodology interprets ADC as a quantization mechanism, allowing us to scale the range of ADC input optimally along with the weight parameters of a DNN, resulting in multiple-bit reduction in ADC precision. This approach reduces ADC size and power consumption by several times, and it is applicable to any DNN type (binarized or multibit) and any RCA size. Additionally, we propose ways to minimize the overhead of the digital scaler, which is an essential part of our scheme and sometimes required. Our experimental results using ResNet-18 on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our method can reduce the size of the ADC by 32 times compared to ISAAC with only a minimal accuracy loss degradation of 0.24%.

However, the conventional early exit works have suffered from the large size of branches, whose memory access energy is significantly large compared to that of the main network. In this article, we propose a low-cost early exit network (LoCoExNet), which significantly improves energy efficiencies by reducing the parameters used in inference with efficient branch structures. To further reduce the energy consumption of branches, based on the observation that the classification difficulties of the images can be predicted using the magnitudes of input activations, we also propose hardware-friendly dynamic branch pruning (DBP). Given the network and target dataset, we can construct an energy-efficient early exit network through the branch structure determination algorithm and DBP algorithm. Finally, we develop several architectural supporting modules to improve the energy efficiency of the proposed LoCoExNet with DBP. The experimental results show that the LoCoExNet uses 28.7% of the total network parameters on average for Tiny-ImageNet dataset using VGG-16 without accuracy loss. The CNN accelerator that implements LoCoExNet with DBP has been implemented using the 65nm CMOS process.

Multicast communication is popularly used in parallel applications on chip. However, existing researches for multicast in ONoC mainly focus on the optimization of one multicast. This limits the practical applications of the research outcomes because we often face the dynamic formation of multiple multicast groups in real network systems. In this article, we define the problem of routing and wavelength assignment for multiple multicasts in ONoC with the objective of minimizing the number of wavelengths required. To solve the problem, we first formulate it as an integer programming model for general topologies. Then we design routing policies for special instances that optimally use only one wavelength on mesh topology. For general instances, we design a group-partitioning routing algorithm for multiple multicasts (GPRMM). GPRMM decouples a group of multicasts into a number of subgroups, each of which matching one of the special instances. Theoretical results show that the number of wavelengths required by GPRMM is no more than the Destination Density  $\sigma _{d}$ , i.e., the maximum number of multicasts with destinations in the same row or column. Moreover, we find the upper bound and the lower bound on the number of wavelengths required for GPRMM. The wavelength requirement is also upper bounded by the network size  $n$  for an  $n\times n$  mesh network. Simulation results show that GPRMM can reduce the number of wavelengths by 26.7% compared with previous methods. GPRMM has the advantages of low routing complexity, low wavelength requirement, low power consumption, and good scalability."/></item><item><title text="A Triple-Memristor Hopfield Neural Network With Space Multistructure Attractors and Space Initial-Offset Behaviors"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10158420"/><description text="Memristors have recently demonstrated great promise in constructing memristive neural networks with complex dynamics.

The complex dynamical behaviors of the triple-memristor Hopfield neural network (TM-HNN), which have never been observed in previous Hopfield-type neural networks, include space multistructure chaotic attractors and space initial-offset coexisting behaviors. Bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponents, phase portraits, Poincar&#233; maps, and basins of attraction are used to reveal and examine the specific dynamics. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation show that the number of space multistructure attractors can be adjusted by changing the control parameters of the memristors, and the position of space coexisting attractors can be changed by switching the initial states of the memristors. Extreme multistability emerges as a result of the TM-HNN&#8217;s unique dynamical behaviors, making it more suitable for applications based on chaos. Moreover, a digital hardware platform is developed and the space multistructure attractors as well as the space coexisting attractors are experimentally demonstrated.

To address this drawback, we propose a few analytical solutions for calculating the transient stress evolution and void volume in straight multisegment interconnect trees during the post-voiding phase. By employing the Laplace transform, the proposed method aims at solving coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) governed by physics-based EM modeling. The analytical solutions can be tailored to expressions with required accuracy and computational savings, leading to a compact end-to-end system providing results of EM failure effects at arbitrary time instances and locations of interconnect trees with varying geometry under time-dependent current and temperature stressing. The EM lifetime such as the incubation time, related to the void volume evolution, at any desired precision, can be calculated by the analytical solutions.

Some methods utilize performance models without performing RTL simulation to obtain rough simulation performance and have a large speedup. However, they do not support functional verification. In order to address the problems, we propose a loop-oriented RTL simulation acceleration approach based on code instrumentation for designs synthesized by high-level synthesis. Our approach reduces the RTL simulation time by skipping a large number of repeated loop iterations, and maintains high accuracy for the prediction of the number of cycles by reserving some loop iterations. We establish a performance prediction model and an interval value formula for skipping loop iterations. We conduct experiments on the MachSuite benchmark. The results show that for the RTL simulation of single data processing and batch data processing, the average speedup of our approach can reach  $7.49\times $  and  $43.3\times $ , respectively, and the average prediction errors of the number of cycles are 1.71% and 1.06%, respectively.

Recent I/O isolation approaches eliminate CPU switching, I/O interference, and lock contention for I/O queues by pinning I/O threads in isolated and dedicated I/O paths. However, they degrade the overall performance of mixed workloads with heterogeneous I/O demands. The I/O-intensive workloads issue multiple I/O requests and quickly fill up their dedicated I/O queues, resulting in I/O wait. On the contrary, the non-I/O-intensive workloads cannot deliver enough I/O requests to saturate their associated I/O queues. Moreover, frequent allocations and deallocations of I/O request objects expose a significant overhead for I/O-intensive workloads.

EBIO contains an on-demand queue management strategy (ODQM) and a reusable I/O management strategy (RERM). Specifically, ODQM eliminates I/O wait by dynamically adding queues for I/O-intensive workloads and leverages I/O generation time to guarantee strong sequential consistency and fairness in scheduling I/O requests. RERM reduces the overhead caused by repeatedly allocating I/O request objects for I/O-intensive workloads by reusing the allocated objects.

However, due to the skyrocketing design complexity, in practice, it is hard for requirement engineers to accurately construct requirement models with expected timing behaviors using CCSL, especially, for safe timing behaviors. Although more and more CCSL synthesis approaches are designed to facilitate the generation of CCSL specifications, most of them cannot be used directly for the synthesis of requirements models. This is because existing CCSL synthesis methods: 1) focus on filling the holes of CCSL constraints rather than completing requirements models and 2) rely heavily on limited observations of system behaviors, while the (temporal) safety properties of target systems are neglected. To address these issues, this article proposes a novel method that enables the automated synthesis of safe timing behaviors for requirements models. By specifying the safety timing properties of target systems using safely-LTL, our approach adopts CCSL as an intermediate representation of requirement synthesis, where incomplete requirements models coupled with safely-LTL-based properties are encoded into CCSL constraints with holes. Guided by the samples (expected behaviors) provided by requirement engineers, our approach can automatically figure out the complete version of incomplete requirements models. Comprehensive experimental results on two complex case studies demonstrate that our approach can not only quickly and efficiently synthesize requirement models but also guarantee that the synthesized models satisfy specified safety properties in Safely-LTL form."/></item><item><title text="Realization and Hardware Implementation of Gating Units for Long Short-Term Memory Network Using Hyperbolic Sine Functions"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10175619"/><description text="This article proposes a new activation function (AF)  $\mathrm {sinh}(\beta x) + \mathrm {sinh}^{-1}(\beta x)$  called combined hyperbolic Sine (comb-H-sine) to replace existing AFS like  $\sigma $  and  $\tanh $  in long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks.

This article proposes a novel wear-leveling technique that covers the entire buffer without being constrained by specific applications. We introduce metadata characteristic-aware allocation (MCAA), which utilizes an appropriate hot data detection scheme depending on the type of update pattern on metadata. We also propose unified wear-leveling (UWL) that hierarchically integrates the wear-leveling techniques of each partition, including MCAA. The proposed method improves the maximum write count by 39.3% and the standard deviation of the wear-out by 25.9% on average compared to the conventional technique."/></item><item><title text="2023 Index IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems Vol. 42"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10332916"/><description text="null"/></item><item><title text="IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems publication information"/><link text="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10325367"/><description text="null"/></item></channel></rss>
