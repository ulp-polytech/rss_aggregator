However, the practical realization of the capacitor bank remains largely qualitative and dependent on the opaque performance capabilities of the capacitor technology. This work presents an exhaustive survey of commercial aluminum electrolytic capacitors and defines both quantitative and justly comparative device-level figures-of-merit (FOM). By configuring the relative voltage ripple ratio specification $\alpha$ of the dc bus, these device FOM enable the determination of minimal dc-link capacitor volume, cost, and/or mass. Graphical illustration demonstrates that the set of commercially available yet viable components diminishes as specification $\alpha$ increases; the realized dc-link capacitor bank volume and cost will grow appreciably for ${\alpha &gt;\!10\,{\%}}$ and ${\alpha &gt;\!5\,{\%}}$, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Enhanced Modeling of Wireless Power Transfer System With Battery Load</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10440500</link><description>This article presents an enhanced mathematical model for the wireless power transfer (WPT) system with a battery load and uncontrolled rectifier at the receiver side. The WPT system is decomposed into two subcircuits using the superposition theorem. By calculating the phase difference between the fundamental wave of the inverter output voltage and that of the rectifier input voltage, various electrical parameters including voltage, current, power, efficiency, and input impedance angle are derived. In addition, the effect of rectifier parasitic capacitance is also considered. To demonstrate its precision, the proposed model is compared with the constant-resistance and variable-resistance load models using numerical simulation software (SIMULINK) as a reliable reference. Finally, simulation and experiments are carried out to validate the theoretical analysis.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Single Isolation Channel Gate Driver With Bidirectional-Signal and Forward-Power Transmission</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443551</link><description>Conventional isolated gate drivers adopt separate isolation channels for gate driver signal and isolated power supply, which suffers from large signal delays, large size, and high cost at medium-voltage (MV) and high-voltage (HV) applications. Gate drivers with single isolation channel were proposed but suffered from gate driver power instability and limited duty-cycle range. A novel compact single isolation channel with bidirectional-signal and forward-power transmission gate driver is proposed in this letter. Gate driver signal is modulated by pulse edge modulation and transmitted through flyback converter with time-division multiplexing. Feedback signal is modulated by amplitude modulation and demodulated based upon the voltage proportional relationship between primary and secondary sides of a flyback transformer. 3D vertical packaging is adopted with an overall size of 20 mm&#215;17 mm&#215;16 mm. The proposed gate driver achieves max. driving current of 13.8 A and can drive silicon carbide devices with max. dv/dt of 154 V/ns. It can support max. gate driver signal frequency of 100 kHz with duty cycle ranging from 7.5% to 92.5%. Feedback signal transmission is also demonstrated by the desaturation circuit.</description></item><item><title>A Method to Reduce PDN Impedance Based on Multicapacitor Loop Coupling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10449441</link><description>As the target impedance of the power delivery network decreases, the demand for output decoupling capacitors proportionally increases. Parasitic inductance of the vias connecting the output capacitors to the motherboard has a more serious impact on the impedance design of power deliver network. To solve this problem, this letter proposes a novel layout method to reduce the value of parasitic inductance associated with the vias. The proposed method utilizes the coupling effect between the vias to reduce the equivalent inductance. Therefore, the proposed method is not only simple and easy to implement, but also saves space and cost by reducing the number of decoupling capacitors. Two 200-W experimental prototypes were fabricated to compare the conventional solution with the proposed reverse coupling method. The decoupling capacitance of the prototype using the reverse-coupled structure is 25.6% lower than the prototype using conventional forward-coupled method.</description></item><item><title>A Simplified DC-Bias Injection Method for Characterizing Power Magnetics Using a Voltage Mirror Transformer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10460202</link><description>This letter presents a simplified dc-bias injection circuit utilizing a voltage mirror transformer configured in a unique way for improved equipment applicability and measurement accuracy. A mirror transformer can minimize the impact of the reflected actuation voltages on the dc source and improve the quality of the dc-bias injection. By combining the dc-bias and ac-actuation current, the traditional three-winding dc-bias measurement setup was simplified with improved accuracy and reduced equipment complexity. The dc-bias injection circuit was implemented as a part of a highly automated data acquisition system designed for fast and accurate characterization of power magnetic materials under a wide range of operating conditions.</description></item><item><title>High-Resolution Inductor Current Estimation Algorithm for Digital Controlled Buck Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10460196</link><description>With the demand for the fast transient response of the voltage regulator module, current mode controls are used to achieve high-bandwidth control, which brings the need for inductor current feedback. The inductor current sampling is one of the major issues in digital control, because of the complex current sensing circuit and sampling noise, as well as the increasing design complexity and cost in multiphase applications. In this letter, a high-resolution current estimation algorithm is proposed, which samples the input and output voltages and calculates the inductor current by digital filter. The current estimation algorithm makes it possible to avoid using the high-speed analog-to-digital converter to obtain the inductor current for close-loop control. Compared with existing current estimation research, this letter proposes a high-resolution approach, applies the delay line structure, and significantly improves the estimation accuracy at steady state under various load conditions and load step transient in low-voltage and high-current applications. The high-resolution scheme is implemented by Xilinx FPGA and verified on the multiphase buck system. The experimental results show that the estimation is accurate within 3.8% and 1% under the light and heavy loads, respectively. The proposed scheme is also compared with the up-to-date research to prove the advancement.</description></item><item><title>Enhanced Maximum Power Point Reaching Method for Passive Magnetic Energy Harvesters Operating Under Low Primary Currents</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10470376</link><description>The letter concerns a clamped-type passive magnetic energy harvester (MEH), supplying power to a general load via a diode bridge rectifier (DBR). It is known that a certain value of output MEH voltage (referred to as optimal) maximizes harvested power. Under high primary current magnitudes, the optimal voltage value is constant, i.e., current-independent. Consequently, it was recently proposed to interface a passive MEH to a general load via a switching power converter whose input (i.e., MEH-side) voltage is regulated to a corresponding constant voltage reference, realizing the maximum power point reaching (MPPR) method. However, optimal voltage value becomes current-dependent under low primary current magnitudes. As a result, the power harvested by MPPR-operated MEH becomes suboptimal if the MEH-side voltage reference of the converter remains unchanged. Hence, the brief suggests allowing the converter input voltage reference value to be adjusted (by, e.g., a maximum power point tracking loop) to maximize harvested MEH power under low primary currents as well. Experimental results comparing the harvested power of a passive MEH under classical and enhanced MPPR methods validate the proposed enhancement.</description></item><item><title>A Dual-Coupled Double-LCC System With the Capability of Misalignment Tolerance Improvement for Wireless Charging Substation Inspection Robots</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10465261</link><description>This article presents a wireless power transfer system for substation inspection robots. Employing a dual-coupled double inductor&#8211;capacitor&#8211;capacitor (LCC&#8211;LCC) compensation topology, the system aims to address the prevalent challenge of misalignment tolerance improvements. It reveals that the system's output is predominantly influenced by the denominator parameter (i.e., &#955;), which is the sum of two dominant factors (i.e., &#955;1 and &#955;2). Specifically, with larger misalignment, the changing trends of &#955;1 and &#955;2 are opposite. As a result, their sum (&#955;) can remain constant by balancing the decrement (increment) in &#955;1 with the increment (decrement) in &#955;2, thereby achieving a relatively stable power transfer during a certain misalignment range. An experimental prototype is built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed system. The experimental results show that the output current is stable regardless of load variations, and it can also remain stable within the misalignment range of &#8722;100 to 100 mm in y-axis and 50 to 90 mm in z-axis.</description></item><item><title>A Dual-Output Rectifier-Based Self-Powered Interface Circuit for Triboelectric Nanogenerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10470387</link><description>Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) offer a cost-effective solution for harvesting energy in Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, their practical application is limited due to extremely high output voltage and low intrinsic capacitance, alongside the nonself-powered nature of current interface circuits and low transfer efficiency resulting from output voltage asymmetry. Addressing these issues, this letter introduces a dual-output rectifier-based interface circuit, innovatively designed to rectify TENG output into two distinct voltage magnitudes, optimizing for energy harvesting and switching generation. The experimental results validate our approach, showing gains of 2.75 and 2.34 times in terms of maximum output power over a full-wave rectifier (FWR)-based design at 2 and 3 Hz, respectively. Furthermore, under identical frequency and load conditions (1 M&#937; at 2 and 3 Hz), the output gains reached 152 and 160 times that of the FWR. Our approach brings about a significant advancement in TENG integration for low-frequency and low-load IoT devices. This letter is accompanied by two videos demonstrating the charge response of 1 M&#937; load at 2 and 3 Hz, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Active Voltage Balancing With Seamless Integration Into Dual Gate Driver for Series Connection of SiC Mosfets</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10477920</link><description>The versatility of half-bridge configuration of silicon carbide (SiC) metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (mosfet) power module contributes to its widespread adoption, highlighting the popularity and significance of its corresponding dual gate driver (D-GD) design. For use in high-voltage converter designs, configuring the half-bridge module as series connection with effective voltage balancing (VB) can make it aggregated into a single device with double voltage rating. Hence, in this letter, a novel active VB scheme with seamless integration into D-GD is proposed. Different from existing passive VB methods with significant loss and active VB strategies with high cost and complexity, the proposed active VB circuitry only consists of few low-voltage and low-power bipolar junction transistors (BJTs), resistors, and capacitors, which offers the prominent advantages of ease of implementation and integration, low cost, and high reliability. Analysis is provided to illustrate the working principle, followed by the criterion for parameter selection. Finally, the experimental results based on a 3.3-kV half-bridge SiC mosfet power module are given to demonstrate operational performances.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Analysis of Switched-Capacitor Converters With Finite Terminal Capacitances</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10254453</link><description>In pre-existing analytical models of switched-capacitor (SC) converters, the input and output capacitances ($C_{\text{in}}$ and $C_{\text{out}}$) have long been assumed to be infinitely large so that the input and output can be modeled as ideal voltage sources. However, in practice, the terminal capacitances can be insufficient to ensure ideal input and output behaviors due to space and cost constraints. This article reveals that finite terminal capacitances can have considerable effects on the output impedance ($R_{\text{out}}$) and overall efficiency of SC converters. A general modeling and analysis methodology is proposed for SC converters to characterize the effects of finite terminal capacitances quantitatively. A 2-to-1 SC converter prototype is specially designed to verify the proposed general output impedance model. The relative error between the modeling results and the experimental measurements is less than 8%, which demonstrates the excellent accuracy of the proposed model. It is revealed that the insufficiency in $C_{\text{in}}$ can lead to a considerably higher $R_{\text{out}}$ and harm the overall efficiency. On the contrary, decreasing $C_{\text{out}}$ can counter-intuitively help reduce $R_{\text{out}}$, which contributes to both higher efficiency and higher power density, although this benefit comes at the cost of a larger output voltage ripple. In addition, $C_{\text{out}}$ has a stronger effect on $R_{\text{out}}$ in the slow switching region, while $C_{\text{in}}$ is more influential in the fast switching region, especially around the knee of the output impedance curve, which is the typical operating point of SC converters. Several design guidelines are provided based on these findings. Further discussions are provided to explain how to apply the proposed general output impedance model to arbitrary SC topologies.</description></item><item><title>Electro-Thermo-Mechanical Analysis and Modeling of High-Power Intergrated Gate Commutated Thyristors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10423143</link><description>As a high-power electronic device, intergrated gate commutated thyristor (IGCT) has the characteristics of strong turn off, high surge capability, and high withstand voltage ability, which makes it receive more and more attention and be used more widely, such as circuit breakers and inverters. However, since IGCTs is a whole-wafer device, the current distribution and junction temperature distribution inside the chip cannot be measured, making it impossible to obtain the status of the chip and increasing the risk of device failure. In this case, the margin of the chip can only be increased to avoid failure and improve the reliability of the device, which greatly increases the cost of the device. This article proposes a new method to study the physical characteristics of IGCT chips by establishing the split-ring modeling. First, the characteristic of cells is studied to prove the necessity and effectiveness of split-ring model. Then, the electrical, thermal and pressure characteristics of the chip were studied, and their coupling effects were analyzed. Finally, a multiphysics coupling model was proposed to analyze the current and temperature distribution of IGCT under different working conditions. Experiments were conducted to verify the accuracy of the model.</description></item><item><title>Decoupling Model Predictive Controlled Three-Level Noninverting Buck&#8211;Boost Converter Applied in DC Energy Storage System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10444035</link><description>To solve the bidirectional power control issue under wide range voltage changes on both sides of the dc bus and energy storage battery in the dc energy storage system, this article proposes a multiobjective decoupling model predictive control (MPC) (MOD-MPC) strategy for the three-level noninverting Buck&#8211;Boost converter (TLNBC). The mathematical model of TLNBC based on the voltage difference of split capacitors is first studied, solving the problem of multi branch modeling of split capacitor voltage. On this basis, a MOD-MPC power control strategy with dual-carrier modulation method is proposed by analyzing the relationship between system current and split capacitor voltage sharing control. The optimal control variables solution is directly obtained by solving the cost function, achieving independent control of system current and split capacitor voltage sharing, and greatly reducing computational load. The decoupling MPC controlled TLNBC can operate in Buck and Boost modes when energy is transmitted in any direction catering to various scenarios while exhibiting favorable control performance. The effectiveness of the converter and control strategy is verified through experiments.</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid Current Balancing Method for Multiple Paralleled SiC-MOSFET Half-Bridge Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10444987</link><description>The parallel connection of silicon carbide (SiC)-mosfet modules can effectively increase the rated current of modules, however, the related current imbalance issue will affect the performance of the system. To solve this problem, this article proposes a hybrid current balancing method for multiple paralleled SiC-mosfet half-bridge modules, which can balance the transient current and steady-state current of the modules, simultaneously. First, the operating principles of the current balancing circuit are analyzed, and multiple toroidal magnetic cores with additional windings and dc current compensator are utilized to suppress the transient imbalance currents. Then, a novel current detection circuit is introduced to capture the steady-state imbalance current of the modules. Based on the obtained unbalanced currents, the steady-state currents of the modules are finally balanced by using a closed-loop active pulse width modulation (PWM) edge regulation method. The proposed hybrid current balancing method does not require high-bandwidth high-precision current sensors and introduces negligible reactive power to the system. It can be easily extended to more paralleled modules and employed in dc&#8211;dc converters. The effectiveness of the proposed method is experimentally verified by a prototype with three paralleled 1200 V/120 A SiC-mosfet half-bridge modules. The results show that with the proposed method, both the transient current and steady-state current are well balanced.</description></item><item><title>Multiphase Constant On-Time Control With Phase Overlapping&#8212;Part I: Small-Signal Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10444984</link><description>Multiphase voltage regulators (VRs) that power multicore processors must have a fast load transient response and good light-load efficiency. Multiphase current-mode constant on-time (COT) control based on pulse distribution method eliminates the phase-locked loops and interleaves the phases through a simple phase manager. Hence, power management industries widely use this control to meet VR requirements with reduced complexity. To handle large load currents, the VR's phase count continues to increase. With increased phase count, these converters operate with overlapping phases within the practical duty cycle range. This article finds that the total current exhibits variable on-time and off-time modulation under a small sinusoidal perturbation in the phase-overlapping region. Hence, the small-signal model of the single-phase COT control does not apply in this region. Therefore, Part I of this article presents a general small-signal model of this control applicable to the whole duty cycle range using the describing function method. Also, the proposed model is verified using SIMPLIS simulations and experimental results from a six-phase COT-controlled buck platform. Part II of this article identifies that the total current loop of this control will become unstable with overlapping phases and derives the critical conditions for stability using the model from Part I.</description></item><item><title>A Capacitor Fault-Tolerant Scheme for Dual-Active-Bridge DC/DC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10448545</link><description>Recently, dual-active-bridge (DAB) dc/dc converters have been widely utilized in renewable energy systems. Lots of research work on the optimization of DAB converters have been conducted, including novel topologies, modulation schemes, control schemes, and fault-tolerant schemes for active switches or riding-through, etc. However, there is a limited fault-tolerant scheme developed for capacitor failure in DAB converters so far due to the low-device redundancy. To address this important issue, a capacitor fault-tolerant scheme is proposed in this article. With the proposed scheme, the DAB converter can maintain power transfer sustainability even if the port capacitors break down. Besides, potential voltage spikes can also be suppressed by the proposed scheme when the snubber function of port capacitors is lost. Subsequently, the modulation scheme, topology characters, and control scheme are elaborated in this article. Finally, the experimental results based on a scale-down laboratory prototype are presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed fault-tolerant scheme.</description></item><item><title>A Dual-Level Optimal Control Strategy for Offshore Microgrid Considering Efficiency and Operation Cost in Wide Load Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10449413</link><description>Both efficiency and operation cost are the key to offshore microgrids operation. At the same time, due to the lack of external energy support, the paralleled converters in offshore microgrids often needs to handle the operation in a wide load range. In that case, this article proposes a dual-level optimal control framework to improve overall operation performance of offshore microgrid with paralleled converters within a wide load range. First, a normalized nonlinear relationship between power loss and operation cost of paralleled converters is established. Based on it, a multiobjective optimal function is established. Then, the optimal operation condition is derived by Lagrange multiply method with the established converter performance index. Furthermore, optimal power sharing considering both efficiency and operation cost is proposed at first level. Then, second level control is proposed to improve system performance in a wide load range. The proposed decentralized dispatch strategy is realized by a consensus protocol mechanism with the mealy machine based on the established performance index. Experiment results in a scaled-down prototype are given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed dual-level control strategy. The proposed strategy is able to optimize performance of paralleled converters under different power profiles.</description></item><item><title>Four-Degree-of-Freedom Hybrid Control Strategy for the Neutral-Point Voltage of Three-Level NPC Multiphase Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10449421</link><description>The three-level neutral-point-clamped (NPC) multiphase inverter, which combines three-level converter technology with multiphase motor technology, is the main direction to improve the system capacity at present. To control the neutral-point (NP) voltage, this article analyzes the degrees of freedom (DoF) of NP voltage control of a three-level NPC multiphase inverter, which includes zero-sequence voltage, the number of zero-level disassembly phases, zero-level disassembly phase, and the extent of zero-level disassembled. Meanwhile, the influence of four DoF on the NP current is deduced, and a 4-DoF hybrid control strategy is presented. The 4-DoF hybrid control strategy can maximize the control ability of the NP voltage by injecting the zero-sequence voltage and disassembling the zero level of each phase. Therefore, the 4-DoF hybrid control strategy can eliminate the deviation of NP voltage without significantly increasing the system switching frequency and improve the dynamic balance ability of NP voltage. The proposed 4-DoF hybrid control strategy is verified by experiment.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical State-of-Charge Balancing and Second-Harmonic Current Suppressing Control With a Scalable DC Reconfigurable Battery Pack</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10449456</link><description>This article presents a hierarchical balancing architecture for the dc reconfigurable battery pack (RBP) with a modular design. The battery cells in the RBP are divided into several modules, and each module is equipped with a slave controller that is only responsible for a subset of cells. The system controller performs the closed-loop control and allocates the desired voltage steps into battery modules. The proposed architecture can significantly reduce communication and computation requirements for large-scale applications. Moreover, considering the second-harmonic current (SHC) widely existing in a single-phase dc/ac system, which may induce the aging of battery cells, the dc RBP is used to suppress the SHC for the first time without an additional central dc/dc converter. Due to the high output voltage quality and low-frequency operation of the dc RBP, the filter size can be significantly reduced. Experimental validation of the proposed control scheme is demonstrated through the utilization of a dc RBP comprising 48 3-Ah 18 650 lithium-ion cells. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves effective battery cell balancing and SHC suppression.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Optimization of Carrier Phase Displacement Angles for Modular Multilevel Converters With PSC&#8211;PWM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10458389</link><description>In the conventional implementations of phase-shifted carrier pulsewidth modulation (PSC&#8211;PWM) for modular multilevel converters (MMCs), different phases normally adopt identical carrier arrangements, neglecting the phase-to-phase carrier phase displacement (P2PCPD). This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the P2PCPD angles, focusing on their effects on the harmonic characteristics of the line-to-line voltages (LLVs) and common mode voltage (CMV). The selection criteria of the P2PCPD angles are proposed for different conditions in terms of the modulation index and the number of submodules (SMs) per arm of the MMC. It is revealed that the LLV and CMV harmonics cannot be minimized simultaneously, while a trade-off can be achieved between these two control objectives: a proper set of P2PCPD angles can be obtained which minimizes the CMV/LLV harmonic distortion meanwhile keeping the LLV/CMV harmonic distortion below a preset threshold. Simulations and experiments are conducted, and their results validate the theoretical findings.</description></item><item><title>High-Efficiency Modulation Scheme for Three-Level Buck Four-Leg Current-Source Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10458374</link><description>Four-leg current source inverter (4L-CSI) has abilities of zero-sequence current handling, voltage boosting, and output short-circuit protection, but it also has the drawbacks of bulkiness and low efficiency. To address these drawbacks, a three-level buck 4L-CSI (3L-Buck-4L-CSI) topology and a simple and high-efficiency modulation scheme are proposed. Due to the multilevel characteristics of 3L-Buck-4L-CSI, the volume of its dc inductor can be reduced greatly and the dc-link current could respond quickly. The proposed modulation scheme is an algebraic modulation scheme, in which the duty cycles are obtained by solving algebraic equations simply and directly. In addition, it reduces the dc-link current and the average switching frequency compared with conventional modulation schemes, which improves the efficiency of the converter. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed topology and modulation scheme.</description></item><item><title>Low-Power Consumption Control Method for BLDCM With Very Small Inductance and Nonideal Back EMF</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10457040</link><description>Conducting research on reducing the power consumption of the high-speed brushless dc motor (BLDCM) drive system is crucial for the efficient operation of the magnetically suspended control moment gyroscope in the limited energy environment of space. This article focuses on studying the losses caused by current harmonics and nonideal back electromotive force (EMF) in the BLDCM, and proposes a low-power consumption control method to mitigate these losses. First, a finite element analysis (FEA) model of the BLDCM is utilized to analyze the rotor eddy current loss caused by current harmonics with different pulsewidth modulation (PWM) switching frequencies. By selecting the optimal PWM switching frequency, it is possible to reduce rotor eddy current loss while minimizing switching loss. Furthermore, to address the drive loss resulting from nonideal back EMF, this article introduces a compound controller based on repetitive control. This controller incorporates the high-frequency PWM drive scheme, which helps reduce current fluctuations compared to the pulse amplitude modulation drive scheme. As a result, the total power consumption of the high-speed motor is reduced by approximately 4.3% at the rated speed. Simulation and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Feedforward Compensation for Phase-Shifted Full-Bridge DC&#8211;DC Converter Under Peak Current Mode Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10460185</link><description>One of the basic requirements of a high-performance isolated full-bridge dc&#8211;dc converter as a controlled dc voltage source is to obtain a constant output voltage quickly and accurately during load changes. In order to achieve a fast dynamic response, this article studies the feedforward control method based on the peak current mode control for the isolated full bridge converter, and proposes a peak current feedforward (PCFF) control scheme with phase shift control to improve the dynamic performance of the converter. Through modeling and analyzing the steady-state large-signal of the phase-shifted full-bridge converter (PSFB), a feedforward prediction method for the PSFB converter under peak current control is obtained. In addition, this article built a PSFB converter experimental platform in scale, and test the steady-state and dynamic performance of the proposed control method on it. Based on peak current controller, the dynamic performances for PSFB converter under the double-loop control strategy, load current feedforward control strategy, and the proposed control strategy are tested and compared. The experimental results verify the improvement effect of PCFF control on the dynamic performance of PSFB converter.</description></item><item><title>Grouped Valley Switching Control to Optimize Efficiency and THD for DCM Boost PFC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10460188</link><description>In discontinuous conduction mode boost converters, the switching-node voltage oscillates after the inductor current reaches zero, leading to fluctuating power loss. To investigate this, a circulating energy model is first proposed. Accurate power loss is analyzed with consideration of oscillation damping effect, reverse conduction of power switch, and nonlinear capacitance effect. Analysis shows that the loss can be minimized when the switch is turned on at specific switching-node voltage valleys. Therefore, to minimize the power loss, a grouped valley switching (GVS) control is proposed to count the valleys and turn on the switch at the optimal valley. However, dynamic changes in valleys will cause frequency hopping, resulting in degraded total harmonic distortion (THD) in input current. To address this issue, the GVS controller turns on the switch at constant valleys in a half-line cycle, while adaptively calculating the on-time with online tracked oscillation duration. For efficiency improvement, the optimal valleys are grouped and tuned based on a comprehensive power loss analysis. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed control. Compared with conventional variable on-time controls, the proposed control improves an average efficiency of 0.4% across the entire power range under 110/220 VAC input. The THD is below 3.1% at 250 W rated power.</description></item><item><title>A Discrete Duty Ratio Control for CCM Boost PFC Converter: Principle, Modeling, and Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10474196</link><description>In this article, a discrete duty ratio (DDR) control strategy is proposed to improve both power factor (PF) and transient response performance for boost power factor correction (PFC) converters operating in continuous conduction mode. By directly generating discrete duty cycles to fit a target duty ratio with unity PF and reference output voltage, the proposed control can achieve fast, accurate, and low computation control. The control principle and discrete parameter design of the proposed control are presented. Due to the inherent characteristic of discrete control pulses, the linear control theory-based modeling and analysis methods are not suitable for the PFC converter system with DDR control. Therefore, another contribution of this article lies in establishing a discrete-time iteration model to assess the stability and explain the discrete control process of the DDR control system under steady-state and transient conditions. Experimental results on a 110 Vrms-400 Vdc-320 W prototype are presented to demonstrate the high PF and fast transient response of the DDR control strategy and verify the theoretical predictions. With a simple control loop design and low computational effort, the proposed DDR control is ideally positioned for high PF and fast transient response PFC applications that require tight cost control and high reliability.</description></item><item><title>$90^\circ$-Valley Unified Controller for Zero-Voltage-Switching Quasi-Square-Wave (ZVS-QSW) Boost Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10473201</link><description>This article presents a novel control strategy for zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) quasi-square-wave boost converter. The controller is based on an exact, closed-form analytical solution of the converter, which is obtained under the assumption that the duration of the valley resonant transition corresponds to a $90^\circ$ angle. A zero-voltage-detection (ZVD) circuit is used to tune the switching frequency to a value that results in the $90^\circ$ valley resonant transition. The controller is implemented digitally, and it is not affected by the propagation delay of the ZVD signal. ZVS of the main device is guaranteed by the closed-loop ZVD frequency tuning, and accurate current control is achieved with the exact analytical solution of the converter. Contrary to commonly used approaches that rely on high-frequency current measurement, this current control is realized without measuring the current. The controller is implemented in a power factor correction circuit, in conjunction with an outer voltage loop. The approach is validated experimentally on a 5-kW prototype, using GaN devices, and featuring a power density of 120 W/in${^{3}}$, peak efficiency greater than 99%, and a total harmonic distortion well below the specified requirements, across the entire load range.</description></item><item><title>Achieving Fast Dynamic Response and Output Filter Condition Monitoring in Hybrid PWM Inverters Using a Low-Computational State Trajectory Prediction Algorithm Incorporating With Reduced-Order Switching Surfaces</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475551</link><description>This article presents a novel state trajectory prediction algorithm with reduced-order switching surfaces, designed for H-bridge inverters using hybrid pulsewidth modulation (h-PWM). h-PWM hybridizes the merits of a unipolar two-level switching scheme (U2SS) and a bipolar three-level switching scheme (B3SS), operating mainly in U2SS while temporarily transitioning to B3SS near the zero-crossing region to resolve the impact of pulse droppings. The algorithm predicts the state trajectory for the entire switching cycle, facilitating fast control and fast dynamic response. By sampling the state variable once at the beginning of each switching cycle, the duty ratios of all switching devices are established for the entire cycle. Since the effective operating frequency under h-PWM is twice the switching frequency, the values of the output filter components are minimized, and thus the power density can be increased. Furthermore, the algorithm can indirectly assess the condition of the output filter by adjusting the switching surface based on the comparison of actual and predicted state trajectories, thereby 1) ensuring that the prediction can adapt component variations, 2) identifying aging conditions, and 3) enabling preventive maintenance to avoid unexpected failures. The performance of the algorithm and the output filter parameter estimation technique are evaluated on a 1-kVA prototype.</description></item><item><title>Small-Signal Modeling and Loss Analysis of Capacitor-Current Dynamic Freewheeling Controlled PCCM SIDO Buck Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10474142</link><description>The pseudocontinuous-conduction mode (PCCM) can be used in the single-inductor multiple-output (SIMO) dc&#8211;dc converter to achieve minimized cross-regulation, which will suffer the restrictions of limited load-range and low light-load efficiency. In this article, a capacitor-current dynamic-freewheeling control scheme for PCCM SIMO dc-dc converter is proposed to overcome these restrictions. Taking PCCM single-inductor dual-output (SIDO) buck converter as an example, a complete and accurate small-signal model is established to guide the error amplifier design. Then, the cross-regulation and transient response are explored via impedance transfer functions. With the employment of DF controller, the freewheeling current and the freewheeling period are updated in real-time via load current and capacitor current, which can improve the light-loading efficiency and broaden the load-range. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis is verified by experimental results. These results show that the proposed control scheme is more suitable for the PCCM SIDO dc&#8211;dc converter to improve efficiency, broaden load range, suppress cross-regulation and enhance transient performance.</description></item><item><title>Transient Stability Analysis for Grid-Tied VSG Considering High-Order Nonlinear Interactions Between Active and Reactive Power Control Loops</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10473188</link><description>Transient stability issues of power converter systems have attracted much attention. Generally, the converter systems behave in high-order nonlinear dynamics due to multiple cascaded control loops, which become obstacles for transient stability analysis. Considering the dynamic coupling between active power and reactive power control loops, the grid-tied virtual synchronous generators (VSG) system is a third-order nonlinear system. Including the equal area criterion (EAC), many conventional methods are only applicable to second-order systems and cannot fully capture damping effects. To fill this gap, a novel iterative EAC method is proposed to handle the transient stability of the third-order VSG system. First, an implicit relationship from the output voltage to the power angle is derived by integral substitution. From energy aspects, the dynamic relations between voltage, power angle, and frequency are approximated by algebraic equations through iterative calculation. The impact of nonlinear damping is also fully captured quantitatively. Both conservatism and quantity of computation are improved compared with previous studies. Furthermore, the critical clearing angles under different disturbance forms and degrees are derived. In addition, some discussions about current limiters&#8217; influence and different controller parameters&#8217; influence are given. Simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments based on RT-Lab are conducted to verify the accuracy of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Paralleled Current and Voltage Control Strategy With Compound PI Controllers for Three-Phase Active Power Filters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10477528</link><description>The conventional control strategy for active power filters (APFs) is essentially a nested structure, where the output of the outer voltage loop will affect the command current of the inner loop, inevitably impairing the performance in harmonic compensation. In this article, to enhance the harmonic-compensation performance, the output of the dc-link voltage loop has been modified and added as a disturbance to the current loop, which forms a paralleled structure. Thus, the pure command current can be achieved and not affected by the output of the voltage loop. Parameters of the proposed paralleled strategy are designed considering both stability and dynamic responses, and larger phase and gain margins are achieved. In addition, a compound PI controller has been designed to avoid the integral overflow problem. Finally, experimental results verify that, though with a relatively slow the dc-link voltage response, the proposed paralleled strategy can achieve a faster and more precious current control, and a better performance in harmonic compensation compared with the conventional nested strategy.</description></item><item><title>Decoupled Continuous Control Set Model Predictive Control for T-Type Three-Phase Four-Leg Three-Level Inverters Driving Constant Power Loads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10476752</link><description>The control coupling and stability of three-phase photovoltaic systems with constant power loads (CPLs) are two key technical issues that urgently need to be addressed. However, current methods are difficult to solve both technical challenges simultaneously. To address these issues, this article proposes a novel decoupled continuous control set model predictive control (CCS-MPC) strategy for LC-filter T-type three-phase four-leg three-level voltage source inverters (3P4L-3L-VSIs) driving CPLs. The control strategy is developed in &#945;&#946;&#947; frame. The model of 3P4L-3L-VSIs is first transformed from abc frame to the &#945;&#946;&#947; frame to remove the coupling effects in the abc frame. Then based on the decoupled model in the &#945;&#946;&#947; frame, a novel CCS-MPC strategy is proposed to provide balanced sinusoidal voltages. The &#945; and &#946; components are regulated by the A, B, and C legs, while the zero-sequence component is regulated by the N leg. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, both simulation and experimental results are presented to verify the proposed decoupled CCS-MPC strategy. The results show that the proposed control achieves low computational burden and total harmonic distortion and can increase the stability margin especially for CPLs compared with the commonly used PI-based control, PR-based control, and deadbeat control.</description></item><item><title>An Analytical Switching Loss Model for SiC MOSFET Considering Temperature-Dependent Reverse Recovery Over an Extremely Wide High-Temperature Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433688</link><description>Accurate switching loss prediction is crucial for studying the failure mechanisms of power modules at extremely high temperatures. However, the temperature range of existing loss models for SiC mosfets is below 175 $^\circ$C, which cannot fulfill the requirements of high-temperature applications. This study proposes an analytical switching loss model for SiC mosfets over an extremely wide temperature range of 25 $^\circ$C to 475 $^\circ$C. First, the proposed device-level model improves accuracy by considering the temperature-dependent channel transfer and output characteristics, body diode forward characteristic, and focusing on the two main charge storage effects of the reverse recovery process. Importantly, new phenomena in device characteristics at high temperatures are considered, especially the sudden increase phenomenon in reverse recovery, thereby broadening the applicable temperature range of the model. In addition, the proposed circuit-level model is based on the commonly used four-lead Kelvin source connection case in conventional high-temperature packages and includes almost all parasitic inductances and capacitances. In this study, a low-inductance double-side embedded package structure with a temperature resistance of 550 $^\circ$C is used to develop a high-temperature double-pulse test platform to verify the accuracy of the model. Experimental results show that the average estimation error of the turn-on energy loss is less than 8% and the maximum estimation error of the total energy loss is less than 14%. The proposed model holds the potential to be a powerful tool for studying extremely high-temperature failure mechanisms of power modules and guides the design of high-temperature converters.</description></item><item><title>Positive VTH Shift in Schottky p-GaN Gate Power HEMTs: Dependence on Temperature, Bias and Gate Leakage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443548</link><description>In this article, we present an extensive analysis of the positive threshold voltage instability in Schottky p-GaN gate enhancement-mode devices, investigated by a custom setup allowing an extended observation window, from the microsecond to hundreds of seconds. We show that a matrix of experiments can be specifically designed to investigate the voltage, temperature and leakage dependence of the threshold voltage instability induced by a positive gate bias, and to identify them. The original results indicate that the observed positive threshold voltage shift can be ascribed to the trapping of electrons at defects located in the AlGaN barrier. Remarkably, the trapping rate is strongly dependent on temperature at low bias, while it is not temperature-dependent at high bias, indicating the existence of both temperature and leakage-assisted trapping processes. This result was confirmed by investigating the correlation between dc leakage measurements and the time constant of threshold voltage transients. On the other hand, the recovery process is found to be thermally activated, with an activation energy of 0.26 eV: the trapped electrons are thermally emitted into the conduction band and are pushed toward the channel by the intrinsic electric field.</description></item><item><title>Direct Metallization-Based DBC-Free Power Modules for Near-Junction Water Cooling: Analysis and Experimental Comparison</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10444073</link><description>Reducing the thermal resistance is vital for power modules. Thermal conducting paths are formed by heterogeneous layers for insulation, causing inevitably high thermal resistance. In this article, with the aid of direct metallization technology, a direct bonded copper (DBC)-free power module concept is proposed to achieve near-junction water cooling. A 55% reduction of thermal resistance is achieved by using a DBC-free power module instead of a DBC interface. Reliability analysis indicates that the DBC-free power module is sufficiently reliable in terms of mechanical stress, fatigue, and peel strength. The junction temperature of the DBC-free power module is experimentally compared to indirectly and directly water-cooled power modules with the DBC interface. The proposed near-junction water cooling method has effectively achieved reductions of 28&#8201;&#176;C and 11&#8201;&#176;C in junction temperature, respectively, under full load conditions when compared to the designs of indirectly and directly water-cooled power modules. The maximum junction temperature rise &#916;Tj of the indirectly water-cooled power module is reduced from 50&#8201;&#176;C to 21&#8201;&#176;C. The unlimited promise of direct metallization technology in 3-D packaging is also highlighted.</description></item><item><title>A 96.3%-Efficiency Wide-Voltage-Range Three-Level Boost Converter With Loop-Free Self-Balancing and Dead-Zone PWM Control for Backlight LED Drivers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10452814</link><description>This article proposes a high-efficiency three-level boost converter that ensures reliable operation in wide input and output voltage ranges for light-emitting diode drivers. The proposed converter adopts robust auto calibration using half of the output voltage (VOUT) for flying capacitor voltage (VCF) self-balancing without requiring additional bulky feedback loops. In addition, the proposed dead-zone pulsewidth modulation control (DZPC) overcomes the limitations of irregular switching and output ripples near the duty 0.5 boundary by alternating between mode1 (D &lt; 0.5) and mode2 (D &gt; 0.5) at every cycle. The prototype converter was fabricated in a 180-nm Bipolar CMOS DMOS (BCD) process occupying a silicon area of 4.72 mm2 while adopting a flying capacitor of 4.7 &#956;F and an inductor of 10 &#956;H. The peak efficiency was measured up to 96.3% at VIN = 24 V, VOUT = 30 V, and ILOAD = 100 mA. The proposed loop-free self-balancing verified the reliable three-level conversion regardless of duty by maintaining VCF at 0.5VOUT, while DZPC also ensures efficient and seamless operation around the duty of 0.5.</description></item><item><title>A Switching Oscillation Suppression Method With Clamping Function and Quantitative Design for SiC MOSFETs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10452843</link><description>SiC mosfets offer significant benefits for power electronics applications due to their material properties, including increased switching speeds, reduced switching losses, and improved power density. However, these benefits can also result in severe switching oscillation and electromagnetic interference in SiC mosfets, which can cause device breakdown or damage. In this article, an oscillation suppression method with clamping function and quantitative design is presented, which not only effectively clamps the drain-source voltage overshoot but also does not reduce the switching speed and increase the switching loss. First, the clamping circuit based on a double-pulse circuit is proposed and its operating principle is described. Then, in order to achieve full suppression of oscillation below the clamping capacitor voltage, the high-frequency equivalent circuit in the oscillation stage is derived and the snubber parameters are further quantitatively designed. Finally, an experimental platform is developed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively clamp the overshoot and suppress the switching oscillations, which will significantly improve the device application reliability.</description></item><item><title>A Flexible Setup for Dynamic On-State Resistance Measurements of GaN HEMTs With One-Factor-at-a-Time Capability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10470396</link><description>A measurement circuit for the characterization of trapping effects in GaN HEMTs is presented.

To achieve a high number of voltage levels with minimal device count, this article presents a novel and generalized derivation method for a new family of tree-type active neutral-point-clamped (TANPC) multilevel topologies. By utilizing the two-level bridge and three-level neutral-point pilot bridge as fundamental cells, the proposed method enables the extension of output voltage levels in a simple and straightforward way. Each derived TANPC topology is equivalent to a single-pole multithrow switch without the need for flying capacitors, where n + 1 voltage levels can be generated with only 2n active switches.

Achieving this goal in hybrid MMCs, where the modulation index exceeds one, becomes intricate owing to the differing participation of half-bridge submodules (HB-SMs) and full-bridge submodules (FB-SMs) in arm voltage generation. This article proposes an advanced voltage-balancing method based on enhanced phase-shift modulation and model predictive control, featuring a single comprehensive cost function that utilizes a novel form of redundancy to manage the insertion of HB- and FB-SMs in a wide range of modulation indices. The designed cost function addresses four key control objectives: intercell balancing by tracking the dc voltage reference, minimizing the energy deviation between the HB- and FB-SMs, interleg balancing to eliminate energy variations between the upper and lower arms, and rejecting voltage errors arising from uncertainties in the SM capacitance using a Kalman filter based observer. This method enables comprehensive capacitor voltage balancing, which is suitable for various modulation indices and power factors. The validity of the proposed method is substantiated through simulations using MATLAB/Simulink software and experiments conducted on a scaled-down hardware prototype.</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid Power Supply Based on Capacitor and Battery for Accurate Regulation of the Pulsed High Current for Inductive Load</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10449454</link><description>Generating steep, pulsed heavy currents with a high stability flat-top on a highly inductive load is a challenging task. This is due to the voltage of the current rising tens of times higher than that of the stable current, and the load resistance undergoing nonlinear changes caused by Joule heat. Hence a hybrid power supply, which includes the cooperative discharge of capacitor-battery and a novel flat-top regulation bypass circuit, is proposed in this article. The high voltage of capacitor source (CAPS) makes the magnet current rise fast. The stable output of battery voltage can maintain high current output and the bypass circuit with IGBTs operating in the active region (IGBTs-AR) regulates the magnet current accurately during the flat-top. A unit of RC with semiconductor switch is in series with the IGBTs-AR to suppress the power dissipation of IGBTs-AR. An isolation valve set of 28 kV/ 22 kA and a bypass circuit of 4 kA/ 100 ms are developed to implement isolation and automatic commutation between the battery source and CAPS, and to regulate the magnet current, respectively. Finally, the detailed tests are performed and the magnetic fields of 20.058 T/10 ms/ 200 ppm and 10.747 T/ 45 ms/ 450 ppm are realized.</description></item><item><title>An LLC-Based Single-Stage Step-Up AC/DC Resonant Converter Without Boost Circuit for EV Charging With High Power Factor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10452826</link><description>AC/DC converters are popularly utilized in modern industrial applications, telecom, and electric vehicle charging applications.

A smooth operation of an MMC depends on the proper regulation of multiple control variables, e.g., phase current, circulating current, capacitor voltage, etc. The model predictive control (MPC) is an excellent candidate for such a scenario since different control objectives can be simultaneously handled in a unified cost function. Although extensive research has been conducted in the literature, a computationally efficient MPC implementation capable of regulating the common-mode voltage (CMV) of the ac-side neutral point of an MMC as a control target has not been properly investigated. This article proposes such an MPC strategy that can flexibly regulate the CMV by incorporating the CMV tracking error into the cost function. The biggest challenge is the dramatically increased number of available control actions and the consequent computational burden as the three phases are controlled as a whole, which are addressed employing a quadratic programming technique, leading to only 64 cost-function evaluations per control period regardless of the number of submodules of the MMC. Several experiments and simulations are carried out considering the regulation of the CMV in different scenarios, and the results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Sensorless Capacitor Voltage Balancing Method for the Modular Multilevel DC Transformer With Diode-Clamped Circuits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10470400</link><description>This article proposed a novel sensorless capacitor voltage balancing method for the modular multilevel dc transformer (MMDCT), which is a promising solution for interconnecting dc grids. The MMDCT comprises two modular multilevel converters (MMCs) and a medium frequency transformer (MFT), where the MFT provides galvanic isolation between the input and output dc grids and the MMCs offer high-voltage handling capability. In order to produce medium frequency sine-wave voltages at the MFT terminals, the phase shift carrier pulsewidth modulation (PSC-PWM) is employed for the MMCs. Typically, a feedback controller is required for each submodule of the MMC to regulate the capacitor voltage to its nominal value, resulting in increased costs due to the requirement for a large number of voltage sensors and fiber optic transceivers. To address this issue, low power rating clamping circuits are implemented between each adjacent submodule of the MMC, and the capacitor charge differences caused by the PSC-PWM are analyzed. Sequential balancing and nonsequential balancing are proposed to achieve capacitor voltage self-balance. Both simulation and experiment results have shown that the capacitor voltages are well-balanced with the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Six-Level Hybrid Diode-Clamped Inverter Topology and DC-link Capacitor Voltage Balancing Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10473195</link><description>This article proposes a six-level hybrid diode-clamped inverter (6L-HDCI) topology with the capability of self-balancing the dc-link capacitor voltages.

The proposed 6L-HDCI topology offers simple structure, cost savings, and lower power losses compared to the conventional 6L-DCI and 6L-FCI topologies, with a total cost reduction of 18.7% and 13.5%, respectively. Moreover, unlike the other topologies, which require auxiliary balancing circuits, for regulating the dc-link capacitor voltages, an algorithm is proposed for balancing these voltages over the full range of modulation indices without additional components. The top and bottom capacitor voltages at the dc-link can be balanced by injecting a zero-sequence voltage, whereas the inner three capacitor voltages are controlled by adjusting the duty ratio using PI controllers. The effectiveness of the proposed 6L-HDCI topology and voltage balancing control has been verified by simulation results. Finally, experimental results for the prototype hardware have validated the feasibility of the proposed topology and control.</description></item><item><title>A Configurable DC&#8211;DC Ripple Attenuator Module With an Active Ripple Cancellation Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10440456</link><description>The active ripple canceller used in multiphase buck converters (MBCs) always guarantees a ripple-free output current, regardless of the number of phases and duty cycle values, and can be adopted to minimize the output ripple, thus prolonging the lifespan of its electrolytic output capacitors.

For the reason that voltage faults and squander of communication resources are common in PMSM drive systems engineering applications, a discrete-time event-triggered fault-tolerant control scheme considering voltage faults is applied to PMSM drive systems in this article. First, the PMSM discrete-time dynamic model considering voltage faults is established. Then, the command filter approximator is used to approximate the system nonlinearities and adaptive fuzzy technique is utilized to solve voltage faults problem. Furthermore, by means of event-triggered mechanism, the network communication resources from the central controller to the remote actuator are saved.

The existing parallel structure for IPS is short of insulation similarity, which results in low insulation utilization ratio (IUR) and limited adjustability. Here we propose a power supply chain (PSC) with series insulation structure. The insulation circumstance of PSC maintains the same for each stage, which increases the minimum IUR to almost 90%, compared to the existing parallel structures. The proposed PSC requires purely diodes, capacitors, and inductors to achieve IPS for switches, thus avoiding the customized cost and enhancing insulation adjustability. After analyzing the working principle of PSC, we evaluate the performance of PSC from the perspective of power supply and insulation. Finally, an 8-staged Marx SSPG prototype is developed to examine the compatibility of PSC and the protection circuit for PSC is implemented. The withstand voltage of PSC can be easily adjusted within 14 kV according to the number of diodes. The PSC does not require external control signals and does not interfere with gate driving synchronization or load waveforms, which offers a new solution of IPS for compact Marx generators designed at nanosecond scale.</description></item><item><title>The Stability Analysis and Control Strategies of Multiparalleled SAPFs: A Comprehensive Overview</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10214669</link><description>An active power filter (APF) is a power electrical equipment that possesses the functions of harmonic suppression and reactive power compensation in the power grid.

In motor driving mode, the implementation of bipolar current excitation and regenerative braking offers significant advantages in terms of balanced switching loss and heat dissipation. The series-connected and the series and parallel-connected winding structures are adopted for enhanced torque and extended speed requirements, respectively. In single-phase charging mode, a front-stage bridgeless interleaved totem-pole power factor corrector and a back-stage Buck&#8211;Boost converter are, respectively, obtained by multiplexing and reconstructing SRM windings and converter devices to reduce the ripple of input ac current.

However, this technique typically employs extra components and introduces increased power losses. In view of this, this article proposed a dual-dc-port rectifier with active power ripple suppression, which enables direct power delivery among the ac grid and dc ports without additional components and intermediate power conversion. Besides, an equivalent two-level framework is put forward to decouple the controller design for this high-integrated topology. With the proposed equivalent two-level model, the controller design for the dual-dc-port rectifier can be simplified, where the grid current control is achieved by regulating the active vector, and power ripple suppression is realized by allocating the zero vector. Consequently, the proposed active power ripple suppression scheme simultaneously achieves sinusoidal grid currents on the ac side and constant dc output voltage on the dc side because the active power ripples on the ac side are all distributed into the extended power decoupling port on the dc side. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the employed topology and the designed control scheme.</description></item><item><title>Integration Modulation for Current Ripple and High-Frequency Zero-Sequence Circulating Current Reduction on Two-Parallel Three-Level Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287921</link><description>Realizing simultaneous reduction of zero-sequence circulating current (ZSCC) and current ripple for two-parallel three-level neutral-point-clamped (3L-NPC) converters are always challenging. To overcome this obstacle, this article proposes a carrier-based integrated modulation method, which analyzes and controls the two-parallel 3L converters as an integrated five-level (5L) converter. First, the nearest three vectors are applied in each subsector to minimize the current ripple. Then, the corresponding 5L-vector sequences are optimally distributed into dual 3L-vector sequence combinations with the smallest common-mode voltage differences. A uniform distribution principle is also summarized based on reference signal decomposition and carrier type selection, which allows easy implementation in mainstream microcontrollers. Moreover, quantitative performance comparisons that compare the current ripple and the high-frequency ZSCC between the proposed method and several state-of-the-art strategies are subsequently conducted. Finally, comparative experiments are performed to verify the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>An Exponential Power Rate Discrete-Time Sliding Mode Observer for a Modular Multilevel Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10272033</link><description>Modular multilevel converter (MMC) gained popularity in modern power applications due to its attributes like scalability and modularity. But, the number of submodules of an MMC and its corresponding voltage sensing devices increase with the increase in voltage levels, which makes the design complex, bulky, and expensive. Hence, an observer for estimating the voltages across the capacitors makes the complete design inexpensive, simple, and compact. This article presents an exponential power rate discrete-time sliding mode observer (EPR-DTSMO) for the observation of voltage across the capacitors of the half-bridge submodule of an MMC. In this article, the hybrid nature of an MMC is investigated, and the MMC system is demonstrated to be observable using the $Z(T_{N})$ observability criteria for hybrid systems. The proposed EPR-DTSMO is then designed for the MMC, and its convergence for the observation errors is proved. The proposed observer is validated using an experimental setup after verifying with numerical simulations. Moreover, its performance is compared to other observer techniques present in the literature. Both simulation and experimental results show that the proposed EPR-DTSMO is well suited for the sensor-less operation of MMC without using any voltage sensors for submodule capacitors.</description></item><item><title>Generalized Feed-Forward Sampling Method for Multilevel Cascaded H-Bridge Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10274629</link><description>Multilevel cascaded H-bridge (CHB) converters are usually operated applying a phase-shifted pulsewidth modulation (PS-PWM) method. In this modulation strategy, it is important to define the sampling instants in order to obtain a superior harmonic performance in the CHB output waveforms. Previous approaches to define the PS-PWM method consider a shorter sampling time, becoming even smaller when the number of cells of the CHB is large. In addition, unbalanced operational conditions in the CHB aggravate this issue also degrading the CHB harmonic performance. In this article, both challenges (small sampling time and unbalanced operational conditions) are faced. A feed-forward compensation technique is proposed to face with the unbalanced operating conditions and enlarging the available computational time for control schemes keeping the good CHB harmonic performance. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Fusion Multilevel Hybrid Multi-VSC Topology's m-to-1 Rating Design for Current Sharing With Reduced Capacity and Enhanced Efficiency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10265165</link><description>Cascaded H-bridge (CHB) multilevel voltage source converter (VSC) topologies have been recently investigated for high-voltage applications. Additionally, more and more multilevel VSCs have been applied in parallel as multi-VSCs for high-current applications. In 2022, the concept of fusion topology was proposed to deal with performance, efficiency, and capacity for parallel multilevel hybrid multiconverters. However, the number of voltage levels of the VSC corresponding to the operating voltage of the hybrid VSC is required to be investigated, which can influence the current sharing among fusion topology converters, efficiency, and capacity. Based on the abovementioned issues, an m-to-1 rating design is proposed to reduce the active inverter capacity and power loss in this article for power quality compensation as an example. The comparative hardware experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed design and fusion multilevel multi-VSC. The results show that multilevel L-CHB-VSC and hybrid LC-VSC have the same current injection ability with about 33% lower loss and more enhanced efficiency than the previous cascaded active multilevel multi-VSCs.</description></item><item><title>Period Control Approach Finite Control Set Model Predictive Control Switching Phase Control for Interleaved DC/DC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304404</link><description>The control of interleaved converters is commonly implemented through pulsewith modulation (PWM) techniques. A common element in these implementations is the use of phase shift between carriers to improve the system performance. When working with a balanced system, this phase shift is equally distributed between modules, but for an unbalanced system, this is no longer the best alternative. Changing the phase shift in these controllers requires the implementation of new capabilities in the control platforms, and for the controller to manage more variables of different nature. On the other hand, finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) has shown to be a promising control strategy, especially when managing multiple control objectives of different natures or dynamics. In general, FCS-MPC does not present a fixed switching pattern, but this issue has been recently addressed with the so called period control approach (PCA). This article expands on the PCA-FCS-MPC to achieve the switching phase regulation for interleaved dc/dc power converters. A switching pattern similar to that of PWM techniques is achieved, while keeping the advantages of FCS-MPC and achieving the phase shift required for interleaved operation. Simulation and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A DC Offset Reduction of Neutral Point Voltage Strategy Based on Vector Phase Angle Difference Optimization for Vienna Rectifier With Bipolar DC Bus</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304412</link><description>When Vienna rectifier operates at light load conditions, small load power difference of bipolar dc bus leads to dc offset of neutral point (NP) voltage due to the limitation of dc-link power, increasing the voltage stress on switching devices. To solve this problem, a dc offset reduction of NP voltage strategy based on the vector phase angle difference (VPAD) optimization is proposed. By analyzing the relationship between the magnitude of zero-sequence component and the duty cycles of voltage vectors, the maximum power difference of the conventional strategy is obtained. The proposed strategy illustrates that VPAD can adjust the NP current based on the contour of the NP current, and the maximum VPAD is limited to satisfy the reference voltage and input current have the same sign. To increase the NP current, the VPAD is optimized by introducing the fluctuating reactive current, and the active current disturbance is injected to regulate the change rate of NP current. Therefore, the proposed strategy can significantly reduce the dc offset of NP voltage under light load conditions at the cost of the input current harmonics and the dc-link voltage fluctuation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified on a Vienna rectifier platform.</description></item><item><title>Multiobjective Optimization of High Power Density Outer Rotor PM Starter Generator Considering Electromagnetic and Temperature Characteristics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304356</link><description>This article presents a multiobjective optimization method for a special cooling tooth design in an outer rotor permanent magnet starter generator (ORPMSG), taking into account both the electromagnetic and temperature performances.

In addition, an optimization method considering the power density, efficiency, and temperature rise have been proposed and employed to obtain an optimal overall performance on the ORPMSG design. The comprehensive sensitivity method is conducted based on the random forest algorithm to improve model accuracy. Besides, the random black-hole algorithm is proposed to enhance the convergence rate and approximate Pareto optimal solution. Then, an optimal ORPMSG is obtained using the proposed multiobjective optimization. Besides, the corresponding electromagnetic and temperature characteristics of the optimal and initial machines are compared by finite element analysis to confirm the merits of the optimization method. Finally, a 25 kW prototype is manufactured and tested, which verifies a significant 45.1% current density and 3.2% efficiency improvement for the same condition compared to the traditional cooling method.</description></item><item><title>A Five-Level Inverter Topology With Extended Linear Modulation Range Till Full Base Speed Irrespective of Load Power Factor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287855</link><description>In conventional inverters, the linear modulation range is limited to a maximum voltage space vector radius of 0.866 times the dc link voltage ($\text{V}_\text{dc}$), which corresponds to a maximum peak fundamental phase voltage of 0.577 $\text{V}_\text{dc}$. Beyond this, the inverter enters the overmodulation region, where the operation transitions to a six-step mode causing the voltage space vector to trace a hexagonal locus. This results in phase voltage waveforms with significant lower order harmonic content leading to torque ripples in the motor shaft and undesired harmonic losses. Thus, the achievable speed range of the induction motor in the linear modulation range is effectively limited to 90.5% of its full base speed. In contrast, the proposed five-level inverter topology generates a circular voltage space vector locus with a radius of up to 0.955 $\text{V}_\text{dc}$ resulting in a maximum peak fundamental phase voltage of 0.637 $\text{V}_\text{dc}$. Thus, the linear modulation range is extended to full base speed and is independent of the load power factor. The proposed power circuit is based on two standard three-level neutral point clamped inverters and can be realized by two readily available three-level NPC inverter IC packages. Standard space vector pulsewidth modulation techniques can be employed for switching pulse generation.</description></item><item><title>Improved Model-Free Predictive Current Control Method for SPMSM With an Overmodulation Scheme</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10273616</link><description>Traditional deadbeat predictive current control is an effective control approach, due to its simple concept, easy implementation, and fast dynamic response. However, the parameter mismatch is one of the main problems affecting its wide application. Model-free predictive current control on the basis of the extended state observer (ESO-MFPCC) is an effective solution to the above problem, while the bandwidth limitation in ESO will reduce the control performance. Moreover, because of the voltage limitation of the power converter, in response to load impacts, the motor potentially has poor dynamic performance under the overmodulation region. In order to solve these above problems, model-free predictive current control on the basis of the adaptive sliding mode observer (ASMO-MFPCC) with an overmodulation scheme is proposed. First, the ASMO-MFPCC can preferably improve system parameter robustness without bandwidth limitation. In addition, the vertical method for optimizing dynamic performance in the overmodulation region is proposed, so that the quicker and better dynamic response is obtained between the linear modulation region and the overmodulation region. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the method, carried on a 1-KW surfaced permanent magnet synchronous motor, are verified through the experimental results.</description></item><item><title>A Fault Diagnosis and Fault-Tolerant Control Method for Open-Switch Faults of Converters in DSEM Drive System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287621</link><description>This article proposes a fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control method for open-switch faults of bridge converters in doubly salient electromagnetic motor (DSEM) drive systems. First, the locations of current sensors are reinstalled to detect the dc-link current and its difference with the freewheeling current of diodes in the lower bridge leg, through which the open-switch faults are diagnosed without affecting the control mode of motors. Moreover, a method to process the features of fault current is studied to reduce the calculation load of the diagnosis method. Then, the driving logic of the switches under different fault conditions is developed for fault-tolerant control. Through the analysis of the problem of uncontrolled phase current caused by inheriting the common duty ratio control method of normal operation in fault-tolerant operation, the independent duty ratio control method is further researched to decrease the ripple of phase currents during fault-tolerant operation. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method has superior rapidity and high reliability. In addition, the suppression of current ripple in three-phase DSEM using the converter based on split capacitors is studied to further improve the fault-tolerant control performance. Finally, the experiments on a 12/8 pole DSEM validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Vector-Space-Decomposition-Based Power Flow Control of Single-Stage-Multiport-Inverter-Fed PMSM Drive for Hybrid Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287618</link><description>The single-stage multiport inverter (SSMPI) is one of the high-efficiency power electronic interfaces for hybrid electric vehicles due to its capability of single-stage power conversion from each source to the motor without employing a dc&#8211;dc converter. However, it is cumbersome to design the modulation scheme for the SSMPI since the voltage vectors of the SSMPI are unsymmetrically distributed as the dc-link voltage ratio between the two dc ports varies with the state of the sources, which results in a heavy computation burden in the sector identification and vector synthesis. To this end, this article proposes a vector space decomposition (VSD)-based power flow control scheme to simplify the modulation design for the SSMPI, where the unsymmetrical three-level space vector diagram is decomposed into two separate two-level ones. An intuitive decoupled power flow control for each port without affecting the motor drive control can be easily developed with the proposed VSD strategy. The power distribution capability of the SSMPI with the proposed scheme is also analytically revealed. Experiments are presented to verify the effectiveness and performance of the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Zero Sequence Current Suppression Scheme for Open-Winding Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Based on Model-Free Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10271734</link><description>In open-winding permanent magnet synchronous motors (OW-PMSMs) with a single dc bus, zero sequence current (ZSC) would cause unwanted power loss and negatively affect stability of the system, so it should be addressed. In this article, an improved control scheme is proposed, which can maintain good ZSC performance under varying conditions and reduce the switching action times synchronously. First, an extended state observer that can predict the next instant ZSC and calculate the next instant desired zero sequence voltage (ZSV) is established. In this process, the model-free control principle is applied, which overcomes the problem of dependence on the zero-sequence loop parameters. Second, to reduce the switching frequency in traditional equal distribution modulation strategy, a novel modulation method is illustrated. Zero voltage vector is avoided, and the dwell time of active voltage vectors is redistributed to generate the desired ZSV. As a result, the times of switching actions has reduced from 12 to 8, and this reduction in switching actions is accompanied by effective suppression of ZSC. Finally, to test the effectiveness of the proposed method, several experimental results obtained using existing methods and the proposed method are presented.</description></item><item><title>Parallel Input Series Output Ultra-High Step up DC/DC Converter With Three Degrees of Freedom</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10273005</link><description>In this article, a new high step up dc/dc converter with a very high voltage gain is presented. The proposed converter employs coupled inductors and built-in transformer to achieve an ultra-high voltage ratio with low duty cycle of switches. Interleaved structure of the proposed converter minimizes the input current ripple, and due to the input current sharing, the current stress of switches is reduced. Low voltage stress of switches make it possible to employ low on resistance power mosfets. In the proposed converter, the large output voltage is stored in two series capacitors, which reduces the cost and capacitor losses. The employed clamp circuit not only recycle the energy of leakage inductance but also improve the voltage gain. Thanks to all of these mentioned features, power loss reduces and the circuit performance is improved. In order to verify the validity of theoretical analysis, a 1-kW laboratory prototype circuit converting 26 to 450 V is implemented.</description></item><item><title>Investigation of a PM Flux-Modulated Motor With Mechanical Flux-Weakening Solution for Wide Speed-Range Operation in Traction Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10275789</link><description>In order to achieve wide speed-range operation in traction applications, an investigation of a permanent magnet (PM) flux-modulated motor with a mechanical flux-weakening solution is presented in this article. This PM flux-modulated motor consists of two sets of windings, i.e., windings I and II, and two rotors, i.e., the outer rotor and the inner rotor. The two sets of windings are connected in series. By adjusting the inner rotor position, the phase angle between the two voltage vectors of windings I and II is accordingly changed. Hence, with the speed increasing, even though the magnitudes of the two voltage vectors of windings I and II are increased, the voltage magnitude of the total series-connected windings can be maintained (instead of increased) within the voltage limit. As a result, a mechanical flux-weakening solution for wide speed-range operation is achieved. Differing from conventional electrical flux-weakening solutions, this mechanical solution shows the advantage that the flux-weakening capability is not heavily dependent on the power rating of the motor. A comparative study is conducted between the presented PM flux-modulated motor with the mechanical solution and a conventional interior PM synchronous motor (IPMSM) as well as a surface-mounted PM synchronous motor (SPMSM) with the electrical solution. The results indicate that compared to the IPMSM and SPMSM, the presented PM flux-modulated motor exhibits the advantages of high torque/power density, high torque per PM volume, and high flux-weakening capability. Finally, a prototype of the presented PM flux-modulated motor is fabricated, and experimental validation of the mechanical flux-weakening solution is provided.</description></item><item><title>A Misalignment Tolerant Inductive Power Transfer System With AC Resistance Reduction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10298832</link><description>Misalignment sensitivity is one of the main problems limiting the development of inductive power transfer system. When misalignment occurs, the system output power and efficiency reduce dramatically and cause unstable power supply. Meanwhile, the ac resistance of the inductive power transfer coil increases with the frequency. In medium and high frequency region, it produces large ohmic loss and thermal dissipation, which lead to efficiency-drop and temperature-rise problems. This work proposes a misalignment-tolerant winding pattern to reduce the system horizontal misalignment sensitivity, thermal stress, and coil ac resistance. From the experimental result, the proposed winding pattern reduces the ac resistance maximally by 88% at 2 MHz compared with the conventional winding pattern under the same geometry and wire type. The misalignment tolerance is maximally improved by 46% in terms of the output power with the proposed winding pattern.</description></item><item><title>Harmonic Inclusion and Accurate Modeling and Performance Analysis of the IPT Topologies Under Varying Operating Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315204</link><description>The fundamental harmonic approximation (FHA) is generally used to design and model inductive power transfer (IPT) circuits. However, with coil misalignments, at light load or the rectifier's discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), the IPT circuit must handle higher harmonic content. Moreover, topologies like LCL and LCC have high harmonics at the inverter output and rectifier input side, even during regular operation. The existing two-port network-based harmonic modeling assumes quasi-square rectifier input voltage for the LCC&#8211;LCC topology in DCM condition, thereby leading to significant error. In this article, the rectifier input voltage of LCC&#8211;LCC topology (capacitive filter at load) and the rectifier input current of series-parallel (S-P) topology (inductive filter at load) are modified and improved for the DCM mode. Hence, by including the modified expression, accurate results in extreme conditions, high coupling, light load, and DCM scenarios are achieved. The proposed technique models the output port as a voltage/current source instead of approximating it to be resistive. Furthermore, the proposed study equally applies to continuous conduction mode and DCM conditions for the rectifier. A comparison using the FHA-based analysis, proposed harmonic modeling and simulation is carried out, and experimental validation is done for S-P and LCC&#8211;LCC topologies.</description></item><item><title>A Controller HIL Testing Approach of High Switching Frequency Power Converter via Slower-Than-Real-Time Simulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287918</link><description>The controller hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) simulation is a vital tool to test power electronics controllers in the early development stages to reduce cost and risk and save time. However, the CHIL cannot handle the high-switching-frequency power converters due to the strict computing time constraint imposed on the real-time simulation and the limitation of the digital-analog conversion rate of the I/O interface. To deal with this challenge, in this article, a CHIL testing approach based on the slower-than-real-time simulation (STRTS) is proposed for the power electronics converter with high switching frequency. The operating principles and implementation procedure of the STRTS-based CHIL are presented in detail. By comparing with the real-time simulation-based hardware-in-the-loop (HIL), STRTS-based CHIL is proved to have equivalent controller testing performances. Moreover, a 200&#8201;kHz buck converter prototype is developed and the closed-loop experimental results validate the feasibility and application values of the STRTS-based CHIL in testing the high-frequency converters.</description></item><item><title>An Unbalanced Capacitor Voltage Buck Converter With Wide Soft Switching Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10273003</link><description>DC&#8211;DC converters using soft switching technology have gained popularity in several industrial applications. Nevertheless, a wider soft switching range and a simpler structure are the holy grail for these converters. In this article, an innovative unbalanced dc-link capacitor voltage buck converter with a broad soft switching range has been proposed. The converter uses an auxiliary switch and a small inductor to create an auxiliary network that enables zero voltage switching (ZVS) for the buck switch. The auxiliary switch turns on under zero current switching, whereas the main buck switch operates under ZVS with reduced dv/dt. Unbalanced voltage of a series-connected dc-link capacitor is intended to boost the soft switching range of the buck converter for a broad range of loads by lowering the resonant voltage to less than half the input voltage. LTspice simulations of the converter operating with a power load of 1 kW and a switching frequency of 100 kHz have been demonstrated and the efficiency of the topology based on silicon carbide MOSFET has been discussed. Compared with the traditional hard switching buck converter, the proposed converter reduces total losses by 50% and improves the light-load efficiency to 91.3% from 88.5% and the full-load efficiency to 97.5% from 94.5%. Finally, a 1 kW prototype has been designed and tested to validate the theoretical ideas including the closed-loop control strategy for the converter.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Integrated Magnetic for Wide Voltage Gain ISOP-LLC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286296</link><description>In order to enlarge the voltage gain range and improve the conversion efficiency over the whole load, the combination between ISOP-LLC and configurable rectifier is conducted in this article, which constructed three operation modes.

This article proposes a simple but effective peak current control strategy to achieve dimming operation. Unlike the traditional dimming techniques, no extra switch, pulsewidth modulation controller, or linear current regulator in series with the LED strings is used in the proposed method, resulting in easy implementation and low cost. A 33 W ac&#8211;dc Sepic LED driver prototype, both with power factor correction (PFC) and without PFC, is constructed and tested to validate the proposed peak current control method. Moreover, flicker-free operation of LEDs is necessary for human eye comfort. Therefore, this article also introduces a ripple remover circuit (RRC) to remove low-frequency LED current ripple in ac&#8211;dc LED drivers. At the same time, the output capacitor can be greatly reduced by the critical design of the RRC. Unlike the existing methods, the inclusion of RRC into a driver circuit is straightforward and RRC has no complex structure.

The proposed structure applies series capacitor and coupled inductor techniques. This combination can reduce the converter's voltage gain considerably. In addition, the proposed converter comprises only two switches and two sets of coupled inductors, all participating in the power conversion process and are responsible for reducing voltage gain. Not only do the coupled inductors decrease the conversion ratio, but also, they cancel out the ripple of each other. Therefore, the continuous low ripple output current is achieved. Moreover, both output diodes contribute to providing the output current. Furthermore, zero voltage switching is attained for both switches. A 120-W prototype converter is implemented, and the experimental results justify the theoretical analysis.</description></item><item><title>Offset Current Modulation Technique for Wide ZVS Range in Dual Active Bridge (DAB) DC-DC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287885</link><description>This article proposes a novel offset current modulation technique, which can add a new degree of freedom to the dual active bridge dc&#8211;dc converter. The concept of the proposed technique is to inject offset currents into the primary- and secondary-sides of the transformer. If the same offset currents are injected into both sides, dc bias does not occur in the magnetizing current of the transformer. Therefore, the offset current can be used as a new control variable without any adverse effects. When the proposed technique is applied to single phase shift (SPS) modulation, zero voltage switching (ZVS) characteristics can be further improved by realizing the ZVS of two more switches, leading to higher efficiency. Furthermore, the proposed control system can be configured with simple modification of the conventional control system. The optimal SPS modulation with the proposed technique is derived through theoretical loss optimization considering a tradeoff between conduction loss and switching loss. The feasibility of the proposed technique is verified using a 3.3 kW prototype with a 400 V input and 280&#8211;420 V output conditions.</description></item><item><title>Single-Switch Soft-Switched High-Step-Down Converter With Self-Driven Synchronous Rectifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268282</link><description>A new fully soft-switched nonisolated high-step-down converter is presented in this article. The proposed converter utilizes only one switch and a self-driven synchronous rectifier to implement a fully soft-switched pulsewidth modulation high-step-down converter. In addition, the single switch does not require an isolated gate drive, which further simplifies the converter control. The main switch is turned on and off under zero-current-switching and zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) conditions, respectively. The extended duty cycle enables the converter to have a wide input voltage range and reduce the switch current stress. Also, the self-driven synchronous rectifier turns on and off under ZVS condition. These merits have contributed to the improved efficiency of the proposed converter with respect to other counterparts. To verify the converter characteristics, a 150 V to 12 V converter prototype operating at 100 W and 100 kHz is implemented and the results indicate 97% efficiency at full load.</description></item><item><title>Bidirectional Supercascode High-Voltage DC Solid-State Circuit Breaker With Sensorless Current&#8211;Time Configuration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10288149</link><description>This article presents a bidirectional normally-on SiC junction field-effect transistor (JFET) based supercascode high-voltage dc solid-state circuit breaker (BSC-SSCB) with sensorless current&#8211;time configuration. A sensorless detection-driving circuit (DDC) is proposed to detect the current and drive the main switch by directly utilizing the forward voltage of the BSC-SSCB. The DDC only contains a few passive components and a low-voltage MOSFET, whereas no high-voltage input or high-isolation auxiliary power supply is used. In addition, the current&#8211;time tripping response can be configured by only setting two resistors and two capacitors of the DDC without additional controllers. The configurable current&#8211;time tripping response enables the BSC-SSCB to avoid unnecessary breaking-off caused by impulse current. A design procedure for the DDC and the main circuit is carried out. A 4-kV/15-A BSC-SSCB prototype is designed and tested. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed BSC-SSCB can quickly break off the fault current and achieve balanced voltages of all power JFETs. The current&#8211;time tripping curve can be fine-configured, which agrees with theoretical analysis. The results indicate that the proposed BSC-SSCB can be applied to medium-voltage dc for fast circuit breaking.</description></item><item><title>Fixed-Frequency Circulant Phase-Shift Controlled Current-Fed Resonant Converter With Wide Voltage Gain Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10284545</link><description>This article proposes a novel current-fed LLC resonant (CFLLC) converter for wide voltage range applications. For the proposed CFLLC converter, it is obtained by integrating a boost inductor, two series-connected voltage source submodules (VSMs) and a resonant tank. The output voltage can be regulated by the fixed-frequency circulant phase-shift (FFCPS) modulation method. And the switching frequency is fixed at the resonant frequency, which is conducive to the design of magnetic components. Compared with other CFLLC converters, the proposed solution has a simpler single-stage structure and lower voltage stress borne by switching devices over a wide input range, which reduces the number and cost of components. Based on the FFCPS modulation strategy, the proposed CFLLC is characterized by wide voltage range, high efficiency and self-balancing performance of VSM capacitor voltages without introducing the control complexity. In addition, zero-voltage switching of all power devices can be achieved through the collaborative design of the boost inductor and transformer. The main working principle of CFLLC is expounded in more depth. A laboratory prototype is built for experimental verification. The experimental results verify the correctness and feasibility of the theoretical analysis.</description></item><item><title>Alleviation of Leakage Current and Neutral Point Voltage Deviation for Using an Eight-Switch Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10275064</link><description>Due to the less number of switching devices, a coupled eight-switch converter is an attractive topology for reducing cost in photovoltaic generation systems. Nevertheless, the medium vectors are absent in an eight-switch converter compared to the conventional three-level topology, resulting in an undesired performance for leakage current suppression and neutral point voltage (NPV) balancing with existing methods. To overcome such limitations, this article proposes a modulation method without the medium vectors for leakage current suppression and NPV balancing for eight-switch converters. In order to mitigate the leakage current, except for using the low common-mode voltage (CMV) vectors to reduce the amplitude of the CMV, two pairs of sequences are further designed to lower the transitions of the CMV. Simultaneously, the average switching frequency is reduced and the NPV balance can be achieved by changing between sequences. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulations and experiments.</description></item><item><title>Flex-LCC: A New Grid-Forming HVDC Rectifier for Collecting Large-Scale Renewable Energy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10314129</link><description>A new grid-forming (GFM) high-voltage direct current (HVdc) rectifier, named flexible line-commutated converter (Flex-LCC), is proposed in this article to collect the power generated by large-scale islanded or weak-grid-supported renewable energy systems. The Flex-LCC uses a series-connected hybrid valve based on the LCC and full-bridge modular multilevel converter (FBMMC), and adopts a new control. As a result, the Flex-LCC works as a GFM rectifier and retains the same dc voltage and power carrying capacity, dc fault clearing, and power reversal functions as an LCC. Particularly, the Flex-LCC has three salient features: the control of the Flex-LCC is decoupled from the LCC part's firing angle, the internal reactive power allocation is flexible, and the valve-side ac voltage of the FBMMC part has a wide operation range due to the decoupling of dc-port voltage and capacitor voltage. These bring reduced interharmonics, enhanced stability, and a smaller capacity boundary to the FBMMC part for the Flex-LCC. Furthermore, utilizing the reasonable design for the actual capacity and valve-side ac voltage of the FBMMC, the Flex-LCC can effectively balance cost, footprint, and weight, and match the current-carrying capacity between the series-connected LCC and FBMMC. The topology, control, characteristics, and design of the Flex-LCC are analyzed in detail in this article. Simulations and experiments validate the theory.</description></item><item><title>Single-Loop Droop Control Strategy for a Grid-Connected DFIG Wind Turbine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10314133</link><description>When grid-forming droop control strategies are implemented in grid-connected power converters, two control strategies are widely used: the single-loop and multiloop droop controls. However, only multiloop droop control strategies with inner control loops have been implemented in doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbines so far. This article proposes the application of a single-loop droop control strategy to a DFIG wind turbine, which has not been previously explored or implemented. As shown in the article, the application of the conventional droop control without inner control loops to DFIG-based wind power systems does not ensure a stable response. After modeling the system dynamics and evaluating its stability, two causes of instability have been identified: a resonance at the rotor electrical frequency relevant at high slips and a phase margin reduction at low slips. To solve these instability issues two control solutions are proposed: the emulation of a virtual resistor and a phase rotation. The proposed control strategy allows stabilizing the system and achieving a fast and damped dynamic response. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is validated by experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Improved Sliding Mode-Based Controller of a High Voltage Ratio DC&#8211;DC Converter for Electrolyzers Supplied by Renewable Energy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287092</link><description>This article presents a novel control algorithm for a three-level interleaved buck converter (TLIBC) to supply energy to a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer (PEMEL) in the presence of renewable energy sources. It leverages the main advantages of the TLIBC, i.e., a high voltage conversion ratio, low output current ripple, and the ability to operate in case of electrical circuit failures. The new control law, based on nonlinear improved sliding model-based control, offers a significant improvement of the performance for input power variation when renewable energy sources are used. The proposed controller exhibits further benefits, such as a faster dynamic response and greater robustness against parameter uncertainties when compared to traditional PI-based control. Experimental verification is carried out using a PEMEL dynamic emulator to preserve the real PEMEL performance during the tests. The obtained experimental results demonstrated that the proposed control technique overcomes current limitations in terms of performance usually characterized by PI controllers. Particularly, during operating conditions change when considering electrolyzers powered by renewable energy sources, a faster response is obtained. The rise time is imposed by the controller, and it does not depend on the operating point.</description></item><item><title>Self-Excited Three-Port Converter for Photovoltaic Application With Stability Enhancement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10272242</link><description>Reducing the impact of system voltage on the phase-locked loop in weak grid is an effective method to enhance the stability of grid-connected inverters. This article introduces a self-excited three-port converter topology, which utilizes a zigzag transformer to construct a small capacity series ac port on the dc&#8211;dc module of a two-stage photovoltaic grid-connected converter, achieving the goal of adjusting the grid voltage with its power and extending the degree of freedom in the grid-connected converter control. At the same time, an impedance compensation strategy based on the series ac port is proposed to suppress the impact of the grid-connected converter output circuit on the grid voltage and enhance the system stability on the time scale of the phase-locked loop. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed converter topology and control method can significantly improve the stability so that the grid-connected converter can adapt to weak grid. Simulation and 1.6 kW prototype experiments prove that the proposed topology can effectively improve the stability of the converter system in weak grid with short-circuit ratio of 1.49 by compensating the impedance value of the power grid.</description></item><item><title>Economic Operation Optimization Under Real-Time Pricing for an Energy Management System in a Redundancy-Based Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10305280</link><description>DC microgrids (MGs) represent self-contained systems for distributing and managing electricity locally, offering advantages in terms of efficiency and control. This article proposes the optimization of redundancy-based dc MG, emphasizing the integration of an intelligent algorithm to minimize operational costs under real-time pricing conditions and also increase the efficiency operation. The redundancy-based dc MG consists of a cascaded bidirectional Cuk converter (CBC) linked to a cascaded bidirectional boost converter, sharing two battery energy storage system (BESS) units as common inputs. Thereby, two boost converters interface the dc utility and fuel cell (FC) to the dc-link of the CBC. The redundancy-based dc MG operates with a coordinated and decentralized control among the dc utility, FC and two BESS units. The energy management system (EMS) employs a droop control for the dc utility and FC, while BESS units adhere to a state-of-charge (SoC)-sharing function. In addition, the particle swarm optimization dynamically adjusts EMS parameters for optimal real-time performance. Then, a stability analysis determines MG operational boundaries, and the effectiveness of the method is confirmed through experiments using Typhoon HIL and dSPACE setups. Finally, comparative evaluations against traditional SoC-based droop and genetic algorithms demonstrate the cost reduction of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Universal Active Filter With SPV and Battery Support for Standalone Hydroelectric System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10280621</link><description>The number of sensitive loads that require optimal sinusoidal supply voltages for proper operation has increased because of developments in process control, digital electronics, and power converters. Therefore, it is imperative to develop efficient control strategies to address this issue. In this article, a universal active power filter (UAPF) is incorporated with the standalone hydroelectric system to enhance voltage and current qualities simultaneously. This standalone hydropower system includes an induction generator as a primary source, a battery with a dc&#8211;dc converter, and a solar photovoltaic array. The series compensator improves the voltage characteristics. It keeps the harmonics (distortion) free voltage with constant amplitude at the terminals of nonlinear loads, regardless of source voltage variations. Furthermore, UAPF's shunt compensator improves power indices, including power factor, current harmonics, and reactive power. By using an improved low-pass second-order generalized integrator control algorithm, the fundamental elements of nonsinusoidal currents from nonlinear critical loads are estimated. These components are used to generate switching pulses and reference signals, ensuring efficient and effective power quality (PQ) enhancement under various circumstances. Moreover, laboratory prototype validation has ensured the effectiveness in providing PQs of currents and voltages to follow the IEEE std. 519.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Multiple Compensation Circuits for Wireless Power Transfer With Fewer Components</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10275735</link><description>This article proposes a novel approach to designing integrated compensation circuits with fewer components for wireless power transfer (WPT) systems. Our approach utilizes $\Gamma$-circuit and ${\unicode{xA780}}$-circuit to achieve voltage&#8211;current conversion and is applicable for both inductive and capacitive couplers. By incorporating the designed compensation circuits at the primary or secondary side of second-order compensated WPT converters, higher-order compensated WPT converters can be achieved. These converters offer the ability to transform between load-independent constant current (CC) output and constant voltage (CV) output at the same operating frequency, while also possessing desirable properties such as reduced dependence on couplers and an expanded operating range. Moreover, our approach can be extended to increase flexibility on the output side, without compromising the simplicity of design parameter determination. We present the properties of the resulting circuits, enabling the selection of multiple compensation circuits suitable for various application scenarios. Finally, we validate the proposed compensation design's applicability to a WPT system by constructing a laboratory prototype that can produce both CC and CV output forms at a fixed operating frequency.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Model Predictive Control for LCL-Filter Grid-Tied Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10309832</link><description>This article proposes adaptive continuous-control-set model predictive control (CCS-MPC) for three-phase LCL-filter grid-tied inverters in the stationary frame. The proposed control provides stability against the LCL-filter resonance and removes the need for active damping or passive damping. Furthermore, it can track sinusoidal references in the stationary frame close to zero offsets. Inductance variation of a grid is a challenging issue, which can shift the LCL-filter resonance. Even though CCS-MPC generally has good stability for parameter mismatches, the control is optimized for the nominal value of the parameters. A relatively large variation may deteriorate the performance of the control and cause instability in the closed-loop system. To solve this problem, the concept of CCS-MPC is developed to work with a variety of the grid-inductance changes. The controller coefficients are chosen with a sensitivity analysis to provide enough gain margins and phase margins for the whole interval of the presumption grid-inductance variation. Also, this selection guarantees the control robustness against mismatches of the LCL-filter capacitance and inductance. The real-time computation of advanced controllers is a challenging issue. The computation burden of the proposed CCS-MPC is mostly performed offline and just some simple numerical expression is executed in real time. Thus, it does not require a powerful but expensive processor for implementation. The simulation and experimental results prove the performance of the proposed controller for handling the LCL-filter resonance, grid-inductance variations, and tracking sinusoidal references.</description></item><item><title>Online Expansion of Multiple Mobile Emergency Energy Storage Vehicles Without Communication</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10323257</link><description>The extreme weather and natural disasters will cause power grid outage. In disaster relief, mobile emergency energy storage vehicle (MEESV) is the significant tool for protecting critical loads from power grid outage. However, the on-site online expansion of multiple MEESVs always faces the challenges of hardware and software configurations through communications. In order to simplify the on-site operation, the online expansion without communication line is always expected to realize the effect of plug-and-play. For this purpose, this article proposes an online expansion method, which focuses on the voltage coordinate control at two key parts to avoid the circulating current: one is for the system reset after new MEESV is joined, while the other one is for the bus voltage synchronously gradually restored to the rated value. For the former one, a mutual small-signal-based resetting method is proposed, for which the injection and identification of small signal are studied to ensure the safe expansion with acceptable disturbances. For the latter one, event-triggered method is suggested which synchronously restores the bus voltage to nominal value at its specific zero crossings. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated through an experimental platform, with three prototypes online expanded one by one.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Energy Management of Renewable Hydrogen Production Systems Without Communication Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10314039</link><description>With the increasing penetration of renewable generation, producing renewable hydrogen by water electrolysis has become a promising development. For hydrogen production systems integrated with renewable energy sources (RESs), alkaline electrolyzers (AELs), and energy storage devices, its energy management system (EMS) not only controls the RESs&#8217; operating points to capture more renewable energy but also regulates the AELs and energy storage devices&#8217; operating power to achieve dc bus voltage regulation, dynamic power sharing, power regulation of AELs, state-of-charge regulation of energy storage devices, etc. In this article, a decentralized EMS is proposed to achieve the above objectives. The proposed EMS can indirectly improve the system's efficiency and service life by ensuring that the AEL's operating power is always above the minimum recommended operating power and it only absorbs the low-frequency part of renewable power fluctuations. Besides, the proposed EMS can reduce system costs and enhance system reliability by eliminating communication networks. Furthermore, the operational principle of the proposed EMS and the system design and analysis are elaborated. The proposed EMS's effectiveness is verified by hardware-in-the-loop real-time simulations.</description></item><item><title>A Distributed Control Method With Seamless Hot Swap Capability for Generic DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10266904</link><description>This article proposes a distributed secondary control method for droop-controlled dc microgrid (MG) systems with ring or mesh configurations. The control method achieves accurate current sharing and improved load voltage regulation than the conventional droop method by using the bus voltage information of any bus of the dc MG system. The secondary controllers are implemented locally at each converter, thus ensuring a distributed control. The proposed method requires communication of only one signal per communication link and it needs less number of communication links than the state-of-the-art distributed secondary control methods. The method also offers a seamless hot swap capability of a converter as there is no interdependence between the secondary controllers of the converters. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using switching simulations and hardware-based experiments on different configurations of dc MG systems.</description></item><item><title>Virtual Fractional-Order-Inductor Based Second Harmonic Current Suppression Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10274606</link><description>In a two-stage single-phase inverter, the pulsating output power generates a second harmonic current (SHC) at the dc port. Although the conventional virtual-resistor (VR) based control method can suppress the SHC, the SHC reduction performance is limited by its dynamic performance. To address the above issues, based on the unified small-signal model of the dc&#8211;dc converter, a virtual fractional-order-inductor (FOI) based control method is proposed in this article to reduce the SHC and improve the system dynamic performance. The order and magnitude of the fractional-order inductor can be modified arbitrarily. A negative order inductor is constructed in this article to reduce the SHC and improve the system dynamic performance. In addition, the proposed virtual FOI-based control method can improve the stability of both dc&#8211;dc converter and the cascaded system. The comparison of the proposed fractional-order inductor and conventional VR-based control method is given and the design method of key parameters is presented. Finally, an 800-W two-stage single-phase inverter with the upstream boost converter is fabricated and tested in the laboratory to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control method.</description></item><item><title>Weighted DC Virtual Generator Control Scheme for Interlinking Converters in DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292499</link><description>This article proposes a new control strategy for power electronic converters interfacing two dc networks. The proposed control, based on a modification of the dc virtual generator concept, has grid-forming capability in both sides of the converter simultaneously without intermediate energy storage device. Departing from the dc virtual generator control concept, capable of controlling voltage in one of the converter sides while withdrawing the power from the other side, an adaptation is done to make it reversible. A priority weight is assigned to each side voltage control. A weight calculation method, proportional to the voltage deviation from its rated value, is proposed. This weight calculation strategy makes the control system to contribute to the side most in need (using voltage deviation with respect to rated value as an indicator of the neediness). The interlinking converter with the proposed weighted strategy is capable of stable work in grid-forming mode at both sides simultaneously, just requiring a grid-feeding converter with $P/V$ droop to be connected in either side. No control architecture was found in the literature with this capability for dc&#8211;dc interlinking converters. The theoretical discussion has been supported with small-signal analysis and hardware-in-the-loop validation.</description></item><item><title>Minimization of Current Stress for Dual Active Bridge Converters Based on Model Predictive Control With Enhanced ZVS Ability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315245</link><description>Efficiency is a crucial concern for dual active bridge (DAB) converters. Although many studies on novel modulation schemes have attempted to improve the efficiency, achieving the optimal balance between current stress and zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) ability remains challenging. In addition, due to the wide operating range of DABs, small-signal models have to be setup at each equilibrium point to purpose a high performance of liner controllers. Existing works mainly employ the slow-loop to prevent oscillations during transitions, which degrades the dynamic and bandwidth. To address the current state of research, this article proposes a triple-phase-shift modulation combined with model predictive control (MPC) for DABs. Herein, a designed cost function initially calculates shift-angles. Subsequently, a proposed optimization segment for ZVS checks and revises the ZVS ability to select an optimal set of shift angles. The current stress is minimized on the premise that the wide range of ZVS is guaranteed. Meanwhile, the dynamic performance is improved through the nonlinearity of MPC. Finally, a 1.4-kW scaled-down prototype is built, and the experimental comparisons with other schemes verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Federated-Learning-Based Distributed Frequency Control Against False Data Injection Attack</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10305493</link><description>This article proposes the federated-learning-based second-order recurrent neural network (SORNN&#8211;FL) for distributed frequency control of a multimicrogrid (MMG) system. The problem is conceptualized as proportional&#8211;integral derivative consensus control using the Lyapunov function, which depicts the behavior of recurrent neural network (RNN). The parameters of the controller are obtained by deriving the dynamics of energy function to update the state of neurons. During the learning process, FL of weights is adopted to improve the performance of the network by increasing the communication among the neurons. The effectiveness of the developed SORNN&#8211;FL controller is tested for the MMG system, and its performance is compared with those of the MMG system using SORNN, RNN, and the conventional method of tuning. The results obtained reveal that the proposed higher order control gives an improved performance during uncertainties and communication failure. Specifically, we use a differential privacy mechanism to secure the data from false data injection attacks by the invaders. The various extensive cases studied on the MMG system demonstrate that the proposed privacy-preserving-based SORNN&#8211;FL scheme is robust and efficient. Even if a communication failure and a malicious attack occur in the MMG system, our proposed control scheme can regulate the system frequency and maintain system stability. The real-time validation has been demonstrated at the 0.4-kV microgrid test-bed system in the laboratory.</description></item><item><title>A New Macro Dynamic Demand Response Strategy Considering Micro Power Quality Disturbance for Wind-Storage Integrated System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304361</link><description>This article developed a new methodology of macro dynamic demand response (DDR) strategy considering micropower quality disturbance (PQD) for wind-storage integrated systems. A novel idea has been presented in this methodology to eliminate the barrier of PQD and renewable energy dynamic adjustment. At the microlevel for PQD elimination, a filtering strategy of Butterworth&#8211;Wiener filter (Bw-WF) is proposed to deal with the frequency interference PQD in wind-storage integrated system by Bw and the WF. The method connects the macro DDR and the PQD elimination at the microlevel for the stable wind power output after PQD elimination. At the macrolevel for dynamic adjustment, the Hampel&#8211;Savitzky&#8211;Golay macropower filtering method is proposed to calculate the low-frequency power in line with the national standards. Considering all wind power participates in the DDR, the change of DDR and the adjusted power curves are calculated based on the Logistics function, optimistic response, and pessimistic response factors. Through the experimental verification, it is found that the power and state of charge curves of energy storage can be significantly changed by the subtle dynamic changes during an ultra-short period. Also, it is demonstrated that the theoretical method proposed in this article is reliable and promising.</description></item><item><title>Offline Equalization Control of Modular Multilevel Converter-Based Battery Energy Storage System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10323264</link><description>The modular multilevel converter-based battery energy storage system (MMC-BESS) can help the power grid to run safely and stably, which plays an important role in the modern power grid. The inconsistency of cells in BESS may lead to overcharge or overdischarge of cells, which may decrease the operation life of battery packs and cause safety problems. Normally, before the MMC-BESS is connected to the grid, it is necessary to prebalance the system batteries in an offline state. This article analyzes the topology, the mathematical model, and the equalization control model in offline MMC-BESS. According to the analysis, an offline MMC-BESS stepwise balancing control strategy considering the state of charge, state of health, and state of function, is proposed. In this strategy, the state of dischargeable energy is set as the criterion of offline equalization of the system. The balancing of submodules in MMC-BESS would be achieved by controlling the circulating currents and voltages of arms. Finally, the feasibility of the offline equalization control strategy is verified by simulation and experiment.</description></item><item><title>Novel DC-Bus Voltage Controller for Three-Phase Photovoltaic Microinverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10269717</link><description>In this article, a novel fast dc-bus voltage controller is proposed for the application of a three-phase photovoltaic microinverter. A three-phase microinverter, comprising a two-stage power conversion architecture, consists of a small dc-bus capacitor due to the absence of any low-frequency power oscillations. However, conventional voltage controllers used to regulate the dc-bus voltage result in large transient voltage fluctuations that can result in unnecessary interruptions in inverter operation. Therefore, a fast responding voltage controller is proposed that results in reducing the voltage fluctuations in the dc-bus during transients, leading to stable and robust operation of the microinverter. The proposed controller is implemented using a lookup table so that the computational burden of the digital processor does not increase. The theoretical analysis and the superior performance of the proposed control system are verified through a 1.2-kW experimental prototype of a three-phase microinverter.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Dual-LC Resonant DC Circuit Breaker Employing Soft-Switching Technique for Enhanced Performance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10288138</link><description>DC circuit breakers (DCCBs) are crucial equipment to ensure safe and stable operation of the dc systems. Resonant DCCBs (RCBs) have recently gained significant attention due to their ability to generate multiple zero-crossing points for mechanical switches, which leads to high reliability. However, existing solutions either necessitate the use of precharged capacitors or have continuous hard-switching requirements for power electronic devices, which require improvement in terms of both economy and reliability. To address these challenges, this article proposes a dual-LC RCB employing soft-switching technique for enhanced performance. The dual-LC RCB adds an additional LC circuit in parallel with the power electronic devices and oscillate synergistically with the original main LC circuit. This configuration achieves soft-switching on power electronic devices, significantly reducing the potential for damage caused by high junction temperatures. As a result, the dual-LC RCB offers improved reliability. The topology structure and operation principle of dual-LC RCB are first introduced, followed by a complete parameter optimization design method. A 10 kV/10 kA prototype is constructed to verify the interruption capability of the topology structure and the correctness of the parameter design principle.</description></item><item><title>Coordinate Sizing and Control of the Onboard Pulse Power Supply System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10273139</link><description>Onboard pulse power load features a high peak-to-average ratio, which would significantly impact the stable operation of the power supply system (PSS). Specifically, the supply voltage may reduce dramatically and eventually trigger system protection, thus sacrificing reliability. One effective way to address this issue is to connect an active capacitor, which is defined as a capacitor with a bidirectional dc/dc converter, to the power supply's output. However, as the active capacitor is usually used to accommodate all the pulsed load with the conventional control schemes, the power supply's specific power would be limited due to the less optimized system's volume, making its implementation constrained. In this article, a coordinate sizing strategy is first proposed. The system's volume is minimized by using the battery to supply a portion of the pulsed load. Afterward, a simple pulsed current reference generation method is proposed for the active capacitor. The pulse power tracking performance is further improved. A prototype of a pulse PSS with 2.7-kW constant power and 30-kW peak power is designed in the lab. The experimental results verify the validity of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive Stabilization Strategy for Harmonic Oscillation of SAPF Interacted With Nonlinear Load and Grid Impedance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10311351</link><description>A shunt active power filter (SAPF) can interact with the nonlinear load and grid impedance, which may lead to unexpected harmonic oscillation. To describe the interaction, this article builds the interaction model including the source-current-detected SAPF, nonlinear load, and grid impedance. The interaction model reveals that the harmonic oscillation is prone to occur when the passive resonant frequency from grid impedance and nonlinear loads gets close to the harmonic frequency compensated by SAPF. This kind of harmonic oscillation is normally unpredictable because grid impedance and state of the nonlinear load continuously change. To cope with it, this article proposes a harmonic oscillation observation and adaptive stabilization strategy, which is implemented by monitoring and controlling the phase trajectory of the grid harmonic current through adjusting the phase and emergency damping factor of the harmonic resonant controllers in SAPF. This strategy has low requirement on real-time calculation and does not affect the dynamic response of the SAPF. In the end, the effectiveness of the stabilization strategy is verified by experiment results.</description></item><item><title>Feedback Control of Doubly-Fed Generator Connected to Current Source Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10293255</link><description>Doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) system supplied by current source converter (CSC) is considered in this article. The DFIG can work in two independent modes: AC grid connection and stand-alone mode. The DFIG is connected to the ac grid directly through its stator and the CSC links the rotor side. In this mode, the active and reactive powers of the DFIG must be controlled. This article proposes two control system structures for the DFIG working in the generator mode. Both control structures are based on nonlinear transformations but on different state-feedback control variables. The selection of the variables is similar to the input&#8211;output linearization but more complicated due to the CSC and &#8220;voltage control&#8221; involved. Both proposed control structures ensure independent control of the active and reactive powers with different accuracies; as evidenced in the simulation and experimental results. The proposed approach can be named by voltage control of the DFIG because the control variables are the voltage in the dc-link and the angular speed of the output current vector from the inverter. For both proposed control structures, the current in the dc-link is not a constant value, but depends on the dynamic states and values of the controlled powers; thus, it varies accordingly. The proposed control strategy can be applied to low- and high-power DFIG systems. Simulation and experimental results from a 2-kW generator validate theoretical propositions.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Hierarchical Energy Management System With Plug-and-Play Capability for Neighborhood Home Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10288140</link><description>With the increasing adoption of renewable energy sources, researchers are actively engaged in the development of smart grid technologies. This study introduces a home energy management system (HEMS) designed to optimize home microgrid (HMG) operation by integrating electric vehicles (EVs) through a hierarchical three-level distributed control approach. The proposed system governs the power transfer of distributed energy sources through converter control at the primary level, while employing an intelligent optimal power exchange technique for EVs and energy storage (ES) at the secondary level. To achieve optimal energy demand management, the system employs a two-layer strategy, comprising offline and online scheduling, utilizing particle swarm optimization and artificial neural network to reduce computing time. The offline scheduling formulates a deterministic optimization model to minimize HMG operation costs, thereby extending ES lifetime through optimal load-sharing. The online scheduling approach enables real-time performance under uncertainty and accommodates plug-and-play renewable energy sources, HMGs, loads, and batteries. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is tested using MATLAB/Simulink simulations over a 24-h period, affirming its ability to respond promptly to HEMS status changes and adapt decision-making methods to new conditions with improved training time and reduced mean square error. In addition, experimental studies on two laboratory-based HMGs demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed HEMS.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Model-Free Adaptive Control Strategy for Hybrid AC/DC Microgrid With Event-Triggered Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10324405</link><description>A distributed control strategy (DCS) is an efficient way to realize power sharing among distributed generators (DGs) and restore the voltage deviation caused by droop control. However, there are several limitations in the traditional strategy of hybrid ac/dc microgrid (MG), such as the heavy communication burden and sensitivity to the working conditions. In this article, a distributed model-free adaptive control strategy (DMFAC) is proposed with an event-triggered (ET) mechanism. A unified control framework of hybrid MG is established and the ET-DMFAC can operate within it to realize multiple control strategies simultaneously. The dynamic linearization parameters of hybrid MG are estimated online to reflect the working condition, and an ET mechanism is designed to reduce the communication burden. The stability of ET-DMFAC is analyzed with the discrete Lyapunov theory and experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed ET-DMFAC strategy under different operating conditions. The outperformance of ET-DMFAC is demonstrated by comparing it with many existing DCS of hybrid AC/DC MG.</description></item><item><title>Output Current Quality Improvement for VSC With Capability of Compensating Voltage Harmonics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10321720</link><description>Using the voltage source converter (VSC) to compensate for voltage harmonics at the point of common coupling (PCC) is beneficial for the power supply quality in the regional power grid. However, it leads to a significant deterioration of output current quality for VSC. This article aims to develop the design principle and realization method for impedance reshaping in VSC used for compensating voltage harmonics with the minimal sacrifice of the output current quality. By revealing the coupling constraint between the voltage harmonics of PCC and the output current harmonics of VSC, a harmonics impedance design principle for VSC is proposed. This principle indicates that the impedance phase of VSC should be identical to the phase of grid impedance at the frequency of harmonics. Hence, an impedance reshaping strategy based on the variable-phase reduced-order generalized integrator is developed, which can reshape the VSC's impedance to fulfill the harmonics impedance design principle under different grid conditions. Compared to existing studies, the proposed harmonics impedance design principle and realization method meet the same requirement of the voltage quality at PCC with a lower VSC's output current quality sacrifice. Theoretical analysis and experiments are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>A Current Controllable Active Transient-Voltage Compensation Circuit for Voltage Regulator Module</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10311370</link><description>In this article, a novel current controllable active transient-voltage-compensation circuit (CC-ATVCC) is proposed to mitigate output voltage overshoot and undershoot in voltage regulator module (VRM) during load transients. The current difference between the VRM output and the load is compensated by field effect transistors in the proposed CC-ATVCC so that the output voltage spikes are suppressed. In the proposed CC-ATVCC, a high gain analog drive circuit, consisting of an operational amplifier cascaded with a common-source amplification circuit, provides adjustable drive voltage, which flexibly changes the compensation current. Furthermore, a time-domain model is developed in this article to analyze the interaction between VRM and the proposed CC-ATVCC, guiding the circuit design under universal conditions. Finally, the proposed CC-ATVCC has been built and tested in a 12-phase 500 A interleaved buck converter. The results show that the overshoot of the output voltage can be reduced by 34% using the proposed CC-ATVCC and the footprint of CC-ATVCC is only 10% compared with the traditional capacitor-only solution. The proposed CC-ATVCC can reduce the number of output capacitors and greatly increase the power density of VRM.</description></item><item><title>Incentivized Coordinated Heat-Electricity-Gas Dispatch: A Zero Knowledge Proof-Based Solution Considering Privacy and Anti-Forgery</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10183368</link><description>The coordination of multienergy systems has been commonly adopted to improve energy utilization performance. Reallocating profits of all systems is utilized to provide incentives for the coordination. However, some systems might forge their profits to maliciously obtain more reallocated profits. Existing works partially solve this problem by developing privacy-preserving anti-forgery methods that focus on the coordination of two energy systems with linear constraints. This article proposes a coordinated heat-electricity-gas dispatch mechanism that addresses incentive, privacy and anti-forgery issues. The coordination model based on Nash bargaining is decomposed into both a dispatch problem that maximizes the total profit and a profit reallocation problem that provides incentives. The profit reallocation problem is solved using exponential ElGamal encryption to avoid leaking the profit variation of each system before and after coordination. Furthermore, to prevent any system from forging its profit for maliciously obtaining more reallocated profit, we propose a privacy-preserving anti-forgery method based on zero knowledge proof. The method enables each system to prove that its profit variation satisfies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the dispatch problem with nonlinear constraints. The numerical tests show that our proposed method provides incentives for coordination and detects forgery of profit variation without leaking privacy.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Privacy-Preserving Secondary Control for DC Microgrids via State Decomposition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10207776</link><description>In this article, a distributed secondary controller is proposed for an islanded DC microgrid to preserve privacy information of the local power sources, while achieving current sharing among the generators and voltage regulation of the DC bus. Based on the state decomposition mechanism, the original secondary control signal of each generator is decomposed into two parts: one takes over the role of communicating with neighbors, while the other affects the evolution of the former one and is invisible to the neighbors. Besides, random noises are introduced to mask the true value of the transmitted signals. Under the proposed controller, the current data of the local generators can be kept confidential, as well as the associated privacy power information. In this way, the power security risks caused by privacy information leakage can be avoided. Lastly, both simulation and experiment tests are imposed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Reactive Current Optimization Based Onshore AC Fault Ride-Through Strategy for MMC-HVDC Integrated Offshore Wind Farms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10207701</link><description>Onshore AC faults may cause the modular multilevel converter based high voltage direct current integrated offshore wind farms (MMC-HVDC-OWF) to develop surplus power and trigger overvoltage problems. This article proposes a dynamic reactive current optimization (DRO) strategy that combines MMC energy control capability with transient overload capability to achieve onshore AC fault ride-through (ACFRT). Firstly, the decoupling control mechanism and constraints of the active and reactive currents of the onshore gird-side MMC (GSMMC) are analyzed. Furthermore, a dynamic reactive current optimization based ACFRT strategy is proposed based on the current constraints and the energy control capability of MMCs. The main parameters of DRO are set according to the fault characteristic analysis results. Once a fault occurs, the proposed DRO based ACFRT strategy can control the offshore surplus power by controlling the MMC internal sub-module energy. The DRO strategy quickly optimizes the active and reactive power output commands of the GSMMC by collecting and comparing the local power signals. It enables to increase the onshore AC grid voltage and the transient active power output of the MMC-HVDC-OWF. Finally, The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified through comprehensive case studies conducted on the PSCAD/EMTDC.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive PI Control of Wave Energy Converters With Force and Motion Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10207822</link><description>This article presents the application of adaptive PI control design to a point absorber - wave energy converter (WEC) under force and motion constraints. Adaptive PI control has several features that make it attractive for WEC system. In particular, it has a clear physical interpretation. The &#8220;P&#8221; component converts the wave energy into useful energy, while the &#8220;I&#8221; component changes the WEC system natural frequency allowing the absorber to be more in phase with the incoming waves. However, standard adaptive PI control schemes in the literature do not have the ability to incorporate the constraints in the design phase. The main objective of this article is to fill this gap by proposing a new adaptive PI control law that can take the constraints into account. Simulation results show that the new control law can improve the performance while respecting system limitations.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Optimization of Photovoltaic Power With Lifted Linear Decision Rule for Distribution System Voltage Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10214028</link><description>This article proposes a lifted linear decision rule (LLDR) as a photovoltaic (PV) power control strategy for distribution system voltage regulation. First, the active-reactive power control is designed as a linear function in a lifted space of PV power, which is presented as a piecewise linear function without auxiliary integer variables for benefiting the parameter optimization of control functions. Then, a hierarchical central-local voltage regulation framework is designed. In the central control stage, the constant part of LLDR determines the reactive power of PV units, which is also coordinated with other voltage regulation devices. In the local control stage, the adjustable part of LLDR would control the PV power in real time for reducing voltage deviations. Finally, optimization problems and their solution methods are developed to obtain LLDR parameters. In particular, robust optimization (RO) and distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems are designed to obtain the affine coefficients of LLDR considering multiple PV power uncertainty models. The tractable formula of RO is derived based on the convex hull of PV power uncertainty sets in the lifted space, and Benders decomposition is combined with a distribution separation method to solve the DRO problem. The proposed method is tested on distribution systems with actual PV power data, and the results are compared with those of other linear and piecewise-linear control methods to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in diminishing voltage deviations caused by variable PV power.</description></item><item><title>Active Fault Current Limitation for VSC-MTDC Integrated Offshore Wind Farms Participating in Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10218998</link><description>The onshore local grid is facing the challenge to avoid continuously increasing fault current caused by frequency regulation (FR) of broad-scale offshore wind farms (OWFs) integrated by voltage source converter based multi-terminal high voltage direct current (VSC-MTDC) system. To tackle this challenge, an active fault current limitation (AFCL) method is proposed in four aspects: 1) a fault current contribution factor (FCCF) is introduced for grid side VSC (GSVSC) to quantify the incremental degree of fault current caused by FR of GSVSC under different fault types; 2) a current phase angle control (CPAC) strategy based on vector analysis is conducted for GSVSC to actively mitigate the fault current increment; 3) according to FCCF and CPAC, an active and reactive current quantification (ARCQ) strategy is developed for GSVSC to satisfy bilateral demands of AFCL and FR; 4) an adaptive frequency regulation (AFR) strategy, which considers FCCF and the operating conditions of the offshore system (e.g., rotor speed and DC voltage), is formulated for OWFs to quantify and generate the active power required for FR and AFCL. Numerous test results are analyzed to verify the effectiveness and performance of the proposed AFCL method in satisfying system fault current limitation during FR of OWFs.</description></item><item><title>Uncertainty-Aware Procurement of Flexibilities for Electrical Grid Operational Planning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10221712</link><description>In the power system decarbonization roadmap, novel grid management tools and market mechanisms are fundamental to solving technical problems concerning renewable energy forecast uncertainty. This work proposes a predictive algorithm for procurement of grid flexibility by the system operator (SO), which combines the SO flexible assets with active and reactive power short-term flexibility markets. The goal is to reduce the cognitive load of the human operator when analyzing multiple flexibility options and trajectories for the forecasted load/RES and create a human-in-the-loop approach for balancing risk, stakes, and cost. This work also formulates the decision problem into several steps where the operator must decide to book flexibility now or wait for the next forecast update (time-to-decide method), considering that flexibility (availability) price may increase with a lower notification time. Numerical results obtained for a public MV grid (Oberrhein) show that the time-to-decide method improves up to 22% a performance indicator related to a cost-loss matrix, compared to the option of booking the flexibility now at a lower price and without waiting for a forecast update.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Negative-Emission Optimal Energy Scheduling for Off-Grid Integrated Electricity-Heat Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10224346</link><description>This article proposes a distributionally robust chance-constrained (DRCC) negative-emission optimal energy scheduling scheme for the off-grid integrated electricity-heat microgrid (IEHM). A negative-emission operating strategy is designed to regulate the electric power, thermal power, and carbon emission of the off-grid IEHM under uncertainty. The post-combustion carbon capture system (PCCS) and direct air capture (DAC) modeling consider both electric and thermal energy consumption. Besides, the duration of DAC process flow is considered in its model. In the DRCC energy scheduling model for the off-grid IEHM, the negative emission is achieved by scheduling PCCS and DAC, and the negative emission constraint is included considering the uncertainty of carbon emission. The uncertain forecasting errors of wind power are balanced by coordinating the combined heat and power unit and battery storage. DRCC approach under the moment-based ambiguity set is employed to tackle both uncertainties. The DRCC energy scheduling model is reformulated as a tractable mixed-integer second-order cone programming. Evaluation indices are defined from three aspects, i.e., carbon emission, economy, and reserve capacity, to assess the overall performance of the DRCC energy scheduling scheme for the off-grid IEHM. Case studies were carried out on two test systems to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Simulation results demonstrate that the off-grid IEHM can achieve negative emission operation while minimizing the energy cost under wind power and carbon emission uncertainty.</description></item><item><title>Combined Heat and Power Dispatch Against Cold Waves Utilizing Responsive Internet Data Centers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10224307</link><description>The extreme weather disaster is a main threat to the operation of integrated electricity and heat systems (IEHSs), particularly the cold wave, which is prone to cause surges in regional demand for heat and electricity. In IEHSs, Internet data centers (IDCs) consume a huge amount of electricity and generate waste heat. The former can be regulated spatially by migrating workloads in the interconnected data network and interrupted temporally with the equipped backup generators or uninterruptible power supply (UPS), the latter can be captured and supplied to the districts using heat pump facilities. Thus, energy behaviors of IDCs are impressively responsive, which are completely considered and dispatched to enhance the resilience of IEHSs against cold waves in this paper. Firstly, the integrated energy response (IER) meaning responsive electricity consumption and heat production of IDCs is modelled considering workload scheduling and emergency standby power supply. Secondly, the adverse impacts of cold waves on IEHS operation are comprehensively formulated using intervals considering both component outages and sudden energy demand increases. Moreover, a scenario-based stochastic optimization model with interval parameters is constructed incorporating IER formulations, in which both unit commitment plan of IEHSs and IER strategies of IDCs are simultaneously optimized. Furthermore, a two-stage stochastic-interval solution method is proposed to handle the hybrid heterogeneous uncertainties in the model based on the L-shaped algorithm and interval linear programming theory. Numerical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques using a test IEHS composed of IEEE 118-bus system, seven 32-node heating systems, and eight IDCs.</description></item><item><title>Joint Optimization of Production and Maintenance in Offshore Wind Farms: Balancing the Short- and Long-Term Needs of Wind Energy Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10229237</link><description>The rapid increase in scale and sophistication of offshore wind (OSW) farms poses a critical challenge related to the cost-effective operation and management of wind energy assets. A defining characteristic of this challenge is the economic trade-off between two concomitant processes: power production (the primary driver of short-term revenues), and asset degradation (the main determinant of long-term expenses). Traditionally, approaches to optimize production and maintenance in wind farms have been conducted in isolation. In this article, we conjecture that a joint optimization of those two processes, achieved by rigorously modeling their short- and long-term dependencies, can unlock significant economic benefits for wind farm operators. In specific, we propose a decision-theoretic framework, rooted in stochastic optimization, which seeks a sensible balance of how wind loads are leveraged to harness short-term electricity generation revenues, versus alleviated to hedge against longer-term maintenance expenses. Extensive numerical experiments using real-world data confirm the superior performance of our approach, in terms of several operational performance metrics, relative to methods that tackle the two problems in isolation.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Data Center Energy Management With Hybrid Quantum-Classical Multi-Cuts Benders' Decomposition Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10232912</link><description>The flourishing of the data era has led to a higher demand for hyper-scale data centers, resulting in a great energy gap. It is necessary to comprehensively analyze the energy management in data centers to minimize the operation cost. In this article, we first propose a new optimal energy management model for data centers by considering energy consumers such as heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC), server, solar, and battery. Then, inspired by the great computation power of quantum computing techniques, we propose a new hybrid quantum-classical multi-cuts Benders' decomposition algorithm, which utilizes quantum advantages in parallel computing for generating multi-cuts in a single iteration. Finally, experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the novel model and algorithms.</description></item><item><title>A Two-Stage Stochastic Unit Commitment With Mixed-Integer Recourses for Nuclear Power Plants to Accommodate Renewable Energy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10243161</link><description>To provide flexibilities for peak regulations in power systems while addressing renewable energy uncertainties, this article proposes a two-stage stochastic unit commitment model with peak regulation constraints of nuclear power plants (NPPs) under the &#8220;12-3-6-3&#8221; mode. The first stage aims to determine the optimal thermal unit commitment, and the second stage tries to adjust the operation modes of an NPP and thermal unit generation output to cope with different renewable energy scenarios. Due to the discrete adjustments of NPPs, the proposed model is mathematically a two-stage stochastic optimization with mixed-integer recourses. Furthermore, a Fenchel cut based bilevel decomposition is proposed to solve this model, where the inner second-stage subproblem is first relaxed into a linear program and a Fenchel cut is then generated to recover the facet of the convex hull solution. The technique can significantly accelerate the computational speed of the proposed model with a special mathematical structure. Numerical results on a provincial power system verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and method.</description></item><item><title>Sky-Image-Derived Deep Decomposition for Ultra-Short-Term Photovoltaic Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10246013</link><description>Because of the stochastic and nonstationary weather changes, photovoltaic (PV) power exhibits high uncertainty and fluctuation, which severely challenges the operation of power systems. PV variations can be detected by investigating inherent properties and reflections of sky images. However, limited study has focused on the effect of sky image changes on PV inherent properties. Therefore, in this study, a novel sky-image-derived decomposition method was proposed for ultra-short-term PV power forecasting. First, historical PV series were decomposed into seasonal and trend parts with guidance of sky image sequence. The Auto-Correlation mechanism was adopted to enhance the temporal dependencies of seasonal parts. Then, to reduce the model instability in different weather scenarios, the latent features were handled by an improved density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise using a semi-supervised strategy to identify forecasting scenarios. Finally, a rolling scenario-wise decoder was proposed to conduct multi-step forecasting task. The proposed method was compared with various state-of-the-art methods, including empirical mode decomposition and deep decomposition methods. The results validated the high performance of the proposed method in terms of accuracy within forecast horizons of 5 to 30 min.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Management of Hybrid Energy Station Under Exogenous-Endogenous Uncertainties and Bounded Rationality</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10252038</link><description>Hybrid energy station (HES) systems coupling diverse energy sectors can facilitate the low-carbon and sustainable transition by integrating massive wind-solar power and energy conversion technologies. With the proliferation of renewable and flexible demand response (DR), different uncertainties are inevitably introduced into energy systems because of external volatile surroundings and internal consumers' mutable behavior. Moreover, the probability distribution function (PDF) of these uncertainties may be unavailable or ambiguous and even affected by decisions. In this work, we propose a hierarchical optimal framework for HES systems, in which the energy hub plant determines the schedules of generation and trade in different markets (upper-level) and users minimize energy expense by managing facilities operations considering decision-dependent uncertainties (lower-level). A scheme of energy transaction options is also provided under the bounded rationality of user sides. To tackle problems with uncertain PDFs, a tailored chance-constrained distributionally robust method is implemented. In the process, the correlation DR operation pattern and analytic pricing formulation are derived incorporating the property of users. Case studies with comparison tests validate the efficacy of the proposed model in handling uncertainties and pursuing economic profits.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Service Restoration of Distribution Networks With Volt-Var Devices, Distributed Energy Resources, and Energy Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10251925</link><description>The new energy resources in distribution systems have led researchers to consider the operation of such elements during service restoration. Hence, the current state-of-the-art regarding the restoration problem considers the operation of distributed resources in both island and grid-connected modes. Few articles also address the system's restoration capacity changes throughout the time needed to repair the network after an outage, given the variations in the system's demand and availability of energy sources. However, the solutions proposed in the literature converge in proposing a single topology that is feasible throughout the entire repairing time. In this article, we propose addressing the mutable nature of the system's restoration capacity by splitting the repairing time into several time intervals and associating each of them with a specific configuration that minimizes the out-of-service load. Energy storage systems, intermittent and dispatchable generators, and voltage-control devices are also considered. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). The model and its scalability are tested using the 53-, 217-, and 404-node systems, considering different fault scenarios and reliability indices. The results show that the nonsupplied energy during the repairing time decreases when dynamic changes in the system topology are considered. Furthermore, the effects of storage systems operation and their integration with dynamic topology changes are highlighted.</description></item><item><title>Coordinating Multi-Energy Microgrids for Integrated Energy System Resilience: A Multi-Task Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10255302</link><description>High-impact and low-probability events have occurred more frequently than before, which can seriously damage energy supply infrastructures. As localized small energy systems, multi-energy microgrids (MEMGs) can provide a viable solution for the system-wise load restoration of integrated energy systems (IESs), due to their enhanced flexibility and controllability. However, existing literature tends to realize MEMGs as corrective response rather than load restoration resource after extreme events, which cannot fully exploit the benefits of multi-MEMGs on IES resilience. This article introduces a decentralized operating paradigm for the real-time coordination of local multi-MEMGs towards system-wise IES load restoration, while a novel topology-aware multi-task reinforcement learning method with soft modularization is proposed to solve it. The multi-task learning framework enables MEMGs to simultaneously learn scheduling decisions across different network topologies and better adapt to unanticipated contingencies. Additionally, to avoid insecure MEMG operations, a physics-informed safety layer is embedded on top of the multi-task learning framework for action corrections. Case studies have been conducted on two IESs (33-bus power, 20-node gas, and 20-node heat network as well as 69-bus power, 40-node gas, and 62-node heat network) to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enabling effective coordination among multi-MEMGs towards system-wise IES load restoration.</description></item><item><title>Virtual Inertia Scheduling (VIS) for Real-Time Economic Dispatch of IBR-Penetrated Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10264213</link><description>A new concept called virtual inertia scheduling (VIS) is proposed to efficiently handle the increasing penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) in power systems. VIS is an inertia management framework that targets security-constrained and economy-oriented inertia scheduling and generation dispatch with a large scale of renewable generations. Specifically, it determines the appropriate power setpoint and reserved capacity of synchronous generators and IBRs, as well as the control modes and control parameters of IBRs to provide secure and cost-effective inertia support. First, a uniform system model is employed to quantify the frequency dynamics of IBR-penetrated power systems after disturbances. Leveraging this model, the s-domain and time-domain analytical responses of IBRs with inertia support capability are derived. Then, VIS-based real-time economic dispatch (VIS-RTED) is formulated to minimize generation and reserve costs, with full consideration of dynamic frequency constraints and the derived inertia support reserve constraints. The virtual inertia and damping of IBRs are formulated as decision variables. A deep learning-assisted linearization approach is further employed to address the non-linearity of dynamic constraints. Finally, VIS-RTED is demonstrated on a two-machine system and a modified IEEE 39-bus system. A full-order time-domain simulation is performed to verify the scheduling results.</description></item><item><title>Proactive Scheduling of Mixed Energy Resources At Different Grid Levels</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10265110</link><description>The optimal utilisation of distribution grids requires the proactive management of volatilities caused by mixed energy resources installed into different grid levels, such as buildings, energy communities (ECs) and substations. In this context, proactive control based on predictions for energy demand and generation is applied. The mitigation of conflicts between the stakeholders' objectives is the main challenge for the control of centralized and distributed energy resources. In this article, a bi-level approach is proposed for the control of stationary battery energy storage systems (SBES) supporting the local distribution system operator (DSO) at the transformer level, as well as distributed energy resources (DERs) operated by end customers, i.e., EC-members. Model predictive control (MPC)-based and hybrid approaches merging rule- and MPC-based control schemes are evaluated. Simulation studies based on a typical European low voltage (LV) feeder topology yield the performance assessment in terms of technical and economic criteria. The results show an advantage of hybrid approaches with respect to the DSO's cost savings from peak shaving. From the EC's perspective, both hybrid and MPC-based schemes can achieve effective cost savings from proactive energy management.</description></item><item><title>An Anti-Windup Mechanism for State Constrained Linear Control of Wave Energy Conversion Systems: Design, Synthesis, and Experimental Assessment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10266789</link><description>Motivated by the necessity of suitable state constraint mechanisms within linear time-invariant (LTI) energy-maximising control of wave energy converters (WECs), we present, in this article, an anti-windup (AW) scheme for state constraint satisfaction, where the associated unconstrained controller is designed via impedance-matching theory for WEC systems. As in the standard (input) AW scenario, the adopted technique provides a mechanism for &#8216;informing&#8217; the (unconstrained) controller when constraints are active, so that appropriate modifications to future control actions can be taken accordingly. The overall adopted AW technique is tested experimentally, on a prototype of the Wavestar WEC system, available at Aalborg University (Denmark). We explicitly demonstrate that the proposed AW scheme is able to consistently respect the defined state constraints, having a mild impact on overall energy absorption performance when compared to its unconstrained counterpart.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Objective Estimation of Optimal Prediction Intervals for Wind Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268627</link><description>Accurate and reliable wind power forecasting is crucial for efficient operation in a power system. Due to the substantial uncertainties associated with wind generation, probabilistic interval forecasting offers a distinct approach for assessing and quantifying the potential impacts and risks that may arise from the integration of wind energy into a power system. This article proposes a novel multi-objective lower upper bound estimation method to directly construct optimal wind power intervals without the assumption of any specific distribution function. Prediction intervals at a nominal confidence level are formulated through simultaneously optimizing the Winkler loss and coverage probability. The proposed framework is gradient descent-enabled and therefore allows flexible integration of various deep learning algorithms. An evaluation using four wind power datasets is conducted, and the results are analyzed and compared with those from several benchmark models. The findings indicate the proposed method outperforms its counterparts in terms of both reliability and overall performance.</description></item><item><title>Collaborative Response of Data Center Coupled With Hydrogen Storage System for Renewable Energy Absorption</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10269736</link><description>The demand response of data center is considered as an effective flexible method to absorb excessive renewable energy (RE) in the power system, especially for the data center with high-density hydrogen storages. Therefore, this article proposes a collaborative response framework considering regulations of data workload and hydrogen storage. It is expected to further improve the data center flexibility. However, this collaborative response is a high-order and non-convex optimization problem involving the multi-period and complex model. Considering the condition of uncertain RE supply, it is difficult for power optimization dispatch to realize the precise decision in this NP-hard problem. To address this issue, a global interval optimization (GIO) approach is developed. It is to obtain efficient and robust decisions in the collaborative response. This approach deduces an interval optimization model to achieve the global optimality of convergent solution. Furthermore, this article introduces a probability correction into the GIO approach. It is used for improving the decision accuracy in the actual renewable power scenarios. A case study based on the IEEE 24-bus system verifies superiority of the GIO approach. It further validates effectiveness of the collaborative response framework for RE utilization.</description></item><item><title>A Regulation Method Considering Coupled Voltage Violation and Unbalance in Three-Phase Four-Wire Hybrid AC/DC LVDNs With High Penetration PVs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10272708</link><description>Low-voltage distribution networks (LVDNs) have witnessed an increasing penetration of distributed photovoltaics (PVs), which exacerbates the existing voltage violation and voltage unbalance issues. PVs, energy storage systems, and voltage source converters can regulate voltages in hybrid AC/DC LVDNs. To solve the above two voltage problems simultaneously, a partition-based coordinated regulation method is proposed in this article considering the coupling of the two issues and the effect of active power on reactive power in electrical distance calculation. The voltage adjustments in different voltage violation scenarios are obtained based on a graph that describes the coupling of the two issues mathematically. In order to better determine control devices, the equivalent coefficient of active power adjustment on electrical distance calculation is considered in the partition method, in which regulation efficiency, regulation cost, and regulation capability are used as objectives. The coordination of controllable devices is achieved according to three-phase four-wire sensitivities. Case studies are performed to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed regulation method in hybrid AC/DC LVDNs.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Step Clustering and Generalized Nash Bargaining-Based Planning Strategy of Community-Shared Energy Storage for Large-Scale Prosumers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10274997</link><description>Inspired by economies of scale, the joint planning of community-shared energy storage (CSES) among prosumers provides a new solution to the issues of high investment costs associated with independent construction of individual energy storage. However, the cooperation among large-scale prosumers is rarely investigated and there is an urgent need to formulate an appropriate strategy. Hence, a multi-step clustering and generalized Nash bargaining (GNB)-based CSES joint planning strategy for large-scale prosumers is proposed. First, a CSES planning-oriented multi-step clustering algorithm based on nonparametric kernel density estimation (NPKDE) and a modified fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm is proposed to reduce the input data dimensionality of the planning model. Then, taking the optimal construction time sequence into consideration, a bi-level CSES joint planning model is established to minimize the total costs of prosumers. On this basis, a contribution rate index is designed to evaluate prosumers' bargaining power, and a GNB-based allocation strategy is formulated for realizing fair cost allocation. Finally, case studies show that the proposed strategy can help large-scale prosumers effectively deal with the joint CSES planning problem and achieve lower investment and operation costs. It also demonstrates that the proposed cost allocation approach is more efficient and practical than other cooperative game-based methods.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Coordinated Control Strategy for Frequency Regulation of MMC-HVDC Connecting Offshore Wind Farms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10278216</link><description>To solve the problems of weak inertia support and poor frequency regulation capability of power system, a novel coordinated control strategy for frequency regulation of MMC-HVDC connecting offshore wind farms (OWFs) is proposed to improve system frequency stability. In terms of inertia support, based on analyzing the available energy margin of MMC-HVDC, a virtual inertia control method based on decoupling control of DC voltage and capacitor voltage is proposed, which can fully utilize the energy margin of capacitors and improve its inertia support capability. The coupling relationship between the rotor speed of wind turbines and the frequency is directly established through DC voltage, an inertia support coordinated control strategy for MMC-HVDC and OWFs is designed to realize the rational utilization of available energy. In terms of primary frequency regulation, according to the local DC voltage, a primary frequency regulation control strategy is proposed for OWFs based on the variable speed control and pitch angle control. The overall coordination is realized through the reasonable design of control links and parameters, so as to improve the frequency stability of the system. Finally, the simulation model of MMC-HVDC connecting OWFs is built to verify the validity of the proposed control strategies.</description></item><item><title>Neural Networks-Based Inverter Control: Modeling and Adaptive Optimization for Smart Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10283888</link><description>The optimal voltage control of inverter-based resources, especially under the high penetration of solar photovoltaics, is critical to the stability of the distribution power system. However, the computational complexity as well as the coordinated operation performance of the voltage control optimization in the distribution power system limits the real-time applications. To mitigate this issue, a model-free based adaptive optimal control scheme for the smart inverter is proposed to maximize the active power generation, minimize the power loss, and maintain the bus voltages in smart distribution networks. An inverter-based optimization model for coordinated operation is first established, considering the uncertainties of renewable power generation. Subsequently, by collecting the data and control strategies, the neural networks (NNs) based algorithm is proposed to efficiently predict the best possible control strategy. The main objective of this scheme is to accurately predict candidate optimal solutions with near-negligible feasibility and optimization gaps, with the advantage of avoiding complicated iteration-based numerical algorithms. Thereafter, the co-simulation among OpenDSS, MATLAB, and Python is set up to fully take advantage of the three individual software. Experiments are conducted based on different control parameter characteristics and structures of NNs. The results reveal that an average mean squared error of 0.013 and 1 ms response time are achieved, which is lower than some state-of-the-art methods.</description></item><item><title>A Control Method Using Two Electromotive Forces and a Disturbance Observer to Improve the Dynamics of a Virtual Synchronous Machine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10285072</link><description>The modern power grid is facing a significant challenge due to decreasing grid inertia, which is caused by the high penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs). Virtual synchronous machines (VSMs) have been considered as effective solutions to support the grid by providing inertial responses similar to that of traditional synchronous machines. However, fast and flexible dynamic responses to reference inputs, which can be achieved by conventional RES interfacing inverters, are degraded when inverters emulate the behavior of a synchronous machine. In this article, a current-referencing electrified synchronous machine (CURESYM) is proposed as a control method to adjust the dynamics to the reference input regardless of the parameter settings for emulating a synchronous generator. That is, the output current of CURESYM can be regulated with an intended dynamic response to follow the current reference. In addition, the accuracy of the current regulation can be enhanced by virtue of a disturbance observer. The fundamental characteristics of CURESYM are described with laboratory-scale experimental results. Finally, the effectiveness of CURESYM is discussed with practical data from on-site tests that applied the proposed method to a battery energy storage system in an actual island microgrid.</description></item><item><title>Day-Ahead PV Power Forecasting Model Based on Fine-Grained Temporal Attention and Cloud-Coverage Spatial Attention</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292906</link><description>With the increase of grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) power plants, measuring the uncertainty of PV output forecast due to multiple meteorological factors has become an important method to ensure the stable operation of the power system. However, the manual similar days' extraction methods of historical power features and cloud motion features, which are commonly used for PV spatial-temporal prediction, are inefficient and coarse-grained. In this paper, focusing on automatic attention of the local similar sequences in daily features, we improve the attention scoring method of the original transformer to increase the calculation accuracy of the similarity of PV power sequences. We construct an end-to-end PV power prediction framework using an encoder-decoder architecture. Based on the spatial-temporal similarity characteristics of PV output, the fine-grained temporal and cloud-covered spatial attentions embedded in the prediction framework are proposed using the improved similar sequence attention module. Among them, fine-grained temporal attention can dynamically position and utilize similar historical PV power sequences for the predicted period; cloud-coverage spatial attention automatically captures the neighbor site's matching PV power sequences. Experiments were conducted on a real PV dataset, and the root mean square error was reduced by 21.34% on average compared to the baseline model. The results proved the effectiveness of the proposed model.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Wind Power Scenario Generation Based on Conditional Latent Diffusion Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10296015</link><description>Quantifying short-term uncertainty in wind power plays a crucial role in power system decision-making. In recent years, the scenario generation community has conducted numerous studies employing generative models. Among these generative models, diffusion models have shown remarkable capabilities with excellent posterior representation. However, diffusion models are seldom used to quantify renewable energy uncertainty. To fill this research gap, this manuscript proposes a novel conditional latent diffusion model (CLDM) adapted for short-term scenario generation. CLDM decomposes the wind power scenario generation task into deterministic forecasting and forecast error scenario generation. The embedding network is used to regress deterministic forecasts, which reduces the denoising complexity of diffusion models. The denoising network generates forecast error scenarios in a latent space. Subsequently, the wind power scenarios are reconstructed by combining deterministic forecasts and forecast error scenarios. The case study compares with existing state-of-the-art methods, CLDM demonstrates superior evaluation metrics and enhances the denoising efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Periodic Allocation Mechanism for Allocating Demand Response Reserves Deployed by Multiple Ancillary Services</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10296534</link><description>High penetration of renewable energy resources poses technical and economic challenges to system operation. Utilizing demand response to provide ancillary services is beneficial to the security of the grid, but for this, an adequate level of reserves to support possible ancillary services is required. Reasonable allocation of the demand response reserves (DRREs) deployed by different ancillary services can guarantee performance and participant profits during ancillary service provision. An allocation mechanism that periodically allocates DRREs for various ancillary services considering uncertainty and demand response resource (DRR) sufficiency is proposed to address this problem. The participants include purchasers and providers of DRRs. First, K-means clustering is used to obtain the occurrence characteristics of different ancillary service events. Second, the utility functions of the participants in the allocation process are modeled while fully considering the uncertainty in periodic allocation. Then, different types of Stackelberg games are formulated to determine the DRREs deployed by different ancillary services under different DRR sufficiency situations. Finally, an intraday scheduling method is presented to optimize the use of the allocated DRREs and achieve the expected regulation performance. Simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed allocation mechanism in terms of achieving a win-win situation for all participants.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Incentive Pricing on Charging Stations for Real-Time Congestion Management in Distribution Network: An Adaptive Model-Based Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10298595</link><description>This paper concerns the pricing strategy for real-time distribution network congestion management, aiming at maximizing the total social welfare while eliminating congestion. The difficulty lies in dealing with the complex time-varying relationship between price and charging demand in the integrated power system and transportation network, and ensuring the safe application of the proposed method with limited real historical data. To address these challenges, we first model the EV user charging decision-making process to indirectly reflect the unquantifiable price and demand relationship, and then formulate the pricing problem as a bi-level model with a constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). After that, we propose a model-based safe DRL framework and develop an adaptive model-based safe deep reinforcement learning (AMSDRL) algorithm to solve the CMDP problem. AMSDRL learns the environment transition model and uses a strict and adaptive cost constraint to offset potential modeling errors. Compared to the state-of-the-art safe DRL methods, AMSDRL can be deployed with security guarantees by training on limited historical data, which is more practical for applications. The numerical results on modified IEEE 33-bus and 118-bus systems and a transportation network with real-world EV data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Autonomous Energy Management Strategy for Multi-Paralleled Hybrid Energy Storage Systems in the DC Microgrid With Mismatched Line Impedance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10298785</link><description>In this paper, a decentralized P-V$^{2}$ droop-based energy management strategy for the hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs), including multiple batteries/supercapacitors (SCs), in the DC microgrid is proposed. By using the output voltage of the SC converter as the unified feedback voltage in each HESS, the impacts of non-negligible and mismatched line impedance on the power allocation performance and bus voltage tracking are eliminated. Compared with the I-V droop-based method, the adopted P-V$^{2}$ droop technique improves the stability of the HESS, especially considering the constant power loads (CPLs). In addition, the state-of-charge (SoC) recovery is considered for the SCs to prolong the service life of the HESSs. Finally, the experiment and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations have been carried out for the studied system to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.</description></item><item><title>A Bayesian Hierarchical Model to Understand the Effect of Terrain on Wind Turbine Power Curves</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10301539</link><description>This paper is concerned with explicitly modeling the effect of terrain on wind power curves. Terrain characteristics are spatially-varying but temporally constant, whereas other power curve-affiliating variables such wind speed, temperature, and wind power vary both spatially and temporally. In order to effectively model such two modes of variation in the data, we employ a Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) that connects the terrain characteristics with the parameters in a power curve. BHM jointly models the data from all turbines on a wind farm for attaining the turbine-specific, terrain-incorporating power curves. Our analysis shows that, out of the three terrain variables available in our data, ruggedness has the strongest effect on the power curve. We also evaluate the applicability of using the resulting power curve model for turbines on a different terrain and find that incorporating terrain information explicitly is beneficial. The specific BHM mechanism of using terrain information leads to 7&#8211;10% improvement over the group averaging approach.</description></item><item><title>A Stochastic Charging Station Deployment Model for Electrified Taxi Fleets in Coupled Urban Transportation and Power Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10306294</link><description>Metropolitansworldwide are increasingly adopting electric taxis (ET) to address concerns about transportation-related emissions. However, the widespread deployment of electric taxis presents challenges in terms of increased electricity demand and changing demand profiles. This transition impacts both the urban transportation network (TN) and the electricity power distribution network (PDN), highlighting the interdependence between these two systems. In this paper, we propose a two-stage stochastic programming planning model that aims to optimize both the TN and PDN, enabling efficient deployment of charging stations and grid upgrades. Our model seeks to strike a balance between meeting ET drivers' charging preferences, minimizing the costs associated with infrastructure deployment and grid expansion, and harmonizing the coordination between the TN and PDN. Additionally, we explore the potential benefits of utilizing an autonomous ET fleet to enhance overall system performance.</description></item><item><title>Low-Voltage Survivability of Islanded Microgrids With Mixture of Single-Phase and Three-Phase DGs under Harmonic Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308631</link><description>Unbalanced low-voltage survivability of islanded microgrids under three-phase nonlinear load conditions in terms of primary control of distributed generations (DGs) is a research gap. This paper bridges the gap by proposing dynamic-sliding mode controller (SMC) for the voltage control loop and a novel current limiting strategy (CLS) based on the sliding-discrete Fourier transform (DFT) algorithm. The proposed sliding-DFT-based CLS separates fundamental and harmonic components of the reference value of inverter current and only restricts its fundamental component to a value less than the threshold value. The proposed dynamic-SMC, which presents robust performance with low chattering phenomenon, in combination with the sliding-DFT-based CLS prevents DG's output voltage distortion. This feature is favorable for supplying local and sensitive loads. Moreover, single-phase washout filter-based power sharing method has been implemented to ensure precise active power sharing and frequency regulation of the microgrid with mixture of single-phase and three-phase DGs during asymmetrical short-circuit faults as well as better fault clearance dynamics than the conventional three-phase droop control method. The offline and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation results also confirm the effectiveness of the proposed CLS and voltage controller applied to the control structure of DGs operating in the grid-forming mode in comparison with existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Secondary Control With an Event-Triggered Consensus-Based Observer for Energy Storage Systems in Islanded DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10306326</link><description>This paper proposes a distributed secondary control strategy with an event-triggered consensus-based observer. Firstly, a voltage-shifting term is introduced in the proposed control strategy to ensure accurate current sharing, faster state-of-charge (SOC) balancing and bus voltage restoration. Since the SOC balancing speed becomes very slow when the difference in SOC between battery energy units (BEUs) is small, and SOC balancing of BEUs with low power is difficult. Therefore, an adaptive SOC balancing factor to improve the balancing speed is proposed in this control strategy. In addition, communication delay can lead to large errors in traditional consensus-based observers, and continuous communication can bring a significant burden. Considering these issues, the event-triggered consensus-based observer is proposed. This observer can achieve accurate average consensus under communication delay and greatly reduce communication burden. The convergence of the proposed observer under communication delay is theoretically proven, and the Zeno behavior is excluded. At last, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy has been verified in MATLAB/Simulink and RT-LAB experiments.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Agent Graph Reinforcement Learning Method for Electric Vehicle on-Route Charging Guidance in Coupled Transportation Electrification</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10310266</link><description>This paper proposes a multi-agent deep graph reinforcement learning-based EV on-route charging guidance strategy, aiming at minimizing the charging cost for EV drivers in an uncertain and complex environment. First, a real-time online EV charging guidance framework with bi-timescales coupled transportation electrification is proposed. On the slow timescale, the distribution locational marginal pricing of the node where the charging station is located is solved by the power purchase cost optimization of the power distribution network. On the fast timescale, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning is used to solve real-time EV requests. Second, charging stations are considered as agents, and the potential competition for future charging demand at charging stations is considered. A multi-agent actor critic algorithm with embedded graph attention networks is proposed to optimize charging decision-making of EV drivers, which exploits the interactions between agents&#8217; observations using graph attention networks. Case studies are carried out in a practical area of Xi'an, China. We analyze the necessity of model components. The effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing charging cost and its applicability in PV-equipped scenarios is verified. The convergence performance and scalability are verified by the comparison with SAC and MADDPG algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Committed Carbon Emission Operation Region for Integrated Energy Systems: Concepts and Analyses</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10313074</link><description>A novel concept called the committed carbon emission operation region (CCEOR) of integrated energy systems (IESs) is proposed in this paper, which provides a powerful tool for low-carbon operation analyses (LCOA) of IESs. The CCEOR of IESs is first defined, and a CCEOR model is then proposed by considering the uncertainty of renewable power outputs and the characteristics of low-carbon sequential operation. Based on the nonlinear constraint transformation method and distributionally robust chance-constrained (DRCC) approach, a reformulation method is developed to convert the proposed uncertain nonlinear CCEOR model into a deterministic mixed-integer convex CCEOR model. The characteristics of the CCEOR are investigated. Based on the transformed CCEOR model, the CCEOR is a high-dimensional and bounded region composed of finite convex sub-regions. A region approximation method is then presented to construct the CCEOR. The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed CCEOR model and method are validated by numerical simulation on three test systems. Simulation results indicate that the proposed CCEOR can characterize the low-carbon feasible space (LCFS) visually, the visual coupling relationships between observation variables and LCFS, and the comprehensive low-carbon operation information of operation points.</description></item><item><title>Joint Sizing Optimization Method of PVs, Hybrid Energy Storage Systems, and Power Flow Controllers for Flexible Traction Substations in Electric Railways</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10313989</link><description>Flexible traction substation (FTSS) integrates PVs, energy storage systems (ESSs), and railway power flow controllers (RPFCs) into the existing split-phase traction substation. It is a vital solution in advancing electric railways towards a low-carbon, efficient, and grid-friendly future. To improve the techno-economic performance of FTSSs, this paper proposes a sizing method to jointly size PV, RPFC, and battery-ultracapacitor hybrid ESS (HESS). Firstly, a flexible operation model of FTSS is established. It fully uses the capacity of RPFCs for improving the three-phase voltage unbalance and average power factor, thus, reducing the capacity requirements of RPFCs. Next, a linearized approach is developed for estimating battery aging affected by battery cycles, depth of discharge, state of charge, and calendar time. It facilitates obtaining battery sizing with relatively accurate life evaluation in sizing optimization. Then, a joint sizing optimization model of PV, HESS, and RPFC is established to minimize the total annualized investment and operation cost of an FTSS, and it is formulated as mixed-integer second-order programming. Finally, case studies show that the proposed method can optimize the total annualized cost of FTSSs while ensuring efficient energy utilization and improvements of the three-phase voltage unbalance and average power factor.</description></item><item><title>Novel Black Start Control Strategy With Power Boundary Analysis for PMSG-Based Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10319342</link><description>A novel power boundary analysis-based black start control (PBBC) strategy of PMSG-based wind turbines (WTs) is proposed in this paper to reduce the outage time of WTs and improve the reliability of wind power supply. The active power-rotor speed maximum boundary is quantified to estimate the kinetic energy (KE) reserve limit and the power response capability of the WTs during the black start period. In the power boundary analysis, the power response capability will collapse as the rotor speed increases to maximum. To achieve the trade-off between high KE reserve and power response capability, an overloaded power response control method during the black start period is developed, which can fully utilize the reserved KE. Moreover, the dc-bus capacitor charging model of WTs with initial KE is constructed, which can accurately represent the required KE of the WTs black start. The WTs are coordinated to achieve black start with the minimum backup power supply for the safety devices and auxiliary load according to the capacitor charging model. The proposed PBBC strategy can maximize the KE reserve of the WT and improve the power response capability, as well as reduce the backup power cost during the black start period.</description></item><item><title>Low Carbon Planning of Multiple Integrated Energy Systems Considering Trans-Regional Battery Logistics Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10323512</link><description>With the emergence of integrated energy system (IES) paradigm, planning and control of multiple interconnected IESs starts to draw attention in academia.

Models of the critical components in the studied system are established, and a multi-agent carbon emission reduction model is proposed to enable carbon-reduction in both energy supply and demand sides. Based on these, a low-carbon planning model is formulated for the multi-IES, which aims at minimizing the system's annual cost while satisfying a set of operational constraints. A CPLEX-based numerical optimization approach is developed for solving the proposed planning model and extensive numerical case studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving the energy efficiency and promoting decarbonization for multiple IESs.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Fault Ride-Through and Voltage Support Capability for MMC-HVDC Integrated Offshore Wind Farms Based on Multi-Mode Matching</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10336519</link><description>To cope with onshore AC faults in modular multilevel converter based high voltage direct current integrated offshore wind farms (OWF-MMC-HVDC), this paper proposes a multi-mode matching control (MMMC) approach. Mode I is active energy control. It is activated at high fault levels, when the reactive power output capability of the MMC is weak. Mode I uses the MMC sub-module energy to maximise the absorption of offshore surplus power to mitigate DC overvoltage problems. Mode II is dynamic reactive current optimization (DRO) control. It is activated at medium fault levels. It dynamically optimises the MMC active and reactive current command values within the permitted current margins. This simultaneously enables voltage support to the onshore grid and maximises offshore active power output, reducing offshore surplus power. Mode III is energy coordinated synchronous (ECS) control. It is activated under more mild faults. It allows simultaneous adjustment of the energy absorption rate of the wind farm-side MMC (WFMMC) and the grid-side MMC (GSMMC). This allows the energy margin of the MMCs to be utilised more fully to improve support to the onshore grid while maintaining fault ride-through capability. Finally the correctness and validity of the proposed method was verified by the PSCAD/EMTDC.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Objective Optimization Based Voltage Injection Technique for Minimizing Imbalance and Harmonics in AC Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10347373</link><description>Negative-sequence components and harmonics are generated in the current and voltage of an islanded AC microgrid under unbalanced and nonlinear loading conditions. Without any external controller or feedback signal filter, such components give power-sharing errors and develop voltage distortion at the output of participating inverters associated with particular sources. This paper proposes a decentralized inverter control scheme with an advanced voltage injection technique that minimizes the voltage unbalance factor (VUF) and reduces voltage total harmonic distortion (THD) in a low-voltage AC microgrid using Pareto multi-objective optimization (PMOO). It has a mean function with a second-order filter to minimize the DC offset and distortion in the feedback signal. It manages power sharing in a multi-bus distribution network with an advanced angle droop control. It also accounts for the line impedance, i.e., connecting the inverter unit to the network and the effect of zero sequence components. The simulation is tested on a modified CIGRE LV multi-bus distribution system with four wire configurations and experimentally validated on a two DG, single-bus resistive distribution model.</description></item><item><title>Data Driven Decentralized Control of Inverter Based Renewable Energy Sources Using Safe Guaranteed Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10354415</link><description>The wide integration of inverter based renewable energy sources (RESs) in modern grids may cause severe voltage violation issues due to high stochastic fluctuations of RESs. Existing centralized approaches can achieve optimal results for voltage regulation, but they have high communication burdens; existing decentralized methods only require local information, but they cannot achieve optimal results. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based methods are effective to deal with uncertainties, but it is difficult to guarantee secure constraints in existing DRL training. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes a projection embedded multi-agent DRL algorithm to achieve decentralized optimal control of distribution grids with guaranteed 100% safety. The safety of the DRL training is guaranteed via an embedded safe policy projection, which could smoothly and effectively restrict the DRL agent action space, and avoid any violation of physical constraints in distribution grid operations. The multi-agent implementation of the proposed algorithm enables the optimal solution achieved in a decentralized manner that does not require real-time communication for practical deployment. The proposed method is tested in modified IEEE 33-bus distribution and compared with existing methods; the results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving decentralized optimal control with guaranteed 100% safety and without the requirement of real-time communications.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Objective Stochastic Optimization Approach for Planning a Multi-Energy Microgrid Considering Unscheduled Islanded Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10354526</link><description>The multi-energy microgrid (MEMG) improves the energy supply economy through a multi-energy coupling operation. However, due to faults or maintenance, outages may occur in the main grid, forcing the MEMG switch to the islanded mode, which heavily impacts the energy supply reliability. To solve this problem, a multi-objective stochastic optimization approach for planning the MEMG considering unscheduled islanded operation is proposed in this paper. This method aims to optimize the planning decision, improve the operation economy in the grid-connected mode and enhance the energy supply reliability in the islanded mode. A planning-operation co-optimization model is established with two objective functions: the minimum total planning cost and the minimum expected economic loss caused by islanded operation. The model incorporates equipment capacity allocation constraints, operation constraints in two operation modes and load curtailment constraints in the islanded mode. In addition to considering the uncertainties of load and renewable energy, the model of the uncertain islanded mode is established using four correlated random variables, and the scenario tree is used for islanded scenario generation. The adaptive weighted sum (AWS) method is used to solve the multi-objective model and obtain an optimal and evenly distributed Pareto frontier. On this basis, the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) is employed to determine the final planning scheme. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which makes a trade-off between planning economy and energy supply reliability.</description></item><item><title>Grid-Forming Control of Offshore Wind Farms Connected With Diode-Based HVdc Links Based on Remote Active Power Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10361591</link><description>The connection of offshore wind farms (OWFs) via diode rectifier-based- high-voltage direct current (DR-HVdc) transmission requires the use of wind turbine (WT) converters with grid-forming (GFM) capability. However, active and reactive power coupling and oscillation issues have been revealed in WTs employing reactive power frequency (Q/f) droop-based control schemes. This paper proposes a GFM control for OWFs based on remote active power regulation. The proposed scheme remotely regulates the active power of the DR-HVdc link by adjusting the dc voltage of the onshore modular multilevel converter (MMC). As a result, the voltages of offshore point of common coupling and WT converters are freed from being controlled for active power. On this basis, the WT converters can be equipped with classical GFM control schemes that incorporate active power frequency (P/f) and reactive power voltage (Q/V) droop relationships. The offshore frequency acts as an indication of the OWF active power balance and it is measured and transmitted to the onshore MMC through a communication channel to close the remote active power control. Comparative studies of power coupling characteristics and stability reveal that the proposed control scheme can achieve efficient decoupling control of active and reactive power in WT converters, prevent oscillation risks, and significantly enhance the system's stability. The feasibility and advantages of the proposed control scheme are verified through comparative time-domain simulations.</description></item><item><title>Incentivizing the Collaboration Between Travelers and Power-Traffic Network Operators: An Asymmetric Nash Bargaining Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10363682</link><description>With the proliferation of electric vehicles and the deepened interdependence between power and traffic networks, tariff- and subsidy-based monetary incentives have been leveraged by network operators to shape vehicular&amp;amp;charging flow distributions to more closely align with network-level objectives. Travelers and network operators are generally regarded as two self-interested entities. As a result, the conflict between the system- and user-optimality usually forces travelers to bear an extra expenditure (either tariff payment or detour time) or requires network operators to dispense overmuch subsidies, both resulting in social welfare losses. The present work bridges this gap by designing a Cooperative Game based operation scheme that facilitates the collaboration between the two entities, in which collaborative travelers follow the social routing advice and then receive a certain level of reimbursement from network operators. To ensure a fair benefit allocation, we quantify the individual contribution as the difference of the path travel cost before and after the collaboration, then adopt the asymmetric Nash bargaining theory to settle the dispense of reimbursement. Numerical results on case studies indicate that the proposed model outperforms the subsidy-based non-cooperative Stackelberg Game in terms of promoting a win-win situation for both entities.</description></item><item><title>Wave Energy Optimal Control Structure With Second-Order Sliding Mode Tracking: Hardware-in-the-Loop Assessment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10363673</link><description>This article presents a hardware-in-the-loop assessment of a moment-based optimal controller including a robust super-twisting tracking term. The aim of the overall control structure is to maximise the energy extracted by a flap-type wave energy converter. An experimental assessment is performed via hardware-in-the-loop testing, which allows experiments in a controlled environment and repeatable conditions. Key aspects of the control structure are analysed in the results, with particular focus on the behaviour of the second-order sliding mode tracking term. Robustness against modelling uncertainties and finite-time convergence are evaluated, initially for a single sea state, and then across three different sea conditions. Excellent tracking performance is observed for all considered operating conditions. Finally, the super-twisting algorithm in the tracking loop is compared with the performance of a linear controller synthesised based on Youla-Ku&#269;era parametrisation, observing that the former presents better tracking capabilities, also outperforming in terms of energy extraction.</description></item><item><title>Fuzzy Adaptive Frequency Support Control Strategy for Wind Turbines With Improved Rotor Speed Recovery</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10365243</link><description>With the large-scale integration of wind power, the frequency stability of the power system is facing a significant challenge due to the wind power generation system typically operating in maximum power point tracking (MPPT) mode. Traditional frequency support control methods for wind turbines (WTs) do not consider the state of WTs and the frequency changes simultaneously. This article proposes a fuzzy adaptive frequency support control strategy for WTs with improved rotor speed recovery. Based on fuzzy logic control, the proportional gain is adaptively adjusted using the rotor speed and frequency deviation to support the grid frequency. It can fully utilize the frequency support capability of WTs with more available rotor kinetic energy while averting the over-deceleration of WTs with low rotor speed. Moreover, as the frequency deviation increases, the output power of WTs is increased by a larger proportional gain to alleviate the excessive frequency degradation. In response to the shortcomings of traditional rotor speed recovery methods, an improved rotor speed recovery method is presented by integral control, which can restore the rotor speed in stages without affecting the frequency support performance of WTs and can avoid secondary frequency drop (SFD). Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Fault-Tolerant and Attack-Resilient Cooperative Control in an Offshore Wind Farm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10366828</link><description>Modern wind farms promise increased capacity, sustainability, and efficiency through the integration of information technology with the existing wind energy technologies. However, this integration creates a new category of cyber-physical vulnerabilities stemming from physical faults and/or cyberattacks potentially leading to devastating physical impacts and catastrophic consequences. The large scale and high complexity of a wind farm, in addition to its growing connectivity, control functionality, and wind intermittency and variability make the task of cyber-physical protection particularly challenging. This paper introduces novel approaches for guaranteeing the safety, security, and reliability of a modern wind farm under simultaneous occurrence of faults and attacks using an advanced cyber-physical health monitoring scheme, defined as &#8220;intrusion detection and fault diagnosis system&#8221;, as well as fault-tolerant/attack-resilient control strategies at different levels. The proposed fault-tolerant control strategy is based on adaptive model predictive control at turbine level, enhanced with a control reallocation mechanism at farm level. The attack-resilient control strategy is based on an automatic signal correction (ASC) technique that is applied at network operator level. The effectiveness of the suggested approaches is demonstrated using an offshore wind farm model under wind turbulences, measurement noises, and realistic physical fault and cyberattack scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Dual Current Control of Renewable Energy Sources for Recent Grid Code Compliance and Reliability Enhancement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10373073</link><description>Inverter-interfaced renewable energy sources (IIRESs) are controlled to follow low-voltage ride-through requirements during different fault conditions to support grid voltages and enhance stability. However, these requirements could result in improper operation of conventional protection functions, e.g., phase selection, that are designed based on the fault current characteristics of conventional power systems. In this paper, a dual-current controller (DCC) is designed for IIRESs to allow precise operation of the conventional phase selection method (PSM) while following the positive- and negative-sequence reactive current generation (RCG) requirements imposed by recent grid codes (GCs). First, the negative-sequence current reference is designed to comply with GC requirements and inject the minimum value of negative-sequence-active current that secures a correct operation of phase selection. Subsequently, the positive-sequence-reactive current is designed to comply with RCG requirements and allow injecting the maximum combination of the positive-and negative-sequence currents without hindering the proper operation of PSM or RCG requirements. Comprehensive time-domain simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed DCC in meeting both PSM and recent RCG requirements during different fault types, resistances, and locations.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive BESS Controller for Stability Enhancement of Islanded Low Voltage Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10376028</link><description>Battery energy storage system (BESS), as grid-forming unit, can quickly regulate voltage and frequency for a 100% inverter-based islanded low voltage microgrid. However, due to some inherent characteristics of this network, such as: (a) coupling among voltage and frequency dynamics, (b) dynamics of dc source, and (c) timescale coupling among converter and network, small-signal stability is a major concern. This paper proposes an adaptive feed-forward compensation scheme for each BESS unit to reduce dynamic interactions among converters and network/load parameters. Additionally, the proposed scheme can enhance system damping capability for a wide range of operating conditions without the need for any prior/ continuous generation/network information or additional sensors. This technique can preserve the voltage/frequency regulation capability of the traditional ($\omega -P/V-Q$) droop control scheme for any low voltage networks. The existing small-signal model is modified to include dc-source, dc link, and proposed feed-forward dynamics, which assists in analyzing the impact of dc-side, ac-side, and network parameters on system small-signal stability. The system performance is analyzed with extensive case studies conducted on a CIGRE TF C$6:04:02$ benchmark system. The proposed model is validated using a real-time digital simulator with hardware-in-loop setup.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Power Imbalance Time Series With Solar Power Penetration: Butterfly Curve</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443304</link><description>Variable renewable energy (VRE) is known to be highly influenced by weather events and may ramp up or down abruptly. Therefore, increasing penetration of solar power will cause fundamental and structural changes to power system operation regimes. In this letter, we conduct an analysis of a 1-minute temporal resolution dataset from 6 Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) in the US during 2018 and 2019. By examining day-ahead power exchange and real-time power imbalance time series characteristics, distinct patterns can be observed: the day-ahead power exchange time series curve looks like the canyon, while the real-time power imbalance time series curve looks like a butterfly shape, which becomes bigger as solar penetration level increases. This letter will provide some scientific evidence for the reform of the day-ahead power exchange and real-time power balance operation in response to high solar power penetration.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Voltage Control for Microgrids Against Time-Varying Communication Delay Interference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268641</link><description>In islanded microgrids, the state-of-the-art distributed controller will suffer from control errors under the interference of time-varying communication delay. Towards this end, a distributed average consensus estimator is proposed to track the dynamic signal averages regardless of time-varying delay. On this basis, a distributed voltage controller resisting time-varying delay interference is proposed to precisely achieve average voltage recovery and the proportional reactive power sharing, and to constrain the voltage over-limit by introducing an additional signal, which is not possible with state-of-the-art distributed controllers. Also, the inaccurate estimation of the delay upper bound will lead to the improper parameter design, and then the controller is at risk of losing dynamic performance or instability. For this problem, the stochastic network calculus (SNC) is used to derive the tight upper bound of time-varying delay, and then the delayed discrete matrix is constructed to solve multi-delay transcendental equation, by which a parameter design algorithm is presented. Finally, the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimental platform is built, and the performance of the proposed controller is tested jointly with OPNET. Compared to the state-of-the-art controller, the proposed controller has the advantages of high control accuracy, superior stability, fast convergence and no voltage crossing under the time-varying delay.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Preserving Distributed Economic Dispatch for Microgrids Based on State Decomposition With Added Noises</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10283857</link><description>This paper devotes itself to the issue of privacy-preserving distributed economic dispatch (ED) of microgrids. The desired algorithm in a distributed way not only ensures a balance between power supply and demand for the entire microgrid system at minimal cost but also effectively safeguards the confidentiality of sensitive information. To this end, both state decomposition and Laplace noises are embedded into a distributed optimization algorithm in the framework of consensus to improve the privacy-preserving capability. Then, both a sufficient condition about the strength of consensus coupling and the convergence accuracy induced by added noises are disclosed for the proposed algorithm via the Lyapunov stability theory and stochastic analysis. Furthermore, the privacy level is discussed in the framework of differential privacy and the lower bound of the convergence accuracy is found for the given privacy level and noise distribution. Finally, the effectiveness and correctness of our approach are demonstrated by applying an IEEE 39-bus system.</description></item><item><title>Intelligent Multi-Functional Fault Current Limiter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10288269</link><description>This paper proposes an intelligent multi-functional fault current limiter (IMFCL) designed for protection against bidirectional faults using an almost lossless fault energy strategy in medium-voltage applications. The proposed circuit incorporates a symmetrical double-sided combination of a voltage source converter (VSC), isolating transformers, and bidirectional switches. The design allows both series and shunt configurations for the transformers, enabling protection for both, downstream and upstream sides of a network. Moreover, the structure can also function as a dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) or even as a unified power quality coordinator (UPQC) and unified power flow controller (UPFC), addressing additional power quality issues in the grid. The control segment employs the maximal overlap discrete wavelet packet transform (MODWPT) for time-frequency analysis, leveraging it to estimate the network&#8217;s impedance and pinpoint the fault&#8217;s location and nature. To this end, an interharmonic high-frequency signal is fed into the grid using VSCs, facilitating swift downstream or upstream impedance determination in FCL or DVR modes. Additionally, a new algorithm is deployed to simultaneously measure both voltage and current magnitudes, determining fault type or voltage sag/swell occurrences in real-time. Simulation and Real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) results substantiate the proposed IMFCL&#8217;s feasibility and efficacy.</description></item><item><title>Virtual Impedance Control for Load Sharing and Bus Voltage Quality Improvement in Low-Voltage AC Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287544</link><description>Due to the mismatched feeder impedances in a resistive feeder AC microgrid, it&#8217;s challenging to accurately share harmonic and active power while promising a low bus voltage distortion rate.

This research presents a two-stage robust model for microgrid planning, considering mixed decision-dependent and decision-independent uncertainties. We design a modern time-of-use (ToU) pricing scheme to optimize the identification of peak $/$ off-peak time periods, as well as the pricing for individual load buses. The operational constraints of the recourse problem are characterized using a second-order conic AC power flow model. To exactly solve this intricate microgrid design problem, we devise a parametric CCG procedure that can handle robust optimization programs with hybrid endogenous and exogenous uncertainties.

In this configuration, the dc MG naturally experiences a second harmonic current injection caused by the double-frequency component of the ac side instantaneous power. This paper proposes a new decentralized control method by utilization of the injected harmonic for power sharing. The proposed method enables accurate power sharing among dc sources and precise global power sharing among dc and ac sources without imposing any dc side voltage deviation. In this method, each dc source adjusts its power based on the frequency of the harmonic component. Additionally, the IC ensures that the voltage level of the dc MG remains at the rated value. Capacitive virtual impedances are integrated into the dc sources to facilitate second harmonic current sharing among them and prevent the circulation of harmonic current flow between the dc sources and the IC&#8217;s dc side capacitor. To fulfill the objectives, each dc source simultaneously regulates the second harmonic voltage of its output filter capacitor and the dc component current of its output filter inductor. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated through time-domain and frequency-domain simulations.</description></item><item><title>Systematic Controller Design for Inverter-Based Microgrids With Certified Large-Signal Stability and Domain of Attraction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10310265</link><description>Inverter-based resources (IBRs) introduce fast dynamics and high non-linearities to microgrids, degrading their stability and complicating the design of effective controllers. To address the arising vulnerability and non-linearities, this paper presents a systematic controller design approach that ensures large-signal stability and domain of attraction (DOA) for islanded microgrids. First, the nonlinear electromagnetic transient model of inverter-based microgrids is developed in the rotating dq reference frame, which is then transformed to a homogeneous-like system with nonlinear terms acting as superimposed parameter uncertainties. Next, the stability conditions, including certified stability, certified DOA, and their combination, are derived to rigorously guarantee a designated range to be a subset of DOA. The designated region is customized and flexible enough to cover microgrids&#8217; normal or emergency operational ranges, such as low- and high-voltage ride-through (L/HVRT) conditions. Then, a systematic method for identifying the candidate control parameter set is developed by integrating the analytical stability conditions. This approach is further exemplified in the droop controller design to improve microgrid stability and resilience. Finally, the proposed systematic controller design is verified through numerical simulation and power hardware-in-the-loop experiments to ensure large-signal stability and DOA of microgrids in emergency L/HVRT conditions.</description></item><item><title>More Efficient Energy Management for Hybrid AC/DC Microgrids With Hard Constrained Neural Network-Based Conversion Loss Surrogate Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10354442</link><description>Conversion loss modeling plays a crucial role in hybrid AC/DC microgrid (MG) energy management (EM). However, accurate calculation of the conversion losses is often very costly. Additionally, existing surrogate models typically rely on fixed-voltage DC buses, leading to excessive voltage magnitudes. To overcome these limitations, we propose surrogate models based on piecewise linear neural networks (NNs) that estimate conversion losses using converter power and variable-voltage DC buses. These NNs employs the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, allowing reformulation into linear constraints. During NN training, additional hard constraints are enforced via the augmented Lagrangian method to enhance feasibility. To limit the computational cost of the reformulated NN constraints, weights sparsity and ReLU stability regularizations are applied to the NN training process. The efficient energy management is implemented as a two-stage stochastic unit commitment (UC) problem with integer recourse. To solve this UC problem, we propose a finite iteration convergent Benders decomposition algorithm with several acceleration techniques, which reduce the computational burden significantly. Our case study demonstrates that: 1) the proposed surrogate model accurately approximates conversion losses while satisfying hard constraints, 2) optimizing the DC bus voltage leads to more efficient system operation, energy savings, and better overall performance, and 3) combining the NN weight optimization with Benders decomposition acceleration techniques significantly reduces the computational associated with the NN surrogates.</description></item><item><title>Risk-Aware Flexible Resource Utilization in an Unbalanced Three-Phase Distribution Network Using SDP-Based Distributionally Robust Optimal Power Flow</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10250821</link><description>The variability caused by the proliferation of distributed energy resources (DERs) and the significant growth in unbalanced three-phase loads pose unprecedented challenges to distribution network operations. This paper focuses on how a distribution system operator (DSO), taking over the distribution grid and market operations, would develop a risk-aware flexibility market to mitigate uncertainties in an unbalanced three-phase power distribution network. First, a distributionally robust chance constraint (DRCC) method is devised to solve the unbalanced three-phase optimal power flow using a semidefinite programming (SDP) model. The DSO can apply the proposed solution to jointly clear energy and flexibility markets. Then, the DRCC model accuracy is improved by an information-sharing mechanism characterized by spatially-correlated uncertainties in the distribution grid. Further, a novel system-wide response function is derived to make the DRCC model tractable. Using the duality theory, the paper further investigates the physical composition of the DSO&#8217;s cleared flexibility prices to guide the unbalanced distribution network operation. Finally, the effectiveness of the risk-aware flexibility market is verified in a modified three-phase IEEE 34-node system. Results demonstrate that the flexibility market can quantify the impact of spatially correlated uncertainties and facilitate the utilization of flexible resources to mitigate uncertainties across the network.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Terminal Current Differential Protection Setting Method for Fully Weak-Infeed Distribution Networks Based on Restricted Enumeration Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10266989</link><description>With the high penetration connection of inverter-interfaced distributed generators and the increasing application of large-capacity energy routers, fully weak-infeed distribution networks consisting entirely of power-electronized weak-infeed power sources are set to become one of the fundamental forms of future distribution networks. For fully weak-infeed distribution networks, multi-terminal current differential protection is considered an optional or even preferred line protection scheme. In this paper, a multi-terminal current differential protection setting method for fully weak-infeed distribution networks is proposed based on the restricted enumeration method. To address the impact of data synchronization errors and measurement errors of multi-terminal current on differential current, the problem of determining the maximum differential current superimposed with the multi-terminal current phasor errors is transformed into a high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem. The distribution law of the global optimal solution in the non-convex constraint space is deeply studied and analyzed, and a restricted enumeration method is proposed that can quickly solve the protection setting value, thereby solving the problem of multi-terminal current differential protection setting. The accuracy and rapidity of the proposed method are verified by comparing the calculation accuracy and time consumption of the restricted enumeration method and the exhaustive search. It is shown that the proposed multi-terminal differential protection setting method exhibits sufficient reliability and sensitivity in fully weak-infeed distribution networks, as verified through simulation analysis using a fully weak-infeed distribution network model built in PSCAD/EMTDC.</description></item><item><title>Transactive Energy-Based Sequential Load Restoration of Distribution Systems With Networked Microgrids Under Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292442</link><description>Natural disasters such as hurricane would cause damages in distribution systems (DSs), resulting in large-scale blackouts. In order to reduce socioeconomic losses under blackouts, it is critical to enhance resilience of DSs through a series of restoration means. Microgrids (MGs) are considered as viable and critical sources to provide emergency power support, and can facilitate restoration of DSs when properly coordinated with the utility-owned control measures. Instead of direct coordination control, this paper proposes a transactive energy (TE) framework for load restoration of DSs, under which the distribution system operator (DSO) organizes a TE market with MGs to trade emergency energy through price signals. Moreover, in order to consider renewable generation uncertainties, a distributionally robust optimization (DRO)-based sequential load restoration model is formulated under the TE framework to maximize the expected restored load with respect to the worst-case probability distribution. Case studies were conducted on the modified IEEE 123 node system. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy can effectively coordinate MGs scheduling to assist in load restoration. Moreover, as compared to the conventional stochastic programming model, the proposed DRO model is less sensitive to the number of scenarios modeled and can produce a more robust solution against out-of-sample scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Genetic Algorithm With k-Nearest Neighbors for Radial Distribution Network Reconfiguration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10285485</link><description>Distribution network reconfiguration (DNR) is to control switches to reduce system losses, alleviate overloads, and mitigate voltage fluctuations. DNR is challenging due to nonlinear power flow equations and the inclusion of integer variables representing switch states. Besides, radial distribution networks require a forest structure, imposing a challenging constraint on the switch state variables. Genetic algorithm is one of the commonly used methods to solve the problem. However, to derive radial solutions, it is necessary to either continue iterating until a radial solution emerges or apply slow and complex encoding techniques that compromise the similarity between chromosomes and real topologies. In this study, we introduce a k-nearest neighbors (kNN) structure that replaces the original chromosome with the best-performing radial topology closest to the chromosome based on the L1 norm, creating a population consisting of radial solutions at each iteration. We also propose a graph-based method to find the nearest neighbor. By utilizing the proposed kNN structure, radiality can be guaranteed with simple encoding. The proposed method has been tested on two test feeders including both balanced and unbalanced networks. The results demonstrate that our approach consistently yields superior performance gains, effectively showcasing the advantages of integrating the kNN structure into the genetic algorithm framework.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Linear-Time-Variant MPC Method for Voltage and Power Regulation in Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287147</link><description>This paper proposes a data-driven voltage and power regulation method based on model predictive control (MPC) for active distribution networks (ADNs), which doesn&#8217;t rely on accurate system model parameters. To approximate the system model from data with a good balance between simplicity and expressiveness, we propose a new piecewise linear (PWL) regression method combing the support vector linear regression (SVR) model, which overcomes the issues of measurement outliers and data collinearity in the traditional PWL regression method. With the PWL model trained offline, a novel data-driven voltage and power regulation method based on the linear time-varying MPC scheme is proposed in this paper, which can effectively coordinate fast and slow regulating resources with a low computational burden. The convergence of the proposed data-driven MPC based scheme is also theoretically clarified. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated via numerical simulations using several distribution systems.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Volt/Var Control for Unbalanced Distribution Networks With Human-in-the-Loop Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10335935</link><description>This paper proposes a human-in-the-loop deep reinforcement learning (HL-DRL)-based VVC strategy to simultaneously reduce power losses, mitigate voltage violations and compensate for voltage unbalance in three-phase unbalanced distribution networks. Instead of fully trusting DRL actions made by deep neural networks, a human intervention module is proposed to modify dangerous actions that violate operation constraints during offline training. This module refers to well-designed human guidance rules based on voltage-reactive power sensitivities, which regulate PV reactive power to sequentially address local voltage violation and unbalance issues to obtain safe transitions. To efficiently and safely learn the optimal control policy from these training samples, a human-in-the-loop soft actor-critic (HL-SAC) solution method is then developed. Different from the standard SAC algorithm, an online switch mechanism between action exploration and human intervention is designed. The actor network loss function is modified to incorporate human guidance terms, which alleviates the inconsistency of the updating direction of actor and critic networks. A hybrid experience replay buffer including both dangerous and safe transitions is also used to facilitate the learning process towards human actions. Comparative simulation results on a modified IEEE 123-bus unbalanced distribution system demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in voltage control.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Scale Spatial&#8211;Temporal Graph Neural Network-Based Method of Multienergy Load Forecasting in Integrated Energy System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10251987</link><description>Accurately predicting multi-energy loads is essential for optimizing the dispatch and economic operation of integrated energy systems (IES). However, existing multi-energy load forecasting methods have two main limitations: (1) they fail to consider the complex correlations between multi-energy loads and auxiliary features; (2) single time-scale feature extraction methods can result in the loss of critical temporal feature information. Therefore, multi-energy load forecasting remains a challenging task. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel multi-energy load forecasting method based on a multi-scale spatio-temporal graph neural network (MS-STGNN). Specifically, the proposed continuous graph learning module quantifies the correlations between multi-energy loads and auxiliary features using an adjacency matrix, while the graph convolution module aggregates feature information among neighboring nodes through the same matrix to improve the correlations between multi-energy loads and auxiliary features. The model&#8217;s robustness is further enhanced by the feature attention module. Moreover, to mitigate temporal feature information loss, we develop a multi-scale convolution module that uses filters of various sizes to extract multi-dimensional temporal features of different time steps. Extensive experiments show that the MS-STGNN method has higher prediction accuracy and better generalization ability than existing methods on the IES dataset at the Tempe campus of Arizona State University. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/nuist-cs/MS-STGNN.</description></item><item><title>Restoration of a Multi-Energy Distribution System With Joint District Network Reconfiguration via Distributed Stochastic Programming</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10258416</link><description>Extreme events like floods, tsunamis, hurricanes, etc., can threaten the normal operation of district power and thermal networks in multi-energy distribution systems (MDSs). Exploiting the reconfigurable properties of the combined network can provide a cost-effective solution to enhance the MDS resilience level and operation flexibility by redistributing multi-energy loads. In this paper, a resilient restoration approach is proposed for a MDS to coordinate multi-stage dispatch decisions in a distributed manner. First, the MDS operation is modelled with the power and thermal network constraints. As the district thermal network model is nonlinear, massive auxiliary flow variables are introduced to make the reconfiguration problem tractable, which significantly reduces the computational burdens. Second, to handle diverse uncertainties from the outcomes of disasters, loads, and renewable generation, both the pre-restoration and real-time stage measures are coordinated via a two-stage stochastic programming method. To further save the solution time, a distributed algorithm named progress hedging is used to decompose the original large problem into several small sub-ones. At last, case studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to other traditional restoration benchmarks.</description></item><item><title>Analytical Dynamic Energy-Carbon Flow Model and Application in Cost Allocation for Integrated Energy Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10294255</link><description>Energy indicators on the demand side, such as consumers&#8217; total carbon emissions and energy costs, nodal energy carbon emission intensity (CEI) and energy price (EP), describe the impact of consumers&#8217; energy consumption on system carbon emissions and costs, helping consumers with energy consumption decisions. In this paper, an analytical dynamic energy-carbon flow model of integrated energy system (IES) is proposed, which allocates energy and carbon emissions from supply side to demand side. This method is also applied to cost allocation, resulting in accurate energy indicators for consumers. Firstly, a dynamic energy flow model for an IES is established based on the superposition characteristics of subsystems. Then, a dynamic energy flow tracing (DEFT) method that considers pipeline packing, transmission loss and time delay is proposed first to estimate an analytical energy relationship between sources and loads. Combined with the CEI of sources, a dynamic carbon flow model is proposed to allocate the carbon emissions and form CEI on demand side.

To address the problem, an optimal scheduling strategy of mobile energy storage capable of variable-speed energy transmission is proposed. Firstly, by analyzing the hydrogen-carrier vessel (HCV)&#8217;s variable speed-spatiotemporal characteristic mapping mechanism and the ability to supply hydrogen and electricity, an interisland energy variable-speed transmission model is developed. On this basis, an island energy microgrid (EMG) operation model compatible with variable-speed transmission energy is established, in order to reconcile HCV with hydrogen balance, power flow and frequency response. Additionally, considering the impact of uncertainties on the energy output, energy demand, frequency stability, and especially energy transmission sequencing, a stochastic dispatching strategy of the island energy microgrid groups (EMGG) is designed. This model is first linearized as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) problem, and then is solved quickly by a two-layer algorithm, where the upper layer finely manages the possible optimal EMG power reserve that ensures the frequency security, and the lower layer optimally coordinates the inter-island variable-speed energy transmission and island EMG operation. Finally, case studies on Island groups in the South China Sea verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Day-Ahead Scheduling and Online Dispatch of Energy Hubs: A Flexibility Envelope Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10333081</link><description>Energy hub is a micro energy system in industrial park or residential area. It makes full use of renewable resources through multi-energy integration. Proper coordination among generation units, battery and thermal storage devices provides additional flexibility to cope with volatile renewable power. Due to the lack of accurate predictions, the operator uses an interval estimation for day-ahead scheduling and makes online decisions in response to real-time observations without future renewable output values. This paper proposes an envelope-based approach which offers a thorough coordination between day-ahead scheduling and real-time dispatch. In the day-ahead stage, a flexibility envelope for admissible renewable power and action envelopes for controllable devices are determined from a convex quadratic program. In the real-time operation stage, online actions for generation facilities and storage devices are determined by a partial-quantile policy based on the current renewable output and those envelopes. Since the flexibility envelope intentionally caters to the interval estimation of renewable output, the online decisions would be less myopic. Test results demonstrate that the proposed method has an optimality gap smaller than 5% compared to the hindsight optimum, which is comparable to the model predictive control (MPC) method with exact predictions in the next 4&#8211;5 hours.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Stage Adaptive Stochastic-Robust Scheduling Method With Affine Decision Policies for Hydrogen-Based Multi-Energy Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10354055</link><description>Zero-carbon clean energy such as hydrogen has been developed rapidly to reduce carbon emissions, gradually promoting them as the main energy supply for multi-energy microgrids (MEMGs), which motivates the deployment of hydrogen-based MEMG (H-MEMG). The main difficulty of the H-MEMG scheduling problem is how to handle source/load uncertainties for ensuring the solution feasibility and economics in the actual operation. To this end, this paper proposes a novel multi-stage adaptive stochastic-robust optimization (MASRO) approach, which combines the ideas of stochastic programming and multi-stage robust optimization. The established model has the objective of the expected operation cost and ensures the solution feasibility by designed constraints rather than the &#8220;min-max&#8221; structure. Specifically, first, affine policies are adapted to describe the complex relationship between decision variables and uncertainty realizations; Second, an affine policy-based solution approach is proposed for the MASRO H-MEMG scheduling model. Then, the complex conversion relationship and coupling constraints are reformulated, and a tractable mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is established; Third, based on the solved affine functions, the real-time rolling and non-rolling economic dispatch models are proposed to respectively pursue the economic and computational requirements, and both can guarantee solution robustness and nonanticipativity. Numerical tests are implemented on a real H-MEMG, verifying that the proposed method could guarantee the feasibility and economic efficiency of actual H-MEMG operations.</description></item><item><title>A Game Bidding Model of Electricity and Hydrogen Sharing System Considering Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10412692</link><description>The uncertainty of renewable energy source (RES) and load may bring huge challenge to the operation of power systems. In order to meet the balance of supply and demand, a game bidding strategy considering uncertainty is proposed for the electric-hydrogen shared energy storage system (SESS). Firstly, based on Wasserstein distance in extreme scenarios, a reduced scale fuzzy set is constructed for the uncertainty of supply and demand. Secondly, Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism is introduced to deal with the misreporting and valuation behavior of microgrids (MGs). Then a two-stage distributed robust optimization (DRO) game model is designed for SESS&#8212;MGs through game bidding. The aim of Stage I can maximize the benefits of SESS, while the social welfare of each microgrid (MG) may be maximized in Stage II, which can achieve a unique Stackelberg equilibrium. So the DRO model is transformed into a solvable mathematical model by taking advantage of dual theory and adaptive McCormick algorithm. Finally, the case studies are simulated by using the IEEE 33 node power grid together with a 20 node hydrogen network, which can validate the effectiveness of the proposed model.</description></item><item><title>Computation-Power Coupled Modeling for IDCs and Collaborative Optimization in ADNs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10271137</link><description>The batch and online workload of Internet data centers (IDCs) offer temporal and spatial scheduling flexibility. Given that power generation costs vary over time and location, harnessing the flexibility of IDCs&#8217; energy consumption through workload regulation can optimize the power flow within the system. This paper focuses on multi-geographically distributed IDCs managed by an Internet service company (ISC), which are aggregated as a controllable load. The load flexibility resulting from spatial load regulation of online workload is taken into account. A two-step workload scheduling mechanism is adopted, and a computation-power coupling model of ISC is established to facilitate collaborative optimization in active distribution networks (ADNs). To address the model-solving problem based on the assumption of scheduling homogeneity, a model reconstruction method is proposed. An efficient iterative algorithm is designed to solve the reconstructed model. Furthermore, the Nash bargaining solution is employed to coordinate the different optimization objectives of ISC and power system operators, thereby avoiding subjective arbitrariness. Experimental cases based on a 33-node distribution system are designed to verify the effectiveness of the model and algorithm in optimizing ISC&#8217;s energy consumption and power flow within the system.</description></item><item><title>A Distributed Coordinated Framework With Fair Comfort Level Sharing for Inverter Air Conditioner in Auxiliary Services</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10269097</link><description>As a flexible resource, inverter air conditioners (IACs) have significant potential for demand response. However, due to the diverse characteristics of users, it is challenging to consider users&#8217; internal temperature requirements fairly while controlling IACs power. This paper aims to find a feasible solution to this problem. First, the concept of &#8220;comfort state&#8221; is utilized to describe the operating state of IACs with different reference temperatures and allowable internal temperature deviations. Then, a distributed leaderless coordinated framework is designed for IACs to ensure the tracking of reference aggregated power and the achieving of fair comfort level sharing. The proposed framework does not require the aggregator to manage all IACs in a centralized manner and also avoids the need of periodic re-issuance of aggregated power deviation. The feasibility of the proposed framework and the impact of time-delay is rigorously analyzed. Besides, a specific implementation method for the proposed framework in the primary frequency support is developed. Numerical studies show that the proposed coordinated framework can effectively mitigate the drastic variations in system frequency when loads fluctuate.</description></item><item><title>Power Reliability Service Provision and Pricing in Distribution Power Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10314417</link><description>For distribution utilities, it is important to match the power reliability service with the demand of users. However, since there are partial overlaps in the power supply paths of different nodes, the reliability of different nodes has the inherent coupling relation based on the network topology. The improvement of reliability level on individual nodes can hardly be separately controlled without causing any influence on other nodes. To solve this problem, this paper aims to study the co-optimization method of reliability service provision and pricing for the distribution utility. First, a joint placement method of common devices for reliability enhancement is presented. The coupling relationship between the load recovery states of different load nodes under the same fault is conveniently expressed. Second, a service menu design approach is introduced to determine the level and price of candidate reliability services. It considers that users have differentiated evaluations of service and select the service in the menu according to their profit maximization. Third, to overcome the free-riding issue that users receive unnecessarily high-reliability service, the load-shedding compensation method is proposed to exactly match the reliability level received by users to the service level selected by users. After the model transformation, the optimization model is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem. An acceleration algorithm with convergence guarantee is developed to mitigate the computational burden.</description></item><item><title>Incorporating Data-Driven Demand-Price Uncertainty Correlations Into Microgrid Optimal Dispatch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315234</link><description>A growing number of microgrid (MG) systems ipate in market trading as prosumers to improve their own operation profits, as well as the flexibility of power supply. To handle the MG dispatch problem with uncertainties in both load demands and electricity prices, this paper provides a data-driven robust optimization (RO) approach. Firstly, the correlations between the uncertainties of demands and prices are verified via the analysis of historical monitoring data from a real-world case. Based on the data-fitting for the rectangular and ellipsoidal intervals, a new data-driven demand-price uncertainty set with correlations is built to eliminate these unreasonable scenarios effectively. Secondly, a two-stage RO dispatch model is established considering multiple uncertainties of renewable-load power and prices in MGs. The bilinear objective term brings huge obstacles to the solution of the RO model, therefore a novel nested iterative algorithm is further exploited. The bilinear terms of power and price in the objective function are linearized by a binary expansion approach. Besides, to avoid the enumerations of numerous binary recourses in problem solving, the block coordinate descent (BCD) theory is adopted to co-optimize different types of variables, thereby enhancing the computational tractability. Numerical simulations indicate the validity and superiority of the developed RO model and the solution algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Frequency-Responsive Refrigerator Switching Controller</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10330137</link><description>Future low-inertia power systems will introduce challenges to system operators to maintain essential grid services such as fast frequency control (FFC). Hence, there is a need for efficient solutions that can provide the desired FFC capability and arrest high rate-of-change-of-frequency (RoCoF). Recent advancements in information and communication infrastructure within the smart grid concept have created new opportunities to optimally control and utilize the immense potential of thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs), such as refrigerators. However, modeling and controlling different types of TCLs to deliver a precise collective FFC response is challenging. In this regard, this paper develops an adaptive decentralized autonomous fuzzy-temperature-frequency (FTF) control strategy to enable refrigerators to alter their power consumption according to variations in the grid frequency. The ability of the proposed FTF controller to modify the power consumption of a population of refrigerators in accordance with a reference power profile is demonstrated through a set of simulations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller through a strong improvement in the frequency security parameters, i.e., RoCoF and frequency nadir, and with a negligible impact on the thermodynamic performance of refrigerators.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Practical Evaluation of AC&#8211;DC Solid-State Transformer With Electric Spring Functions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10330006</link><description>Power electronics (PE) devices have become ubiquitous in the modern power system. Their potential in participation in grid supporting has been gathering growing attention. PE-based electric spring (ES) technology has recently evolved from the low-voltage ac mains to the medium-voltage distribution network. When equipped with ES functions, solid-state transformers (SSTs) can be associated with energy storage and smart loads to absorb power fluctuations arising from renewable energy sources. Unlike previous studies in which PE systems are generally simplified as  ${V}$ ,  $\theta $ ,  ${P}$ ,  ${Q}$ , or represented by the simplest power converter topology, this paper implements and examines the grid-supporting functionality of a practical ES enabled-SST (ES-SST) system. The dynamic model of the ES-SST is presented and simulated, including both the circuit and control loops. Experimental results obtained from a scaled-down power system are also included to confirm the validity of the dynamic model in a microgrid environment. This dynamic model will facilitate smart-grid researchers to evaluate the use of a large group of distributed ES-SSTs in large power systems in future studies.</description></item><item><title>Novel Autonomous Control of Grid-Forming DGs to Realize 100% Renewable Energy Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10273620</link><description>The grid-forming distributed generators (GFM-DGs) have attracted much attention as a key technology for realizing 100% renewable energy grids. This paper presents a novel control strategy to ensure the reliable operation of a renewable energy source (RES)-based GFM-DG even during weather variations. The GFM-DG connects a RES to the grid via source- and grid-side converters, with the converters&#8217; common DC-link voltage  $V_{DC}$  indicating the power balance between the RES and the grid. We begin by identifying the limitation of conventional strategies in maintaining  $V_{DC}$  against severe weather. To address the limitation, we propose a coordinated strategy for both source- and grid-side converters to regulate  $V_{DC}$  cooperatively, ensuring GFM-DG stability even in adverse weather conditions while also achieving decentralized power sharing and contributions to frequency inertia and damping. The proposed strategy is applicable to photovoltaic- and wind turbine-based generators, as well as energy storage systems. A guideline for control parameter design and stability margin analysis for weather conditions are also provided. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated via small-signal analysis and simulation case studies under various conditions of 100% renewable energy grids, characterized by severe weather, load demand changes, actual line impedances, and a grid fault.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Preserving Operational Decision Making for Networked Autonomous Microgrids Based on Bilevel Mixed-Integer Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10285433</link><description>This paper presents a privacy-preserving operational decision-making approach for autonomous microgrids networked via a power distribution system, where the distribution system operator (DSO) and microgrid master controllers (MMCs) make independent decisions as different stakeholders. First, the scheme of bilevel optimization (i.e., the Stackelberg leader-followers game) is applied to investigate the sequential interactions between DSO and MMCs. Then, given the coexistence of continuous and binary variables in the lower-level problems, an exact strong-duality-based reformulation and decomposition framework is customized to cope with the nonconvex nature of the bilevel mixed-integer optimization. Meanwhile, a fast-enhanced Benders decomposition algorithm is proposed to realize local privacy-preserving decision-making, where multiple unified Benders cuts are generated once and the strongest one is selected back to Benders mater problem. Mathematically, the proposed algorithm will not change the equilibrium point and corresponding optimal solution after finite iterations. Finally, through numerical experiments on a simplified two-bus test system and a modified IEEE 123-bus system, we demonstrate the effectiveness of privacy preservation, as well as the robustness and scalability of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>A Marginal Cost Consensus Scheme With Reset Mechanism for Distributed Economic Dispatch in BESSs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10302354</link><description>Battery energy storage systems (BESSs) are often integrated into the smart grid as the key equipment for valley filling and peak suppression. However, the internal power consumption and capacity degradation of battery cells can not be ignored. In addition, there are certain electric trading between the owner of the grid-connected BESSs and the electric company (EC). Therefore, an expenditure function for grid-connected BESSs is constructed in this paper, in which internal power consumption, capacity degradation and power trading are covered while meeting the balance of power supply and demand. On this basis, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition of the function is summarized as the consensus problem of marginal cost (MC) converging to time-phased electricity price. Thus, we plan to design a distributed MC consensus scheme for economic dispatch (ED) in BESSs based on multi-agent systems (MASs) on a small-time scale. In view of the low control accuracy and response speed of the existing distributed proportional protocol, this paper proposes a distributed ED (DED) scheme with reset mechanism based on a proportional integral (PI) control. When the proportional term encounters zero crossing, the integral term of the control scheme is reset to 0, which ensures that the signs of the two are aligned, thus accelerating MCs convergence and restraining overshoot. Parameter conditions for consensus, regularity and Zeno-free behavior are given through the relevant theoretical analysis. Several simulation cases are designed to verify the designed DED algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchically Distributed Energy Management in Distribution Systems: An Error-Tolerant and Asynchronous Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10302370</link><description>Distribution systems are becoming more complex with the integration of numerous distributed energy resources (DERs), such as distributed generators (DGs), distributed energy storages (DESs), and controllable end-users (EUs). Aggregators (Aggs) are emerging to bridge the gap between the distribution system operator (DSO) and EUs. This creates a hierarchical &#8220;DSO-Agg-EU&#8221; architecture that requires effective and efficient coordination among massive agents. However, this architecture faces challenges such as communication asynchrony and solution inexactness among different agents, which may undermine the performance of energy management or even cause unexpected failures. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an error-tolerant and asynchronous algorithm based on dual decomposition for hierarchically distributed energy management (HDEM). The algorithm is theoretically guaranteed to converge to a near-optimal value and can be further accelerated by Nesterov&#8217;s method. The algorithm is tested on the IEEE 123-bus distribution system and demonstrates high effectiveness and efficiency under asynchrony and inexactness.</description></item><item><title>Identifying Secure Operating Ranges for DER Control Using Bilevel Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10305207</link><description>Active distribution grids are accommodating an increasing number of controllable electric loads and distributed energy resources (DERs). A majority of these DERs are managed by entities other than the distribution utility, such as individual customers or third-party aggregators, who control the loads and DERs without consideration of any distribution grid constraints. This makes it challenging for a distribution system operator (DSO) to allow third-party aggregators and transmission operators to fully exploit the flexibility offered by these resources while also ensuring that distribution grid constraints such as voltage magnitude limits are not violated. In this paper, we develop a bilevel optimization-based framework to determine the aggregate power flexibility that can be obtained from an unbalanced distribution grid while ensuring that there is no disaggregation solution that leads to grid constraint violations. The results are a set of constraints and operating rules that are easy to communicate, and which provide the entities that procure flexibility from DERs (e.g., transmission operators or third-party aggregators) with the ability to freely implement their own disaggregation strategy without intervention from the DSO. The proposed approach is tested on two unbalanced distribution feeders and our simulation results indicate that it is possible to determine a wide range of aggregate power flexibility, as long as a simple set of rules for DER control activation are followed.</description></item><item><title>An Edge Intelligence-Based Framework for Online Scheduling of Soft Open Points With Energy Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10312803</link><description>Edge intelligence (EI) is an emerging interdiscipline to advance the coordination of artificial intelligence and edge computing. EI sinks the computation and decision-making process from centralized clouds to the edge node in proximity to terminal devices, which is robust to the unacceptable communication delay or disconnection. In this paper, we propose an EI-based framework for online scheduling of soft open points with energy storage (ES-SOPs), a novel power electronic device, to enhance both spatial and temporal flexibility in power distribution networks. The proposed framework empowers the edge computing via hybrid deep reinforcement learning (HDRL), which seamlessly combines advantages of both data-driven deep neural networks and physics-based ES-SOPs model. Inside the edge computing node, a deep neural network first learns a set of parameters from the historical data and ES-SOPs local status. Then, the outputs of the deep neural network are fed into a physics-based ES-SOPs model to construct its objective function, where rigorous operation constraints are included. Finally, this model is solved to obtain near-optimal ES-SOPs online scheduling. Case studies on a modified IEEE 33-node system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework under different levels of uncertainties and its superiority over safe DRL and model predictive control-based methods.</description></item><item><title>Optimized Energy Dispatch for Microgrids With Distributed Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315028</link><description>The increasing integration of renewable energy resources (RES) introduces uncertainties in modern power systems and makes the dynamic energy dispatch (DED) problem challenging. Uncertainties lead to dynamic grid control, which needs to be addressed for the optimized DED. Moreover, since energy usage and power generation are distributed, multiple parties can be involved in the DED problem. Thus, DED should be optimized in a distributed way for efficiency and privacy. With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning technology, various data can be gathered and analyzed to achieve intelligent energy management, and the dynamics of power grids should be considered for optimality. For this purpose, we investigate how reinforcement learning can be used to solve the DED problem for a dynamic microgrid (MG) environment. The objective is to determine the optimal power generation for each generator using fossil fuels at each time slot, to minimize the cumulative cost of power generation in a given time period. To achieve this goal, we first model the MG with the practical impact of batteries, photovoltaic (PV) panels, and load banks (external grids). Then we formulate the optimization problem of minimizing the total generation from fossil fuels. To solve this problem, we propose a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm to reduce communication costs and improve data privacy. In the proposed scheme, each generator is considered as an agent, which shares a global state and only obtains its own local loss. Then, different agents work jointly to minimize the global cost. Theoretical analysis is provided to prove the convergence of the proposed algorithms, which are also tested with real-world datasets. Results show that the policy learned from the proposed algorithms can balance the production and consumption in the MG for both fully and partially observable MG environments while simultaneously reducing the total generation cost from fossil fuels.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Objective Interval Optimization Dispatch of Microgrid via Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10345718</link><description>This paper presents an improved deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for solving the optimal dispatch of microgrids under uncertaintes. First, a multi-objective interval optimization dispatch (MIOD) model for microgrids is constructed, in which the uncertain power output of wind and photovoltaic (PV) is represented by interval variables. The economic cost, network loss, and branch stability index for microgrids are also optimized. The interval optimization is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP). Then, an improved DRL algorithm called triplet-critics comprehensive experience replay soft actor-critic (TCSAC) is proposed to solve it. Finally, simulation results of the modified IEEE 118-bus microgrid validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Day-Ahead Electricity Consumption Prediction of Individual Household&#8211;Capturing Peak Consumption Pattern</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315236</link><description>Day-ahead electricity consumption forecasting for individual residential consumers, especially the peak consumption time forecasting, is essential for home energy management system. However, it is considerably challenging since the single household consumption is highly volatile and stochastic and dependent on the underlying human behaviour. Further, the difficulties of accurately capturing the occurrence time of peak consumption in a house can limit the performance of existing machine learning-based load forecasting methods. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for day-ahead single-household electricity consumption forecasting by learning the peak consumption patterns of users. Instead of attempting to obtain the electricity consumption curve for the future 24 hours, the prediction of electricity consumption is achieved by combining the predicted base consumption, the predicted peak consumption occurrence time and the predicted amount of peak consumption within each time interval. The proposed framework can be used for both deterministic and probabilistic load forecasting of individual households. Case studies are conducted on hundreds of households from two different datasets. The results demonstrate that the performance of different deterministic load forecasting algorithms and probabilistic load forecasting algorithms can be improved after being integrated into the proposed framework.</description></item><item><title>Robust Co-Modeling for Privacy-Preserving Short-Term Load Forecasting With Incongruent Load Data Distributions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10454597</link><description>Short-term load forecasting (STLF) can support strategies for power retailers. Training based on aggregate load datasets can yield more precise STLF models. In real scenarios, however, retailers can only access the consumer information they serve. The aggregation of their data for centralized forecasting requires access to private local data, which may lead to potential security concerns. This paper proposes a method namely Privacy-Preserving  ${k}$ -means Federated Learning (PPK-Fed), to facilitate STLF co-modeling among retailers. Federated Learning (FL) is founded on the assumption of data consistency, which does not necessarily exist in real datasets. PPK-Fed incorporates  ${k}$ -means clustering together with convolutional neural networks into FL. PPK-Fed is proven to reduce the impact of potential data incongruence embedded in retailer local datasets. Besides, to address the sensitivity of the  ${k}$ -means prototype to the potential anomalies in the real dataset, PPK-Fed fuses density-based anomaly detection into  ${k}$ -means clustering under FL to improve robustness. For further model security, a secure multi-party computation (SMPC) scheme is designed in PPK-Fed. The model validity, privacy-preserving features, and robustness to anomalies have been verified using a real load dataset.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Energy Dispatch of Grid-Connected Electric Vehicle Considering Lithium Battery Electrochemical Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10256087</link><description>The grid-connected electric vehicles (EVs) serve as a promising regulating resource in the distribution grid with Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) facilities. In the day-ahead stage, electric vehicle batteries (EVBs) need to be precisely dispatched and controlled to ensure high efficiency and prevent degradation. This article focuses on considering a refined battery model, i.e., the electrochemical model (EM), in the optimal dispatch of the local energy system with high penetration of EVs which replenish energy through V2G-equipped charge station and battery swapping station (BSS). In this paper, to utilize the EM efficiently, recursive EVB constraints and a corresponding matrix-based state update method are proposed based on EM power characterization. The charging EV state distribution is profiled and a multi-layer BSS model along with binary aggregation is proposed, in order to overcome the computation complexity of combining the refined battery constraints with the mixed integer optimization. Finally, a local energy system scenario is investigated for evaluation. The efficiency and effectiveness of EM consideration are assessed from the perspective of both the system and battery.</description></item><item><title>Load Forecasting of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations: Attention Based Spatiotemporal Multi&#8211;Graph Convolutional Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268505</link><description>The charging load forecasting is of significant importance to the economic operation of charging stations and the stable operation of power systems. The charging stations couple power systems with transportation systems. Their charging loads are not only affected by the driver&#8217;s driving and charging behavior simultaneously, but also by the above two networks. There is much literature reporting load forecasting combined with historical charging loads in temporal dimension. However, the spatial data of charging stations in the neighboring areas is helpful for load forecasting, as they share common conditions, including traffic and weather factors. This paper proposes load forecasting of electric vehicle charging stations based on the spatiotemporal multi-graph convolutional networks (STMGCN). STMGCN contains three components: gated dilated causal convolution, spatiotemporal attention mechanism, and multi-graph convolutional layer. Firstly, the load model based on graph structure is established according to the historical load and geographical information of charging stations. Then, a load forecasting method of multiple charging stations is proposed, which can effectively share spatiotemporal relationships among stations. Finally, experiments on real-world dataset illustrate that STMGCN is capable of improving the accuracy of charging stations load forecasting compared with the baselines, which shows the effectiveness of the model.</description></item><item><title>Stochastic Optimization of Coupled Power Distribution-Urban Transportation Network Operations With Autonomous Mobility on Demand Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287171</link><description>Autonomous mobility on demand systems (AMoDS) will significantly affect the operation of coupled power distribution-urban transportation networks (PTNs) by the optimal dispatch of electric vehicles (EVs). This paper proposes an uncertainty method to analyze the operational states of PTNs with AMoDS. First, a PTN operation framework is designed considering the controllable EVs dispatched by AMoDS as well as the uncontrollable driving behaviors of other vehicle users. Then, a bi-level power-traffic flow (PTF) model is proposed to characterize the interaction of power distribution networks (PDNs) and urban transportation networks (UTNs). In the upper level, a social optimum model is established to minimize the operating cost of PDNs and UTNs embedded with controllable EVs. In the lower level, a stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) model is established to minimize the operating cost of uncontrollable EVs and gasoline vehicles (GVs) in UTNs. Finally, a probabilistic PTF analysis method is developed to evaluate PTN operations under environmental and human uncertainties. A regional sensitivity analysis method is proposed to identify the critical uncertainties and quantify the impacts of their distribution ranges on PTN operations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the PTN consisting of a 21-bus PDN and a 20-node UTN.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Vehicle Charging in Bilevel Power-Traffic Networks via Charging Demand Function</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10293190</link><description>Electric vehicle (EV) charging couples the operation of power and traffic networks. Specifically, the power network determines the charging price at various locations, while EVs on the traffic network optimize the charging power given the price, acting as price-takers. We model such decision-making processes by a bilevel program, with the power network at the upper-level and the traffic network at the lower-level. However, since the two networks are managed by separate entities and the charging expense term, calculated as the product of charging price and charging demand, is nonlinear. Solving the bilevel program is nontrivial. To overcome these challenges, we derive the charging demand function using multiparametric programming theory. This function establishes a piecewise linear relationship between the charging price and the optimal charging power, enabling the power network operator to manage EV charging power independently while accounting for the coupling between the two networks. With the derived function, we are also able to replace the nonlinear charging expense term with a piecewise quadratic one, thus guaranteeing solution optimality. Our numerical studies demonstrate that different traffic demands can have an impact on charging patterns and the power network can effectively incentivize charging at low-price nodes through price setting.</description></item><item><title>A Capacity-Based Regulation Method for Coordinating Electric Vehicle Charging Flows in Coupled Distribution and Transportation Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10295993</link><description>The proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) is bringing additional challenges to power distribution network (PDN) operations. Traditional regulation methods incentivize EVs to charge at expected places via price signals, which cannot guarantee a secure PDN operation due to uncertain responsiveness of EVs to charging prices. This paper explores the use of available EV charging station (EVCS) capacities as signals and proposes a regulation method to coordinate EV charging flows in coupled power and transportation networks. First, the proposed bi-level model optimizes the available charging capacities and schedules the least-cost power generation at the upper level, while assigning the traffic flows by user equilibrium and navigating the EV charging at the lower level. The adverse impact of EV charging behaviors on PDN operations is eliminated by the proposed model. Second, a branch price and cut-based decomposition algorithm is proposed to tackle the computational intractability and infeasibility brought about by the capacity regulation. Third, the inverse optimization technique is exploited to yield an enhanced regulation strategy that alleviates the impact of system adjustments on EV users. Finally, case studies are carried out on a practical network, which demonstrate the merits of the proposed capacity-based method over the traditional price-based method.</description></item><item><title>EV-EcoSim: A Grid-Aware Co-Simulation Platform for the Design and Optimization of Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10342763</link><description>To enable the electrification of transportation systems, it is important to understand how technologies such as grid storage, solar photovoltaic systems, and control strategies can aid the deployment of electric vehicle charging at scale. In this work, we present EV-EcoSim, a co-simulation platform that couples electric vehicle charging, battery systems, solar photovoltaic systems, grid transformers, control strategies, and power distribution systems, to perform cost quantification and analyze the impacts of electric vehicle charging on the grid. This python-based platform can run a receding horizon control scheme for real-time operation and a one-shot control scheme for planning problems, with multi-timescale dynamics for different systems to simulate realistic scenarios. We demonstrate the utility of EV-EcoSim through a case study focused on economic evaluation of battery size to reduce electricity costs while considering impacts of fast charging on the power distribution grid. We present qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the battery size in tabulated results. The tabulated results delineate the trade-offs between candidate battery sizing solutions, providing comprehensive insights for decision-making under uncertainty. Additionally, we demonstrate the implications of the battery controller model fidelity on the system costs and show that the fidelity of the battery controller can completely change decisions made when planning an electric vehicle charging site.</description></item><item><title>When Mobile Energy Meets Active Distribution Networks: A Security&#8211;Economic Coordination Perspective</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10342820</link><description>This article explores the interaction between active distribution networks (ADN) and mobile energy, specifically mobile charging robots (MCRs) and electric vehicles (EVs). We introduce the concept of MCR operator, who acts as a mediator between EVs and the ADN. To realize the interaction among the three parties, a cloud-edge-terminal control framework is formulated considering the coupling factors with the transportation systems. On this basis, the interaction between MCRs and EVs is achieved based on the game theory, which is implemented in a fully distributed manner to protect the data privacy. To reduce the computation complexity, the game-based interactive problem is further decomposed into a charging price bargaining problem and a charging decision and power regulation problem. Furthermore, the power quality of the ADN is guaranteed through incentivizing the charging/discharging behaviors of MCRs, which is formulated as a coordination between the ADN operator and the MCR operator, and the topology switching is also taken into consideration, thus the voltage regulation ability of the ADN and the economics of the MCR operator can be enhanced at the same time. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach, which also indicate that mobile energy and the ADN can achieve a win-win situation by benefiting all parties: Improving the utility for the EV aggregator by 35.48% (reducing the charging cost for EV owners), increasing the charging revenue for the MCR operator by 12%, and addressing the voltage issue for the ADN with a 100% voltage security rate.</description></item><item><title>Online Electric Vehicle Charging Strategy in Residential Areas With Limited Power Supply</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10345701</link><description>Electric vehicle (EV) demand is considerably increasing, aided by battery technology development and government policy support. Therefore, it is necessary to consider various charging infrastructures and secure sufficient power to support this. In several cities or countries, a large population lives in a small area, and the supply of large residential complexes such as apartments is common. Given that old apartments may not have sufficient power capacity, it is challenging to secure additional power for charging EVs. In particular, power shortages can intensify during high power usage, such as the summer season, and may become an obstacle to the spread of EVs. Therefore, an efficient charging strategy for residential complexes must be established under the condition of limited power supply. This study proposes two scheduling methods to optimally charge EVs in residential complexes considering limited power supply. The proposed scheduling algorithms are thoroughly examined through extensive simulations with parking data collected from real situations and are demonstrated to be effective for online EV charging systems.</description></item><item><title>Joint Trading and Scheduling Among Coupled Carbon-Electricity-Heat-Gas Industrial Clusters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10293189</link><description>This paper presents a carbon-energy coupling management framework for an industrial park, where the carbon flow model accompanying multi-energy flows is adopted to track and suppress carbon emissions on the user side. To deal with the quadratic constraint of gas flows, a bound tightening algorithm for constraints relaxation is adopted. The synergies among the carbon capture, energy storage, power-to-gas further consume renewable energy and reduce carbon emissions. Aiming at carbon emissions disparities and supply-demand imbalances, this paper proposes a carbon trading ladder reward and punishment mechanism and an energy trading and scheduling method based on Lyapunov optimization and matching game to maximize the long-term benefits of each industrial cluster without knowing the prior information of random variables. Case studies show that our proposed trading method can reduce overall costs and carbon emissions while relieving energy pressure, which is important for Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG).</description></item><item><title>A Decentralised Transactive Energy Market Considering Physical System Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10314804</link><description>Local energy markets leveraging direct Peer-to-Peer (P2P) trading have been proposed as a solution, which can increase prosumer participation in lower cost and more reliable supply of energy to consumers. Many approaches have been proposed to determine the optimal dispatch of distributed resources; however, existing approaches either provide inadequate representation of the physical layer or insufficient handling of infeasibilities for a continuous pricing mechanism. Hence, a gap remains in the research to date on efficiently allowing for prosumer decision autonomy while ensuring that the physical layer of the power system is considered. This paper addresses these issues with a proposed decentralised transactive solution that retains prosumer negotiation and decision autonomy, while using market determined prices to allocate limited system resources for a feasible system state. This is achieved through a transaction fee mechanism for prosumer interactions that considers the network characteristics such as topology and line congestion, and a congestion-clearing process to ensure efficient allocation of network resources. Previously reported distribution networks are used to compare the economic performance and transaction decisions of the proposed solution with existing approaches.</description></item><item><title>A Gradient-Based Wind Power Forecasting Attack Method Considering Point and Direction Selection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304287</link><description>Machine learning methods have been prevailing in wind power forecasting, while these data-driven based methods are susceptible to cyberattacks. Typical attack methods inject malicious data into influence factors according to the gradient direction of the forecasting model to randomly increase or decrease forecasting results, ignoring the number of attacks and attack effect. In this paper, an attack sample selection model is proposed to select vulnerability sample points for attack in order to reduce the number of attacks. At the same time, an attack direction judgment model is developed to launch the attack in the correct gradient direction to maximize the attack effect. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated on two public wind power datasets and nine typical machine learning based forecasting models such as ANN, ENN, RNN, LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, BiGRU, CNN and TCN. Compared with the existing gradient-based attack methods, the proposed attack method increases MAPE values of the nine models by about 9% on average while improving the attack concealment.</description></item><item><title>Complex-Value Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks and Its Applications to Electric Power Systems AI</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10317877</link><description>The effective representation, processing, analysis, and visualization of large-scale structured data over graphs, especially power grids, are gaining a lot of attention. So far most of the literature considered exclusively real-valued graph signals. However, graph signals are often sparse in the Fourier domain, and more informative and compact representations for them can be obtained using the complex envelope of their spectral components, as opposed to the original real-valued signals. This is the case for the AC carrier, and motivates its complex phasor representation. Focusing on applications in power systems, in this paper we generalize graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) to the complex domain, incorporating a complex-valued graph shift operators (GSO) based on the admittance matrix of power grids in the definition of graph filters (GF) and process complex-valued voltage phasor graph signals (GS). The theory developed is generalized to handle spatio-temporal complex network processes. We prove that complex-valued GCNs can be stable with respect to perturbations of the underlying graph support, by bounding of the error propagation through multiple NN layers. The paper showcases the benefits of complex GCN relative to several benchmarks, in power grid state forecasting and cyber-attack detection and localization.</description></item><item><title>Lyapunov-Based Resilient Cooperative Control for DC Microgrid Clusters Against False Data Injection Cyber-Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10319320</link><description>With the high penetration of renewable energy sources in power systems, DC microgrid clusters are widely installed and employed that can interface several types of renewable energy sources to different types of loads. However, being highly dependent on communication networks, DC microgrids are exposed to cyber-attacks. Therefore, in this paper, a resilient cooperative control method is proposed for DC microgrid cluster systems, that is able to achieve both the voltage regulation and power sharing in the presence of cyber-attacks. Firstly, a comprehensive microgrid cluster model is developed taking the grid forming converters, grid feeding converters, loads and line impedances into account. Based on the Lyapunov-based stability analysis, a design guideline for controller that depends only on parameters of the local microgrid is then presented. Next, steady state analysis is carried out showing that the controller is capable of eliminating the impact of cyber-attacks on the microgrid. Finally, the resilience performances of the provided control scheme are validated by experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Bayesian GAN-Based False Data Injection Attack Detection in Active Distribution Grids With DERs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10335615</link><description>Advancements in information and communication technologies have revolutionized monitoring and control capabilities within smart grids. However, it also brings new vulnerabilities to data acquisition systems and state estimation functions, which attackers can subtly tamper with the measurement data through compromising the communication network. Moreover, the high penetration of renewable energy sources with the inherited characteristics of uncertainty and variability further complicates the design of effective intrusion detection systems. In this paper, a Bayesian deep learning-based approach is developed to detect cyber attacks and maintain the security of smart grids. Our method specifically addresses the prevalent issue of imbalanced data in real power systems, which arises from the predominance of normal system operations over compromised or attacked states. Employing a novel Bayesian GAN-based technique, our approach successfully discriminates between secure and compromised measurement data, even in scenarios with significant data imbalance. Furthermore, the proposed method accommodates various practical application factors, ensuring accurate intrusion detection despite the presence of measurement noise. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed detection mechanism are validated by testing on IEEE 13-node and 123-node test systems. Simulation results and comparisons with literature methods demonstrate the superiority of proposed cybersecurity solutions.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Modeling and Mitigation of Cascading Failures in Power Grids With Interdependent Cyber and Physical Layers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10336916</link><description>Modeling and prevention of cascading failure in power systems are important topics of research. We propose a dynamic cascading failure model that considers realistic interdependencies between power and communication networks used for system monitoring and control in power grids. In this model, power line outages do not immediately disconnect communication links, whereas communication nodes have battery backup that starts depleting after considerable load shedding in the collocated bus or bus outage. When a communication node&#8217;s battery is fully depleted, the node disconnects from the cyber layer, potentially reducing the observability and controllability of the power grid. A centralized optimal preventive controller (OPC) to minimize load shedding is proposed for cascade mitigation, which is applied selectively on fully observable and controllable islands. The OPC considers AC power flow equations, multiple hard constraints, and treats overloading of lines as soft constraints. The results of Monte-Carlo simulations on the IEEE 118-bus and the 2,383-bus Polish systems demonstrate that the proposed OPC is effective in mitigating cascading failures. Finally, we demonstrate that our recently proposed Backward Euler method with Predictor-Corrector can reduce the average simulation time by approximately 9&#8211;26-folds compared to the Trapezoidal method with acceptable accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Training a Dynamic Neural Network to Detect False Data Injection Attacks Under Multiple Unforeseen Operating Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10345789</link><description>As a cyber-physical attack targeting power systems, False Data Injection Attack (FDIA) has raised widespread concern in recent years. Many FDIA detection approaches in the literature train learning models using historical data to distinguish attacked measurements from normal ones. These approaches typically suffer from severe generalization problems. Although they can achieve good detection performance when the data has a similar distribution in the offline training and online application phases, they often perform poorly when an online operating condition is unforeseen during offline training. To address this problem, this paper proposes a two-layer Dynamic Neural Network (DyNN) framework for FDIA detection. The lower layer is like a traditional FDIA detection model, which uses a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network to extract latent features, and employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to make detection decisions based on the extracted features. However, unlike traditional approaches where the internal parameters of the learning model are fixed after training, the internal parameters of the MLP are dynamically generated according to the online data by an upper-layer DyNN adapter. An interactive co-training mechanism is also proposed to coordinate both layers and ensure that the dynamically generated MLP parameters are best suited for FDIA detection in the current operating condition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the two-layer DyNN framework can achieve satisfactory FDIA detection performance even though the training and test data are collected under completely different operating conditions. In the most extreme cases, the average accuracy and F1 score of the proposed DyNN-based FDIA detection framework are 4.91% and 4.24% higher than that without DyNN, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Coordinated Defense Strategy for Time-Sensitive Networking Enabled Cyber&#8211;Physical Power System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10398470</link><description>Cyber-physical power system (CPPS) stability is severely affected by the communication network performance due to cyber-physical interdependence. Thus, uncertain cyber-physical coordinated attacks (CPCA) pose more significant threats to CPPS than physical attacks. However, the defense strategies in recent works assume real-time and reliable transmission under an ideal cyber-attack, leading to inaccurate cyber-physical interdependence modeling. Therefore, the strategies are ineffective against uncertain CPCA. This paper proposes a hierarchical CPPS network architecture that integrates time-sensitive networking (TSN) to improve resilience against uncertain CPCA. To model the uncertain CPCA, a coordinated N-K ambiguity set is proposed considering all possible link failures on both cyber and physical layers. For the cyber layer, we propose a joint routing-scheduling model of TSN-based network to support deterministic and reliable data transmission, which improves the accuracy of cyber-physical interdependence. A distributionally robust coordinated defense (DRCD) strategy integrated with cyber-physical interdependence is then proposed to mitigate the priority-based load shedding considering the uncertainties of CPCA. The formulated DRCD strategy is linearized and transformed into a tri-level optimization problem which is efficiently solved by C-CG algorithm. Case studies indicate that the DRCD strategy has superiorities in improving the resilience of CPPS compared with other conventional models.</description></item><item><title>Stochastic Dynamic Power Dispatch With Human Knowledge Transfer Using Graph-GAN Assisted Inverse Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304374</link><description>This paper proposes a novel approach for dynamic economic dispatch (DED) of distribution networks, based on graph-generative adversarial network (Graph-GAN) assisted inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) with human knowledge transfer via demonstration. Firstly, the proposed method utilizes graph convolutional network (GCN) to capture the complex and nonlinear relationships between dispatch decision and system state. Secondly, a GAN-based approach is proposed to imitate the reward function from expert demonstration data, which avoids the need for manually designed reward functions. The trained policy network is then used for decision-making in real-time optimal dispatch of distribution networks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional IRL methods and achieves supply-demand balance. Computation efficiency of the proposed method is thoroughly analyzed and shows that it is practically scalable to large-scale distribution networks. Overall, the proposed approach presents a promising alternative by incorporating human knowledge into reinforcement learning for DED of distribution networks.</description></item><item><title>Stabilizing an Islanded Microgrid via Tie Switch Controls</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10409554</link><description>In contrast to the traditional power control viewpoint, this letter explores the problem of islanded microgrid stabilization from the topological control perspective: How to stabilize an islanded microgrid through tie switch controls?

In order to achieve this goal, drayage operators would need to transition 100% of their fleets to zero-emission vehicles such as battery electric trucks (BETs). This article presents an intelligently controlled charging model for BETs that minimizes charging costs while optimizing subsequent tour completion. To develop this model, real-world activity data from a drayage truck fleet operating in Southern California was combined with a two-stage clustering technique to identify trip and tour patterns. The energy consumption for each trip and tour was then simulated for BETs with a battery capacity of 565 kWh using a 150 kW charging power level. Home base charging load profiles were generated using the proposed charging model, subject to constraints of the energy needed to complete the next subsequent tour and Time-of-Use energy cost rates. A sensitivity analysis evaluated three scenarios: a passive scenario with a 5% state-of-charge (SOC) constraint after completing the subsequent tour, an average scenario with a 50% SOC constraint, and an aggressive scenario with an 80% SOC constraint. Results indicated that the 80% SOC constraint scenario achieved the lowest charging cost. However, it also yielded the lowest tour completion rate (51%). In contrast, the 5% SOC constraint scenario registered the highest tour completion rate. These results revealed that 96% of the tours could be successfully completed using the intelligently controlled charging model. The remaining tours were infeasible, indicating that the available time at the home base was inadequate for charging the necessary energy for the next tour. In terms of total costs, the scenario with a 5% SOC constraint resulted in an annual cost of approximately $40,000, whereas the 80% SOC scenario nearly doubled that amount.</description></item><item><title>A Fast and Accurate GaN Power Transistor Model and Its Application for Electric Vehicle</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10347531</link><description>In order to overcome the challenge of balancing accuracy with simulation speed of power electronics converters for system-level simulation, the paper proposes a GaN power transistor model that can accurately and rapidly predict power losses, which is suitable for system-level application such as an electric vehicle. The model is based on equivalent circuit and formed by behavioural equations to carefully model both conduction and switching losses. As a novelty, transistor power losses due to dynamic ON-state resistance is also included in the model. By comparison with experimental measurements and other available models of the similar type from the literature, it is shown that our model gives accurate results of the power losses and it helps to reduce the error by more than 70%. To accelerate simulation speed, power loss calculation and simulation time-step is decoupled. The power losses are represented in different levels and in the form of mathematical equations and look-up tables in MATLAB/Simulink. It is shown that our approach is able to reduce the simulation time by almost 18 times and maintain the same accuracy. The proposed GaN transistor loss model is finally implemented into a racing vehicle powertrain, where designers can obtain the power losses and temperature of the used power transistors in an easy and rapid way to optimise power electronics design.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Energy Management Strategy Based on Driving Pattern Recognition for a Dual-Motor Dual-Source Electric Vehicle</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10363666</link><description>This article introduces a novel approach in electric vehicle technology by combining dual-motor coupling with a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) using batteries and supercapacitors. This innovation enhances vehicle performance and prolongs battery life. An energy management strategy (EMS) based on Pontryagin's minimum principle (PMP) is used to optimize power distribution within the HESS. To improve PMP performance, the proposal integrates driving pattern recognition (DPR) and co-state variable ($\lambda $) control. DPR employs an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for real-time pattern recognition. The process involves creating a sample driving cycle, employing subtractive clustering to establish the original fuzzy inference system (FIS), and fine-tuning FIS parameters through neural network training. $\lambda $ values are updated based on recognition results to adapt control actions for various driving styles. Real-time simulations on Opal-RT reveal significant improvements compared to EMS without DPR. Battery current root mean square and standard deviation decrease by 11.4% and 29.4%, respectively, during the unknown in advance Federal Test Procedure (FTP) cycle. This adaptable DPR method offers versatility for various EMSs and clarifies the impact of disturbances like supercapacitor size, state of charge variations, and off-road conditions on HESS performance, aiding researchers in designing more efficient systems.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Torque-Distribution for Dual-Motor Off-Road Vehicle Using Machine Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10411103</link><description>Recently, demand for electric vehicles (EVs) has increased significantly as people are becoming more conscious of the environment and the need to reduce carbon emissions. The introduction of multi-motor systems in EVs has brought new challenges in terms of energy efficiency and performance. This paper presents a Multi-Ensemble Learning (MEL)-based approach to design an Energy Management Strategy (EMS) for a Dual Motor Electric Vehicle (DMEV) where MEL is a new powerful Machine Learning approach implemented using Python programming language. To make our study concrete, we studied a real DMEV that is modeled using Energetic Macroscopic Representation and whose control is simulated using Matlab/Simulink&#8482;. The designed EMS aims to distribute the instant torque between the two electric motors in an efficient manner, with the objective of minimizing energy consumption as much as possible. Contrary to existing EMSs, an important advantage of our designed EMS is that it determines the instant torque distribution in real-time (while the vehicle is running), without knowing in advance how physical parameters (such as the speed and traction force) will evolve during the current trip. The real-time simulation is carried out under unknown driving cycles based on a validated numerical EV model with a significantly lower computational cost while achieving a high degree of accuracy in predicting and allocating torque, and a high degree of performance in terms of energy consumption.</description></item><item><title>Assessing Effectiveness of Integrated Photovoltaic Panels on Light Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10428053</link><description>Light electric vehicles (LEV) are seen as an effective solution for reducing the carbon emissions in the transportation sector thanks to their light weight and low energy requirement. Integrated photovoltaic (PV) panels on LEVs have great potential because a higher portion of the energy demands can be covered by PV panels compared to heavier vehicles. Integrated PV panels on LEVs are constrained by the surface shape and available area, which results in panels facing different angles. In this work, we assess the effectiveness of such integrated PV panels based on simulations with meteorological data and measurements from a real prototype on an electric scooter. It is shown that the measured PV power correlates well with the simulated data. A number of design options such as the number of PV panels and the angle of the panels are evaluated through simulations and we compare seasonal and regional differences. Based on the assessment, we make design suggestions for cost-effective and energy-efficient integrated PV panels on LEVs. Results indicate that with the right design and favorable circumstances, the integrated PV panels can generate more energy over a day than is consumed by the LEV in one day.</description></item><item><title>Application of Wireless Charging at Seaports for Range Extension of Drayage Battery Electric Trucks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10380321</link><description>Even though heavy-duty battery electric trucks (BETs) have become commercially available, their range limitation still hinders widespread adoption. Drayage has been regarded as a suitable application for early BETs due to typically having limited daily mileage. However, drayage operation can vary widely and some form of range extension may still be needed for BETs operating in this application. In this paper, wireless charging at port terminals is proposed for this purpose. Potential wireless charging zones at port terminals are identified, and efficacy of wireless charging to extend BET range in drayage operation is verified by simulating the activity of 20 BETs from a drayage operator serving the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, using a microscopic BET energy consumption model. Furthermore, an optimization problem is formulated for optimal wireless charging zone planning from the port authority's perspective, considering subsets of the identified zones, and charging power options to choose from, for different budget ranges. In this context, zone planning means determining which areas of the port terminals should be selected for installing wireless charging systems, and what level of charging power should be for each selected zone's system. For each budget range, the optimization problem is solved using genetic algorithm to determine an optimal zone plan that provides the maximum amount of energy through wireless charging per unit cost of installation. The results show that wireless charging can aid improving activity completion of the simulated fleet by 5%, and further optimizing the zone plan can achieve similar performance with lower cost.</description></item><item><title>A Flexible Cloud-Based HIL Testing of Batteries for Various Electrified Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10334515</link><description>Power Hardware-In-the-loop (HIL) testing is increasing in the automotive industry for testing subsystems for new vehicles. Usually, the test is located in a unique place (stand-alone (local) HIL). The key-points for a vehicle manufacturer and subsystems suppliers are time and confidentiality. Using the cloud is a way to satisfy the both. Cloud model sharing is developed to spare time and cloud-based real-time simulation limits the access to the models to only certain variables. In this article, a cloud-based power HIL testing is proposed using a cloud of vehicle models. The Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR) formalism is used to organize all the models. It facilitates the interconnections between the simulated and power tested subsystems. Two new batteries are experimentally tested, one for an electric vehicle, the other one for a plug-in hybrid vehicle. The same cloud is used and the power test facilities are located in two different locations. This shows the flexibility of the method.</description></item><item><title>Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Integrated Eco-Driving Strategy for Connected and Automated Electric Vehicles in Complex Urban Scenarios</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10414122</link><description>With vehicle-to-everything (V2X) information, connected and automated vehicle (CAV) eco-driving strategy allows the vehicle to plan its speed and choose the optimal lane based on actual conditions, resulting in improved driving performance. This study presents a novel eco-driving strategy framework based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques for CAVs driving in urban scenarios. This framework integrates longitudinal speed planning with lateral lane change decision-making and aims to co-optimize the energy efficiency, driving safety, and travel efficiency. By leveraging traffic information and multi-objective reward functions, the twin delayed deep deterministic (TD3) algorithm is employed to train the actor-critic (AC) network which generates both longitudinal and lateral control commands based on its estimation for lane preference score. The proposed strategy is tested in a complex urban scenario based on Simulation Urban Mobility (SUMO) which reflects real urban traffic conditions. Experimental results indicate that the longitudinal speed planning module of the proposed strategy can shorten the travel txime by up to 7.94% or reduce the electricity consumption by 18.15%, depending on the degree of importance placed on economy by the TD3 agent. By integrating the lateral lane decision module, the proposed strategy can further shorten the travel time by 5.7% and save 1.75% energy consumption.</description></item><item><title>Online Temperature-Aware Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy for Mild Hybrid Electric Powertrains</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10401959</link><description>In this work, an online energy management strategy for mild hybrid electric vehicles is developed to minimize the fuel consumption while simultaneously preventing battery overheating. Since mild hybrids are typically equipped with a passively cooled battery pack, the energy management strategy design needs to keep the battery temperature below an upper limit, preventing accelerated aging and thermal runaway. To address this issue, the equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) approach is extended to develop a real-time capable controller, termed thermal ECMS (Th-ECMS), that is sensitive to the thermal dynamics of the battery and that can enforce constraints on its temperature. The rationale for our formulation is based on Pontryagin's minimum principle from optimal control theory. The online Th-ECMS is developed on the basis of the offline version of Th-ECMS, introduced in a previous work. Exploiting the a priori knowledge of the driving mission, the offline Th-ECMS calibrates the equivalence factors and obtains the optimal solution, which is compared with the globally optimal dynamic programming solution. This offline calibration method is run on a large number of driving missions and the collected data is used to train a feed-forward neural network that estimates optimal equivalence factors as functions of the battery state of charge, battery temperature, and distance yet to travel. The trained network is then used to populate two look-up tables mapping the equivalence factors, and implementable on the vehicle electronic control unit. Finally, the online Th-ECMS obtains the equivalence factors through the look-up tables in real-time. The online strategy was tested in four different driving missions, achieving a fuel economy remarkably similar to the optimal solution and successfully avoiding battery overheating.</description></item><item><title>Transformer-Based Traffic-Aware Predictive Energy Management of a Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10409570</link><description>The energy economy of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) plays a crucial role in determining their practicality, making the optimization of energy management strategies (EMS) essential. Predictive EMS (PEMS) based on future vehicle speed prediction offers great potential for enhancing EMS performance. However, current PEMS prediction models rely on historical speed data or static traffic information, overlooking the impact of real-time traffic conditions. In this article, we introduce a Transformer-based PEMS (TPEMS) that incorporates real-time predicted surrounding traffic information to improve FCEV operational economy. To better predict vehicle speed by accounting for the complex interactions between the controlled vehicle and surrounding vehicles, we developed a Transformer network-based predictor, which considers the speed and relative distance of six vehicles surrounding the controlled vehicle, generating speed predictions for the next 10 s. We then employ the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method as a downstream optimizer, creating a fully data-driven PEMS. For training the TPEMS, we developed a dataset derived from the NGSIM dataset, consisting of numerous driving profile segments that include temporal-sequential characteristics of the controlled vehicle and surrounding traffic. Furthermore, we utilize the SUMO simulator to generate a traffic information-enabled driving profile for performance evaluation. Experimental results reveal our Transformer-based predictor outperforms existing predictors, i.e., recurrent neural networks (RNN), in processing traffic information and achieving improved predictions. The TPEMS enhances the economic efficiency of FCEVs by 4.6% relative to the current state-of-the-art long short-term memory (LSTM)-based PEMS.</description></item><item><title>Generating Fault Databases Through Simulated and Experimental Multi-Rotor UAV Propulsion Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10387779</link><description>A light-gray-box simulation model is proposed for a multi-rotor propulsion chain designed to inject various faults into the system to generate fault behavior data sets. The model integrates the electrical and thermal characteristics of each component to model the interactions between components when faults are introduced. The simulated model is compared with an experimental test bench incorporating real hardware components, on which various faults can be injected to assess the accuracy of the simulated model. The propulsion chain consists of an Electronic Speed Controller, a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor, and a propeller. The faults considered are introduced on the three components of the propulsion chain. Electronic Speed Controller faults are applied to the power transistors; motor failures are open circuit, overheating and friction; and propeller failures are blade breakage and propeller loss. Using simulation of components with various failures, the model is designed to generate scalable, systematic, and reproducible behavior datasets for the development of fault detection systems which would eliminate the need for real hardware components.</description></item><item><title>Efficiency Evaluation of a Conductive Electric Road System With Respect to Traffic Characteristics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10423084</link><description>Electric Road Systems (ERS) are effective charging infrastructures that allows electric vehicles to receive energy while driving. This energy is used both to propel the vehicle and to charge the battery. Sufficient deployment of ERS implies that charging opportunities become greatly increased, allowing for electric vehicles to have smaller batteries and easing some of the problems associated with static fast-charging such as queues and need for large available areas. In this paper a simulation model for a conductive electric road is introduced and experimentally validated on a conductive electric road demonstrator. Two main ERS deployment cases with corresponding traffic flows are simulated: urban and rural. The results show that the urban simulation case has an efficiency of 96.5% and the rural simulation case has an efficiency of 95.7%. For the urban simulation case the impact of traffic intensity and traffic congestion on the ratio of semiconductor losses and resistive losses is evaluated. This evaluation shows that for this type of ERS design semiconductor losses should be considered in future ERS deployments in urban environment where traffic congestion and queues occur. Finally, a system efficiency comparison between the urban and rural simulation cases and a conventional static charger shows that an ERS can provide equivalent or even greater system efficiency than that of a conventional static charger depending on ERS application, deployment and design.</description></item><item><title>Reliability of Linear Losses-to-Power Scaling Method of Electric Drive Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10417773</link><description>This article assesses the reliability of the linear losses-to-power scaling method of electric drive systems, composed of a permanent magnet synchronous machine and IGBT inverter. The scaling method, which is commonly used in research studies on system-level design, postulates that overall power losses scale linearly to the desired power rating. However, the validity of this assumption is questionable, and it may impact simulation outcomes. To address these issues, the study derives the conditions that must be met for the linear scaling method to be achieved based on the well-known geometric scaling laws of electric machines and information obtained from inverter datasheets. The analysis at component-level indicates that the linear scaling method is effective in predicting efficiency for upscaling cases, with a discrepancy of less than 1%. However, it is found that this method is not appropriate for downscaling scenarios. Despite these limitations, a sensitivity analysis is conducted at system-level to examine the effect of linear losses-to-power scaling on the energy consumption of an electric vehicle, considering power scaling factors of 0.67 and 1.33. The examination compares this effect to different geometric variations of scaled electric machines and different power ratings of inverters, using 12 different standardized driving cycles. The outcomes of the analysis indicate that the difference in terms of energy consumption is within a satisfactory range below 2% for the upscaling and downscaling cases. This demonstrates the feasibility of the method at system-level for fast assessment of energy consumption in the early development phases of electric vehicles.</description></item><item><title>Closed-Form Expression to Estimate the Hydrogen Consumption of a Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicle</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10381787</link><description>Optimizing the design of hybrid powertrains requires co-optimizing their plant and their control, and the complexity of combining a static and a time-varying problem naturally leads to methodologies that optimize both levels in a nested configuration. As an alternative, a method to estimate the fuel consumption over a driving cycle with a closed-form expression is available in the literature, the Fully-Analytical Fuel Consumption Estimation (FACE), reducing the co-optimization to a uni-level problem. This approach was also expanded to Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicles (FCHEV) by introducing theory-based models for the fuel cell system and the electric components, since the latter were oversimplified in the first FACE implementation. However, the resulting expressions were difficult to handle, and the component operating constraints were ignored. This article addresses the problems identified in the first implementation of FACE for FCHEVs, using the 2020 Toyota Mirai as a reference architecture. Simplified models of the powertrain components are introduced, and the steps required for development of a single closed-form expression for the hydrogen consumption are explained. The models are fitted and validated with experimental data obtained with a real vehicle on a roller test bench. The results show that the final model adequately estimates the hydrogen consumption over 5 different homologation cycles in both cold and hot starting conditions, with an overall error RMS of less than four percent.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Preemptive Controller Enabling Electric Driving of a Hybrid Electric Vehicle in a Zero Emission Zone</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10333990</link><description>For carbon neutrality, various regulations on fuel efficiency and exhaust gas of vehicles are being implemented. As one of the exhaust gas regulations, zero emission zone (ZEZ) where the entry of internal combustion engine vehicles is regulated is implemented, and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (P-HEVs) must drive in EV mode to pass through it. Unlike P-HEVs, HEVs have a small battery capacity and need to charge the battery in advance, and in cold weather, engine coolant needs to be heated in advance. If the engine coolant temperature is not sufficiently high, the heating of cabin may be turned off during ZEZ driving. Therefore, We propose a power management control algorithm that satisfies the battery state of charge and engine coolant temperature requirements while maximizing energy efficiency. The proposed controller is divided into a planning part that generates optimal reference based on navigation information and model predictive controller part that calculates optimal control inputs to follow the reference. Based on optimal control, the proposed controller satisfies the requirements and shows superior performance in terms of fuel efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Doppler Aliasing in OFDM Radar: A Method for Reducing the ADC Sampling Frequency Without Losing Range Resolution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10323103</link><description>The orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform is especially suited for joint sensing and communication applications and has raised attention for radar-driven applications as well. For radar applications, the signal bandwidth determines the achievable range resolution, however, a large signal bandwidth also entails a large sampling frequency that is costly in terms of energy consumption and chip area. Hence, methods for reducing the sampling frequency have become an interesting field of research. In this work, a novel method referred to as Doppler aliasing (DA) - OFDM (DA-OFDM) is proposed, which allows for reducing the sampling frequency, while still benefiting from the same range resolution the entire signal bandwidth offers. This is achieved by allowing for systematic aliasing of the originally orthogonal subcarriers due to undersampling in the receiver. However, by properly modulating the transmit signal, these subcarriers become separable in the receiver in the Doppler domain. This work contains the derivation of the DA-OFDM waveform, a detailed analysis, radar measurement results, the derivation of a suitable communication receiver signal processing scheme, and bit error ratio (BER) simulation results. The latter one will verify the suitability of DA-OFDM for joint sensing and communication applications compared to, e.g., stepped-carrier OFDM.</description></item><item><title>Learning-Based Cooperative Mobility Control for Autonomous Drone-Delivery</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10310117</link><description>It has been widely considered that autonomous aerial drone-delivery will play a key role in next-generation logistics. For enabling robust and reliable autonomous multi-drone aerial package delivery services, the proposed algorithm has to mainly consider two objectives, i.e., (i) the maximization of total number of delivered packages and (ii) the efficient energy utilization which is defined as the energy consumption facilitation for increasing the number of delivered packages while avoiding battery exhaustion. This can be formulated as a kind of scheduling optimization problems, after that, this is re-formulated as a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL), in order to convert integer programming-based formulation which is hard to solve in polynomial-time into MADRL-based discrete-time sequential decision making over multiple cooperative drones. For the solution approach of MADRL, a novel communication network (CommNet)-based algorithm is designed for multi-drone cooperation in order to optimally achieve our two objectives. Our performance evaluation results verify that the proposed CommNet-based algorithm achieves desired performance improvements in terms of the maximization of total number of delivered packages as well as the efficient energy utilization.</description></item><item><title>Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Driving in Unstructured Scenarios Based on Deep Learning and Quadratic Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10310161</link><description>Trajectory planning for autonomous driving is challenging in unstructured scenarios such as mining sites. Existing studies mainly resort to a heuristic search-based planner to find a feasible trajectory. In the case of the narrow area, the heuristic function of the planner suffers from over-expansion problems, which may result in heavy computation burden and memory usage as well as potential failure. Therefore, a novel trajectory planning approach, namely learning and optimization-based trajectory planning (LOTP), is proposed, which is featured by a hierarchical structure consisting of two modules: (1) path searching, (2) speed profile generation. Firstly, a path searching method based on deep learning and Monte-Carlo tree search is proposed to generate a coarse path connecting starting and terminal points. Then, the path is smoothed using path optimization and provided to the speed-planning module as the reference. Next, a speed planning method based on quadratic optimization is developed, which allows to seek maximum driving comfort and energy saving. Last, extensive simulation experiments were conducted in the real environment of mining sites. The results verified that LOTP enhances the computational efficiency and success rate of path planning and helps generate an optimal speed profile. Furthermore, LOTP exhibits desirable potential for the practical application of autonomous driving at mining sites. Source implementation will be released as an open-source code.</description></item><item><title>RLoPlanner: Combining Learning and Motion Planner for UAV Safe Navigation in Cluttered Unknown Environments</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10323210</link><description>In this paper, we propose a hierarchical navigation framework named RLoPlanner that combines deep reinforcement learning algorithms and local motion planners, allowing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to perform navigation tasks safely and energy-efficiently in complex and unknown environments. This technique is critical to improve the performance of UAVs in environments without prior maps. Specifically, the framework high-level generates a stochastic policy through a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on maximum entropy, which generates a local target based on raw sensor information. Then the low-level motion planner tracks the local goal to generate a smooth trajectory to the final target. Compared with existing end-to-end navigation methods, the proposed navigation framework generates trajectories that are smoother, more energy-efficient and more dynamically feasible. The framework also overcomes the drawback that the mapping and planning methods tend to fall into local minima. Our experiments in a simulated environment with random obstacles demonstrate that RLoPlanner outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of navigation success rate and kinematically compliant trajectories.</description></item><item><title>Improved Supervisory Controller Design for a Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicle</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10313075</link><description>In this paper, a fuel cell system supervisory controller is developed for a fuel cell-based hybrid electric vehicle to safely control the interactions between powertrain components, maximize efficiency and minimize the degradation of the fuel cell. The proposed fuel cell supervisory controller includes three main elements: a state machine, an optimal setpoint generator and a power limit calculator. The state machine, as the top layer of the supervisory controller, is responsible for coordinating the various subsystems of the fuel cell, including the three subsystems, anode, cathode, thermal, and the dc/dc converter. The primary purpose of the state machine is to ensure global control over these subsystems as well as facilitate communication between the fuel cell system, diagnosis system, and Vehicle Control Unit (VCU). The state machine not only allows for the appropriate transitions between states but also governs the fuel cell system operation in all its different operating states such as Start-up, Shutdown and Run. The optimal setpoint generator is responsible for determining the operating conditions of the fuel cell system that maximizes the system's efficiency. It is designed by taking into account the comprehensive model of the fuel cell stack, considering manufacturing constraints, and incorporating the compressor map which then provides the optimal setpoints for all the subsystems' local controllers. A power limit calculator is also developed to compute the stack available power and feeds this information to the energy management system in the VCU. This information is used by the VCU to split the requested power between the fuel cell and the battery. The experimentally validated stack model and the complex model of the subsystems based on the Inn-Balance project data are used in the simulation. Furthermore, the subsystems' local controllers used in the MATLAB-Simulink were validated in a real vehicle test bench. The Common Artemis 130 km/h Driving Cycle (CADC) for automotive applications is used to verify the proposed fuel cell system supervisory controller in the MATLAB-Simulink environment. The simulation results showed that the proposed control structure functioned properly in the Run mode using this CADC-based load profile.</description></item><item><title>High Performance Sparse Forward-Looking Imaging of Distributed Millimeter-Wave Radar</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10328892</link><description>High performance and high resolution single snapshot imaging technology is one of the keys to empowering radar development. For millimeter-wave radar performance to meet the stringent requirements of forward-looking imaging, conventional processing of a single sensor by straightforward scaling of the radar parameters is often restricted. Here, this paper presents an effective and high accuracy settlement for forward-looking imaging acquisition in spatial distributed radar system. Firstly, we construct a joint angle-range complex signal model for multiple-input multiple-output scheme, and propose the joint Bayesian matching pursuit (jBMP) algorithm to employ sparse sensing-based estimation of unsynchronized nodes. Our primary goal is to find a global minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimator involving Bernoulli-Gaussian variables, and to adopt the general linear fusion rule for the distributed Bayesian structure. The uniqueness of the solution lies in the fact that the associated support set obtained through greedy search is globally shared by all nodes. Finally, a series of simulation and real data obtained from the distributed radar systems is presented to illustrate the validity and robustness of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Learning-Based Model Predictive Control for the Energy Management of Hybrid Electric Vehicles Including Driving Mode Decisions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10319113</link><description>This paper presents an online-capable controller for the energy management system of a parallel hybrid electric vehicle based on model predictive control. Its task is to minimize the vehicle's fuel consumption along a predicted driving mission by calculating the distribution of the driver's power request between the electrical and the combustive part of the powertrain, and by choosing the driving mode, which depends on the vehicle's clutch state. The inclusion of the clutch state in a model predictive control structure is not trivial because the underlying optimization problem becomes a mixed-integer program as a consequence. Using Pontryagin's Minimum Principle and a simplified vehicle model, it is possible to prove that a drive cycle-dependent critical power request $P_\text{crit}$ exists, which uniquely separates the optimal driving mode. Based on this result, a learning algorithm is proposed to determine $P_\text{crit}$ during the operation of the vehicle. The learning algorithm is incorporated into a multi-level controller structure and the working principle of the resulting multi-level learning-based model predictive controller is analyzed in detail using three realistic driving missions. A comparison to the solution obtained by Dynamic Programming reveals that the proposed controller achieves close-to-optimal performance.</description></item><item><title>Joint User Association and Beamforming in Integrated Satellite-HAPS-Ground Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304301</link><description>This article proposes, and evaluates the benefit of, one particular hybrid satellite-high-altitude-platform-station (HAPS)-ground network, where one HAPS connected to one geo-satellite assists the ground base stations (BSs) at serving ground-level users. The paper assumes that the geo-satellite is connected to the HAPS using free-space-optical backhaul links. The HAPS, equipped with multiple antennas, aims at transmitting the geo-satellite data to the users via radio-frequency (RF) links using spatial-multiplexing. Each ground BS, on the other hand, is equipped with multiple antennas, but directly serves the users through the RF links. The paper then focuses on maximizing the network-wide throughput, subject to HAPS payload connectivity constraint, HAPS and BSs power constraints, and backhaul constraints, so as to jointly determine the user-association strategy of each user (i.e., user to geo-satellite via HAPS, or user to BS), and their associated beamforming vectors. We tackle such a mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem using an iterative approach, where the user-association is determined using a combination of integer linear programming and generalized assignment problems, and where the beamforming strategy is found using a weighted-minimum-mean-squared-error approach. The simulations illustrate the appreciable gain of our proposed algorithm, and highlight the prospects of augmenting the ground networks with beamforming-empowered HAPS for connecting the unconnected, and super-connecting the connected.</description></item><item><title>Quantized Phase Alignment by Discrete Phase Shifts for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Assisted Communication Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315225</link><description>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), with its capability of passively beamforming, has aroused a surge of interest in recent years. In this paper, we investigate the joint phase alignment and phase quantization on RIS discrete phase shift designs for RIS-assisted single-input single-output (SISO) system. Firstly, the phenomena of phase distribution in far and near fields of RIS are differentiated. Then, for the purpose of phase alignment, the phase distribution law and its underlying degree-of-freedom (DoF) are analyzed, serving as the guideline of phase quantization strategies. Subsequently, two phase quantization methods, i.e., dynamic threshold phase quantization (DTPQ) and equal interval phase quantization (EIPQ), are proposed to optimize RIS phase shift discretization so as to strengthen the beamforming. DTPQ evidences its capability of achieving the optimal discrete phase alignment with a linear complexity, whilst EIPQ is a simplified method yielding sub-optimal solution yet with a constant complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that both of the proposed methods provide substantial improvements on power gain, stability, and robustness over traditional quantization method. In addition, as a product of RIS beamforming, the path loss (PL) scaling law under discrete phase shifts for RIS channel is unveiled for the first time. The field trials conducted at 2.6GHz and 35 GHz validate the favourable performance of the proposed methods in practical communication environment. This work may provide reference for the beamforming design of RIS-assisted links, especially in the near field.</description></item><item><title>Joint Beam Scheduling and Beamforming Design for Cooperative Positioning in Multi-Beam LEO Satellite Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10323191</link><description>Cooperative positioning with multiple low earth orbit (LEO) satellites is promising in providing location-based services and enhancing satellite-terrestrial communication. However, positioning accuracy is greatly affected by inter-beam interference and satellite-terrestrial topology geometry. To select the best combination of satellites from visible ones and suppress inter-beam interference, this paper explores the utilization of flexible beam scheduling and beamforming of multi-beam LEO satellites that can adjust beam directions toward the same earth-fixed cell to send positioning signals simultaneously. By leveraging Cram&#233;r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) to characterize user Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) positioning accuracy, the concerned problem is formulated, aiming at optimizing user positioning accuracy under beam scheduling and beam transmission power constraints. To deal with the mixed-integer-nonconvex problem, we decompose it into an inner beamforming design problem and an outer beam scheduling problem. For the former, we first prove the monotonic relationship between user positioning accuracy and its perceived signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) to reformulate the problem, and then semidefinite relaxation (SDR) is adopted for beamforming design. For the outer problem, a heuristic low-complexity beam scheduling scheme is proposed, whose core idea is to schedule users with lower channel correlation to mitigate inter-beam interference while seeking a proper satellite-terrestrial topology geometry. Simulation results verify the superior positioning performance of our proposed positioning-oriented beamforming and beam scheduling scheme, and it is shown that average user positioning accuracy is improved by 17.1% and 55.9% when the beam transmission power is 20 dBw, compared to conventional beamforming and beam scheduling schemes, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Joint Beam Alignment and Resource Allocation for Multi-User mmWave Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10316594</link><description>Integrated sensing and communication has been considered as one of the key technologies for the 6th generation mobile networks. To achieve higher beamforming gains, arrays with massive antennas are employed in millimeter wave band. However, the narrowing of the beam will also lead to increasing difficulty in beam alignment while increasing the error and overhead of conventional codebook-based beam sweeping schemes. In this article, a sensing-aided beam alignment scheme and corresponding resource allocation algorithm for the multi-user system is proposed. Specifically, the base station senses the angle of departure (AoD) of each user and performs beam alignment based on obtained AoDs in a time-divisional manner. Then, to reduce the effect of beam misalignment caused by sensing errors, a projected gradient descent algorithm based on Monte Carlo estimation is proposed to solve the non-convex and non-closed optimization problem for power allocation among users. Moreover, aiming to obtain the optimal trade-off between communication and sensing, a method for time interval allocation is developed. The proposed scheme can match the communication power allocated to each user with the estimation accuracy of its AoD, which can improve the achievable sum communication rate in the case of imperfect beam alignment. Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Weighted Sum-Rate Maximization for Multi-STAR-RIS-Assisted mmWave Cell-Free Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10316600</link><description>The cell-free network is regarded as an enabling technology for alleviating inter-cell interference due to its user-centric network paradigm. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are used to assist cell-free networks in improving network capacity at a low cost. However, only half-space coverage can be achieved by RISs. With the unique capability of extending half-space coverage to full-space coverage, simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS) is emerged as an attractive technology. Motivated by this distinctive characteristic, multiple STAR-RISs deployed in millimeter wave (mmWave) cell-free systems to assist users in downlink transmission are investigated in this paper. Our objective is to maximize the weighted sum-rate (WSR) via joint optimization of association indicators, active beamforming vectors at mmWave base stations (MBSs) as well as transmission and reflection beamforming vectors of STAR-RISs, while the limits of STAR-RIS-user association, each MBS maximum transmit power as well as passive coefficients of STAR-RISs ought to be satisfied. To handle the non-convex problem, we develop the Lagrangian dual transform (LDT)-quadratic transform (QT)-based algorithm. To be specific, the LDT and QT are utilized for reformulating the non-convex problem as a more solvable equivalent one, afterwards, the transformed problem is decomposed into five subproblems via the alternating optimization (AO) method. Particularly, the solutions of association indicators, active beamforming vectors, and passive beamforming vectors are obtained through the linear conic relaxation (LCR)-based association scheme, the rank-one relaxation approach as well as the penalty-based norm approximation algorithm, respectively. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method can obtain better WSR performance over benchmarks. Some useful guidances are also provided for mmWave cell-free systems.</description></item><item><title>Delay and Energy Minimization for Cooperative NOMA-MEC Networks With SWIPT Aided by RIS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10319410</link><description>In this article, a cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) mobile edge computing (MEC) network aided by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is considered, where the transmitters offload parts of their computing tasks to the MEC server via a relay and an RIS for enhancing the transmission environment. The goal is to minimize the task delay and energy consumption for the considered networks by jointly designing the RIS's reflection beamforming vector, the power splitting (PS) ratio, the power allocation factors of the relay, as well as the offloading transmit power and the offloading task ratio. To solve the proposed problems, an iterative optimization algorithm based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) method and the penalty method is proposed to decompose the formulated problems into two sub-problems. In particular, we jointly optimize the PS ratio, the power allocation coefficients and the edge computing resource based on the SCA technology, and then the penalty method is used to optimize the RIS's reflecting beamforming vector. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed NOMA-MEC networks aided by RIS and SWIPT are superior to the conventional orthogonal multiple access MEC networks with SWIPT aided by RIS in terms of task delay and energy consumption.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic UAV Swarm Collaboration for Multi-Targets Tracking Under Malicious Jamming: Joint Power, Path and Target Association Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10319327</link><description>In this paper, the multi-target tracking (MTT) with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm is investigated in the presence of jammers, where UAVs in the swarm communicate with each other to exchange information of targets during tracking. The communication between UAVs suffers from severe interference, including inter-UAV interference and jamming, thus leading to a deteriorated quality of MTT. To mitigate the interference and achieve MTT, we formulate an interference minimization problem by jointly optimizing UAV's sub-swarm division, trajectory, and power, subject to the constraint of MTT, collision prevention, flying ability, and UAV energy consumption. Due to the multiple coupling of sub-swarm division, trajectory, and power, the proposed optimization problem is NP-hard. To solve this challenging problem, it is decomposed into three subproblems, i.e., target association, path plan, and power control. First, a cluster-evolutionary target association (CETA) algorithm is proposed, which involves dividing the UAV swarm into multiple sub-swarms and individually matching these sub-swarms to targets. Second, a jamming-sensitive and singular case tolerance (JSSCT)-artificial potential field (APF) algorithm is proposed to plan trajectory for tracking the targets. Third, we develop a jamming-aware mean field game (JA-MFG) power control scheme, where a novel cost function is established considering the total interference. Finally, to minimize the total interference, a dynamic collaboration approach is designed. Different from traditional alternative iteration algorithms, our proposed dynamic collaboration approach triggers the updates of the sub-swarm division and UAV trajectory, and periodically updates the transmission power. Simulation results validate that the proposed dynamic collaboration approach reduces average total interference, tracking steps, and target switching times by 28%, 33%, and 48%, respectively, comparing to existing baselines.</description></item><item><title>Energy Efficiency Enhancement in User-Centric and Cell-Free Millimeter-Wave Massive MIMO Systems With Hybrid Beamforming</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10330153</link><description>Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) is a new and scalable network architecture that can bring antennas closer to users. In addition, hybrid beamforming can greatly reduce the power consumption by limiting the number of radio frequency chains. To achieve higher energy efficiency (EE) of a wireless network, it is of practical interest to incorporate hybrid beamforming into CF-mMIMO systems to fully utilize their combined benefits. Moreover, user-centric scheme is considered so that idle access points (APs) can be turned into sleep mode for energy saving. In this paper, we formulate the EE maximization problem where user-AP association, hybrid beamformers and AP selection are jointly optimized with a realistic power consumption model. Due to the binary variables involved, the formulated problem is a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem. Given this setup, we first exploit the strong coupling between binary variables and continuous beamformers, then a group sparse beamforming method is used to induce group-sparsity of beamformers, and finally the original problem is transformed into a more tractable one. To reduce complexity, we propose another low-complexity method to solve the original problem by using an alternate optimization algorithm. Numerical results indicate the superiority of the two proposed algorithms over some well-known schemes.</description></item><item><title>Analytical Performance Evaluation of STAR-RIS Assisted Terahertz Wireless Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10328394</link><description>This article considers simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) assisted terahertz communications, in which a multi-antenna full-duplex base station serves two half-duplex users (U1 and U2) in the downlink and uplink, respectively. It is assumed that U1 and U2 are located in the reflection and transmission spaces. The STAR-RIS is considered under energy splitting (ES) and mode switching (MS) protocols to provide simultaneous full-space coverage to both users, but at the expense of inter-user interference (IUI). The paper aims to evaluate the impacts of various practical factors on the system performance, including IUI, quantization errors due to discrete phase shifters of the STAR-RIS, beam misalignment due to highly-directive antennas, and random fog. Thus, it derives accurate expressions for the ergodic capacity, outage probability, and symbol error rate. Numerical and simulation results reveal that the system performance is more severely impacted by beam misalignment and random fog than by other factors. It is also observed that the ES protocol outperforms the MS protocol in the downlink, but the situation is reversed in the uplink due to coupled phase shifts. Moreover, in the high-signal-to-noise ratio regime, the system performance is restricted due to IUI signals.</description></item><item><title>How to Minimize the Weighted Sum AoI in Multi-Source Status Update Systems: TDMA or NOMA?</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10329986</link><description>In this paper, the minimization of the weighted sum average age of information (AoI) in a multi-source status update communication system is studied. Multiple independent sources send update packets to a common destination node in a time-slotted manner under the limit of maximum retransmission rounds. Different multiple access schemes, i.e., time-division multiple access (TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), are exploited here over a block-fading multiple access channel (MAC). Constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) problems are formulated to describe the AoI minimization problems considering both transmission schemes. The Lagrangian method is used to convert CMDP problems to unconstrained Markov decision process (MDP) problems, and corresponding algorithms are designed to derive the power allocation policies. Also, a suboptimal threshold-based policy is proposed. On the other hand, for the case of unknown environments, two online reinforcement learning approaches considering both multiple access schemes are proposed to achieve near-optimal age performance. Numerical simulations validate the improvement of the proposed policy in terms of weighted sum AoI compared to the fixed power transmission policy and illustrate that NOMA is more favorable in the case of larger packet sizes.</description></item><item><title>To DASH, or Not to DASH? Optimal Video Bitrate Selection and Edge Network Caching in MEC-Empowered Slice-Enabled Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10305275</link><description>An increasing body of works highlight that Dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH) can negatively impact the user Quality of Experience (QoE) in cache-enabled networks. Besides, network-agnostic DASH cannot fully harness the potential of slice-enabled 5G and Beyond networks, which can promise minimum rate performance for the i) MEC-empowered cellular base station (BS) to user link, and ii) content delivery network (CDN) to MEC-empowered BS link. In this paper, we show that network-agnostic DASH is incompatible with MEC-empowered edge network caching and network slicing in next generation mobile data networks. Accordingly, we propose joint video bitrate selection and edge network caching when specific rate and cache size guarantees can be provided along the end-to-end content delivery path. By formulating the aforementioned problem as a dynamic program (DP), we present an exhaustive (brute-force) search algorithm to optimally solve it and derive an exact algorithm of polynomial time to avoid unnecessary recalculations of previously visited solution branches. Through extensive experimental results we assess the performance of the proposed algorithm and compare it against other solutions, aiming to draw valuable insights for algorithmic design tailored to MEC-empowered slice-enabled mobile data networks.</description></item><item><title>Computation Bits Maximization for IRS-Aided Mobile-Edge Computing Networks With Phase Errors and Transceiver Hardware Impairments</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10306290</link><description>Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a hopeful technique to improve the computation offloading efficiency for mobile-edge computing (MEC) networks. However, the phase errors (PEs) of IRS and transceiver hardware impairments (THIs) will greatly degrade the performance of IRS-assisted MEC networks. To overcome this bottleneck, this paper first investigates the computation bits maximization problem for IRS-assisted MEC networks with PEs, where multiple Internet of Things (IoT) devices can offload their computation tasks to access points with the aid of IRS. By exploiting the block coordinate descent method, we design a multi-block optimization algorithm to tackle the non-convex problem. In particular, the optimal IRS phase shift, time allocation, transmit power and local computing frequencies of IoT devices are derived in closed-form expressions. Moreover, we further study the joint impact of PEs and THIs on the total computation bits of considered systems, where same methods in the scenario with PEs are used to obtain the optimal IRS phase shift and local computing frequencies of IoT devices, while an approximation algorithm and the variable substitution method are used to acquire the optimal transmit power and time allocation strategy. Finally, numerical results validate that our proposed methods can significantly outperform benchmark methods in terms of total computation bits.</description></item><item><title>ESIA: An Efficient and Stable Identity Authentication for Internet of Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10310120</link><description>Decentralized, tamper-proof blockchain is regarded as a solution to a challenging authentication issue in the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs). However, the consensus time and communication overhead of blockchain increase significantly as the number of vehicles connected to the blockchain. To address this issue, vehicular fog computing has been introduced to improve efficiency. However, existing studies ignore several key factors such as the number of vehicles in the fog computing system, which can impact the consensus communication overhead. Meanwhile, there is no comprehensive study on the stability of vehicular fog composition. The vehicle movement will lead to dynamic changes in fog. If the composition of vehicular fog is unstable, the blockchain formed by this fog computing system will be unstable, which can affect the consensus efficiency. With the above considerations, we propose an efficient and stable identity authentication (ESIA) empowered by hierarchical blockchain and fog computing. By grouping vehicles efficiently, ESIA has low communication complexity and achieves high stability. Moreover, to enhance the consensus security of the hierarchical blockchain, the consensus process is from the bottom layer to the up layer (bottom-up), which we call B2UHChain. Through theoretical analysis and simulation verification, our scheme achieves the design goals of high efficiency and stability while significantly improving the IoV scalability to the power of 1.5 (^1.5) under similar security to a single-layer blockchain. In addition, ESIA has less communication and computation overhead, lower latency, and higher throughput than other baseline authentication schemes.</description></item><item><title>Edge Computing Task Offloading Optimization for a UAV-Assisted Internet of Vehicles via Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10314017</link><description>In the context of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted vehicular networking system, more network factors need to be considered to ensure the safe operation of connected vehicles. A large volume of delay-sensitive and computationally demanding tasks necessitate offloading to UAVs or roadside units for processing. And the efficient allocation of various network resources of vehicles, UAVs, and roadside units under constrained conditions determines the efficiency of task offloading. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated its efficacy as an experienced approach for solving such problems. In this article, we delve into the utilization of deep reinforcement learning to design an efficient UAV-assisted vehicular edge computing task offloading strategy. Under the constraints of limited network bandwidth and limited UAV power, the trajectory and the task offloading strategy of the UAV are jointly optimized. The primary objective of our proposed strategy is to achieve a notable reduction in the system delay of the edge computing network. Given the dynamic variability of tasks arrival, we employ a long short-term memory (LSTM) network with the attention mechanism and a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to effectively model the optimization problem as a Markov decision process. This approach can obtain the optimal policy through interactive learning from the UAV and the vehicle environment. The experiment results illustrate that this strategy outperforms other baseline strategies in terms of convergence speed, network delay, and task offloading ratio.</description></item><item><title>Energy-Spectral-Efficient Heterogeneous Cellular Networks: Joint Optimization of Cross-Tier Inter-BS Cooperation and BS Deployment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315021</link><description>This paper enhances the energy/spectral utilization of a large-scale coordinated multi-point (CoMP) enabled two-tier heterogeneous cellular network (HCN) by the joint optimization of the associated cross-tier inter-BS cooperation and BS deployment, where a pair of BSs in different tiers can cooperate to transmit desired signals to the user equipment (UE) supported. We derive the energy-spectral efficiency (ESE) for the large-scale CoMP-enhanced two-tier HCN. Our ESE modeling distinctively includes: 1) The ESE's dependence on the activation degree of cross-tier inter-BS cooperation is quantified, which can be flexibly harnessed for transforming the grave interference-limited situation of the tier-edge UEs into harmonious CoMP-support. 2) Both the BS densities in these two tiers and the large-scale user-behaviors (LSUBs) are explicitly integrated into our ESE modeling. Under this tractable ESE model, we first optimize the network's ESE by choosing a suitable cooperation activation degree based on a specific cellular scenario, whilst satisfying the UE's outage constraint. We continue by formulating the joint optimization problem of the cooperation activation degree and of the BS density for maximizing the ESE, while varying the LSUBs. Our simulation results confirm the accuracy of our ESE modeling and quantify the impact of network parameters on the achievable ESE. We demonstrate that the proposed joint optimization strategy has a significantly higher ESE than its optimization counterpart only considering the cooperation activation degree. Our solution may be expected to pave the way for improving the resource efficiency of large-scale dense HCNs.</description></item><item><title>A Unified Framework for Multi-Hop Wireless Relaying With Hardware Impairments</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10339876</link><description>Relaying increases the coverage area and reliability of wireless communications systems by mitigating the fading effect on the received signal. Most technical contributions in the context of these systems assume ideal hardware (ID) by neglecting the non-idealities of the transceivers, which include phase noise, in-phase/quadrature mismatch and high power amplifier nonlinearities. These non-idealities create distortion on the received signal by causing variations in the phase and attenuating the amplitude. The resulting deterioration of the performance of wireless communication systems is further magnified as the frequency of transmission increases. In this paper, we investigate the aggregate impact of hardware impairments (HI) on the general multi-hop relay system using amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying techniques over a general $\bf H$-fading model. $\bf H$-fading model includes free space optics, radio frequency, millimeter wave, Terahertz, and underwater fading models. Closed-form expressions of outage probability, bit error probability and ergodic capacity are derived in terms of $\bf H$-functions. Following an asymptotic analysis at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), practical optimization problems have been formulated with the objective of finding the optimal level of HI subject to the limitation on the total HI level. The analytical solution has been derived for the Nakagami-$m$ fading channel which is a special case of $\bf H$-fading for AF and DF relaying techniques. The overall instantaneous signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio has been demonstrated to reach a ceiling at high SNRs which has a reciprocal proportion to the HI level of all hops' transceivers on the contrary to the ID.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Task Offloading in Distributed VEC Networks: An Exploration and Exploitation Assisted Contract-Theoretic Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10319112</link><description>In vehicular edge computing (VEC) networks, task offloading is a prospective approach to alleviate the computing burden of vehicles. Most works studied task offloading in centralized scenarios, where centralized infrastructures host the offloading and force vehicles into providing required private information. However, considering the high costs of infrastructure deployment, distributed scenarios without infrastructures are more practical. This paper focuses on a distributed VEC network, where a task vehicle (TaV) offloads tasks to surrounding vehicles (SuVs) with energy harvesting capabilities. In this context, SuVs are self-interested, and how to motivate self-interested vehicles to process offloaded tasks and provide the required information is challenging. To tackle these issues, an exploration and exploitation assisted contract-theoretic (EEACT) scheme is developed, where each SuV is recruited to participate in task offloading, and to accept the contract item designed for its type. The SuV type is related with the SuV's private information, and is partially monotonic. As a result, traditional simplification methods of incentive compatible (IC) and individual rational (IR) constraints in contract theory are not applicable. To address this problem, novel simplification methods are proposed and proved theoretically. Based on the contract design, the TaV determines the task offloading decisions by minimizing the processing cost of tasks, including the computation delay and the energy consumption. A low-complexity algorithm based on SuV types is proposed to obtain the approximately optimal offloading strategy. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme over the baseline schemes in terms of optimality.</description></item><item><title>AoI-Aware Joint Scheduling and Power Allocation in Intelligent Transportation System: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10321738</link><description>In Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), information freshness is a crucial indicator for monitoring road traffic, which is measured by Age of Information (AoI). This paper studies the problem of vehicle data packet scheduling and power allocation for AoI minimization in a Manhattan grid Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) network. The challenge of the problem originates from the dynamic wireless environment and different AoI requirements of vehicles. To solve the above problems, a single-agent Markov Decision Process (MDP) is modeled. And we propose a Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (D3QN)-based Scheduling and Power Allocation Method (SPAM). The D3QN agent is devoted to minimizing the AoI of each vehicle. In addition, Priority Experience Replay (PER) technology is developed to solve the difficulty of obtaining high-value learning experiences. The simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms baseline D3QN approaches in average AoI by 22.6%.</description></item><item><title>Joint Task Offloading Scheduling and Resource Allocation in Air&#8211;Ground Cooperation UAV-Enabled Mobile Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10329934</link><description>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are heavily used in disaster or emergency scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the joint problem of task offloading, task scheduling, transmission power and computing resources allocation, and optimization of UAV deployment location for UAV-enabled Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), considering and highlighting the order of execution and transmission of different tasks. The corresponding optimization problem, which is a non-convex mixed-integer optimization problem, is formulated. In oder to solve this problem, the formulated problem is decomposed into three Sub-Problems (SP), and an iterative method based on Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) is proposed. Given the UAV location and resource allocation, the 1-st SP (SP1) of task offloading scheduling optimization is solved by greedy strategy optimization methods. Given the task offloading decision, task scheduling order, and resource allocation, the 2-nd SP (SP2) of optimizing the deployment location of UAV is solved by Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) optimization methods. Given the task offloading decision, task scheduling order, and UAV location, the 3-rd SP (SP3) of transmission and computing resources allocating is solved by convex optimization methods. Simulation results show that our proposed method can significantly reduce energy consumption compared to the benchmark schemes.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Resource Allocation for Mobile Edge Computing in Internet of Vehicles: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10330753</link><description>Mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged in recent years as an effective solution to the challenge of limited vehicle resources in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), especially for computation-intensive vehicle tasks. This paper investigates a multi-user MEC system with an active task model in high-dynamic IoV scenarios. To improve the MEC performance regarding system capacity, task service delay, and energy consumption, we design an adaptive joint resource allocation scheme based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which includes uplink, computing, and downlink resource allocation. Further, a multi-actor parallel twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (MAPTD3) algorithm is devised to jointly and adaptively optimize these strategies during each time slot. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive joint resource allocation scheme improves system performance significantly while satisfying task delay and system resource constraints. In addition, the space complexity of the designed optimization algorithm is lower than that of conventional DRL algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Joint Content Update and Transmission Resource Allocation for Energy-Efficient Edge Caching of High Definition Map</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10333984</link><description>Caching the high definition map (HDM) on the edge network can significantly alleviate energy consumption of the roadside sensors frequently conducting the operators of the traffic content updating and transmission, and such operators have also an important impact on the freshness of the received content at each vehicle. This paper aims to minimize the energy consumption of the roadside sensors and satisfy the requirement of vehicles for the HDM content freshness by jointly scheduling the edge content updating and the downlink transmission resource allocation of the Road Side Unit (RSU). To this end, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based algorithm, namely the prioritized double deep R-Learning Networking (PRD-DRN). Under this PRD-DRN algorithm, the content update and transmission resource allocation are modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We take full advantage of deep R-learning and prioritized experience sampling to obtain the optimal decision, which achieves the minimization of the long-term average cost related to the content freshness and energy consumption. Extensive simulation results are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our proposed PRD-DRN algorithm, and also to illustrate the advantage of our algorithm on improving the content freshness and energy consumption compared with the baseline policies.</description></item><item><title>Beam Pattern and Reflection Pattern Design for Channel Estimation in RIS-Assisted mmWave MIMO Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10243635</link><description>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a revolutionary technology that can be applied in millimeter wave (mmWave) communications to reduce the high power consumption and propagation loss. However, channel estimation (CE) is challenging due to the large number of passive RIS elements without signal processing abilities. In this paper, the uplink CE for RIS-assisted mmWave multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems is formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem in a novel way. Then, the beam pattern and reflection pattern design based on the compressed sensing (CS) theory are proposed to guarantee the efficient CE. Simulation results demonstrate that, for various CS-based CE algorithms, the proposed patterns can reduce more than 50% pilot overhead at 0 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while maintaining the same accuracy of CE compared with the existing patterns.</description></item><item><title>Preambles Based on Power-Split-Ratio for GFRA Systems With Open-Loop Power Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10310123</link><description>This letter aims to improve the active user detection (AUD) and channel estimation (CE) performance in grant-free random access (GFRA) systems with open-loop power control. In particular, the preamble based on the power-split-ratio (PSR) is designed, where the preamble consists of two sub-preambles generated by multiplying the same sequence with different power coefficients. The ratio of two coefficients is defined as PSR, which can be used to eliminate the effects of uncertain power and detect preamble collisions. Based on the designed preamble, a two-step AUD scheme is proposed to detect the sequence and PSR, followed by the CE scheme. Numerical results show that the proposed PSR-based preamble significantly outperforms existing preambles in GFRA systems with open-loop power control.</description></item><item><title>Intercarrier Interference Mitigation for Communication Compatible OFDM Radar</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10319769</link><description>This paper presents an intercarrier interference (ICI) mitigation method for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) radar. The effects of ICI on radar performance are analyzed according to dynamic range, peak power, and noise floor. To enhance OFDM radar performance, we propose a two-step ICI mitigation method. Coarse compensation partially restores the target's peak power distorted by ICI and estimates actual velocity of each scatterer without ambiguity. Consequently, fine compensation reconstructs the signal from each scatterer as ICI-free signal. The simulation result shows that the proposed method can restore the target's peak power to the level without Doppler shift, and the noise due to ICI effect can be reduced. Since our method is based on OFDM symbols designed for communication systems, it can eliminate ICI effect in OFDM radar without any loss of communication performance, which is preferable for joint radar-communication systems.</description></item><item><title>STAR-RIS Assisted Covert Communications in NOMA Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10306315</link><description>Covert communications assisted by simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems have been explored in this paper. In particular, the access point (AP) transmitter adopts NOMA to serve a down-link covert user and a public user. The minimum detection error probability (DEP) at the warden is derived considering the uncertainty of its background noise, which is used as a covertness constraint. We aim at maximizing the covert rate of the system by jointly optimizing AP's transmit power and passive beamforming of STAR-RIS, under the covertness and quality of service (QoS) constraints. An iterative algorithm is proposed to effectively solve the non-convex optimization problem. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the conventional RIS-based scheme in ensuring system covert performance.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Functional RIS: Signal Modeling and Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10313072</link><description>In this paper, a multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surface (MF-RIS) assisted non-orthogonal multiple access multiuser network is investigated. In contrast to existing studies assuming that the amplitude and phase shift coefficients of the refraction and reflection can be adjusted independently, we propose a practical model for the MF-RIS, where the refraction and reflection coefficients are highly coupled. Then, we investigate a sum-rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and MF-RIS coefficients, subject to the coupled amplitude and phase shift constraints. To address the formulated non-convex problem, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm based on the fractional programming theory. Finally, numerical results show that: 1) The coupled MF-RIS scheme is superior to the simultaneous transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS) and single-functional RIS (SF-RIS) schemes under the same power budget; 2) The performance gap between the ideal MF-RIS and coupled MF-RIS decreases with the increase of the total power budget.</description></item><item><title>Multiuser Beamforming for Partially-Connected Millimeter Wave Massive MIMO</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10314771</link><description>Multiuser beamforming is considered for partially-connected millimeter wave massive MIMO systems. Based on perfect channel state information (CSI), a low-complexity hybrid beamforming scheme that decouples the analog beamformer and the digital beamformer is proposed to maximize the sum-rate. The analog beamformer design is modeled as a phase alignment problem to harvest the array gain. Given the analog beamformer, the digital beamformer is designed by solving a weighted minimum mean squared error problem. Then based on imperfect CSI, an analog-only beamformer design scheme is proposed, where the design problem aims at maximizing the desired signal power on the current user and minimizing the power on the other users to mitigate the multiuser interference. The original problem is then transformed into a series of independent beam nulling subproblems, where an efficient iterative algorithm using the majorization&#8211;minimization framework is proposed to solve the subproblems. Simulation results show that, under perfect CSI, the proposed scheme achieves almost the same sum-rate performance as the existing schemes but with lower computational complexity; and under imperfect CSI, the proposed analog-only beamforming design scheme can effectively mitigate the multiuser interference.</description></item><item><title>GNN-Based Meta-Learning Approach for Adaptive Power Control in Dynamic D2D Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10319409</link><description>This article proposes a deep learning-based power control method for maximizing the sum rate subject to rate requirements in the interference-limited device-to-device (D2D) communications. Based on the dynamic nature of D2D communications, we consider the environment where system parameters, such as the number of devices, rate requirements, and deployment area, unpredictably change over time. To deal with the low adaptability and scalability issues of the conventional deep learning-based approaches in dynamic environments, we develop an environment-adaptive power control method by leveraging graph neural network (GNN) architecture and meta-learning approach. In the developed method, we design the node feature and state update rule for GNN by taking into account the characteristics of power optimization problem and meta-train model by treating some past environments as meta-tasks. Simulation results demonstrate that the developed method outperforms the conventional GNN-based power control methods in terms of the average sum-throughput achievement ratio and adaptation speed to test environments.</description></item><item><title>Statistical Age-of-Information Optimization for Status Update Over Multi-State Fading Channels</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10328835</link><description>Age of information (AoI) is a powerful metric to evaluate the freshness of information, where minimization of average statistics, such as the average AoI and average peak AoI, currently prevails in guiding freshness optimization for related applications. Although minimizing the statistics does improve the received information's freshness for status update systems in the sense of average, the time-varying fading characteristics of wireless channels often cause uncertain yet frequent age violations. The recently-proposed statistical AoI metric can better characterize more features of AoI dynamics, which evaluates the achievable minimum peak AoI under the certain constraint on age violation probability. In this paper, we study the statistical AoI minimization problem for status update systems over multi-state fading channels, which can effectively upper-bound the AoI violation probability but introduce the prohibitively-high computing complexity. To resolve this issue, we tackle the problem with a two-fold approach. For a small AoI exponent, the problem is approximated via a fractional programming problem. For a large AoI exponent, the problem is converted to a convex problem. Solving the two problems respectively, we derive the near-optimal sampling interval for diverse status update systems. Insightful observations are obtained on how sampling interval shall be tuned as a decreasing function of channel state information (CSI). Surprisingly, for the extremely stringent AoI requirement, the sampling interval converges to a constant regardless of CSI's variation. Numerical results verify effectiveness as well as superiority of our proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>On an Intelligent Task Offloading Model to Jointly Optimize Latency and Energy for Electric Connected Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10319109</link><description>With modern Electric Connected Vehicles (ECVs) becoming more intelligent and entertaining, the Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) servers deployed near the Road Side Units (RSUs) have been expected to not only improve the computing performance, but also alleviate the ECVs' battery burden. However, the uneven spatial and temporal distribution of vehicle arrivals cause that the MEC servers in busy areas are overloaded, which results in degraded computation performance and limited energy alleviation for ECVs. In this paper, we consider the task distribution among nearby MEC servers and propose a novel partial offloading strategy where multiple blocks of the tasks are cooperatively processed by MEC servers in the vehicles' moving directions. After formulating the mathematical model to jointly optimize the computing latency and energy consumption of ECVs, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based task partial offloading strategy is proposed and a Deep Q-Network (DQN) is adopted to make the offloading decision. Simulation results illustrate the significant alleviation of energy consumption and improvement of computation performance compared with conventional methods.</description></item><item><title>Review of Mono- and Bifacial Photovoltaic Technologies: A Comparative Study</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10464335</link><description>This article reviews the recent works on bifacial and monofacial photovoltaic (PV) technologies. Furthermore, the effectiveness of bifacial PV technologies over that of monofacial technologies is examined. Unlike monofacial PVs, bifacial PVs have light sensitivity on both the front as well as the rear surface and, therefore, have higher PV yield compared to monofacial PVs. However, because of higher energy output, thermal and electrical behavior are critical in bifacial PV, which needs to be optimized for bifacial PV cells to maintain the optimum cell efficiency. Studies show that bifacial thin-film Si-heterojunction PV cells have the maximum laboratory efficiency. Surface area, the fraction of light reflected, geographical location, economy, and efficiency are key contributing factors that govern the selection of bifacial PV systems. The dual use of land gives an edge to bifacial PV systems over monofacials. The dual use of land cases, such as agri-PVs with bifacial, vertical bifacial, and floating-PVs with bifacial, are unique systems where monofacial PV modules are less effective.</description></item><item><title>Coupled Process/Device Modeling and Point Defect Engineering of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 Solar Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10460087</link><description>Point defects directly impact solar cell device performance by limiting the carrier lifetime.

Furthermore, the LPCs operate as highly efficient SCs. Thus, the proposed dual-wavelength (DW) LPCs fulfill the functions required for LPCs used for optical wireless power transmission to driving electric vehicles; the solar-cell function charges the secondary batteries anywhere during daytime. I designed the electronic band structures of the DW-LPCs and calculated the limiting conversion efficiencies, revealing that the DW-LPCs equipped with the QRs potentially yield high conversion efficiencies for each light competitive with those of the conventional single-function devices dedicated. However, new IB materials must be developed to realize the high efficiency, because the required electronic band structures are significantly different from those of previously reported IB-SC materials.</description></item><item><title>TCAD Modeling and Simulation of Dark Current-Voltage Characteristics in High-Periodicity InGaN/GaN Multiple-Quantum-Wells (MQWs) Solar Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10473022</link><description>Gallium nitride (GaN) based high periodicity indium/GaN multiple quantum wells solar cells have recently been proposed for different applications: from operation in harsh environments, like space applications, to their use in concentrator solar harvesting system and wireless power transfer system. In this article, we extensively investigate the mechanisms, which influence the in-dark current-voltage characteristics of these device under no excitation by means of experimental measurements and numerical simulations performed with the technology computer-aided design (TCAD) Sentaurus suite from Synopsys. Two different nonlocal models are introduced: the first one considers intrabarrier tunneling, which was found to be the dominant conduction mechanism for voltages above the main diode turn-on; the second model considers trap-assisted tunneling, implemented through traps uniformly distributed in space and energy, to reproduce the current flow in the sub turn-on region. A good matching is obtained between the experimental and simulated electrical characteristics, by considering these nonlocal models in addition to the thermionic escape.</description></item><item><title>Evaluation and Enhancement of Laser Power Transfer Efficiency in the Presence of Atmospheric Turbulence</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10473035</link><description>Laser-based wireless power transfer (LWPT) technology has attracted more and more attention in the field of long-range wireless power transfer (WPT). In practical applications, the light intensity distribution of the laser beam at the receiving end has a crucial impact on the efficiency of the power transfer system. In this article, the optimization of photovoltaic (PV) array configuration is explored in an atmospheric turbulent environment under the irradiation of Gaussian (GS) and flat-top (FT) laser beams. By comparing the photoelectric conversion efficiency of 3&#215;3 PV arrays under the irradiation of GS beams and three different orders of FT beams, we conducted a comprehensive investigation on the impact of GS beam and FT beams as light sources on the performance output of PV arrays. We develop a model of atmospheric turbulence and analyze its effects on laser power transmission. Further numerical simulation was performed to evaluate the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the two laser beams when irradiated by the PV array after experiencing atmospheric turbulence. The results indicate that the FT beam exhibits superior characteristics compared to the GS beam in most cases. FT beams with orders 2, 5, and 10 exhibit an over 8% increase in power compared to a GS beam upon direct irradiation. After passing through weak turbulence for a distance of 2 km, the power enhancement exceeds 9% for all three FT beams. These findings highlight the potential advantages of FT beams in LWPT and offer new insights into the design and optimization of long-range WPT systems.</description></item><item><title>Simultaneous Photovoltaic Power Generation and Electroluminescence in Three-Terminal Tandem Solar Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478732</link><description>Optical wireless power transmission (OWPT) using 2-terminal single-junction solar cells or light-emitting diodes is limited because it cannot generate photovoltaic power while transmitting light signals.

In order to detect defective photovoltaic cells, several monitoring techniques, such as lock-in thermography, have been widely used alongside some analytical methods that avoid subjectivity. This article proposes a method with low computational cost that provides a simple and easily implementable way to quantifiably discern if a photovoltaic cell is defective or not. A two-dimensional Gaussian fit is applied to images generated by fast Fourier transform and principal component analysis algorithms on thermographic data from lock-in thermography tests. The considered coefficient of determination ${R}^2$ was found to be a good measure of fitting quality. Additionally, the method highlighted the potential of its application on first principal component, with ${R}^2$ between 0.944 and 0.986, and magnitude images, with ${R}^2$ between 0.965 and 0.985, in order to identify and distinguish nondefective cells from defective ones.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Inclination and Azimuth Angles of a Photovoltaic Module With Load Patterns for Improved Power System Stability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10488860</link><description>Globally, large-scale photovoltaic (PV) systems are being installed to achieve maximum power generation efficiency. However, this often results in severe power fluctuations, impacting the stability of the power system. To enhance the power system stability, it is crucial to effectively distribute the times of maximum power output. This can be achieved by making changes to the inclination angle and azimuth of PV modules at power plants. The modeling results indicate a prediction error of 3.65% relative to the actual measurements. To assess system stability based on each installation method, new concepts called demand gradient (DG) and demand gradient average (DGA) were introduced and analyzed using the load pattern in Metropolitan Seoul. The electricity usage was categorized into four divisions: residential (dwelling), public, service, and manufacturing. The analysis revealed that optimal inclination angles for the dwelling, public, service, and manufacturing sectors were 60&#176;, 30&#176;, 30&#176;, and 15&#176;, respectively. As for installation azimuths, the optimal values were 0&#176;, 80&#176;, 160&#176;, and 230&#176;, respectively. When both the inclination angle and azimuth were varied simultaneously, their optimal installation methods included inclination angles of 60&#176;, 60&#176;, 35&#176;, and 50&#176;, and azimuths of 330&#176;, 210&#176;, 230&#176;, and 190&#176; for the dwelling, public, service, and manufacturing sectors, respectively. Among the various scenarios, the most significant improvement in grid stability was observed in the existing south-facing installation of DGA in the dwelling sector, demonstrating a remarkable 77% reduction from 0.1 to 0.057.</description></item><item><title>A Comprehensive Shade Resilient Approach for Enhanced PV Array Performance Under Irradiance Mismatch Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10474027</link><description>This article proposes a comprehensive shade-resilient approach to enhance the overall productivity of the two most widely used photovoltaic (PV) configurations: total-cross-tied (TCT) and series-parallel (SP), under irradiance mismatch conditions (IMCs). The proposed generalized panel rearrangement strategy (GPRS) for TCT and SP-GPRS for SP arrays is applicable to arrays of any dimensions, including PV arrays with odd, even, and mixed numbers of rows and columns. An extensive performance evaluation is conducted, comparing the proposed approach with various contemporary reconfiguration methods, using both simulation and hardware setups. In the simulation analysis, a 9 &#215; 9 PV array is exposed to four unique shading cases. Comparative performance assessment, utilizing prominent performance indices, demonstrates that the proposed GPRS reduces mismatch loss (ML) by up to 75.4% compared to a TCT PV array of comparable dimensions. Additionally, SP-GPRS yields up to 35.6% lower ML than the SP arrangement. Efficiency enhancements of up to 15.18% and 10.03% are achieved by optimizing the module positions in a 9 &#215; 9 PV array within the TCT and SP frameworks using the proposed GPRS and SP-GPRS, respectively. Experimental implementation of the proposed approach reveals significant power augmentation, with improvements of up to 31% and 16.1% for TCT and SP arrangements, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Power Prediction of PV Modules Contaminated by Bird Droppings via an Image Thresholding Process</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443925</link><description>Environmental factors that influence marine photovoltaic (PV) systems differ considerably from those affecting overland PV systems. The bird dropping, which is one of them, is a main cause of marine PV power reduction. The power prediction of a PV module contaminated by bird droppings is hard because light could pass through the bird dropping depending on the thickness of it unlike hard shading condition. This article shows differences between a bird-dropping shading and hard shading of the contaminated modules, and suggests a prediction model considering a transmittance of a bird dropping using image processing (IP). First, the shading rate (SR), which is the PV module surface ratio covered by bird droppings, is calculated using IP technologies. The accuracy of the SR is verified through an experiment creating artificial hard shading on the module using black masking tape. It has an error rate of 3% compared to our targeted benchmark SRs. Subsequently, an equivalent step methodology, which combines IV curves from individual cells to yield an IV curve for the entire PV module, was adopted to predict the power. The accuracy of this methodology is confirmed, and it showed a 5% error. However, in the case of real bird-dropping shades, discrepancies up to 15% are observed. In this article, the light penetration through bird droppings by a transmittance function was considered to predict the output of modules contaminated by the bird droppings. Errors fluctuate between 1%&#8211;20% based on the quantification of light interferences.</description></item><item><title>Layer-Sensitive Neural Processing Architecture for Error-Tolerant Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10458963</link><description>Neural network (NN) operation has high requirements for storage resources and parallel computing, which bring huge challenges to the deployment of NNs in Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices.

The innovative  $LC$ -QNUTL latch is primarily composed of three soft-error-immune (SEI) static random-access memory (SRAM) cells and a triple-level C-element (CE) unit, which includes five two-input CE and a clock-gating (CG)-based two-input CE. The SEI SRAM cell utilizes polarity hardening technology and source-isolation technology, significantly reducing the number of sensitive nodes and enhancing the latch&#8217;s stability. By using the high-speed transmission gate (TG) technology and stacked structures, the proposed latch offers minimal overhead in terms of delay and power consumption, yielding an improved power delay area product (PDAP). When compared to contemporary quadruple node upset (QNU)-tolerant latch designs (including HLMR, 4NUHL, and LDAVPM), the new design offers substantial improvements&#8212;29.53% less delay, 80.09% reduced power consumption, 58.52% smaller silicon area, and 433.43% improved comprehensive PDAP on average. Furthermore, simulation results demonstrate that the  $LC$ -QNUTL latch exhibits reduced sensitivity to process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations, thus providing superior reliability, which makes it an ideal choice for safety-critical applications.</description></item><item><title>On the Resiliency of Protected Masked S-Boxes Against Template Attack in the Presence of Temperature and Aging Misalignments</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10473706</link><description>Profiling side-channel analysis (SCA) attacks have received a lot of attention in the recent years. To perpetrate these attacks, the adversary creates a profile of a sensitive device at her disposal, and uses it to model a target device with a similar implementation to extract its key. Template attacks are recognized to be the most powerful profiling attacks when the measurement noise is Gaussian. To tackle SCA attacks, different countermeasures have been proposed in the literature, among which masking schemes have received the utmost attention. By adding randomness to the circuit, masking schemes prevent the adversary from relating the power consumption to the evaluated data, thus making the attack more difficult. In this article, we study the protection provided by several masking schemes against template attacks. More precisely, we investigate how the success of the template attack is changed when there is a misalignment between the target and profiling devices in terms of temperature and process variations. As another innovative analysis angle, we extensively study the impact of device aging on the template attack and demonstrate quantitatively how aging misalignments in side-channel traces, between the profiling and the target devices, do hinder the attack. The main objective of this study is to get accurate and numerous results allowing the designer to compare different implementations of masking and accordingly choose one which corresponds to the best compromise among complexity, security, and sensitivity to temperature and aging. We target the S-Box module of the unprotected PRESENT cipher along with its five masking variants including global lookup table (GLUT), rotating S-Box masking (referred to as RSM-LOG hereafter), RSM with read-only memory (RSM-ROM), Ishai-Sahai&#8211;Wagner masking (ISW), and threshold implementation (TI). The unprotected circuit gets impacted by such aging misalignments with  $\approx 12.5$ % increase in the number of traces needed to reach 80% success rate (SR) in the course of 20 weeks of aging at 105 &#176;C. Such increase is 23.3%, 37.19%, and 38.24% for ISW, GLUT, and RSM-LOG, respectively. For RSM-ROM such increase is 193.37% for ten weeks of aging. Interestingly, TI is not much affected by aging in this regard.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Power 0.68-Gbps Data Communication System for Capacitive Digital Isolator With 1.9-ns Propagation Delay</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10374088</link><description>In this brief, we present a data communication system for the capacitive digital isolator capable of sustaining a breakdown voltage of 1.27 kVrms. A pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) strategy is implemented as a signal transmission scheme for capacitive coupling for the first time. It enables a data rate of 0.68 Gbps using a smaller number of ON-chip isolation elements and physical links compared with other circuits. In addition, this scheme allows our design to work at low-frequency operations without the need of additional large-area capacitors. Moreover, a propagation delay of 1.9 ns has been measured with a total jitter (TJ) of 333 ps, and a 46.8-pJ/bit energy consumption at 1 Mbps is obtained. The achieved performance ensures the design integration capability with a wide range of power control applications, particularly industrial sensor interfaces.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Digital-Controlled Current-Mode Single-Inductor-Multiple-Output Buck Converter With Individual Output Overload Protection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10374387</link><description>This brief presents an innovative digital current-mode control technique for single-inductor multiple-output (SIMO) buck converters in continuous-conduction mode. Additionally, it first introduces an overcurrent protection (OCP) method for each output channel of the SIMO converter. As a supplement, since previous research could not or could only protect the input, the OCP proposed in this brief makes SIMO more valuable for industrial applications. The proposed approach effectively reduces cross-regulation by distributing currents shared by the inductor among all branches in a reasonable manner. Moreover, the OCP control can detect overloads in any branch and limit the peak current without affecting other branches. Simulation results demonstrate that the cross-regulation between each channel for overcurrent protection is less than 100 mV, even during an overload.</description></item><item><title>A Wideband Input Buffer Based on Cascade Complementary Source Follower</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10399378</link><description>A highly linear input buffer is crucial for high-speed and high-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) since it isolates the kickback noise and package inductance. Several important factors affecting the linearity of the input buffer are analyzed in this brief, and a wideband input buffer with high linearity based on cascade complementary source follower (CCSF) is proposed. This cascaded input buffer is composed of a pMOS source follower (PSF) and an nMOS source follower (NSF). Compensation capacitor, assisted operational amplifier (opamp), bootstrapped-capacitor level-shifting circuit, current amplifier, and optimization strategies are utilized to extend the bandwidth and reduce distortion. Designed in a 65-nm CMOS, the CCSF input buffer achieves the spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) and a signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) of 76.6 and 58.1 dB with 1.9-GHz input frequency, respectively.

This brief demonstrates a DPWM that utilizes a single clock and a Matrix shift array, allowing it to be scaled to any frequency and reducing the effects of clock skew. It has a clock gating technique that selects a specific row of DFFs based on the required % duty cycle. The DPWM design has a dead time generator to prevent shoot-throughs. The DPWM has been fabricated using UMC 180-nm CMOS process. The performance and functionality of the DPWM have been verified through the measured comparisons of % duty ratio, dead time ( $T_{dt}$ ), and output frequency ( $f_{\text {out}}$ ) at input clock frequency ( $f_{\text {clk}_{\text {in}}}$ ) equal to 10 $\sim $ 100 MHz. The DPWM design has a maximum % duty ratio of 90.6%,  $T_{dt}$  = 1.8 ns, and  $f_{\text {out}}$  = 6.25 MHz with 3.4-mW power consumption at  $f_{\text {clk}_{\text {in}}}$  = 100 MHz.</description></item><item><title>A 28 nm CMOS Dual-Band Concurrent WLAN and Narrow Band Transmitter With On-Chip Feedforward TX-to-TX Interference Cancellation Path for Low Antenna-to-Antenna Isolation in IoT Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10412084</link><description>A dual-band, concurrent 2.4G wireless local-area network (WLAN) and 2.4G narrow band (NB) transmitter (TX) with on-chip feedforward TX-to-TX interference cancellation path for low antenna-to-antenna isolation in internet of things (IoT) devices is proposed. The on-chip cancellation path generates a replica signal of the same magnitude but 180&#176; out-of-phase with respect to the &#8220;aggressor&#8221; TX signal appearing at the &#8220;victim&#8221; TX output. An on-chip third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD3) calibration engine carries out the cancellation calibration across all channel combinations in NB and WLAN using an over-the-air antenna-to-antenna channel, and the measured IMD3 product is reduced by 25 dB. Additionally, the maximum output power during concurrent transmission, while meeting the FCC out-of-band emission specification, improves from 10 to 17 dBm across all WLAN channels in a certified FCC out-of-band emission test. With this proposed architecture, the issue of TX-to-TX interference in multiradio coexistence is finally addressed, opening the door to future high-power concurrent multiband TXs in reconfigurable IoT devices.</description></item><item><title>A Broadband Four-Way Parallel&#8211;Series Doherty Power Amplifier for 5G Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10335684</link><description>This article presents a four-way hybrid parallel&#8211;series Doherty power amplifier (PA) architecture that supports broadband operation and deep power back-off (PBO) efficiency enhancement for next-generation wireless communication. Most existing load modulation PAs are limited in bandwidth due to the large impedance transformation ratios (ITRs) needed for load-pull matching at deep PBO. The proposed technique achieves wide carrier bandwidth by exploiting different frequency-dependent active load modulations of the parallel/series Doherty combiners and PA path biasing reconfiguration, while the deep PBO efficiency enhancement is realized by the optimum turn-on sequences of the four PA paths. The behavior of the implemented PA load modulation network is mathematically described at different PBO levels corresponding to the output power levels at which each efficiency enhancement occurs. As a proof-of-concept design, a 26&#8211;40-GHz PA is implemented in the GlobalFoundries 45-nm CMOS SOI process. The PA measures 22.5&#8211;23.9-dBm OP textsubscript 1dB, 26.2%&#8211;38.2% PAE textsubscript OP1dB, 18.1%&#8211;34.5% PAE textsubscript 6dB PBO, and 10.7%&#8211;22.1% PAE textsubscript 12dB PBO. Note that the PBO levels are referenced from OP textsubscript 1dB. Compared to a normalized ideal class-B PA, this design achieves 1.3&#8211;1.8 $\times $  power-added efficiency (PAE) boost at 6-dB PBO and 1.6&#8211;2.3 $\times $  boost at 12-dB PBO. With a 100-MHz fifth-generation (5G) new radio (NR) frequency range 2 (FR2) 1-CC 64-QAM signal, this PA achieves 9.26&#8211;16.9-dBm average output power and 9.9%&#8211;25.5% average PAE at an rms error vector magnitude (EVM) of -25 dB for 26&#8211;40 GHz. With a 1-CC 400-MHz 16-QAM signal, the PA achieves 12.95&#8211;17.4-dBm average output power and 12.5%&#8211;27% average PAE at an rms EVM of -20 dB for 26&#8211;40 GHz.</description></item><item><title>A Band-Shifting Millimeter-Wave T/R Front-End Using Inductance-Mutation Transformer Technique for Multiband Phased-Array Transceivers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10415461</link><description>This article introduces a band-shifting transmit/receive (T/R) front-end (FE) using the inductance-mutation technique for multiband phased-array transceivers. The proposed inductance-mutation transformer technique enables variable inductances and features insignificant performance deterioration during the wideband frequency shift, compared to the typical capacitance-based frequency shift method. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique, a band-shifting T/R FE prototype is designed and fabricated in a standard 28 nm bulk CMOS process. The T/R FE circuit contains a differential power amplifier (PA) with a cascade output stage, a two-stage cascade low noise amplifier (LNA), and a dual-resonance T/R switch. Both the PA and LNA employ the proposed inductance-mutation technique in the interstage matching network. The compact dual-resonance T/R switch at the antenna interface is embedded to support the wideband time-division uplink/downlink. It is demonstrated in the measurement results that the 3-dB operation band of the FE can be shifted between a low-frequency (LF) band of 24.1&#8211;38.8 GHz and a high-frequency (HF) band of 35.4&#8211;43.5 GHz for the transmitter (TX) mode, and shifted between 23.9&#8211;35.3 and 29.2&#8211;43.7 GHz for the receiver (RX) mode. Meanwhile, the PA achieves the measured peak gain of 19.1/17.2 dB and the measured OP1dB of 17.8/15.0 dBm for the LF/HF bands, and the LNA in the LF/HF bands has the peak gain of 21.3/18.3 dB and the minimum noise figure of 5.1/5.8 dB. In the system-level modulation measurement, the TX mode realizes &lt; &#8722;25 dB EVM for 400 Msym/s 64-QAM wireless communication with &gt;9 dBm average output power across the frequency of interest. Combining the LF and HF bands, the proposed T/R FE can cover multiple operating bands of 5G NR, such as n257&#8211;n261. Thanks to the band shift feature, an extra 24-dB image rejection for the HF signals converted from a potential intermediate frequency signal of 10 GHz is provided by the T/R FE.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Noise Dual-Path Self-Interference Cancellation Architecture for Watt-Level TX Power Handling in Simultaneous Transmit and Receive</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10426744</link><description>Mitigating self-interference (SI) is vital for advancing simultaneous transmit and receive (STAR) systems. The noise and linearity of the canceller impose limitations on SI power handling. This article proposes a novel dual-path SI cancelling scheme for high-power SI handling. The proposed approach breaks self-interference cancellation (SIC) tradeoffs between operating frequency, SI power handling, and canceller noise/distortion by using a frequency-translated (FT) SI canceller and an auxiliary FT noise-cancelling (NC) path that cancels the noise/distortion from the primary canceller. This approach can work well for both full-duplex (FD) and frequency-division duplex (FDD) schemes. The 65-nm CMOS implementation achieves ~45-dB SIC for 12-dBm receiver (RX) SI peak power (9-dBm avg.) with only 4-dB noise figure (NF) degradation and 207-mW power consumption at 600 MHz. The SIC approach enables a blocker-1 dB with respect to SI of &gt; 16 dBm ( $8\times $  higher than prior work) while operating from 0.5 to 1.3 GHz. Therefore, this implementation can support watt-level SI power handling with transmitter (TX)&#8211;RX isolation &gt; 15 dB. This is demonstrated through measurements that show 30-dBm TX power handling with 22-dB initial isolation from the circulator.</description></item><item><title>Compact mm-Wave Ultra-Wideband and Low-Noise Phase Alternately Distributed Quasi-Circulators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10423725</link><description>This article presents ultra-wideband and low-noise distributed active quasi-circulators (QCs) fabricated using a 28-nm CMOS process. The proposed active QCs use a differential two-stage distributed amplifier (DA) design, where the electrical length of the input and output transmission lines is 90&#176; at 28 GHz. For the ultra-wideband distributed active QC (UWQC), the differential outputs of the amplifier in the second stage are cross-connected to the differential outputs of the amplifier in the first stage, resulting in ultra-wideband isolation regardless of the frequency. In addition, an interstage inductor is inserted in the amplifiers to maintain the frequency response of the input and output transmission lines identically. For the low-noise distributed active QC (LNQC), the resistive termination at the input transmission line of DA is eliminated by using input-matched amplifiers, resulting in a low antenna (ANT) -to-receiver (RX) noise figure (NF). In addition, the LNQC with the input-matched amplifiers allows a 3-dB higher transmitter (TX)-to-ANT gain compared to conventional distributed QC. Moreover, the transistor size and bias condition of the input-matched amplifiers can be selected to achieve low noise and high power handling capability of the QC within a given tradeoff. The measured results demonstrate that the UWQC achieves 20.5&#8722;35.5-GHz wideband operating bandwidth with TX-to-ANT gain of 4.5 dB, ANT-to-RX insertion loss of 3.6 dB, and &gt;21-dB TX-to-RX isolation, only occupying a die area of 0.07 mm2. The LNQC achieves ANT-to-RX NF of 8.9&#8722;11.1 dB, which is around 10 dB lower than the conventional distributed QC. The measured TX-to-ANT output power 1-dB compression point is 14.3 dBm with a dc power consumption of 28.6 mW, occupying a die area of 0.25 mm2.</description></item><item><title>A 10.8&#8211;14.5-GHz Eight-Phase 12.5%-Duty-Cycle Nonoverlapping LO Generator With Automatic Phase-and-Duty-Cycle Calibration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10439148</link><description>A 10.8&#8211;14.5-GHz eight-phase 12.5%-duty-cycle nonoverlapping LO generator is proposed for 60-GHz eight-path-filtering subsampling receivers.

The proposed topology manipulates time delay by controlling propagation distance in a trombone-like structure formed with two parallel transmission lines periodically connected via switch networks. The proposed phase control exploits only one switched signal transition for all phase states, significantly lowering insertion loss and keeping loss variation small over phase states. A detailed analysis of the design tradeoff between insertion loss and phase resolution is also presented. A prototype 5-bit digital phase shifter that operates with 11.25&#176; steps over 360&#176; tuning range at 140 GHz was implemented using a 45-nm RF silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology and occupies only 0.04  $\text {mm}^{2}$ . On-wafer measurements report an rms phase error of 1.2&#176; without calibration, which is the lowest among published phase shifters in similar frequency bands. The prototype IC achieved the measured insertion loss of 11.5 &#177; 0.8 dB and IP1dB of &gt;12.9 dBm with no dc power consumption.</description></item><item><title>A 400-GHz Efficient Radiator and OOK Transceiver for Multi-Gb/s Wireless Communication in Silicon</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10414477</link><description>This article introduces an efficient high-power radiator at 400 GHz and a fully integrated transceiver supporting OOK modulation for high-speed wireless communication using 90-nm SiGe BiCMOS. The reverse recovery of silicon p-i-n diodes is used to design a frequency quadrupler that generates high power efficiently at 400 GHz. By mutually interlocking and combining the power from two such quadruplers, we design a 400-GHz radiator. The proposed design achieves a peak effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of +20.6- and &#8722;5.8-dBm radiated power at 398 GHz with 0.2% dc-to-THz radiation efficiency. This is the highest reported efficiency, and THz power radiated per element above 320 GHz. Using the p-i-n diode quadruplers as the LO, we design a 400-GHz OOK transmitter and receiver with on-chip antennas. The transmitter uses a multiplier-last approach and has an EIRP of +17 dBm while consuming 84-mW dc power. The receiver uses fundamental-driven passive mixer architecture to achieve a noise figure (NF) of 25 dB while consuming 184 mW of dc power. This is the lowest reported NF above 320 GHz. Over-the-air (OTA) measurements are performed for a 5-cm link with OOK modulation. The stand-alone transmitter supports a data rate of 10 Gb/s (8 pJ/bit), and the transmit&#8211;receive system supports a data rate of 5 Gb/s (36.8 pJ/bit for the receiver). This is the first demonstration of a fully integrated multi-Gb/s wireless transceiver above 320 GHz in silicon.</description></item><item><title>Design of a Noncoherent 100-Gb/s 3-m Dual-Band PAM-4 Dielectric Waveguide Link in 28-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10418931</link><description>This work details the design of a plastic fiber link in 28-nm CMOS, operating in two adjacent bands centered on 117.5 and 152.5 GHz.

However, most quantum sensors still suffer from a bulky size and weight, low energy efficiency, and high costs, prohibiting their widespread use. Here, we present custom-designed chip-integrated microwave (MW) electronics for a miniaturized, low-cost, and highly scalable quantum magnetometer based on NV centers in diamond. The presented electronics include a quadrature phase-locked loop (QPLL) chip to generate the required local oscillator signal at around 7 GHz with a wide tuning range of 22% and a low phase noise (PN) of &#8722;122 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset from a 7-GHz carrier for broadband low-noise magnetometry. In addition, the magnetometer electronics comprise a 4-channel transmitter chip, which can provide currents up to 412 mApp into a custom-designed inductor over a wide frequency range from 6.4 to 8 GHz. In combination with a custom-designed coil, manufactured on a glass substrate for optical transparency, which features a large active area of ( $\pi { \times } 180 { \times }180~\mu \text {m}^{2}$ ), this current is sufficient to produce strong MW magnetic fields up to  $B_{{1}} = (1/2) \cdot B_{\text {ac}} = 170~{\mu \mathrm {T}}$ , enabling pulsed optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) experiments. In proof-of-concept ODMR experiments, the presented chip-based spin control system produces fast Rabi oscillations of 5.49 MHz.

With quantum computers scaling up toward thousands of quantum bits (qubits), but having too limited fidelity for robust operation, continuous rounds of quantum error correction (QEC) are necessary. However, QEC requires a large amount of data to be transferred from a cryogenic controller at 4K to a classical processor at room temperature (RT). To bridge the gap, a high-speed data link between the quantum processor at CT and the classical counterpart at RT is needed. The proposed PAM4 TX architecture integrates a low-power 64:4 serializer structure, a high-speed 4:1 current-mode logic (CML) multiplexer, and a linear 6-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC). Considering the challenges and benefits of CMOS operating at CTs, the TX architecture and circuitry are designed to exploit the maximum speed, while maintaining sufficient linearity. The fabricated 40-nm CMOS chip achieves a data rate of 40-Gb/s (36-Gb/s), an energy efficiency of 2.46 pJ/b (2.47 pJ/b), and 97.8% (96.6%) ratio of level mismatch (RLM) at CT (RT). While demonstrating an energy efficiency comparable to prior-art TXs in more advanced CMOS nodes at RT, the broad operating temperature of the proposed TX enables the required high-speed wireline link for large-scale quantum computers.</description></item><item><title>A Fast Back-to-Lock DPLL-Based 192&#8211;210-GHz Chirp Generator With +5.9-dBm Peak Output Power for Sub-THz Imaging and Sensing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10264917</link><description>A fully integrated high-efficiency phase-locked sub-terahertz (THz) radiator is reported in this article, implemented in a 55-nm SiGe BiCMOS process.

The MEMS sensor is fabricated using an in-house developed post-CMOS process, while its sensing structure is thinned to 2.52  $\mu \text{m}$  for power reduction. Meanwhile, the distance between the microheater and thermistors is optimized with a linear range of larger than &#177;4 m/s by the Peclet number (Pe) &lt; 1 criterion. The designed CTD control circuit can offer a driving current of 1.88 mA with an output swing of up to 2.82 V, which enables the microheater to operate in 50-K CTD mode with a deviation of less than 0.01 K. Additionally, the designed CFIA has a noise floor of 12.4 nV/rtHz with a 1/f corner of less than 400 mHz. The performance of the system-on-chip (SoC) sensor is evaluated with N2 gas flow.

We propose the simultaneous energy transferring SIBO (SETSIBO) converter, which generates bipolar outputs with only a two-phase operation and does not require additional switching. The hybrid power stage with a flying capacitor and two-phase operation reduces the dc value of the inductor current, which mitigates conduction losses and output ripples; moreover, the hybrid power stage allows the high-voltage switches in the conventional converters to be replaced by low-voltage switches. The inductor current reduction and the low-voltage power switch use improve the PCE. This article analyzes the proposed converter&#8217;s output ripple reduction and the PCE improvements; furthermore, the load imbalance is effectively compensated with the proposed SETSIBO converter. The prototype of the proposed SETSIBO is fabricated in a 0.5- $\mu \text{m}$  CMOS process. The measured ripples at positive and negative outputs are 24.5 and 28 mV, respectively, with a 300 mA load current  $I_{\mathrm {o}}$ . The measured peak PCE is 94.1%, and the active area is 1.46 mm2.</description></item><item><title>A Wideband Sliding Digital-IF Quadrature Digital Transmitter for Multimode NB-IoT/BLE Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10273404</link><description>This article proposes a sliding digital-intermediate frequency (IF) quadrature digital transmitter (Q-DTX) for multimode multiband narrowband Internet of Things/Bluetooth low-energy (NB-IoT/BLE) applications. The digital upconverter (DUC) with a reconfigurable IF frequency between 0 and  $f_{\mathrm {CLK}}$  is employed to replace the traditional fractional upsampling module in digital baseband processing and effectively avoid the fractional sampling spur issue. A quadrature digital power amplifier (DPA) with in-phase and quadrature (IQ)-sharing and transformer-based Doherty techniques are realized to enhance the efficiency at 0/3/6-dB power back-offs (PBOs) while supporting 0.7&#8211;2.5-GHz wide frequency range with a compact single-transformer footprint. Implemented in 28-nm CMOS, this Q-DTX occupies only 0.79-mm2 core area. Powered by 0.9- and 1.8-V supplies, this Q-DTX achieves 28.7-dBm peak output power with 47.7% system efficiency (SE) at 0.9 GHz.

The iSCS system adopts a fast inductor-based charger with level-adaptive duty modulation and charging range detection that can efficiently charge capacitors from any residual voltage levels to the target voltages up to 3 V. The offset-control charge balancing (OC-CB) adaptively reduces the mismatch between cathodic and anodic charges. The iSCS prototype can charge 1- $\mu \text{F}$  capacitor from 0 V (1.5 V) to 3 V within 50  $\mu \text{s}$  (28  $\mu \text{s}$ ), achieving 90% (92.7%) capacitor charging efficiency. The iSCS system efficiency was measured up to 92%, which is &gt;10% higher than state-of-the-art works. The iSCS also achieved higher stimulus efficacy thanks to its decaying exponential waveform. In vivo experiments for ocular muscle stimulation using the iSCS system resulted in a 20% increase in eye movement distance while consuming 13% less energy compared to the current-controlled stimulation system. This ensures higher system efficiency and enhanced stimulus efficacy.</description></item><item><title>A High-Efficiency Wide Output Range Reconfigurable Capacitive-Sigma DC&#8211;DC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10278205</link><description>A 5-to-0.4 $\sim $ 1.2-V reconfigurable capacitive-sigma dc&#8211; dc converter with 98.4% peak efficiency is presented.

This work achieves the following features. First, much higher efficiency, by using capacitive power links instead of low-quality micro-transformers and switching at a relatively lower frequency near resonance. Measurement shows a 68% peak efficiency, which is 15% higher than state-of-the-art miniature designs and is higher over almost the entire loading range. Second, RX local voltage and TX global power regulations are achieved with through-power-link feedback, neither using an extra pair of capacitors nor transformers. Third, the voltage-mode hysteretic control achieves a much faster transient response compared with previous works, with a simpler system complexity and neither small-signal bandwidth limitation nor stability concerns.

In prior current-mode converter designs, there exists undesired output DC error caused by control loop delays and mismatches between the RC current sensing network and the DC resistance (DCR) of the power inductor. Circuit delay is also an obstacle in achieving higher switching frequency and multi-phase operation. To address these issues, ratioed sensing RC network and digital output DC calibration are proposed. To reduce the efficiency degradation caused by imbalanced phase current, digital current balancing (CB) calibration is also developed. To maintain a high efficiency with a wide output load range, digital active-phase-count (APC) function was also introduced, with burst mode (BM) to improve transient responses at fast load current steps. The proposed converter has been fabricated in 180-nm CMOS process and measured at 10 and 25 MHz with 18-to-100-nH miniature 0402 inductors, converting 1.8-V supply ( $\text{V}_{\mathrm{ IN}}$ ) to 0.6&#8211;1.5-V output with 93.9% peak efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Battery-Input Three-Mode Buck&#8211;Boost Hybrid DC&#8211;DC Converter With 97.6% Peak Efficiency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10281380</link><description>This article presents a three-mode non-inverting buck&#8211;boost hybrid converter (3M-BBHC) suitable for mobile devices powered by lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. The proposed 3M-BBHC can work in buck, boost, or buck&#8211;boost mode, and it can switch the operation mode smoothly with a small ripple as the input voltage changes. Compared with the conventional non-inverting buck&#8211;boost converter (CBBC), the proposed 3M-BBHC still has only four power switches with a flying capacitor ( $C_{F}$ ) added. The number of switches conducting current in series with the inductor is reduced from 2 (in CBBC) to 1 (in 3M-BBHC) to decrease the conduction and switching losses. The inductor connects to the input terminal, which means the 3M-BBHC has a continuous input current and thus low electromagnetic interference (EMI). Besides, in buck mode, the inductor current is always smaller than the output current, which decreases the inductor dc resistance (DCR) conduction loss. The 3M-BBHC was fabricated in a standard 0.18- $\mu \text{m}$  CMOS process, using only 3.3-V devices to further reduce the losses. A 97.6% peak efficiency is measured by using a 2.2- $\mu \text{H}$  inductor with 110- $\text{m}\Omega $  DCR, a 10- $\mu \text{F} C_{F}$ , a 10- $\mu \text{F}$  output capacitor ( $C_{O}$ ), and a 2-MHz switching frequency. Its input voltage ranges from 2.7 to 4.2 V, and it can deliver an output current of 100&#8211;800 mA at 3.3-V regulated output voltage.</description></item><item><title>Parallel Versus Serial: Design of an Optical Receiver With Integrated Blue Photodetectors and Digitally Tunable Low-End Cutoff Frequency for MicroLED-Based Parallel Interchip Communication</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286829</link><description>This article first analytically compares the energy efficiency of a serial optical link with a parallel link with the same data throughput and bit error rate for interchip communication. The analysis predicts that more than  $10\times $  energy efficiency improvement is feasible at both TX and RX in a parallel optical link compared to the fastest serial link, depending on the technology. Next, the article presents the design of an optical receiver integrated with on-chip blue photodetectors for the parallel interchip communication. The blue light allows using high-speed microLEDs and enables CMOS compatible photodetector structures that have extremely low capacitance per unit area. This along with a transimpedance-to-noise optimization approach results in a highly energy efficient and compact analog front-end for the receiver, paving the way for dense and energy efficient parallel links. Besides, a digital offset cancellation technique is proposed for offset compensation that can provide a low-end cutoff frequency down to a few hertz with a compact area. As a proof of concept, a 32 elements optical receiver array is fabricated in a low-cost 130 nm CMOS SOI process, with each element occupying only 50  $\times $  50  $\mu \text{m}$  in area. Free space optical measurement results of a single receiver array element show a sensitivity of &#8722;19.3 dBm with a bit error rate of 10&#8722;12 at a data rate of 2 Gbps and an energy efficiency of about 0.5 pJ/bit.</description></item><item><title>Design of Direct 48-V/1-V Three-Path Four-State Switching Power Converter With Adaptive VCF Rebalancing and Dual-Edge tdead Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10254540</link><description>This article presents a new power converter capable of direct 48-V/1-V dc&#8211;dc conversion with high efficiency. The proposed three-path four-state (3P4S) hybrid switching power stage enables high switching frequency ( $f_{\mathrm {SW}}$ ) operation and minimizes power passives by significantly reducing power switch voltage stress. To address the issues of power delivery path imbalances and potential device breakdown, an adaptive flying capacitor voltage ( $V_{\mathrm {CF}}$ ) rebalancing technique is introduced that improves design robustness and eliminates the need for direct floating  $V_{\mathrm {CF}}$  sensing. Additionally, a dual-edge deadtime ( $t_{\mathrm {dead}}$ ) modulation with elastic  $t_{\mathrm {dead}}$  control at switching nodes optimizes converter efficiency across different input voltage and load conditions. An IC prototype of the design was fabricated and tested with input voltage  $V_{\mathrm {IN}}$  ranging from 12 to 48 V, delivering up to 4 W of power at 1-V  $V_{\mathrm {O}}$ . It achieves peak efficiency of 90.7% and 85.6% for 12-V/1-V and 48-V/1-V power conversion, respectively, at an effective switching frequency of 4.5 MHz, which is based on a three-phase operation with each phase at 1.5 MHz. The adaptive  $V_{\mathrm {CF}}$  rebalancing technique reduces  $V_{\mathrm {CF}}$  imbalance error by up to 65.1%. Overall, the proposed 3P4S hybrid switching power converter offers an efficient and robust solution for direct dc&#8211;dc conversion with a wide  $V_{\mathrm {IN}}$  range.</description></item><item><title>A 44.2-TOPS/W CNN Processor With Variation-Tolerant Analog Datapath and Variation Compensating Circuit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10299653</link><description>Convolutional neural network (CNN) processors that exploit analog computing for high energy efficiency suffer from two major issues. First, frequent data conversions between the layers limit energy efficiency. Second, computing errors occur from analog circuits since they are vulnerable to process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. In this article, a CNN processor featuring a variation-tolerant analog datapath with analog memory (AMEM) is proposed so that data conversion is not needed. To minimize the computing error, both AMEM and ANU are designed in such a way that their performance is not affected by PVT variations. In addition, a variation compensating circuit is also proposed. Prototype implemented in 28-nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) achieves energy-efficiency of 437.9 TOPS/W in the analog datapath, 44.2 TOPS/W in the total system and maintains its classification accuracy to within 0.5%p across variations of  ${\pm }10\%$  in supply voltage and &#8722;20 &#176;C to 85 &#176;C in temperature.</description></item><item><title>An Energy-Efficient Computing-in-Memory NN Processor With Set-Associate Blockwise Sparsity and Ping-Pong Weight Update</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10299656</link><description>Computing-in-memory (CIM) chips have demonstrated the potential high energy efficiency for low-power neural network (NN) processors. Even with energy-efficient CIM macros, the existing system-level CIM chips still lack deep exploration on sparsity and large models, which prevents a higher system energy efficiency. This work presents a CIM NN processor with more sufficient support of sparsity and higher utilization rate. Three key innovations are proposed. First, a set-associate blockwise sparsity strategy is designed, which simultaneously saves execution time, power, and storage space. Second, a ping-pong weight update mechanism is proposed for a higher utilization rate, enabling simultaneous execution of CIM and write operations. Third, an efficient CIM macro is implemented with adaptive analog-digital converter (ADC) precision for better sparsity utilization and performance-accuracy trade-off. The 65-nm fabricated chip shows 9.5-TOPS/W system energy efficiency at 4-bit precision, with 6.25 $\times $  actual improvement compared with a state-of-the-art CIM chip. Besides, this work supports high CIM execution accuracy on the ImageNet dataset.</description></item><item><title>A 0.6-to-1.2 V Scaling-Friendly Discrete-Time OTA-Free Linear VCO-Based &#916;&#931; ADC Suitable for DVFS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10449680</link><description>This work presents a scaling-friendly Discrete-Time (DT) 2nd order  $\Delta \Sigma $  ADC using a passive lossy integrator and a novel VCO-Frequency Delta-Sigma Modulator (FDSM). The proposed ADC has a 1st order  $\Delta \Sigma $  ADC structure with a 1st-order loop filter and a quantizer. The loop filter consists of a passive lossy integrator, which is OTA-free, energy-efficient, and provides a 1st order noise shaping. The proposed VCO-FDSM as a quantizer also realizes additional 1st order noise shaping. Therefore, the overall structure has 2nd order noise shaping property. The proposed VCO-FDSM employs a linear VCO with negative feedback to improve the linearity. The VCO output frequency is quantized into a multi-bit thermometer digital output code with inherent dynamic element matching (DEM) property by the fully digital FDSM. The FDSM output having DEM property mitigates the mismatch error of the capacitive digital-to-analog converter (CDAC). This highly digital architecture facilitates a trade-off between the supply voltage and the operational bandwidth (BW), which makes the ADC suitable for energy-efficient IoT applications. The test chip fabricated in 65nm standard CMOS technology operates at wide supply voltages ranging from 0.6 V to 1.2 V with a bandwidth range from 1.25 kHz to 5 kHz.

The proposed DMCG combines a dual-path front end and an improved selecting signal generator that addresses the potential phase error and reduces the peak current of the clock-driving circuits by 60%. The DS is proposed to serialize the digital outputs without employing power-hungry inverter-based buffer chains thus reducing the power consumption by 39.2%. The reference-free time skew extraction algorithm (RFA) is presented to mitigate the accuracy deterioration due to selecting the fixed middle channel. These techniques are validated by a prototype 12-bit 10-GS/s TI pipelined successive approximation register (TI-Pi-SAR) ADC. Fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process, the prototype chip occupies an area of 4.4 mm2. The measurement results show that the ADC achieves a 49.8 dB SNDR and 60.0 dB SFDR after calibration at Nyquist frequency, while the total power consumption is 270 mW, leading to the figure of merits of Schreier (FoM $_{\mathrm {S}}$ ) and Walden (FoM $_{\mathrm {W}}$ ) of 152.5 dB and 106.9 fJ/conv.-step, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Inverse Modelling Techniques as Dynamic Digital Pre-Distortion for Broadband Systems for CS-DACs Based on Volterra Series Expansion</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433893</link><description>This paper presents a dynamic digital pre-distortion (DPD) method for a current-steering digital-to-analog converter (CS-DAC). The novel proposed method is based on the inverse modelling of the system with a Volterra series expansion. It uses a memory structure often only used for DPD in power amplifiers (PA). The goal is to find a model to counteract the signal dependent non-linearities of charge injection from the switching activity of the converter with a limited parameter count. A priori knowledge of the non-linear behavior and architecture of the DAC is exploited. The proposed Volterra system consists of a first and third order kernel with a respective memory depth of one. This results in a total number of only 6 parameters that need to be estimated. This is sufficient to significantly attenuate the non-linear distortions and efficient in terms of memory usage and computational complexity. The paper compares three different methods for generating the inverse of the Volterra system and determines the performance difference between them. The evaluation of the proposed DPD is done via Spice simulations of a 14-bit CS-DAC using a lumped circuit model and Spectre simulations of a real 14-bit 16 nm DAC design. Narrow-band and broad-band discrete multi-tone (DMT) signals with a frequency of up to 684 MHz are considered. The results show a performance gain of the missing-tone-power-ratio (MTPR) of up to 8.4 dB for both model-based and circuit-based simulations based analysis, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A 20.3&#956;W 1.9G&#937; Input Impedance Capacitively-Coupled Chopper-Stabilized Amplifier for Bio-Potential Readout</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10404074</link><description>This paper presents a low-power chopper-stabilized capacitively-coupled frontend amplifier with auxiliary-path-based input impedance ( ${Z} _{\mathbf {in}}$ ) boosting. In order to achieve a high  ${Z} _{\mathbf {in}}$ , a low noise and a small chip area, techniques on both system level and circuit level are implemented. On the system level, small capacitors ( ${C} _{\mathbf {in}}$  = 0.5 pF,  ${C} _{\mathbf {fb}}$  = 25 fF) are used with a biased pseudo-resistor ( ${R}$  = 2.5  $\text{G}\Omega $ ) fed back to an amplifier internal node. As a result, a high achievable  ${Z} _{\mathbf {in}}$  and low high-pass corner frequency are achieved. On the circuit level, an input capacitance shielded current feedback (CSCF) topology achieving effective 10 fF  ${C} _{\mathbf {amp}}$  is proposed as the core of the capacitive feedback amplifier in order not to increase the input noise. Moreover, the design space of auxiliary-path-based boosting is explored to obtain the optimal value of buffer bandwidth and auxiliary capacitor size to save power. The amplifier and its  ${Z} _{\mathbf {in}}$  boosting circuit are implemented in a standard 55 nm CMOS process and characterized experimentally. Measurement results show that the proposed amplifier provides an input noise density of 50 nV/ $\surd $  Hz, and an integrated noise of  $0.85~\mu $  Vrms in 200 Hz band.

It is illustrated that the bandwidth of the DEPA can be improved apparently by applying a shunt short-circuited stub at the combining point. The principle of such method is that the back-off impedance variation with frequency can be compensated by the reactance of the shunt stub. Besides, to get over the high gain compression of the conventional DEPA, an adaptive biasing scheme is proposed for the auxiliary PAs. A DEPA is implemented in a 0.25- $\mu \text{m}$  GaN-HEMT process for validation. The shunt stub is realized by a LC tank equivalently for a compact size. The fabricated DEPA achieves a saturated output power of 41.5&#8211;43 dBm and an 8-dB back-off drain efficiency (DE) of 38%&#8211;46.8% from 1.8 to 5.4 GHz with a chip size of  $3.2\times3.2$  mm2. The fractional bandwidth (FBW) is up to 100%. Applying a 100-MHz LTE signal with an 8.5-dB peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), an average DE of 35%&#8211;43% is measured over the entire bandwidth, and adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) is better than &#8722;47 dBc after applying digital predistortion.

The RF phase-shifting architecture is utilized for the phased-array transmitter to reduce circuit blocks and lower system complexity. The high-resolution phase shifting is achieved by a vector-sum phase shifter, which is based on a quadrature-all-pass filter (QAF) with compensation network and Gilbert-type variable gain amplifiers (VGAs) with digital-controlled current digital-to-analog converters (I-DACs). To lower the gain error introduced by the phase shifter in RF phase-shifting architecture, the variable-gain power amplifier (VGPA) is proposed. The gain of the VGPA is finely adjusted to compensate the gain variation of phase shifter in different phase states. Meanwhile, the phase variation of the VGPA under variable gain states is optimized to avoid the influence on phase errors. To verify the aforementioned mechanism, a W-band  $2\times 2$  phased-array transmitter is implemented and fabricated in a conventional 40-nm CMOS technology. Based on the digital gain-compensation technique, the phased-array transmitter exhibits a less than 1.12dB RMS gain error and less than 1.82&#176; RMS phase error. In addition, the fabricated chip achieves 8.13dBm peak saturated output power and better than 9dB power gain with 135mW power consumption for each channel.</description></item><item><title>A 0.14-nJ/b 200-Mb/s 2.7&#8211;3.5-GHz Quasi-Balanced FSK Transceiver With PLL-Based Modulation and Sideband Energy Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10459220</link><description>This paper describes a balanced frequency shift keying (FSK) modulation, namely quasi-balanced FSK (QB-FSK), for energy-efficient high-data-rate communication. Not suffering from data-pattern dependency, the proposed modulation method enables frequency modulation (FM) over 100 Mb/s by utilizing a wideband phase-locked loop (PLL). The QB-FSK signal is generated with the same baseband clock frequency as the non-return zero (NRZ)-coded binary FSK (BFSK) signal, resulting in improved bandwidth efficiency compared to other balanced FSK signals. For demodulation, the receiver employs a sideband energy detection (SB-ED) method. A FM discriminator converts the QB-FSK signal to an on-off keying (OOK) signal. After that, a band-pass filter (BPF) is used to filter out 1/f noise and dc offset. Based on the proposed QB-FSK modulation and the SB-ED method, a prototype FSK transceiver is implemented in 65-nm CMOS for high-data-rate sub-6-GHz proprietary wireless connectivity. The receiver successfully demodulates data at a rate of 200 Mb/s with a sensitivity of &#8211;67 dBm, while the transmitter can achieve a maximum data rate of 400 Mb/s. The 200-Mb/s transceiver achieves an energy efficiency of 0.14 nJ/b.</description></item><item><title>A 1&#8211;8b Reconfigurable Digital SRAM Compute-in-Memory Macro for Processing Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10417860</link><description>This work presents a 1-8b reconfigurable digital SRAM compute-in-memory (CIM) macro, which significantly improves array utilization and energy efficiency under different input and weight configurations compared to previous works. To ensure the array utilization under different configurations, a row-based bitwise-summation-first digital CIM architecture is proposed. In addition, to realize flexible switching between signed and unsigned operations, a complete 2&#8217;s complement encoding method is adopted, which makes the computation of the sign bits consistent with that of the magnitude bits when performing signed operations, thus ensuring that each row of the CIM array can store the sign of the weight. Due to the support of reconfigurable bit width, the proposed CIM macro can be widely used in various neural networks for optimal efficiency. In order to better apply the CIM macro to binarized neural networks, a configurable bitwise multiplier is presented, which supports both AND and XNOR operations. Moreover, since the power consumption of the adder tree occupies a major part of the digital CIM macro, a 4&#8211;2 compressor based adder tree is presented to further improve the energy efficiency. Measurement results based on 55nm CMOS process show that the proposed CIM macro achieves an energy efficiency of up to 2238TOPS/W at 1b/1b and 44.82TOPS/W at 4b/4b MAC operations.</description></item><item><title>A Heterogeneous Platform for 3D NAND-Based In-Memory Hyperdimensional Computing Engine for Genome Sequencing Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10440648</link><description>Hyperdimensional (HD) computing is a promising paradigm for large-scale genome sequencing.

Compared to conventional methods, the proposed design reduces the system-level energy consumption by $1000\times $ , provided the data is not offloaded from the solid-state drive to the computing units.</description></item><item><title>DS-CIM: A 40nm Asynchronous Dual-Spike Driven, MRAM Compute-In-Memory Macro for Spiking Neural Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10410431</link><description>Compute-in-memory (CIM) based on emerging nonvolatile memory (eNVM) is an effective way to deploy neural networks to low-power edge devices for both storage and computation. NVMs such as ReRAM have been widely used in CIM. Meanwhile, MRAM has higher read and write cycles, lower device and cycle variation and a lower bit error rate, making it equally attractive for storage. However, the high read current and low on/off ratio result in large energy consumption in MRAM read limiting its large-scale application in CIM. The spiking neural network (SNN) represents the information as sparse spike sequences and facilitates hardware to achieve low-power computing by taking advantage of its spatial-temporal sparsity. To further increase the input sparsity of SNN and reduce the read energy consumption, this paper proposes ADC-free, dual-spike (DS) -CIM macro, a spiking MRAM CIM macro driven by asynchronous dual spikes. Compared to the conventional rate coding, our dual-spike coding method uses only 2 spikes to encode the information without losing accuracy. Moreover, the event-driven feature allows the macro to have sub-nW static power consumption. Our DS-CIM macro achieves comparable or higher accuracy while maintaining very low energy consumption. Specifically, it achieves accuracies of 96.99%, 82.87%, 90.00%, and 85.97% for digit classification, image classification, gesture recognition, and action recognition tasks, with energy consumption of only 8.07nJ, 71.26nJ, 729.3nJ, and 369.82nJ, respectively. These results emphasize the significance of DS-CIM and provide ideas for low-power inference on edge devices.</description></item><item><title>Variation Aware Evaluation Approach and Design Methodology for SOT-MRAM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10437994</link><description>Spin-orbit torque magnetic random access memory (SOT-MRAM), which exhibits sub-nanosecond write speed and high reliability, is a promising candidate for the future high-level cache. However, SOT-MRAM faces the problem of large bit-cell layout area due to its structural characteristics and write performance requirements, therefore it is necessary to explore the bit-cell design with optimal overall performance under the unified bit-cell area. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive variation aware evaluation approach for the area, latency, and energy of SOT-MRAM under the uniform yield standard. Based on this, the mainstream SOT-MRAM bit-cell designs with high-density method and multi-finger configuration are evaluated, meanwhile bit-cell designs with excellent write performance and their optimum area ranges are identified. Moreover, the source line read (SLR) mode with higher robustness against transistor variation is proposed to improve the read performance, and the dual SL (DSL) method is proposed to further reduce the read latency and write energy. With the DSL method, the read latency and write energy of 2-word-line (WL)-type bit-cells can be reduced by up to 36.5% and 12.6%, respectively. In addition, the DSL method can solve the shunt current issue of 1WL-type bit-cells and reduce the read latency and write energy by up to 43.6% and 17.4%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>DQ-STP: An Efficient Sparse On-Device Training Processor Based on Low-Rank Decomposition and Quantization for DNN</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443594</link><description>Due to the bottleneck problems such as scenario-varying application, significant data communication overhead and privacy protection between off-line training and on-line inference, intelligent edge devices capable of adaptively fine-tuning the deep neural network (DNN) models for specific tasks have become the most urgent need. However, the computational cost is intolerable for ordinary on-device training (ODT), which inspires us to explore an efficient ODT processor, named DQ-STP. In this paper, we leverage a series of optimization techniques using software-hardware co-design. On the one hand, the proposed design incorporates SVD-based low-rank decomposition,  $2^{n}$  quantization and ACBN algorithm on the software side. This unifies the sparse computing mode of convolutional layers and enhancing weight sparsity. On the other hand, the proposed design effectively leverages data sparsity on the hardware side through four techniques: 1) The flag compressed sparse row is proposed to compress input feature maps and gradient maps. 2) A unified processing element (PE) array comprising shifters and adders is proposed to expedite forward and error propagation steps. 3) The PE arrays for error propagation and weight gradients generation are separated to enhance throughput. 4) A sparse alignment strategy is proposed to further enhance PE utilization. Through these software and hardware co-optimization, the proposed DQ-STP achieves an area efficiency and peak energy efficiency of 41.2 GOPS/mm2 and 90.63 TOPS/W. In comparison to state-of-the-art reference designs, the proposed DQ-STP demonstrates a  $2.19\times $  improvement in normalized area efficiency and a  $1.85\times $  enhancement in energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>HDSuper: High-Quality and High Computational Utilization Edge Super-Resolution Accelerator With Hardware-Algorithm Co-Design Techniques</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10415279</link><description>Super-resolution (SR) techniques have been employed to construct high-definition images from low-quality images. Various neural networks have demonstrated excellent image-reconstruction quality in SR accelerators. However, deploying SR networks on edge devices is limited by resources and power consumption induced by significant algorithm parameters, computation complexity, and external memory accesses. This work explores the hardware algorithm co-design techniques to provide an end-to-end platform with a lightweight super-resolution network (LSR) and an efficient, high-quality SR accelerator HDSuper. For algorithm design, the improved depth-wise separable convolution and pixelshuffle layers are developed to reduce network size and computation complexity by considering the hardware constraints. Also, the improved channel attention (CA) blocks enhance the image reconstruction quality. For hardware accelerator design, we design a unified computing core (UCC) combined with an efficient flattening-and-allocation (F-A) mapping strategy to support various operators with high computational utilization. In addition, we design the patch computing scheme to reduce the external memory access of the hardware architecture. Based on the evaluation, the proposed algorithm achieves high-quality image reconstruction with  $37.44dB$  PSNR. Finally, the FPGA demonstration and ASIC layout under UMC 55nm are achieved with low power consumption ( $2.08 W$  and  $152 mW$ ) under the lowest hardware resources compared to the state-of-the-art works.</description></item><item><title>ESSR: An 8K@30FPS Super-Resolution Accelerator With Edge Selective Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10388489</link><description>Deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) is challenging to implement in resource-constrained edge devices for resolutions beyond full HD due to its high computational complexity and memory bandwidth requirements. This paper introduces an 8K@30FPS SR accelerator with edge-selective dynamic input processing. Dynamic processing chooses the appropriate subnets for different patches based on simple input edge criteria, achieving a 50% MAC reduction with only a 0.1dB PSNR decrease. The quality of reconstruction images is guaranteed and maximized its potential with resource adaptive model switching even under resource constraints. In conjunction with hardware-specific refinements, the model size is reduced by 84% to 51K, but with a decrease of less than 0.6dB PSNR. Additionally, to support dynamic processing with high utilization, this design incorporates a configurable group of layer mapping that synergizes with the structure-friendly fusion block, resulting in 77% hardware utilization and up to 79% reduction in feature SRAM access. The implementation, using the TSMC 28nm process, can achieve 8K@30FPS throughput at 800MHz with a gate count of 2749K, 0.2075W power consumption, and 4797Mpixels/J energy efficiency, exceeding previous work.</description></item><item><title>A 16.38TOPS and 4.55POPS/W SRAM Computing-in-Memory Macro for Signed Operands Computation and Batch Normalization Implementation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10415281</link><description>Edge artificial intelligence applications impose rigorous demands on local hardware to improve throughput and energy efficiency. Computing-in-memory (CIM) architectures provide high parallel and energy-efficient solutions to accelerate the multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations in neural networks (NNs). While SRAM-based charge-domain CIM is achieving thousands of TOPS/W energy efficiency, it encounters limitations when dealing with full NN model deployments where both activations and weights are signed. This paper proposes an SRAM-based signed batch normalization (BN) CIM macro for supporting efficient bitwise sparse MAC computation with signed operands and BN operations in deep neural networks. The key features of this macro encompass: 1) a multibit weight unit for the optimization of bitstream sparsity and the sign bit computation, 2) a 2b-serial input configuration to increase throughput and the ADC energy amortization, and 3) a quantization-hardware co-design for the BN implementation. Measurement results show that the proposed 28 nm 64 Kb CIM macro achieves 16.38 TOPS throughput and 4.55 POPS/W energy efficiency, both normalized to 1b operands. The test accuracy of CIFAR10 is 92%, based on the ResNet18 model with co-design BN implementation at signed-8b precision activations and weights.</description></item><item><title>RDCIM: RISC-V Supported Full-Digital Computing-in-Memory Processor With High Energy Efficiency and Low Area Overhead</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10403109</link><description>Digital computing-in-memory (DCIM) that merges computing logic into memory has been proven to be an efficient architecture for accelerating multiply-and-accumulates (MACs). However, low energy efficiency and high area overhead pose a primary restriction for integrating DCIM in re-configurable processors required for multi-functional workloads. To alleviate this dilemma, a novel RISC-V supported full-digital computing-in-memory processor (RDCIM) is designed and fabricated with 55nm CMOS technology. In RDCIM, an adding-on-memory-boundary (AOMB) scheme is adopted to improve the energy efficiency of DCIM. Meanwhile, a multi-precision adaptive accumulator (MPAA) and a serial-parallel conversion supported SRAM buffer (SPBUF) are employed to reduce the area overhead caused by the peripheral circuits and the intermediate buffer for multi-precision support. The results show that the energy efficiency in our design is 16.6 TOPS/W (8-bit) and 66.3 TOPS/W (4-bit). Compared to related works, the proposed RDCIM macro shows a maximum energy efficiency improvement of  $1.22\times $  in a continuous computing scenario, an area saving of  $1.22\times $  in the accumulator, and an area saving of  $3.12\times $  in the input buffer. Moreover, in RDCIM, 5 fine-grained RISC-V extended instructions are designed to dynamically adjust the state of DCIM, reaching  $1.2\times $  computation efficiency.</description></item><item><title>NeuroSim V1.4: Extending Technology Support for Digital Compute-in-Memory Toward 1nm Node</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443264</link><description>Over the past decade, numerous compute-in-memory (CIM) platforms have been proposed in the literature. While emerging non-volatile memory based analog CIM (ACIM) has been widely studied, its silicon demonstrations are in the mature legacy node (22 nm or above). As an alternative, digital CIM (DCIM) based on static random access memory (SRAM) is recently drawing significant attention, as it enjoys the scaling benefits with the logic process to the leading-edge node (5 nm or below), and does not suffer from the accuracy loss due to process/voltage/temperature (PVT) variations. To assess the potential of DCIM in the future, we release NeuroSim V1.4, a CIM benchmark framework, which supports advanced technology nodes down to 1 nm node. We project the technology parameters (standard cell, transistor and interconnect) using TCAD device simulations, interconnect modeling, and the available industry/IRDS roadmaps. State-of-the-art technology trends such as fin-depopulation, buried power rail, stacked nanosheet, etc are captured in the updated parameters. Technology scaling down to 1 nm enables DCIM to achieve 1.4 $\sim 1.8\times $  and 44.1 $\sim 63.1\times $  higher system-level figure of merit than state-of-the-art 7 nm SRAM-based ACIM and 22 nm RRAM-based ACIM, respectively, for representative workloads such as ResNet18 and ResNet34 inference.</description></item><item><title>A Memristor Emulation in 180-nm CMOS Process for Spiking Signal Generation and Chaos Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10387460</link><description>We present a new CMOS circuit and its successful fabrication of an operational transconductance amplifier (OTA)-CMOS inverter-based memristor emulator and investigate its switching behavior from 5 MHz to 50 MHz. It could be considered the first memristor emulator based on a current mode circuit and an inverter. Primarily, the transconductance of the inverter stage transforms the bias-voltage-dependent transconductance of the OTA into an overall flux-dependent memductance of the memristor. We also demonstrate how performance measures such as frequency response, noise, post-layout simulation, and process corners impact the memristive behavior of the design. The power consumption of the proposed memristor emulator is 2.25 mW. The aforementioned power figure is based on a 1.8 V power supply and calculated on a UMC 180-nm CMOS technology node. Further, using this memristor emulator, we implement a CMOS circuit for spiking signal generation called the Memristive Integrate-and-Fire (MIF) neuron circuit that mimics a biological neuron. As far as we know, a spiking signal generation using a memristor emulator remains unreported. Later on, we went on to realize a MIF neuron based object detection application to bring out the practical significance of the MIF neuron circuit. We have fabricated a chip of the proposed memristor emulator design with the die size of L= $1499.96~\mu \text{m}$ , W= $1499.96~\mu \text{m}$ , and included its fabrication result to validate the theoretical derivations in the work. At last, we perform an experimental realization of a chaos circuit application with the help of the fabricated chip.</description></item><item><title>HAS-RL: A Hierarchical Approximate Scheme Optimized With Reinforcement Learning for NoC-Based NN Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10431799</link><description>Network-on-Chip (NoC) is a scalable on-chip communication architecture for the NN accelerator, but with the increase in the number of nodes, the communication delay becomes higher. Applications such as machine learning have a certain resilience to noisy/erroneous transmitted data. Therefore, approximate communication becomes a promising solution to improving performance by reducing traffic loads under the constraint of the acceptable maximum accuracy loss of neural networks. It is a key issue to balance the result quality and the communication delay for approximate NoC systems. The traditional approximate NoC only considers the node-to-node approximation-based dynamic traffic regulation. However, the dynamically changing traffic patterns across different nodes, different times, and different applications lead to a huge search space, which makes it hard to explore an optimal global approximation solution. In this paper, we propose a quality model for different neural networks, which presents the relationship between the quality loss and the data approximate rate. Then, a hierarchical approximate scheme optimized with reinforcement learning (HAS-RL) is proposed and we reduce the complexity of the HAS-RL by reducing the state space and action space, which will reduce the resource overhead as well. After that, we embed a global approximate controller in the NoC system, in which we deploy a policy network trained with the offline reinforcement learning algorithm to adjust the data approximate rates of each node at run time. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, the proposed scheme reduces the average network delay by 13.5% while their accuracies are similar. The proposed HAS-RL only causes an additional area overhead of 1.24% and power consumption of 0.77% compared with the traditional router design.</description></item><item><title>An Output Voltage Tracking Control Method With Overcurrent Protection Property for Disturbed DC&#8211;DC Boost Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10445021</link><description>In this paper, the output voltage tracking control of DC-DC boost converters is studied. To meet the increasing safety requirements and enhance the control system robustness, overcurrent protection and disturbance rejection are investigated simultaneously. A simple and effective control scheme is proposed to achieve all these three goals, which includes two parts. In the first part, a disturbance observer is constructed to estimate multiple disturbances (including the input voltage fluctuations and the load variations). In the second part, a composite current-constrained controller is proposed by embedding the disturbance estimates and the nonlinear penalty term into the passivity-based control law. Under the novel control scheme, rapid tracking performance and safe overcurrent protection are obtained, even in the presence of multiple disturbances. Rigorous stability analysis is conducted to demonstrate the accomplishment of the output voltage tracking task and the strict guarantee of the current constraint. Simulations and experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.</description></item><item><title>On the Damping of Ringing Affecting Power Transistors by Means of Active Gate Drivers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10418097</link><description>Fast power transistors require a tight control of their switching trajectory to exploit them at full speed, without degrading reliability and delivered electromagnetic emission figures of merit. By using active gate drivers in place of conventional ones, the switching trajectory can be shaped to reduce current and voltage overshoots, as well as the amplitude of oscillations. However, the tuning of such drivers is still an open issue. This paper investigates the damping of oscillations by means of active gate drivers, and proposes a method to tune them a-priori. The target switching waveforms are evaluated by means of non-linear damping elements in simulation, easing the tuning procedure. The proposed method was assessed on a digital active gate driver, providing the initial set-point for the adaptive controller. The convergence time measured experimentally was found to be as low as  $\mathrm {50~ \mu \text {s} }$  for the overall load current range, whilst not affecting the conversion efficiency of the dc-dc converter exploited as test case.</description></item><item><title>A Switched Capacitor Modified Fibonacci Cell Used for a DC&#8211;AC Circuit Supplied by Solar Energy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10403844</link><description>A Fibonacci-type switched-capacitor (SC) cell is modified in order to be suitable for an innovative, breakthrough switched-capacitor multilevel inverter (SCMLI) fitted for photovoltaics powered systems. Characteristic to such a cell, its capacitor voltages follow a Fibonacci series. Thus, with only a very few capacitors, a very large step-up of the input voltage is realized; and the staircase output waveform of a Modified Fibonacci - based inverter would feature a very large number of levels, being very close to a sinusoid. Such an inverter is necessary if its front-end is a green source of energy which provides only a relative low voltage. A common line-load ground two-output SC-based multilevel inverter is then developed, analyzed and designed. This inverter can feed two loads without interference with each other. The common ground (CG) effectively stops the leakage current of the solar cells. In order to get the same voltage step-up and the same number of levels as in a no-common ground inverter with the same structure, the Modified SC Fibonacci circuit is reinvented, by dividing it into two sub-networks, each one with another function. One of them together with the input source supply the positive half-sinusoids voltages of both outputs, thus assuring a permanent non-zero input current, as required by the front-end environmental-friendly sources of energy. The other SC sub-network supplies the negative half-sinusoids to both loads. The novel CG-SCMLI contains the smallest number of components per output among all the common ground SCMLIs able to provide the same number of levels in the output staircase waveform. The idea was implemented on a 400W 15-levels inverter providing two outputs of 220V rms, of a very small total harmonic distortion of 5.2%.</description></item><item><title>Setting Up the State Equations of Switched Circuits Using Homogeneous Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10391066</link><description>This paper discusses a new modeling framework for switched circuits. The core idea is to avoid the distinction between the topologies defined by the short- and open-circuits corresponding to the on- and off-states of each ideal switch. We treat both cases in a uniform manner by describing Ohm&#8217;s law in terms of a single variable  $u$ , via the relations  $i=pu$ ,  $v=qu$ . The parameters  $p$  and  $q$  describe the state of the switch, either ideal or nonideal. An ideal switch is described by the values  $p= p_{\mathrm{ on}}=1$ ,  $q= q_{\mathrm{ on}}=0$  in the on-state and  $p= p_{\mathrm{ off}}=0$ ,  $q= q_{\mathrm{ off}}=1$  in the off-state, whereas nonideal switches are described by nonzero values of  $q_{\mathrm{ on}}$  and/or  $p_{\mathrm{ off}}$ . Regardless of the number of switches, all working states of a given circuit can be described by means of a single model which, in essence, may be set up by conventional methods. This avoids the need to draw different schematics and write down a variety of models depending on the state of each switch, as it is almost invariably done when modeling switched circuits. We use this framework to address the state-space formulation problem for switched circuits. The results are then applied to the analysis of several DC-DC power converters and a multilevel inverter.</description></item><item><title>A 521pW, 0.016%/V Line Sensitivity Self-Biased CMOS Voltage Reference With DIBL Effect Compensation Using Adaptive VGS Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10302323</link><description>This brief proposes an ultra-low-power self-biased CMOS voltage reference (SBCVR) with the drain-induced-barrier-lowering (DIBL) effect compensation to improve the line sensitivity (LS) and low-frequency power supply rejection ratio (PSRR). To reduce the dependence of bias current  $(I_{\mathrm{ B}})$  on the supply voltage  $(V_{\mathrm{ DD}})$  owing to the DIBL effect, the gate-source voltage  $(V_{\mathrm{ GS}})$  of biasing transistor is adaptively regulated by  $V_{\mathrm{ DD}}$ . In this way, the DIBL effect compensation is achieved, while the  $I_{\mathrm{ B}}$  is almost immune to  $V_{\mathrm{ DD}}$ . The presented SBCVR is fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu \text{m}$  CMOS process, while 18 samples have been measured. The results show that its average LS reaches 0.016%/V and has been decreased by almost 85% compared to the one without the DIBL effect compensation. The design can also achieve a PSRR of &#8722;62.5dB at 10Hz. Meanwhile, the average reference voltage  $(V_{\mathrm{ REF}})$  is 317.6mV with a variation of 0.52%  $\sigma /\mu $ . The average temperature coefficient (TC) is 86.6 ppm/&#176;C without trimming from 0&#176;C to 100&#176;C, and the minimum power consumption at 27&#176;C is 521pW. The area of the reported SBCVR with the DIBL effect compensation is only 0.0016mm2.</description></item><item><title>A Fast Transient LDO Regulator Featuring High PSRR Over 100-kHz Frequency Range With Adaptive, Dynamic Biasing, and Current Mode Feed-Forward Amplifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304368</link><description>This brief presents a fast transient LDO with high power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) over 100-kHz based on adaptive biasing, dynamic biasing technique and a current mode feed-forward amplifier (CMFFA). The dynamic biasing improves the load transient response and the adaptive biasing benefits the loop stability. The CMFFA introduces a left-half-plane zero to compensate for the non-dominant pole without large current consumption. Moreover, a impedance adaptive circuit is also used in this design: it ensures the DC gain and pushes a non-dominant pole to high frequency. Through these methods, the proposed LDO is stable over full load range, from 0mA to 150mA, it achieves fast transient response and high PSRR with a low quiescent current. The LDO is fabricated in a 0.6-  $\mu $  m CMOS technology. The output voltage can be regulated from 1.8V to 3.3V and the load capacitance is 1  $\mu $  F. For a 150mA load step and a 3.3V output voltage, the maximum undershoot voltage is 38.6mV. At maximum load condition, a 41dB PSRR is achieved at 100-kHz and the loop gain bandwidth product is 1.9MHz. The DC gain is around 70dB over the full load range. The measured load regulation and line regulation are 0.06mV/mA and 1mV/V, respectively. The LDO has a minimum quiescent current of 9.6  $\mu $  A without load. Finally, the proposed LDO achieves a FOM1 of 16.47ps and a FOM2 of 123.52  $\mu $  V.</description></item><item><title>Input-Independent Array Compensation in Memristor-Arrays-Based Neuromorphic Systems for Input Resistance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10306331</link><description>Neuromorphic systems using memristors as artificial synapses have attracted widespread interest for low-power consumption and low-latency computing applications. However, networks based on the paradox of limited sources and progressively larger array sizes are affected by non-ideal effects, such as input resistance problems due to matrix switches. During vector array multiplication, the input resistance leads to great distortion of the out current and significant degradation of the network performance. Here, an input-independent array compensation (IAC) method for the input resistance effect is proposed, which only require a few known parameters (memristor column average conductance, array size, input resistance) independent of the input information to effectively solves current distortion problems. The simulation and experiment results demonstrate that the current distortion problem can be successfully mitigated and the accuracy of the network computing can be effectively restored by using the proposed IAC method. These results provide a feasible approach for the precise implementation of the neuromorphic system based on memristor arrays.</description></item><item><title>A 480 mVpp Linear Input Range, Low Noise Transconductance Cell for Multi-Input Sensor Interface</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10306268</link><description>This brief proposes a high-linear transconductance cell based on parallel source degeneration and differential flipped voltage followers (FVFs) with balance resistors.

As a result, the chopped offset voltage can yield a time varying residual error that changes in magnitude as a function of the chopping clock phase relative to the start time of the decimation filter and data conversion. Simulation and hardware experiments have been created to help quantify the relationship between the residual offset error magnitude and chopping phase alignment. A 16-bit second order  $\Delta \Sigma $  ADC has been fabricated in a 130 nm technology that utilizes integrator amplifier chopping to reduce the converter offset voltage. The ADC includes a non-interleaved compact third order sinc filter suitable for low cost measurement applications that demonstrates the impact of partial offset cancellation. The results show how to optimize the residual offset error by adjusting the amplifier chopping speed relative to the conversion speed.</description></item><item><title>A Variation-Tolerant Voltage-Mode Transmitter With 3+1 Tap FFE in 28-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10318210</link><description>In this brief, we introduce a voltage-mode transmitter (TX) equipped with a 3+1 tap feed-forward equalizer (FFE).

An analysis of transistor periphery selection is provided in order to fulfil linearity parameters concurrently targeting other design constraints such as switch isolation and size. It is shown that a trade-off between the contrasting goals of switch power handling (expressed in terms of 1dB compression point) and switch isolation should be addressed. The proposed linear versus nonlinear performance analysis is uncommon in the open literature since high power analysis is seldom treated in multi-bit phase and amplitude control circuits and even more valuable considering the relatively higher targeted operating bandwidth than previously published material. A useful insight into some design trade-offs required when synthesizing this class of circuits at Ku-band or above are here provided.

Its key highlight is the in-sensitivity to the input-referred offset of the error amplifier. This is advantageous compared to the prior work with high  $3\sigma $ -accuracy. In the prior work, the offset of error amplifier affects not only the PTAT current but also the CTAT current. This makes it necessary to greatly reduce the offset of error amplifier, leading to a huge area and power consumption. By contrast, this work proposes a new automatic current-controlled feedback loop, which greatly reduces the influence of the error amplifier offset on the BGR accuracy. As a result, the error amplifier no longer needs to consume large area or power in order to reduce its offset. This effectively reduces the area and power of the entire BGR circuit. For a fair comparison, both the prior work and this work are designed under the same  $0.13~\mu \text{m}$  CMOS process. Post-layout simulation results show that the power of the error amplifier is reduced by about 9 times when compared to the prior work. Furthermore, the total power of the proposed BGR circuit is also reduced by 2.5 times than the prior work.</description></item><item><title>CBRAM-Based Bio-Inspired Circuit for the Emulation and Treatment of the Parkinson&#8217;s Disease</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10342760</link><description>In recent years, the intrinsic neuromorphic properties of memristor devices have led to their extensive use in brain-inspired circuits and systems.

Due to the positive feedback path attributed to the complexity of the three-stacked power stage layout, typical capacitive neutralization techniques alone are insufficient to achieve high gain and stability at the same time. To solve this problem, we proposed an LC shunt-feedback technique that can alleviate performance degradation caused by parasitic inductance in the gate node of a power transistor.

The proposed FTA is composed of three functional parts, i.e., an independent amplitude-phase controlling metasurface (MS) on the top, a polarization-converter on the bottom, and a feeding antenna. Particularly, by using spatially designed amplitude on the aperture of the top MS with the specification of the Taylor distribution, much lower side-lobe levels (SLLs) could be effectively realized. The ray-tracing method is used to reduce the profile height and integrate both the feeding antenna and the polarization converter.

These signals have a high peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR), which drives the power amplifier (PA) to early saturation. This brief proposes an analog predistortion method to linearize the power amplifier (PA) for wideband transmission systems like 5G. It utilizes a rat-race-coupler-based intermodulation generator to generate intermodulation terms, and it uses a Tunable-power divider (T-PD) based on varactor diode-controlled crossover structures to control the characteristics of the predistotered signal. This removes the dependencies on the bulky vector modulator which is frequently used in the conventional APD design. This also reduces the overall footprint. In order to validate the concept, the proposed APD with PA is tested with 64-QAM OFDM test signals of bandwidth 20 MHz and 100 MHz. It achieves a maximum improvement in the adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) and normalized mean square error (NMSE) of 23.67 dB and 18.21 dB, respectively, over that of PA. Though the components are designed at a center frequency of 3.5 GHz, the proposed method is tested in a frequency range of 3 to 3.8 GHz and provides a significant improvement in ACPR and NMSE across the entire frequency range.</description></item><item><title>Optimal IC Task Mapping to Maximize QoS on Heterogeneous Multicore Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304293</link><description>Heterogeneous multicore architectures have become one of the most widely used hardware platforms for embedded systems, where time, energy, and system QoS are the major concerns. The Imprecise Computation (IC) model splits a task into mandatory and optional parts, allowing the trade-off of the above issues. However, existing approaches, to maximize system QoS (Quality-of-Service) under time or energy constraints, use a linear function to model system QoS. Therefore, they become unsuitable for general applications, whose QoS is modeled by a concave function. To deal with this limitation, this brief addresses the Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) problem of mapping IC tasks to a set of heterogeneous cores by concurrently deciding which processor executes each task and the number of cycles of optional tasks (i.e., task allocation and scheduling), under real-time and energy supply constraints. Furthermore, as existing solution algorithms either demand high time complexity or only achieve feasible solutions, we propose a novel approach based on problem transformation and dual decomposition that finds an optimal solution while avoiding high computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves 98% performance of the optimization solver Gurobi, but only with 19.8% of its computation time.</description></item><item><title>Finite-Time Self-Triggered Stabilization for Networked Power System With Deception Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10306282</link><description>This brief investigates the finite-time self-triggered stabilization for networked power system under deception attacks. Compared with event-triggered protocol, the extra hardware is not required to monitor the system state in the adopted self-triggered protocol, and only the latest samples and plants information are used to predict the next triggered instant, which effectively avoids the resource waste. Subsequently, a mathematical model is developed for finite-time self-triggered control with deception attacks. Taking the transient performance of power system into account, sufficient criteria to realize the underlying power system with prescribe  $H_{\infty }$  performance are obtained by means of finite time bounded theory. Furthermore, based on the linear matrix inequality framework, the expected solvability is constructed for finite-time controller.

Due to networked resource limitations and storage capacity restrictions, the exact information of their neighbors cannot be obtained by the agents. In this brief, it is supposed that the information exchanged between agents is quantized using a quantizer. By utilizing the open-loop estimation approach, an event-triggered control protocol is established, where the information communication with any connected neighbor is made discontinuously. To further reduce energy consumption, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism is designed, wherein a dynamic variable is assigned to each agent to dynamically govern its threshold. It is demonstrated that the presented control scheme can circumvent the Zeno behavior and the consensus control objective can be achieved. The validity of the theoretical analysis is manifested by the simulation results.</description></item><item><title>Deterministic Reinforcement Learning Consensus Control of Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems via Autonomous Convergence Perception</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10345763</link><description>This brief addresses an approximate optimal consensus control problem for multi-agent systems (MAS) using an autonomous perception empowered deterministic reinforcement learning scheme.

However, the low resistance of magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) results in significant power consumption in a conventional crossbar array, making it challenging to construct an efficient logic-in-memory. In this brief, we present a crossbar array of voltage-gated spin-orbit torque (SOT)-MRAM devices and establish a logic-in-memory scheme that implements majority gates in the crossbar arrays for reading operations. The multiple cells of the voltage-gated SOT-MRAM devices are connected in series, and each branch&#8217;s resistance is determined by adding the resistances of all the selected cells on it. In comparison to parallel connection schemes, the effective resistance  $({R_{eff}})$  in series connections are 25 times greater, resulting in lower read currents and improved energy efficiency. A case study of a 1-bit full adder serves as proof of the proposed logic-in-memory based on majority gates. These results indicate that the resistance summation in the voltage-gated SOT-MRAM crossbar arrays with majority gates is a preferred platform for logic-in-memory.</description></item><item><title>A New Design of Low Hardware Cost and Low Power Programmable FIR Filters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10320430</link><description>Programmable Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters (Proakis et al., 2007) are widely used in various fields such as communication, radio, audio, and signal processing. The Reconfigurable Multiple Constant Multiplication (RMCM) modules are commonly employed to design programmable FIR filters. In this brief, we propose a novel RMCM optimization algorithm to optimize the hardware cost and power consumption of the RMCM module which means lower chip area and lower operating power consumption. In order to reduce the overall search space, a segmented analysis method that divided the global search space into several sub-search spaces is first proposed. In addition, we introduce a novel necessity-first search algorithm for each sub-search space, which can optimize the structures of the multiplexers and shifters in the RMCM module simultaneously. The benchmark filters examples show that the proposed method can reduce the hardware cost and power consumption by at least 13.04% and 2.74% compared with the existing state-of-art methods.</description></item><item><title>A Weight Mapping Strategy for More Fully Exploiting Data in CIM-Based CNN Accelerator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10328651</link><description>Compute-in-memory accelerators have been extensively researched to overcome the limitations of the von Neumann architecture.

We employed NeuroSim to simulate the inference of various networks of different scales. Experimental results demonstrate that our method performs 36.51% higher in energy efficiency and 48.15% higher in speedup when applied to the VGG16 large-scale model under area constraints.</description></item><item><title>An 11T SRAM Cell for the Dual-Direction In-Array Logic/CAM Operations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10330703</link><description>The in-memory computing (IMC) architecture eliminates the frequent data transfers between the memory banks and the processor cores. Researchers have utilized different SRAM cells to implement the in-memory logic operations. However, most of the previous works implement the column-wise logic/CAM operations, which require the column-wise stored operands. These column-wise logic/CAM operations are incompatible with the traditional row-wise SRAM mode. This brief proposes an SRAM cell with 11 transistors, which can work in four operation modes: the SRAM mode, the logic mode, and the BCAM/TCAM modes. All the operations in these four modes can be performed both in the column-wise and the row-wise style. The incompatibility between different modes is eliminated. In the logic mode, the proposed SRAM achieves frequency of 595MHz and energy consumption of 17.94fJ/bit at 1.2V with TSMC 65nm technology file. In the BCAM/TCAM modes, it can work with 407MHz, and it consumes 0.62fJ/bit and 1.38fJ/bit at 1.2V</description></item><item><title>SI PUF: An SRAM and Inverter-Based PUF With a Bit Error Rate of 0.0053% and 0.073/0.042 pJ/bit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10354440</link><description>The physical unclonable function (PUF) can generate a unique identifier for each chip, ideal for key generation and chip anti-counterfeiting. The reliability of PUF is paramount, and therefore is one of the significant challenges for PUF design. This brief proposes a novel SRAM- and Inverter-based PUF (SI PUF) that can operate as either an SRAM PUF or an inverter PUF, depending on the input configuration signal. A zero-overhead bit configuration strategy (BCS) is proposed to enhance the reliability of PUF. Moreover, the working voltage of the sub-threshold level and the well-designed discharge stage ensure that our SI PUF can operate with low power consumption. The tested results of chips fabricated in 40-nm CMOS show that our SI PUF has only 0.0053% of the worst bit error rate (BER) under working conditions of &#8722;50 to 125&#176;C and 0.75 to 1.5V, with 0.073/0.042 pJ/bit of power consumption. The low BER and energy overhead illustrate that our SI PUF is more suitable for resource-limited devices compared to DAC 2022 and JSSC 2020.</description></item><item><title>Wide Dynamic-Range and High-Efficiency Shunt-Diode Rectifier Based on Class-R Harmonic Control and Resistance Compression Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315228</link><description>This brief presents a novel methodology for designing a high-efficiency and wide dynamic-range (DR) rectifier with shunt-diode configuration for wireless power transfer (WPT) and energy harvesting (EH). The proposed structure employs, in the first time, an impedance variation reduction (IVR) mechanism based on the principle of the resistance compression network (RCN) for fundamental matching and a harmonic control based on the class-R operation, which can minimize both impedance mismatch loss and diode loss, and then achieve optimal power conversion efficiency (PCE) within a wide range of input power. A rectifier using a Schottky diode model BAT15&#8211;03W is designed and measured at a target frequency of 2.45 GHz for verification. In accordance with measurements, the rectifier can yield peak PCE of 82.3% at 12 dBm while a wide DR of &lt;50%, indicating a superior performance to the other designs.</description></item><item><title>A Modified Levenberg Marquardt Algorithm for Simultaneous Learning of Multiple Datasets</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10330102</link><description>Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm is a powerful approach to optimize the parameters of a neural network (NN).

For each dataset a pre-selected set of parameters are allowed for modification and the proposed scheme reformulates the Jacobian under the switching mechanism. The results show that a NN can store information available in different datasets by a simple modification to the original LM algorithm, which is the novelty introduced in this brief. The results are verified on a regression problem.</description></item><item><title>A Three-Branch RF Rectifier With Extended Input Power Range Based on Automatic Power Distribution Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10330706</link><description>This brief proposes a three-branch radio frequency (RF) rectifier that adopts a new circuit structure and automatic power distribution technique (APDT) to widen the range of input power. The proposed rectifier includes three branches that operate at different input power levels: low, medium, and high. The proposed APDT is designed according to the input impedance of each branch and distributes the input power automatically to the three branches. In this way, only one branch is active for a specific input power level and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) at the boundary of different power levels can be optimized. For validation, a three-branch rectifier working at 2.4 GHz was implemented and compared with other designs. The experiment results show that the measured PCE is greater than 50% within an input power range of &#8722;1.5 to 29 dBm, and the range of input power is widened to 30.5 dB. In addition, the input return loss  $\boldsymbol {|S_{11}|}$  is less than &#8722;10 dB with a range of 38 dB.</description></item><item><title>A Three-Port Resonant Converter With Switches Multiplexing and Suppressed Switching Frequency Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10312741</link><description>This brief proposes a high efficiency three-port topology with simple structure.

In CHBIs, the cascading of H-bridge power cells generates the step inverter output voltage, so the individual or group of switches is responsible for the respective voltage level output. The OSF with a healthy anti-parallel diode is considered for the proposed switch fault detection and localization algorithm. The complexity of fault detection and localization is defined with respect to the fault signatures obtained from the individual switches at the output. The fault signatures of the diagonally opposite switches of the  $p^{th}$  H-bridge are approximately similar for ( $2{p}+$ 1)-level CHBI, where  ${p}$  is an odd positive integer. The non-ideal characteristics of semiconductor switches are used for the proposed fast and accurate OSF detection and associated switch fault localization logic design.</description></item><item><title>A General Voltage Optimization Method for Different Capacitive-Power-Transfer Coupler Pairs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10318177</link><description>Due to the small dielectric constant in air, the corresponding small coupled capacitances make a capacitive power transfer (CPT) system usually suffer high voltage stresses not only on the face-to-face coupler pairs but also on the lateral and crossing coupler pairs, thus increasing the risks of air breakdown and electric field (E-field) radiation. To solve it, this brief proposes a general method to optimize the aforementioned voltage stresses on the different coupler pairs simultaneously via a voltage vector triangle model. The detailed design principles involving the key parameters of compensation network are also given for four basic compensations. Besides of voltage optimization of coupler pairs, a CPT system is usually required to provide the load-independent constant current (CC) or constant voltage (CV) output under a specified power level. Therefore, the high-order compensation networks are used and analyzed to increase the design freedom of the basic four compensations and achieve controllable CC/CV output, while the voltage characteristics on the coupler pairs still remain. Finally, a 1 MHz LC-LCLC compensated CPT prototype is demonstrated and implemented with load-independent CV output, input zero-phase angle (ZPA), and voltage simultaneous optimization on all coupler pairs.</description></item><item><title>Common Ground Buck Type Five-Level Transformerless Inverter With Less Stress</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10324330</link><description>The presented brief introduces a new switched capacitor-based transformer-less inverter (SC TLI). This SC TLI configuration is based on a reduced switch count employing only six switches, one of which is a bidirectional switch. It uses only one power source and two SCs to obtain a five-level output voltage. A level shift pulse width modulation (LS-PWM) based simple logic circuit controls SC TLI. It also handles capacitor charging and discharging during operation for each fundamental cycle. The SCs are self-balanced and do not require any specific controller. Further, detailed comparative studies are performed with existing arts of literature to determine the merits of the SC TLI. A prototype SC TLI model is made in the laboratory. The experimental results from the laboratory prototype validate the feasibility of the SC TLI.

Finally, this SC TLI performance characteristic is presented for different loading conditions.</description></item><item><title>Ka-Band Efficient Rectifier With Enhanced Power Capability Using Power Distributing Network and High-Q Bandstop Filter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10328652</link><description>This brief presents a Ka-band rectifier that utilizes power distributing technology to enhance its power handling capability. The matching network and power distributing network are integrated to simultaneously match the diode impedance and distribute power to eight Schottky diodes. A novel bandstop filter for millimeter-wave bands is proposed, which is composed of high  ${Q}$  cylindrical cavities and a coaxial line. This filter not only effectively suppress harmonics but also exhibits low loss characteristics. The fabricated rectifier, operating at 35 GHz, shows a measured  $\unicode{0x007C}S_{11} \unicode{0x007C}$  of &#8722;20.3 dB and a power conversion efficiency of 61.9% at the input power of 29 dBm. Efficiencies under different loads are compared, and it is found that  $50 \Omega $  is the best load. To the best of our knowledge, this rectifier has the highest power capability among existing works. Due to its high-power capability and efficiency, this rectifier shows potential for use in wireless power transfer systems to provide power to electronic devices.</description></item><item><title>Bi-Polar Buck-Boost Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10363770</link><description>In this brief, a bi-polar buck-boost DC-DC converter is formulated. A three-switch based LC-cell (TSLC) is responsible for bi-polar load voltage realization while front-end quadratic boost cell (QBC) effectively gives buck-boost voltage gain feature. The existence of front-end QBC ensures low source ripple current profile. This bi-polar converter is established with a lower number of controlled switching devices, yet it exhibits better boosting capability even in the positive output load voltage operating conditions. Also, a simple complementary gating scheme without any dead-band is employed to realize bi-polar load voltages. Detailed analysis (steady-state and small-signal models) is formulated and performance aspects are investigated. For concept demonstration, a 12 to &#177;42 V, 50 kHz prototype bi-polar converter system is built. The experimental results are in close agreement with the analysis.</description></item><item><title>Model-Free Predictive Frequency Control Under Sensor and Actuator FDI Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10342751</link><description>This brief investigates the load frequency control (LFC) issue of an interconnected power system under sensor and actuator false data injection (FDI) attacks. To this end, a novel model-free control method, ultra-local model-free predictive control (ULMFPC), is proposed as the secondary frequency controller to deal with the coordinated FDI attacks and system physical limitations. In contrast to the approaches available in the literature, the presented ULMFPC approach does not need the state estimation of observers and the mathematical model of the system. This method can independently cope with disruptions injected into the system. The ULMFPC considers the employed plant as a dependent system and utilizes predictive control in a constantly updated linear model to track the reference and control limitation. Unlike other predictive control methods, there is no training data set in the presented control strategy, and only small-scale convex optimization is essential for control computation. The proposed control method performance is evaluated by the Speedgoat real-time emulator and compared with the MPC and distributed economic MPC (DEMPC) methods under sensor and actuator FDI attacks. The experimental results indicate that the proposed ULMFPC technique provides much better dynamic responses compared to other methods.</description></item><item><title>Bifurcation Analysis and Criterion of Voltage Oscillation Induced by Low Voltage Ride Through Control in Renewable Energy Stations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10363634</link><description>The voltage stability issue of renewable energy stations (RES) cannot be ignored. In this brief, for the Voltage Oscillation Instability phenomenon caused by the Low voltage ride through during High active power output of the RES with No faults (VOI-LHN), works on both theory and criterion are conducted. In theory, it is explained that the VOI-LHN corresponds to a High active power output and Low voltage ride through control induced Non-smooth Bifurcation (HLINB). Furthermore, based on theoretical derivation and actual power grid parameters, the boundary between HLINB and Saddle Node Bifurcation (SNB) is obtained. The boundary suggests that in actual power grids, wind farms are more prone to HLINB than SNB. In criterion, a criterion for the occurrence of HLINB is developed, and a threshold calculation method for the criterion is proposed.</description></item><item><title>Robust Active Noise Control: Minimum Output Variance Approach With Least Mean Lp-Norm Algorithm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10330647</link><description>The filtered-x least mean  ${\mathcal {([A-Z]+)}}_{([a-z]+)}$ -norm (FxLMP) algorithm, renowned for its widespread usage, exhibits superior performance over the filtered-x Least Mean Square (FxLMS) algorithm in impulsive noise-afflicted environments. Nevertheless, the FxLMP algorithm experiences performance degradation when confronted with nonlinearity in either the primary or secondary path. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm known as the minimum output variance filtered-s LMP (MOV-FsLMP), which effectively tackles nonlinear active noise control problems by imposing constraints on variance or power. Notably, this proposed algorithm exhibits improved convergence and stability even in impulsive noise environments, all while maintaining lower computational complexity. Extensive simulations validate the efficacy of the proposed MOV-FsLMP method, surpassing that of state-of-the-art alternatives.</description></item><item><title>PhGraph: A High-Performance ReRAM-Based Accelerator for Hypergraph Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10360252</link><description>Hypergraph processing has emerged as an effective approach to analyze complex multilateral relationships in real-world scenarios. Existing hypergraph processing solutions based on conventional architectures are severely bottlenecked by off-chip memory accesses. In this article, we propose the first processing-in-memory (PIM)-featured ReRAM-based hypergraph accelerator, dubbed PhGraph, which facilitates performance- and energy-efficient hypergraph processing. On the hardware level, PhGraph integrates analog memristor-based PIM (with high-matrix-grained parallelism) and digital memristor-based PIM (for high-bipartite-edge-grained efficiency) into one standalone solution. On the software level, an overlap-aware hypergraph partitioning mechanism is proposed to polarize hypergraph workloads into matrix-formatted dense and bipartite-edge-formatted sparse partitions for performance acceleration using analog memristor-based PIM and digital ones, respectively. In addition, PhGraph is equipped with load-balanced partition scheduling and algorithm mapping co-designs to boost hardware utilization and efficiency. Experimental results show that PhGraph outperforms the state-of-the-art CPU-, FPGA-, and ASIC-based solutions by up to 4, $309.81\times $ ,  $547.13\times $ , and  $166.76\times $  in terms of performance, and 36, $416.11\times $ ,  $924.12\times $ , and  $41.44\times $  in terms of energy-savings, respectively.</description></item><item><title>PATH: Evaluation of Boolean Logic Using Path-Based In-Memory Computing Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10365674</link><description>In-memory computing using nonvolatile memory is a promising pathway to accelerate data-intensive applications. While substantial research efforts have been dedicated to executing Boolean logic using digital in-memory computing, the limitation of state-of-the-art paradigms is that they heavily rely on repeatedly switching the state of the nonvolatile resistive devices using expensive WRITE operations. In this article, we propose a new in-memory computing paradigm called path-based computing (PATH) for evaluating Boolean logic. Computation within the paradigm is performed using a one-time expensive compilation phase and a fast and efficient evaluation phase. The key property of the paradigm is that the execution phase only involves cheap READ operations. First, we define an analogy between binary decision diagrams (BDDs) and one-transistor one-memristor (1T1M) crossbars that allows Boolean functions to be mapped into crossbar designs. When such crossbar design becomes too large to be physically realizable, we propose to synthesize the Boolean function into a PATH system. A PATH system consists of a topology of staircase structures. A staircase structure is a cascade of hardwired crossbars, which minimizes intercrossbar communication. We evaluate the proposed paradigm using ten circuits from the Revlib benchmark suite, eight control circuits of the EPFL benchmark suite, and eight ISCAS85 benchmarks. Compared with state-of-the-art digital in-memory computing paradigms, PATH improves energy and latency with  $1006 \times $  and  $10 \times $  on average, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Mapping of Large-Scale Spiking Convolutional Neural Networks Onto Resource-Constrained Neuromorphic Processor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10363652</link><description>Neuromorphic processors have been designed as nonvon Neumann systems for energy-efficient spiking neural network (SNN) execution. Spiking convolutional neural networks (SCNNs), combining the advantage of convolutional neural network (CNN) and SNN, have been widely applied to vision tasks. However, as the scale of SCNNs increases, executing large-scale SCNNs on resource-constrained neuromorphic processor faces many challenges, including massive synapse pruning, caused by resource competition, execution performance degradation, etc. Addressing these problems, we propose an efficient approach to map large-scale SCNNs onto resource-constrined neuromorphic processor. The approach consists of three steps: 1) splitting; 2) partitioning; and 3) mapping. We explore three acyclic splitting strategies to divide large-scale SCNNs into subnetworks without cyclic dependency. Axon sharing is the guiding principle to partition subnetworks into multiple clusters. To obtain an optimal cluster-to-core mapping scheme, we use nondominated sorting genetic algorithm to collaboratively optimize two metrics. We evaluate our approach with eight realistic SCNN applications. The results show that compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, our approach significantly reduces the synapse pruning and accuracy loss, and increases the execution performance.</description></item><item><title>NicePIM: Design Space Exploration for Processing-In-Memory DNN Accelerators With 3-D Stacked-DRAM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10359114</link><description>With the widespread use of deep neural networks (DNNs) in intelligent systems, DNN accelerators with high performance and energy efficiency are greatly demanded. As one of the feasible processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures, 3-D stacked-DRAM-based PIM (DRAM-PIM) architecture enables large-capacity memory and low-cost memory access, which is a promising solution for DNN accelerators with better performance and energy efficiency. However, the low-access-cost characteristics of stacked DRAM and the distributed manner of memory access and data storing require us to rebalance the hardware design and DNN mapping. In this article, we propose NicePIM to efficiently explore the design space of hardware architecture and DNN mapping of DRAM-PIM-based DNN inference accelerators, which consists of three key components: 1) PIM-Tuner; 2) PIM-Mapper; and 3) data-scheduler. PIM-Tuner optimizes the hardware configurations leveraging a DNN model for classifying area-compliant PIM-node designs and a deep kernel learning model for identifying better-hardware parameters. PIM-Mapper explores a variety of DNN mapping configurations, including parallelism between branches of DNN, DNN layer partitioning, DRAM capacity allocation, and data layout pattern in DRAM, to generate high-hardware-utilization DNN mapping schemes for various hardware configurations. The data-scheduler employs an integer-linear-programming-based data scheduling algorithm to alleviate the inter-PIM-node communication overhead of data-sharing brought by DNN layer partitioning. Experimental results demonstrate that NicePIM can optimize hardware configurations for DRAM-PIM systems effectively and can generate high-quality DNN mapping schemes with latency and energy cost reduced by 37% and 28% on average, respectively, compared to the baseline method.</description></item><item><title>General Purpose Deep Learning Accelerator Based on Bit Interleaving</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10359130</link><description>Along with the rapid evolution of deep neural networks, the ever-increasing complexity imposes formidable computation intensity on the hardware accelerator. In this article, we propose a novel computing philosophy called &#8220;bit interleaving&#8221; and the associate accelerator couple called &#8220;Bitlet&#8221; and Bitlet-X to maximally exploit the bit-level sparsity. Apart from the existing bit-serial/parallel accelerators, Bitlet leverages the abundant &#8220;sparsity parallelism&#8221; in the parameters to enforce the inference acceleration. Bitlet is versatile by supporting diverse precisions on a single platform, including floating-point 32 and fixed-point from  $1b$  to  $24b$ . The versatility enables Bitlet feasible for both efficient inference and training. Besides, by updating the key compute engine in the accelerator, Bitlet-X could furthermore improve the peak power consumption and efficiency for the inference-only scenario, with competitive accuracy. Empirical studies on 12 domain-specific deep learning applications highlight the following results: 1) up to  $81\times /21\times $  energy efficiency improvement for training/inference over recent high-performance GPUs; 2) up to  $15\times /8\times $  higher speedup/efficiency over state-of-the-art fixed-point accelerators; 3)  $1.5 {\mathrm{ mm}}^{2}$  area and scalable power consumption from 570 mW  $(fp32)$  to 432 mW  $(16b)$  and 365 mW  $(8b) \text{@}28$ -nm TSMC; 4)  $1.3\times $  improvement of the peak power efficiency for the Bitlet-X over Bitlet; and 5) highly configurable justified by the ablation and sensitivity studies.</description></item><item><title>An Automatic Neural Network Architecture-and-Quantization Joint Optimization Framework for Efficient Model Inference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10342823</link><description>Efficient deep learning models, especially optimized for edge devices, benefit from low inference latency to efficient energy consumption. Two classical techniques for efficient model inference are lightweight neural architecture search (NAS), which automatically designs compact network models, and quantization, which reduces the bit-precision of neural network models. As a consequence, joint design for both neural architecture and quantization precision settings is becoming increasingly popular. There are three main aspects that affect the performance of the joint optimization between neural architecture and quantization: 1) quantization precision selection (QPS); 2) quantization-aware training (QAT); and 3) NAS. However, existing works focus on at most twofold of these aspects, and result in secondary performance. To this end, we proposed a novel automatic optimization framework, DAQU, that allows jointly searching for Pareto-optimal neural architecture and quantization precision combination among more than  $10^{47}$  quantized subnet models. To overcome the instability of the conventional automatic optimization framework, DAQU incorporates a warm-up strategy to reduce the accuracy gap among different neural architectures, and a precision-transfer training approach to maintain flexibility among different quantization precision settings. Our experiments show that the quantized lightweight neural networks generated by DAQU consistently outperform state-of-the-art NAS and quantization joint optimization methods.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Supply Noise Aware Timing Analysis With JIT Machine Learning Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10356894</link><description>The incessant decrease in transistor size has led to reduced voltage noise margins and exacerbated power integrity challenges. This trend intensifies concerns about the efficacy of conventional static timing analysis (STA), which traditionally assumes a constant power supply level, often resulting in imprecise and overly conservative outcomes. To address this, this article proposes a dynamic-noise-aware STA engine enhanced by just-in-time (JIT) machine learning (ML) integration. This approach employs the Weibull cumulative distribution function (CDF) to accurately represent dynamic power supply noise (PSN). We perform gate-level characterization, assessing delay and transition time for each timing arc under variations in input transition time, output capacitance, and three PSN-aware parameters. The timing for each timing arc can then be predicted by a multilayer perceptron (MLP), trained with the characterization data. Finally, by incorporating JIT compilation techniques, we integrate trained MLP models into the STA engine, achieving both computational efficiency and flexibility. Experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately estimate the timing fluctuation due to dynamic PSN, with an average relative error of 4.89% for single-cell estimations and 6.27% for path delay estimations.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Design Qualities Utilizing Multibit Flip-Flops: A Design and Technology Co-Optimization Driven Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10336914</link><description>Multibit flip-flops (MBFFs) are widely used in modern circuit designs to save the power consumption. That is, the benefit of using MBFFs as opposed to single-bit flip-flops is sharing in-cell clock inverters among the master and slave latches in the internal flip-flops of MBFFs. Theoretically, the more flip-flops an MBFF has, the more power saving it can achieve. However, in practice, physically increasing the size of MBFF to accommodate many flip-flops imposes two new challenging problems in physical design: 1) nonflexible MBFF cell flipping for multiple D-to-Q signals and 2) unbalanced or wasted use of MBFF footprint space. In this work, we solve the two problems in a way to enhance routability and timing at the placement and routing stages. Precisely, for problem 1, we make the nonflexible MBFF cell flipping be fully flexible by generating MBFF layouts supporting diverse D-to-Q flow directions in the detailed placement to improve routability and for problem 2, we enhance the setup and clock-to-Q delay on timing critical flip-flops in MBFF through gate upsizing (i.e., transistor folding) by using the unused internal space in MBFF to improve timing slack at the post-routing stage. Through experiments with benchmark circuits, it is shown that our proposed design and technology co-optimization (DTCO) flow for designs with MBFFs is able to produce chip implementations with 20.5% fewer design rule violations and 47.7% reduced worst-timing slack with a little power fluctuation in comparison with that produced by the conventional design flow with MBFFs.</description></item><item><title>Aging-Aware Energy-Efficient Task Deployment of Heterogeneous Multicore Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10283861</link><description>Heterogeneous multicore systems, which consist of high-performance and power-efficient cores, are emerging to satisfy the various demands on performance and power consumption. On the other hand, as CMOS technology continues to shrink in size, the aging effect, which can cause performance degradation or timing failures, has become a non-negligible threat to lifetime reliability. To overcome the challenges under the aging effect, various approaches have been proposed in previous studies. Most previous studies, however, did not consider the different characteristics of big and little cores. In addition, most of them do not consider critical tasks with the strict timing requirements present in real-time applications, resulting in early system failure. Therefore, considering different characteristics of cores and the presence of critical tasks, we propose an aging-aware task deployment framework for real-time systems. In this framework, for high-performance big cores, we propose a novel asymmetric aging-aware strategy. This strategy finds an energy-efficient task-to-core assignment to reserve some healthy cores at the early system life stage. The reserved cores are kept idle with the lowest voltage and can execute critical tasks at the late system life stage, extending the system lifetime. Meanwhile, the nonreserved cores use lower voltages to execute tasks, reducing the aging effect. For energy-efficient little cores, we adopt the symmetric aging-aware strategy to balance out the aging effect of each little core. With a balanced aging effect, the utilization of little cores is improved. In addition, we propose voltage/frequency boosting and task migration techniques to increase the number of cores that can meet the task timing constraints. Compared to the state of the art, the proposed framework can achieve  $1.10\times $  lifetime improvement and 5% energy reduction.</description></item></channel></rss>
