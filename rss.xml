This work presents a framework for quantifying passive component performance by reviewing both existing methods and robust device figures-of-merit (FOM). A comprehensive survey yields aggregated data for nearly 700 000 commercial capacitors and inductors of all types. To supplement deficiencies in this data, this work proposes and validates several empirical expressions to estimate passive component energy storage and mass. The estimation of volumetric mass density per component type allows the approximation of component mass from accessible box volume. The estimation of energy-equivalent capacitance in nonlinear Class II ceramic capacitors facilitates the evaluation of stored energy and related energy density FOM. A phenomenological analysis of the comprehensive component data produces several conclusory determinations about peak energy density capabilities&#8212;with respect to volume, mass, and cost&#8212;across capacitor and inductor technologies.</description></item><item><title>Artificial Intelligence Applications in High-Frequency Magnetic Components Design for Power Electronics Systems: An Overview</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478550</link><description>This article provides an overview of how artificial intelligence (AI) is applied in designing high-frequency magnetic components, primarily high-frequency inductors and transformers, for power electronics systems.

However, high-frequency switching can cause overshoots, oscillations, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) issues. Because of a fixed gate driving strength, the traditional gate driver struggles with the tradeoff between overshoot and switching loss (switching speed). To improve the switching performance of the SiC power devices, an active gate driver (AGD) integrated circuit is proposed using a 0.18-&#956;m CMOS HV BCD process is proposed in this article. Instead of requiring a separate programmable logic board, the controller circuits and driving stage are integrated on a chip. The proposed gate voltage sensing technique detects the slope difference of the gate voltage and generates the appropriate gate driving signals without detecting the SiC mosfet ID and VDS information. The area and cost are reduced by removing the high-voltage sensing circuit for ID and VDS detection. The proposed AGD can also attenuate the oscillations of ID and VDS, further reduce the EMI noise induced by high switching speed. In addition, the experimental results show that the proposed AGD can be applied to different SiC power mosfets.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Topology Self-Adjusted Fault Current Limiter for VSC-LVDC Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433796</link><description>The low voltage direct current (LVdc) system effectively integrates renewable energy sources and diverse dc loads. It eliminates unnecessary energy conversion steps between dc distribution units and ac grids, thereby enhancing energy efficiency. In LVdc systems, voltage source converters (VSCs) serve as vital interfaces for converting energy between ac and dc systems, however, their capability on dc fault ride-through is usually lacked. Furthermore, the existing dc circuit breakers struggle to reliably isolate faults before VSCs blocked, thereby compromising VSC safety. To address these issues, this article introduces a novel topology self-adjusted fault current limiter (NSAFCL). In normal operating mode, the impedance of NSAFCL is controlled in a parallel state, and a bias power with adaptable output is designed to bypass NSAFCL, minimizing its influence during normal operation. In fault mode, the impedance of NSAFCL is controlled in a series state, and a current limiting resistor is introduced, shaving the fault current and maintaining the fault voltage. Finally, the simulation and experiment are conducted to verify the feasibility of NSAFCL, and results demonstrate that compared to traditional schemes, the proposed NSAFCL offers extended current limitations, prevents VSC blocking, and reduces the peak fault current by 70%.</description></item><item><title>Unified Small-Signal Impedance Modeling and Analysis of Multi-Pulse Rectifier Units for More Electric Aircraft</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472071</link><description>Moving toward the more electric aircraft (MEA) technology, the power converters, which present as constant power loads (CPL), are increasingly used in the aircraft power system. The CPLs exhibit negative impedance, which may impair the system stability. Since the multipulse rectifier units (MPRUs) are the major secondary power supplies of the MEA variable-frequency ac power system (VFAC-PS), a unified small-signal impedance model of the MPRUs in the d&#8211;q frame is established. On this basis, the terminal characteristics of the MPRUs are analyzed. Then, a case study of a MPRU connected with a motor drive system is carried out to demonstrate the effects of variable-frequency of the ac voltage therein and the MDS&#8217; controller parameters on the system stability. Finally, the accuracy of the unified impedance model and the correctness of the theoretical analysis are verified by the experiments from the hardware-in-the-loop platform of the MEA VFAC-PS.</description></item><item><title>Reconfiguration of Bipolar HVDC System for Continuous Transmission Under DC Line Fault</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10479176</link><description>This article proposes a reconfiguration method for the bipolar high voltage dc transmission (HVDC) system connecting offshore wind power plants (WPPs). Conventional bipolar HVDC systems can continue to transmit half the rated power even if a dc fault occurs at one of the two poles. However, the shutdown of half of the entire WPPs is inevitable because WPPs cannot continue operations on their own. Once the WPPs are shut down, they take a long time to restart. The power transmission decreases during the time and it imposes a negative effect on the onshore ac system. The proposed reconfiguration method immediately removes the dc fault and relocates the converters and WPPs from the faulted pole to the healthy pole by disconnecting switches. Furthermore, the reconfiguration is designed based on the fault ride-through (FRT) capability of the WPPs specified by the existing grid code. As a result, the reconfiguration realizes the continuous operation of the entire WPPs even if a dc line fault occurs. Therefore, the proposed method can improve the supply reliability. The validity of the proposed method is verified by electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations.</description></item><item><title>Study of Voltage Flicker Mitigation Using Emulated Electric Arc Furnace</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478641</link><description>A strategy of the power-electronics-based emulation of the electric arc furnace (EAF) in the laboratory has been developed.

Then, the effect of the switch open-circuit fault on the voltage waveform characteristics of the inverter is analyzed. Subsequently, a fast diagnosis method for the open-circuit fault of the inverter switch tube is proposed, the method can accurately locate the fault within several switching cycles by comparing the temporal position relationship between the characteristics waveform of dc voltage and the changes of switching control signal. Finally, the feasibility and accuracy of the method are verified by experiments.</description></item><item><title>In Situ Detection of GaN $C_{\text{oss}}$ Changes Due to Aging for Device State-of-Health Determination in DC&#8211;DC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10492694</link><description>Detecting the power-device state-of-health (SOH) during converter operation can enhance the overall system reliability by predicting imminent failure scenarios. While various aging indicators for gallium nitride (GaN) devices have been demonstrated in the literature, few are practically measurable in an active converter. This article demonstrates that the large-signal device output capacitance ($C_{\text{oss}}$) is a reliable indicator of short-circuit (SC) aging, and proposes an in situ measurement technique to capture its value by leveraging the operational waveforms of soft-switching converters. The method relies only on the converter operating condition along with the switching modulation and does not require direct measurement of the inductor current. Experimental results for three different GaN devices show a 5%&#8211;10% decrease in the large-signal $C_{\text{oss}}$ after 5000 SC cycles, proving the usefulness of this parameter as an SOH indicator. The in situ measurement technique is demonstrated in a synchronous buck converter operating in discontinuous conduction mode, successfully capturing the SC-aging-induced change in $C_{\text{oss}}$. The presented results and proposed measurement technique pave the way for system-level monitoring of power-device SOH and self-calibrating operation.</description></item><item><title>Detection Method of Series Arc Fault in Three-Phase Frequency Converter Load Circuit Under Unknown Working Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10496898</link><description>Accurately detecting the series arc fault (SAF) in power lines and realizing the protection of the circuit are of great significance for effectively preventing electrical fire accidents. However, existing research results are difficult to effectively detect SAF that occurred in three-phase frequency converter load circuit under unknown working conditions. To solve the above problems, a new approach for SAF detection based on real-time training, updating prediction models and predicting residuals was proposed in this article. First, a prediction model based on dung beetle optimization algorithm optimized extreme learning machine was proposed. Second, SAF experiments in three-phase frequency converter load circuit were carried out under commercial power supply condition. The model was trained and updated by using two cycle current signals, so as to predict the next cycle current signal. The SAF detection was realized by combining the mean square error of the prediction residual and a threshold. Finally, the detection performance of the proposed method was tested under three unknown working conditions, which are different power harmonics, operating parameters of the frequency converter, and operating current, respectively. The results indicated that the proposed method can effectively detect the SAF occurred in the frequency converter load circuit under three unknown working conditions.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Comparison of Isolated High-Gain High-Voltage DC/DC Converters for Offshore Wind Farm Collection and Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375110</link><description>With the vigorous development of offshore wind energy, two-stage voltage step-up HVdc transmission has become a better choice compared with other transmission methods due to the lower cost and higher efficiency. It is essential to step-up the medium voltage (MV) level at the collection grid to the high voltage (HV) level at the export line. Therefore, the research on HV dc/dc converters has received widespread attention. This article introduces two modular multilevel dc/dc converters with high gain, HV, and galvanic isolation, which can be applied to connect the MVdc grid and HVdc grid in offshore wind energy systems. The topologies, operation principles, and control strategies of the two converters are illustrated in the article.

The operation principle and control strategy are validated by the simulation results and experiment results. The comparison results in terms of current stresses, costs, and power losses between these two converters and the two representative topologies previously proposed are presented. Then, the overall performance of each topology is evaluated based on the comparison results.</description></item><item><title>Data-Light Physics-Informed Modeling for the Modulation Optimization of a Dual-Active-Bridge Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10473116</link><description>In modulation optimization, power converter modeling is pivotal for performance evaluation. However, mainstream knowledge-based approaches suffer from low accuracy and heavy computation burden, while emerging data-driven methods are data-intensive and opaque black-box models. Even state-of-the-art physics-informed artificial intelligence (AI) is improper for modulation optimization due to resource-intensive retraining for new predictions. Hence, a physics-in-architecture recurrent neural network (PA-RNN), which customizes recurrent neurons to integrate physical laws into the structure, is proposed, tailoring for modulation optimization of power converters. The PA-RNN model reveals diverse circuit insights, exhibiting data-light merit and on-call prediction capability. Modulation optimization via PA-RNN involves two stages. First, PA-RNN constructs converter models in the time domain for direct performance evaluation. Second, an optimization algorithm interacts with the PA-RNN model to minimize current stress while realizing full-range soft switching. Two design cases are presented: first, modeling buck converters; second, optimizing dual-active-bridge converters under a triple phase-shift modulation or a five-degree-of-freedom modulation. Algorithm experiments and 1-kW hardware experiments have comprehensively validated the merits and feasibility of the proposed PA-RNN. Broadly speaking, this article strives to increase the penetration of AI in power electronics.</description></item><item><title>A Single-Switch Trans-Inverse High Step-Up Semiquadratic DC&#8211;DC Converter Based on Three-Winding Coupled Inductor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10480269</link><description>This article introduces a new nonisolated single-switch trans-inverse high step-up semiquadratic dc&#8211;dc converter with low input current ripple for renewable energy generation systems. In the presented topology, a three-winding coupled inductor combined with a quadratic boost converter to achieve high voltage gains. The advanced features of the suggested structure are its ultrahigh voltage conversion ratio, low voltage stress ratio across the switching components, low input current ripple, zero current switching of the semiconductors and also common ground between the input and output sides. Due to the trans-inverse feature in the proposed circuit, higher voltage gains can be achieved without needing large turns&#8217; ratios of the coupled inductor in comparison to the other typical quadratic converters, which decreases the conduction power loss. Furthermore, in this topology, the maximum voltage stress across the power switch is mitigated with the help of a regenerative passive clamp cell. The operating principle, steady-state analysis, theoretical efficiency analysis of the suggested circuit, along with performance comparison with other similar converters are discussed in detail. Finally, to verify the theoretical analysis, a 200 W with 25 V input voltage and 400 V output dc voltage sample prototype is established.</description></item><item><title>A New Quadratic DC/DC Converter With Ultrahigh Voltage Gain</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10493845</link><description>In this article, a new ultrahigh voltage gain coupled-inductor-based dc&#8211;dc converter is proposed for renewable energy generation systems.

The salient features of the proposed topology are its ultrahigh voltage gain, low reverse recovery in diodes, low voltage stress across switching devices, continuous input current, and common ground between the input source and output load. The integrated coupled inductor also minimizes power dissipation in magnetic components by sharing the high dc source current with another input inductor. Moreover, the proposed topology uses regenerative clamp circuits to mitigate voltage stresses across power switches operated in simultaneous switching. The theoretical analysis along with the operating principle, steady-state analysis, and the efficiency study of the proposed topology are discussed in detail. Finally, the performance of the proposed topology is verified using a 200-W, 25-V/400-V laboratory prototype.</description></item><item><title>A Multiport Partial Power Converter for Smart Home Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10497881</link><description>Multiport architectures based on multiwinding transformers allow the connection of multiple electrical components to achieve smart home functionality. However, existing solutions use full-power semiconductor devices or are constrained by the complexity of the multiwinding transformer design. As an alternative, this work proposes a new multiport partial power converter (PPC) architecture. The proposed multiport PPC architecture enables the partial power by using the series resonant converter based dc transformer. In contrast to the prior art solutions, the proposed converter can be built using partial power semiconductor devices, and only a single transformer rated for a part of the overall power is required. The operating principle and design criteria are also described in the article. The effect of partial power utilization is analyzed in detail.

Conventional methods for improving power harvesting, e.g., increasing the volume of the magnetic core, cannot effectively increase the output power density of the MFEH and it increases the burden on the transmission lines. An in-depth investigation reveals that by adding an optimal series-connected capacitor before the rectifier, the output power of the MFEH can be maximized. By reducing the net voltage applied to the magnetizing inductance, the flux accumulation is slower, lengthening the energy harvesting time, and the output power is increased. Furthermore, the output power can be maximized with an optimal series-connected capacitor. The design method of the optimal series-connected capacitor is theoretically analyzed in this article, which is only related to the load characteristics. In addition, the proposed method has a simple structure and can effectively improve the system power density of the MFEH. An experimental prototype is constructed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the results agree well with the theoretical analysis. Compared with the conventional MFEH without a series-connected capacitor, the method presented in this article can increase the harvested power by approximately 50%.</description></item><item><title>Optimized Design and Fast-Dynamic Control for ISOP-Connected Hybrid CLLC-DAB System With Partial Power Processing Property</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10502348</link><description>This article presents new design and control approaches for an input-series-output-parallel (ISOP) connected hybrid converter with partial power processing (PPP) capabilities, which comprises a CLLC converter and a dual-active-bridge (DAB). In this hybrid CLLC-DAB configuration, secondary-side bridges are shared between CLLC and DAB topologies to minimize the number of utilized switches. Incorporating the high efficiency of CLLC with the exceptional control flexibility of DAB, the hybrid configuration transfers the main power through CLLC while enabling DAB to handle partial power flow. The power distribution between CLLC and DAB is optimized, considering system efficiency, dynamic response, etc. Based on the resulting power ratio, system parameters are also optimized, including considerations for soft-switching of all switches in a wide load range, output power capacity, component tolerances, and overall efficiency. Furthermore, the output voltage can be accurately regulated by manipulating the phase shift angle of DAB. To enhance the system's transient performance in scenarios involving varying loads and input voltages, an adaptive fast dynamic response control strategy exhibiting robustness against variations in system parameters is also proposed.

The PMVG power factor suffers due to design considerations and can be improved by the current angle control (CAC). To do this, a finite angle-rotor position bias (FA-RPB) scheme is proposed by utilizing the principle of model predictive control. The FA-RPB-based CAC scheme is formulated to identify the optimum rotor position bias through cost function optimization and ensures the maximum power factor operation in PMVG. At this time, the electromagnetic torque developed by the generator is modified accordingly due to the introduction of RPB. Consequently, the maximum power extraction of WTS based on the optimum torque control is affected. Therefore, this study aims to enhance the PMVG stator power factor by adapting an RPB-constrained maximum power extraction strategy under CAC through constrained current reference to the control system. Finally, a 5-kW laboratory prototype verifies the enhanced operation of PMVG-based WTSs and the comparative results are summarized.</description></item><item><title>Simultaneous Wireless Power and Multi-Channel Data Transmission Based on OFDM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472664</link><description>Aiming to meet the demand for multi-channel data communication between the power transmitter and receiver in a wireless power transfer system, a simultaneous wireless power and multi-channel data transmission method based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is proposed. In this method, a dual-LC resonant network is employed in the data transmitting circuits, which can achieve two independent data transmitting with only one data transmitting transformer. By making the power carrier and data carriers orthogonal to each other, the multi-channel data can be demodulated based on OFDM demodulation principle without requiring a filtering circuit and sampling resistance in the data receiving circuits. The power transmission adopts the bilateral LCC topological structure to achieve a load-independent constant current output. The data transmission characteristics are optimized by analyzing the system parameters impact on the data transmission gain. A 40 W experimental platform is built and a 4 &#215; 85 kbps data transmission rate is achieved. Experimental results show that four-channel data in two forward and two backward channels can be transmitted accurately without interference from the power and other data carriers according to the OFDM principle. Moreover, the proposed system exhibits a high data bandwidth utilization.</description></item><item><title>An Investigation of Implantable Capacitive Coupling Intra-body Power Transfer based on Full-band Loss Compensation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475583</link><description>Capacitive coupling intra-body power transfer (CC-IBPT) is a promising technique for powering implantable medical devices (IMDs) due to its flexible transmitter (TX) placement. However, several frequency-dependent capacitive impedances increase the path loss. Traditional methods have only compensated for partial path loss at the initially measured optimal frequency, which limits power transfer efficiency (PTE) enhancement. To address this issue, this article investigates the effect of full-band loss compensation (FBLC) on the transmission characteristics, both through theoretical analysis and implantation experiments to achieve maximum PTE at a system level. In the vector network analyzer-based simulation and measurement, FBLC achieves a higher path gain of 6.6 dB than conventional methods. Furthermore, we establish an implantable CC-IBPT prototype system to demonstrate the effects of FBLC on end-to-end power gain and PTE enhancement. The measured results indicate that with a 1 $ \bf mm^{2}$ square electrode implanted 4.6 cm deep in the pork tissue and positioned 15 cm away from the TX electrode, FBLC enhances PTE to 2.06%, an improvement of 3.55 times compared to 0.58% using conventional methods. This work demonstrates that FBLC achieves a higher PTE than traditional methods and validates the capability of CC-IBPT to achieve a relatively elevated PTE in long-distance wireless power supplies for IMDs.</description></item><item><title>Synthesis and Control of a Three-Port LCL Resonant Wireless Power Transfer System for DC Energy Conversion Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10473154</link><description>This article proposes a three-port LCL resonant wireless power transfer system with hybrid power flow control methods for dc--dc energy conversion applications. Two half-bridge microinverters provide the dual input ports for DC energy sources, while the load port is connected through an LCL--LCL wireless coupling tank loaded with a full-bridge rectifier. The three-port topology allows flexible power transfer between dual input sources while the two sources share one LCL resonant tank to transfer energy to the load without additional components. The control function of this proposed system can be divided into two phases. In phase one, PWM method is employed to implement bidirectional power transfer between dual input sources by controlling the average dc offset current in the LCL resonant tank. In phase two, phase-shift modulation (PSM) method is applied to regulate wireless power output for load. The proposed modulation methods enable the system to take sources with different voltage levels at the dual input ports. Theoretical time domain analysis of the proposed topology and LCL coupling tank is presented in detail. Open-loop simulation is carried out to obtain the power transfer characteristics between the multiple ports, and closed-loop simulation is done to verify the efficiency of the designed control method. A 200 W prototype was built to evaluate the performance of the proposed topology. Experimental results show that the proposed system can achieve a peak efficiency of 93.6% with the load-independent constant current performance achieved.</description></item><item><title>A 24-to-240 W 95.6%-Efficiency &lt;300-&#956;s-Settling-Time Hybrid MCR/PT Wireless Power Transfer System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10480642</link><description>This article proposes a hybrid wireless power transfer (WPT) system working in both magnetically coupled resonance (MCR) and parity-time symmetry (PT) modes to provide a wide dynamic output power range. Theoretically, it can operate with arbitrary coupling coefficients of the coupling coils and loads. More optimization freedoms can be released when comparing with the existing single-mode (i.e., either MCR or PT) WPT systems, such that a wider dynamic output power range and higher system efficiency are achieved simultaneously. Analytical models are developed. The analytical control-to-output transfer function in the PT mode reveals the fact that a complex-pole pair and a right-half-plane zero, which limit the loop-bandwidth of the PT-WPT system, exist in the control loop. Thus, a current-mode modulation scheme for the proposed WPT system in the PT mode is proposed to extend the loop-bandwidth. Driven by a 48-V dc source, the efficiency of the proposed hybrid WPT prototype is 86.5%&#8211;95.6% when the coupling coefficient varies 0.1&#8211;0.3 and output power ranges 24&#8211;240 W. The settling time of the proposed hybrid WPT system ranges 100&#8211;300 &#956;s in the whole output power range due to the use of the developed analytical models to the system design.</description></item><item><title>The Impact of Rectifier Filter Capacitance on Buck Converter Output Voltage in Wireless Power Receiver System With Input Current Source</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10480266</link><description>Wireless power transfer (WPT) technology offers a more convenient and safer alternative to traditional contact-based power supply methods. In many WPT systems, a two-stage receiver configuration, comprising a rectifier and a dc&#8211;dc converter, is commonly used. This article examines how the rectifier filter capacitance affects the output voltage of the buck converter in wireless power receiver system with input current source. Prior research often assumed a large capacitance, leading to a conclusion that the output voltage was unaffected by capacitance changes. However, this is not the case when the capacitance is intentionally reduced, causing the buck converter to switch from continuous voltage mode to discontinuous voltage mode, thereby linking the output voltage to the capacitance. Similar findings can be also observed in other dc&#8211;dc converters, such as the Boost converter. This article calculates the critical capacitance and output voltage for the buck converter in both continuous voltage mode and discontinuous voltage mode and develops small-signal models, providing design guidelines for rectifier filter capacitance. The theoretical findings are validated through simulation and experiments.</description></item><item><title>Segmented-Vector Pulse Frequency Modulated Three-Level Converter for Wireless Power Transfer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10486994</link><description>Multilevel converters have attracted more and more attention for their advantages over the two-level converters in breaking voltage limitation and multichannel wireless power transfer (WPT), but their switching loss is unbearable due to the lack of an effective soft-switching modulation method. To fill this gap, this article proposes and implements a segmented-vector pulse frequency modulation (SVPFM) of a half-bridge three-level inverter for WPT systems. Moreover, the sigma-delta (&#931;-&#916;) modulator for the SVPFM-WPT system is proposed, and the modulation range is expanded to [0, 1]. It can achieve wide-range zero-voltage switching (ZVS) without auxiliary circuits and inverter modification, and it suppresses the power losses, further improving the system efficiency of a three-level inverter-based WPT system. In the meantime, a switching state-based capacitor voltage balancing method is proposed to control the half-bridge three-level inverter for the WPT system. It can balance the capacitor voltage of the flying capacitor at the reference value with a small voltage ripple. Software simulation and hardware experimentation are both given to verify the feasibility of the proposed &#931;-&#916; SVPFM of the three-level inverter for WPT systems.

Upon a deficiency of detailed thermal analysis, this article presents a thermal model under natural convection featuring both accuracy and simplicity. Analysis shows that the loss distribution between different parts of the coil has little effect on the resultant temperature. This in the context leads to a key conclusion that the maximum allowable power loss density decreases in an m-1/8 relationship with the increasing area gain m, given the coil geometry and natural convective condition. It also indicates that the coil set can be thermally treated as a black-box to predict how the temperature would rise and determine the necessary coil area for heat dissipation. These conclusions provide guidelines for the material and structure choices of the coils as well as for flexible scaling design. The proposed model is verified by simulation and experiment studies on a 5 kW prototype.

Finally, a 5-kW prototype with a maximum efficiency of 93.2% is built and the feasibility and effectiveness of the system are verified.</description></item><item><title>Evaluation and Suppression of High-Frequency Radiated EMI in Inductive Power Transfer System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10499841</link><description>Inductive power transfer (IPT) employs an antenna-like inductive coupler for wireless charging, which inevitably leads to electromagnetic interference (EMI) affecting nearby objects. This article is dedicated to examining the radiated EMI, exploring its mechanisms, and proposing approaches for suppression. The frequency-dependent behaviors of capacitors and inductors are thoroughly examined to guide the comprehensive study of the coupler's characteristics. Several factors that impact EMI would couple with each other. To address this challenge, various scenarios are defined to isolate and investigate these potential factors independently, ultimately identifying the most influential ones. Subsequently, the Class DE inverter is optimized to achieve the EMI suppression in a wide frequency range. The experimental setup utilizes a 1-MHz IPT system to replicate the simulation analysis, incorporating a measurement platform for assessing high-frequency voltage, current, and magnetic field. The optimized Class DE inverter exhibits a maximum attenuation of approximately 20 dB for both coil current and field strength in the frequency band exceeding 30 MHz.</description></item><item><title>30 kW Bidirectional Inductive Power Transfer Charger With Intermediate Coil for EV Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10502295</link><description>High power, highly efficient, and robust bidirectional inductive power transfer (IPT) system based on three windings, used for automotive applications is considered in this article.

The sensitivity of system characteristics to capacitor deviations is studied to identify sensitive parameters that cause significant uncertainty in the output. The effect of capacitor deviations on output current, power transfer efficiency, and power factor is comprehensively investigated. Interactions between capacitors are considered, and the main effect index S and the total effect index ST are calculated by Sobol&#8217; method. Its results indicate that the output current, power factor, and efficiency are slightly affected by the deviation of the capacitor in series with the receiving coil. Interaction between capacitors has a significant effect on the output current and power factor. Finally, the experimental setups of the three-coil and four-coil WPT systems are built. The experimental results show that when the resonant capacitor on the receiving side is varied within &#177;10%, the fluctuation of the output current is less than 1.5%, the maximum variation in efficiency is less than 2%, and the power factor remains almost above 0.9. The validity of the proposed global sensitivity analysis method is verified.</description></item><item><title>Integration Modulation for Current Ripple and High-Frequency Zero-Sequence Circulating Current Reduction on Two-Parallel Three-Level Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287921</link><description>Realizing simultaneous reduction of zero-sequence circulating current (ZSCC) and current ripple for two-parallel three-level neutral-point-clamped (3L-NPC) converters are always challenging. To overcome this obstacle, this article proposes a carrier-based integrated modulation method, which analyzes and controls the two-parallel 3L converters as an integrated five-level (5L) converter. First, the nearest three vectors are applied in each subsector to minimize the current ripple. Then, the corresponding 5L-vector sequences are optimally distributed into dual 3L-vector sequence combinations with the smallest common-mode voltage differences. A uniform distribution principle is also summarized based on reference signal decomposition and carrier type selection, which allows easy implementation in mainstream microcontrollers. Moreover, quantitative performance comparisons that compare the current ripple and the high-frequency ZSCC between the proposed method and several state-of-the-art strategies are subsequently conducted. Finally, comparative experiments are performed to verify the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Period Control Approach Finite Control Set Model Predictive Control Switching Phase Control for Interleaved DC/DC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304404</link><description>The control of interleaved converters is commonly implemented through pulsewith modulation (PWM) techniques. A common element in these implementations is the use of phase shift between carriers to improve the system performance. When working with a balanced system, this phase shift is equally distributed between modules, but for an unbalanced system, this is no longer the best alternative. Changing the phase shift in these controllers requires the implementation of new capabilities in the control platforms, and for the controller to manage more variables of different nature. On the other hand, finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) has shown to be a promising control strategy, especially when managing multiple control objectives of different natures or dynamics. In general, FCS-MPC does not present a fixed switching pattern, but this issue has been recently addressed with the so called period control approach (PCA). This article expands on the PCA-FCS-MPC to achieve the switching phase regulation for interleaved dc/dc power converters. A switching pattern similar to that of PWM techniques is achieved, while keeping the advantages of FCS-MPC and achieving the phase shift required for interleaved operation. Simulation and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A DC Offset Reduction of Neutral Point Voltage Strategy Based on Vector Phase Angle Difference Optimization for Vienna Rectifier With Bipolar DC Bus</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304412</link><description>When Vienna rectifier operates at light load conditions, small load power difference of bipolar dc bus leads to dc offset of neutral point (NP) voltage due to the limitation of dc-link power, increasing the voltage stress on switching devices. To solve this problem, a dc offset reduction of NP voltage strategy based on the vector phase angle difference (VPAD) optimization is proposed. By analyzing the relationship between the magnitude of zero-sequence component and the duty cycles of voltage vectors, the maximum power difference of the conventional strategy is obtained. The proposed strategy illustrates that VPAD can adjust the NP current based on the contour of the NP current, and the maximum VPAD is limited to satisfy the reference voltage and input current have the same sign. To increase the NP current, the VPAD is optimized by introducing the fluctuating reactive current, and the active current disturbance is injected to regulate the change rate of NP current. Therefore, the proposed strategy can significantly reduce the dc offset of NP voltage under light load conditions at the cost of the input current harmonics and the dc-link voltage fluctuation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified on a Vienna rectifier platform.</description></item><item><title>Multiobjective Optimization of High Power Density Outer Rotor PM Starter Generator Considering Electromagnetic and Temperature Characteristics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304356</link><description>This article presents a multiobjective optimization method for a special cooling tooth design in an outer rotor permanent magnet starter generator (ORPMSG), taking into account both the electromagnetic and temperature performances. First, the key optimization parameters of the ORPMSG are determined based on analytical torque and temperature models. In addition, an optimization method considering the power density, efficiency, and temperature rise have been proposed and employed to obtain an optimal overall performance on the ORPMSG design. The comprehensive sensitivity method is conducted based on the random forest algorithm to improve model accuracy. Besides, the random black-hole algorithm is proposed to enhance the convergence rate and approximate Pareto optimal solution. Then, an optimal ORPMSG is obtained using the proposed multiobjective optimization. Besides, the corresponding electromagnetic and temperature characteristics of the optimal and initial machines are compared by finite element analysis to confirm the merits of the optimization method. Finally, a 25 kW prototype is manufactured and tested, which verifies a significant 45.1% current density and 3.2% efficiency improvement for the same condition compared to the traditional cooling method.</description></item><item><title>A Misalignment Tolerant Inductive Power Transfer System With AC Resistance Reduction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10298832</link><description>Misalignment sensitivity is one of the main problems limiting the development of inductive power transfer system. When misalignment occurs, the system output power and efficiency reduce dramatically and cause unstable power supply. Meanwhile, the ac resistance of the inductive power transfer coil increases with the frequency. In medium and high frequency region, it produces large ohmic loss and thermal dissipation, which lead to efficiency-drop and temperature-rise problems. This work proposes a misalignment-tolerant winding pattern to reduce the system horizontal misalignment sensitivity, thermal stress, and coil ac resistance. From the experimental result, the proposed winding pattern reduces the ac resistance maximally by 88% at 2 MHz compared with the conventional winding pattern under the same geometry and wire type. The misalignment tolerance is maximally improved by 46% in terms of the output power with the proposed winding pattern.</description></item><item><title>Harmonic Inclusion and Accurate Modeling and Performance Analysis of the IPT Topologies Under Varying Operating Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315204</link><description>The fundamental harmonic approximation (FHA) is generally used to design and model inductive power transfer (IPT) circuits. However, with coil misalignments, at light load or the rectifier's discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), the IPT circuit must handle higher harmonic content. Moreover, topologies like LCL and LCC have high harmonics at the inverter output and rectifier input side, even during regular operation. The existing two-port network-based harmonic modeling assumes quasi-square rectifier input voltage for the LCC&#8211;LCC topology in DCM condition, thereby leading to significant error. In this article, the rectifier input voltage of LCC&#8211;LCC topology (capacitive filter at load) and the rectifier input current of series-parallel (S-P) topology (inductive filter at load) are modified and improved for the DCM mode. Hence, by including the modified expression, accurate results in extreme conditions, high coupling, light load, and DCM scenarios are achieved. The proposed technique models the output port as a voltage/current source instead of approximating it to be resistive. Furthermore, the proposed study equally applies to continuous conduction mode and DCM conditions for the rectifier. A comparison using the FHA-based analysis, proposed harmonic modeling and simulation is carried out, and experimental validation is done for S-P and LCC&#8211;LCC topologies.</description></item><item><title>A Controller HIL Testing Approach of High Switching Frequency Power Converter via Slower-Than-Real-Time Simulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287918</link><description>The controller hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) simulation is a vital tool to test power electronics controllers in the early development stages to reduce cost and risk and save time. However, the CHIL cannot handle the high-switching-frequency power converters due to the strict computing time constraint imposed on the real-time simulation and the limitation of the digital-analog conversion rate of the I/O interface. To deal with this challenge, in this article, a CHIL testing approach based on the slower-than-real-time simulation (STRTS) is proposed for the power electronics converter with high switching frequency. The operating principles and implementation procedure of the STRTS-based CHIL are presented in detail. By comparing with the real-time simulation-based hardware-in-the-loop (HIL), STRTS-based CHIL is proved to have equivalent controller testing performances. Moreover, a 200&#8201;kHz buck converter prototype is developed and the closed-loop experimental results validate the feasibility and application values of the STRTS-based CHIL in testing the high-frequency converters.</description></item><item><title>A Peak Current Controlled Flicker-Free AC&#8211;DC LED Driver With Dimming Function</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304413</link><description>Dimming function is an attractive feature for light-emitting diode (LED) drivers since it can adjust the lighting levels for consumer comfort. This article proposes a simple but effective peak current control strategy to achieve dimming operation. Unlike the traditional dimming techniques, no extra switch, pulsewidth modulation controller, or linear current regulator in series with the LED strings is used in the proposed method, resulting in easy implementation and low cost. A 33 W ac&#8211;dc Sepic LED driver prototype, both with power factor correction (PFC) and without PFC, is constructed and tested to validate the proposed peak current control method. Moreover, flicker-free operation of LEDs is necessary for human eye comfort. Therefore, this article also introduces a ripple remover circuit (RRC) to remove low-frequency LED current ripple in ac&#8211;dc LED drivers. At the same time, the output capacitor can be greatly reduced by the critical design of the RRC. Unlike the existing methods, the inclusion of RRC into a driver circuit is straightforward and RRC has no complex structure. The proposed solution is generally suitable for all single-phase ac&#8211;dc LED drivers. Experimental results are presented to validate flicker-free operation by RRC.</description></item><item><title>Offset Current Modulation Technique for Wide ZVS Range in Dual Active Bridge (DAB) DC-DC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287885</link><description>This article proposes a novel offset current modulation technique, which can add a new degree of freedom to the dual active bridge dc&#8211;dc converter. The concept of the proposed technique is to inject offset currents into the primary- and secondary-sides of the transformer. If the same offset currents are injected into both sides, dc bias does not occur in the magnetizing current of the transformer. Therefore, the offset current can be used as a new control variable without any adverse effects. When the proposed technique is applied to single phase shift (SPS) modulation, zero voltage switching (ZVS) characteristics can be further improved by realizing the ZVS of two more switches, leading to higher efficiency. Furthermore, the proposed control system can be configured with simple modification of the conventional control system. The optimal SPS modulation with the proposed technique is derived through theoretical loss optimization considering a tradeoff between conduction loss and switching loss. The feasibility of the proposed technique is verified using a 3.3 kW prototype with a 400 V input and 280&#8211;420 V output conditions.</description></item><item><title>Flex-LCC: A New Grid-Forming HVDC Rectifier for Collecting Large-Scale Renewable Energy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10314129</link><description>A new grid-forming (GFM) high-voltage direct current (HVdc) rectifier, named flexible line-commutated converter (Flex-LCC), is proposed in this article to collect the power generated by large-scale islanded or weak-grid-supported renewable energy systems. The Flex-LCC uses a series-connected hybrid valve based on the LCC and full-bridge modular multilevel converter (FBMMC), and adopts a new control. As a result, the Flex-LCC works as a GFM rectifier and retains the same dc voltage and power carrying capacity, dc fault clearing, and power reversal functions as an LCC. Particularly, the Flex-LCC has three salient features: the control of the Flex-LCC is decoupled from the LCC part's firing angle, the internal reactive power allocation is flexible, and the valve-side ac voltage of the FBMMC part has a wide operation range due to the decoupling of dc-port voltage and capacitor voltage. These bring reduced interharmonics, enhanced stability, and a smaller capacity boundary to the FBMMC part for the Flex-LCC. Furthermore, utilizing the reasonable design for the actual capacity and valve-side ac voltage of the FBMMC, the Flex-LCC can effectively balance cost, footprint, and weight, and match the current-carrying capacity between the series-connected LCC and FBMMC. The topology, control, characteristics, and design of the Flex-LCC are analyzed in detail in this article. Simulations and experiments validate the theory.</description></item><item><title>Single-Loop Droop Control Strategy for a Grid-Connected DFIG Wind Turbine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10314133</link><description>When grid-forming droop control strategies are implemented in grid-connected power converters, two control strategies are widely used: the single-loop and multiloop droop controls. However, only multiloop droop control strategies with inner control loops have been implemented in doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbines so far. This article proposes the application of a single-loop droop control strategy to a DFIG wind turbine, which has not been previously explored or implemented. As shown in the article, the application of the conventional droop control without inner control loops to DFIG-based wind power systems does not ensure a stable response. After modeling the system dynamics and evaluating its stability, two causes of instability have been identified: a resonance at the rotor electrical frequency relevant at high slips and a phase margin reduction at low slips. To solve these instability issues two control solutions are proposed: the emulation of a virtual resistor and a phase rotation. The proposed control strategy allows stabilizing the system and achieving a fast and damped dynamic response. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is validated by experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Economic Operation Optimization Under Real-Time Pricing for an Energy Management System in a Redundancy-Based Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10305280</link><description>DC microgrids (MGs) represent self-contained systems for distributing and managing electricity locally, offering advantages in terms of efficiency and control. This article proposes the optimization of redundancy-based dc MG, emphasizing the integration of an intelligent algorithm to minimize operational costs under real-time pricing conditions and also increase the efficiency operation. The redundancy-based dc MG consists of a cascaded bidirectional Cuk converter (CBC) linked to a cascaded bidirectional boost converter, sharing two battery energy storage system (BESS) units as common inputs. Thereby, two boost converters interface the dc utility and fuel cell (FC) to the dc-link of the CBC. The redundancy-based dc MG operates with a coordinated and decentralized control among the dc utility, FC and two BESS units. The energy management system (EMS) employs a droop control for the dc utility and FC, while BESS units adhere to a state-of-charge (SoC)-sharing function. In addition, the particle swarm optimization dynamically adjusts EMS parameters for optimal real-time performance. Then, a stability analysis determines MG operational boundaries, and the effectiveness of the method is confirmed through experiments using Typhoon HIL and dSPACE setups. Finally, comparative evaluations against traditional SoC-based droop and genetic algorithms demonstrate the cost reduction of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Model Predictive Control for LCL-Filter Grid-Tied Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10309832</link><description>This article proposes adaptive continuous-control-set model predictive control (CCS-MPC) for three-phase LCL-filter grid-tied inverters in the stationary frame. The proposed control provides stability against the LCL-filter resonance and removes the need for active damping or passive damping. Furthermore, it can track sinusoidal references in the stationary frame close to zero offsets. Inductance variation of a grid is a challenging issue, which can shift the LCL-filter resonance. Even though CCS-MPC generally has good stability for parameter mismatches, the control is optimized for the nominal value of the parameters. A relatively large variation may deteriorate the performance of the control and cause instability in the closed-loop system. To solve this problem, the concept of CCS-MPC is developed to work with a variety of the grid-inductance changes. The controller coefficients are chosen with a sensitivity analysis to provide enough gain margins and phase margins for the whole interval of the presumption grid-inductance variation. Also, this selection guarantees the control robustness against mismatches of the LCL-filter capacitance and inductance. The real-time computation of advanced controllers is a challenging issue. The computation burden of the proposed CCS-MPC is mostly performed offline and just some simple numerical expression is executed in real time. Thus, it does not require a powerful but expensive processor for implementation. The simulation and experimental results prove the performance of the proposed controller for handling the LCL-filter resonance, grid-inductance variations, and tracking sinusoidal references.</description></item><item><title>Online Expansion of Multiple Mobile Emergency Energy Storage Vehicles Without Communication</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10323257</link><description>The extreme weather and natural disasters will cause power grid outage. In disaster relief, mobile emergency energy storage vehicle (MEESV) is the significant tool for protecting critical loads from power grid outage. However, the on-site online expansion of multiple MEESVs always faces the challenges of hardware and software configurations through communications. In order to simplify the on-site operation, the online expansion without communication line is always expected to realize the effect of plug-and-play. For this purpose, this article proposes an online expansion method, which focuses on the voltage coordinate control at two key parts to avoid the circulating current: one is for the system reset after new MEESV is joined, while the other one is for the bus voltage synchronously gradually restored to the rated value. For the former one, a mutual small-signal-based resetting method is proposed, for which the injection and identification of small signal are studied to ensure the safe expansion with acceptable disturbances. For the latter one, event-triggered method is suggested which synchronously restores the bus voltage to nominal value at its specific zero crossings. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated through an experimental platform, with three prototypes online expanded one by one.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Energy Management of Renewable Hydrogen Production Systems Without Communication Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10314039</link><description>With the increasing penetration of renewable generation, producing renewable hydrogen by water electrolysis has become a promising development. For hydrogen production systems integrated with renewable energy sources (RESs), alkaline electrolyzers (AELs), and energy storage devices, its energy management system (EMS) not only controls the RESs&#8217; operating points to capture more renewable energy but also regulates the AELs and energy storage devices&#8217; operating power to achieve dc bus voltage regulation, dynamic power sharing, power regulation of AELs, state-of-charge regulation of energy storage devices, etc. In this article, a decentralized EMS is proposed to achieve the above objectives. The proposed EMS can indirectly improve the system's efficiency and service life by ensuring that the AEL's operating power is always above the minimum recommended operating power and it only absorbs the low-frequency part of renewable power fluctuations. Besides, the proposed EMS can reduce system costs and enhance system reliability by eliminating communication networks. Furthermore, the operational principle of the proposed EMS and the system design and analysis are elaborated. The proposed EMS's effectiveness is verified by hardware-in-the-loop real-time simulations.</description></item><item><title>Weighted DC Virtual Generator Control Scheme for Interlinking Converters in DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292499</link><description>This article proposes a new control strategy for power electronic converters interfacing two dc networks. The proposed control, based on a modification of the dc virtual generator concept, has grid-forming capability in both sides of the converter simultaneously without intermediate energy storage device. Departing from the dc virtual generator control concept, capable of controlling voltage in one of the converter sides while withdrawing the power from the other side, an adaptation is done to make it reversible. A priority weight is assigned to each side voltage control. A weight calculation method, proportional to the voltage deviation from its rated value, is proposed. This weight calculation strategy makes the control system to contribute to the side most in need (using voltage deviation with respect to rated value as an indicator of the neediness). The interlinking converter with the proposed weighted strategy is capable of stable work in grid-forming mode at both sides simultaneously, just requiring a grid-feeding converter with $P/V$ droop to be connected in either side. No control architecture was found in the literature with this capability for dc&#8211;dc interlinking converters. The theoretical discussion has been supported with small-signal analysis and hardware-in-the-loop validation.</description></item><item><title>Minimization of Current Stress for Dual Active Bridge Converters Based on Model Predictive Control With Enhanced ZVS Ability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315245</link><description>Efficiency is a crucial concern for dual active bridge (DAB) converters. Although many studies on novel modulation schemes have attempted to improve the efficiency, achieving the optimal balance between current stress and zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) ability remains challenging. In addition, due to the wide operating range of DABs, small-signal models have to be setup at each equilibrium point to purpose a high performance of liner controllers. Existing works mainly employ the slow-loop to prevent oscillations during transitions, which degrades the dynamic and bandwidth. To address the current state of research, this article proposes a triple-phase-shift modulation combined with model predictive control (MPC) for DABs. Herein, a designed cost function initially calculates shift-angles. Subsequently, a proposed optimization segment for ZVS checks and revises the ZVS ability to select an optimal set of shift angles. The current stress is minimized on the premise that the wide range of ZVS is guaranteed. Meanwhile, the dynamic performance is improved through the nonlinearity of MPC. Finally, a 1.4-kW scaled-down prototype is built, and the experimental comparisons with other schemes verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Federated-Learning-Based Distributed Frequency Control Against False Data Injection Attack</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10305493</link><description>This article proposes the federated-learning-based second-order recurrent neural network (SORNN&#8211;FL) for distributed frequency control of a multimicrogrid (MMG) system. The problem is conceptualized as proportional&#8211;integral derivative consensus control using the Lyapunov function, which depicts the behavior of recurrent neural network (RNN). The parameters of the controller are obtained by deriving the dynamics of energy function to update the state of neurons. During the learning process, FL of weights is adopted to improve the performance of the network by increasing the communication among the neurons. The effectiveness of the developed SORNN&#8211;FL controller is tested for the MMG system, and its performance is compared with those of the MMG system using SORNN, RNN, and the conventional method of tuning. The results obtained reveal that the proposed higher order control gives an improved performance during uncertainties and communication failure. Specifically, we use a differential privacy mechanism to secure the data from false data injection attacks by the invaders. The various extensive cases studied on the MMG system demonstrate that the proposed privacy-preserving-based SORNN&#8211;FL scheme is robust and efficient. Even if a communication failure and a malicious attack occur in the MMG system, our proposed control scheme can regulate the system frequency and maintain system stability. The real-time validation has been demonstrated at the 0.4-kV microgrid test-bed system in the laboratory.</description></item><item><title>A New Macro Dynamic Demand Response Strategy Considering Micro Power Quality Disturbance for Wind-Storage Integrated System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304361</link><description>This article developed a new methodology of macro dynamic demand response (DDR) strategy considering micropower quality disturbance (PQD) for wind-storage integrated systems. A novel idea has been presented in this methodology to eliminate the barrier of PQD and renewable energy dynamic adjustment. At the microlevel for PQD elimination, a filtering strategy of Butterworth&#8211;Wiener filter (Bw-WF) is proposed to deal with the frequency interference PQD in wind-storage integrated system by Bw and the WF. The method connects the macro DDR and the PQD elimination at the microlevel for the stable wind power output after PQD elimination. At the macrolevel for dynamic adjustment, the Hampel&#8211;Savitzky&#8211;Golay macropower filtering method is proposed to calculate the low-frequency power in line with the national standards. Considering all wind power participates in the DDR, the change of DDR and the adjusted power curves are calculated based on the Logistics function, optimistic response, and pessimistic response factors. Through the experimental verification, it is found that the power and state of charge curves of energy storage can be significantly changed by the subtle dynamic changes during an ultra-short period. Also, it is demonstrated that the theoretical method proposed in this article is reliable and promising.</description></item><item><title>Offline Equalization Control of Modular Multilevel Converter-Based Battery Energy Storage System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10323264</link><description>The modular multilevel converter-based battery energy storage system (MMC-BESS) can help the power grid to run safely and stably, which plays an important role in the modern power grid. The inconsistency of cells in BESS may lead to overcharge or overdischarge of cells, which may decrease the operation life of battery packs and cause safety problems. Normally, before the MMC-BESS is connected to the grid, it is necessary to prebalance the system batteries in an offline state. This article analyzes the topology, the mathematical model, and the equalization control model in offline MMC-BESS. According to the analysis, an offline MMC-BESS stepwise balancing control strategy considering the state of charge, state of health, and state of function, is proposed. In this strategy, the state of dischargeable energy is set as the criterion of offline equalization of the system. The balancing of submodules in MMC-BESS would be achieved by controlling the circulating currents and voltages of arms. Finally, the feasibility of the offline equalization control strategy is verified by simulation and experiment.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Dual-LC Resonant DC Circuit Breaker Employing Soft-Switching Technique for Enhanced Performance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10288138</link><description>DC circuit breakers (DCCBs) are crucial equipment to ensure safe and stable operation of the dc systems. Resonant DCCBs (RCBs) have recently gained significant attention due to their ability to generate multiple zero-crossing points for mechanical switches, which leads to high reliability. However, existing solutions either necessitate the use of precharged capacitors or have continuous hard-switching requirements for power electronic devices, which require improvement in terms of both economy and reliability. To address these challenges, this article proposes a dual-LC RCB employing soft-switching technique for enhanced performance. The dual-LC RCB adds an additional LC circuit in parallel with the power electronic devices and oscillate synergistically with the original main LC circuit. This configuration achieves soft-switching on power electronic devices, significantly reducing the potential for damage caused by high junction temperatures. As a result, the dual-LC RCB offers improved reliability. The topology structure and operation principle of dual-LC RCB are first introduced, followed by a complete parameter optimization design method. A 10 kV/10 kA prototype is constructed to verify the interruption capability of the topology structure and the correctness of the parameter design principle.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive Stabilization Strategy for Harmonic Oscillation of SAPF Interacted With Nonlinear Load and Grid Impedance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10311351</link><description>A shunt active power filter (SAPF) can interact with the nonlinear load and grid impedance, which may lead to unexpected harmonic oscillation. To describe the interaction, this article builds the interaction model including the source-current-detected SAPF, nonlinear load, and grid impedance. The interaction model reveals that the harmonic oscillation is prone to occur when the passive resonant frequency from grid impedance and nonlinear loads gets close to the harmonic frequency compensated by SAPF. This kind of harmonic oscillation is normally unpredictable because grid impedance and state of the nonlinear load continuously change. To cope with it, this article proposes a harmonic oscillation observation and adaptive stabilization strategy, which is implemented by monitoring and controlling the phase trajectory of the grid harmonic current through adjusting the phase and emergency damping factor of the harmonic resonant controllers in SAPF. This strategy has low requirement on real-time calculation and does not affect the dynamic response of the SAPF. In the end, the effectiveness of the stabilization strategy is verified by experiment results.</description></item><item><title>Feedback Control of Doubly-Fed Generator Connected to Current Source Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10293255</link><description>Doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) system supplied by current source converter (CSC) is considered in this article. The DFIG can work in two independent modes: AC grid connection and stand-alone mode. The DFIG is connected to the ac grid directly through its stator and the CSC links the rotor side. In this mode, the active and reactive powers of the DFIG must be controlled. This article proposes two control system structures for the DFIG working in the generator mode. Both control structures are based on nonlinear transformations but on different state-feedback control variables. The selection of the variables is similar to the input&#8211;output linearization but more complicated due to the CSC and &#8220;voltage control&#8221; involved. Both proposed control structures ensure independent control of the active and reactive powers with different accuracies; as evidenced in the simulation and experimental results. The proposed approach can be named by voltage control of the DFIG because the control variables are the voltage in the dc-link and the angular speed of the output current vector from the inverter. For both proposed control structures, the current in the dc-link is not a constant value, but depends on the dynamic states and values of the controlled powers; thus, it varies accordingly. The proposed control strategy can be applied to low- and high-power DFIG systems. Simulation and experimental results from a 2-kW generator validate theoretical propositions.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Model-Free Adaptive Control Strategy for Hybrid AC/DC Microgrid With Event-Triggered Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10324405</link><description>A distributed control strategy (DCS) is an efficient way to realize power sharing among distributed generators (DGs) and restore the voltage deviation caused by droop control. However, there are several limitations in the traditional strategy of hybrid ac/dc microgrid (MG), such as the heavy communication burden and sensitivity to the working conditions. In this article, a distributed model-free adaptive control strategy (DMFAC) is proposed with an event-triggered (ET) mechanism. A unified control framework of hybrid MG is established and the ET-DMFAC can operate within it to realize multiple control strategies simultaneously. The dynamic linearization parameters of hybrid MG are estimated online to reflect the working condition, and an ET mechanism is designed to reduce the communication burden. The stability of ET-DMFAC is analyzed with the discrete Lyapunov theory and experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed ET-DMFAC strategy under different operating conditions. The outperformance of ET-DMFAC is demonstrated by comparing it with many existing DCS of hybrid AC/DC MG.</description></item><item><title>Output Current Quality Improvement for VSC With Capability of Compensating Voltage Harmonics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10321720</link><description>Using the voltage source converter (VSC) to compensate for voltage harmonics at the point of common coupling (PCC) is beneficial for the power supply quality in the regional power grid. However, it leads to a significant deterioration of output current quality for VSC. This article aims to develop the design principle and realization method for impedance reshaping in VSC used for compensating voltage harmonics with the minimal sacrifice of the output current quality. By revealing the coupling constraint between the voltage harmonics of PCC and the output current harmonics of VSC, a harmonics impedance design principle for VSC is proposed. This principle indicates that the impedance phase of VSC should be identical to the phase of grid impedance at the frequency of harmonics. Hence, an impedance reshaping strategy based on the variable-phase reduced-order generalized integrator is developed, which can reshape the VSC's impedance to fulfill the harmonics impedance design principle under different grid conditions. Compared to existing studies, the proposed harmonics impedance design principle and realization method meet the same requirement of the voltage quality at PCC with a lower VSC's output current quality sacrifice. Theoretical analysis and experiments are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>A Current Controllable Active Transient-Voltage Compensation Circuit for Voltage Regulator Module</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10311370</link><description>In this article, a novel current controllable active transient-voltage-compensation circuit (CC-ATVCC) is proposed to mitigate output voltage overshoot and undershoot in voltage regulator module (VRM) during load transients. The current difference between the VRM output and the load is compensated by field effect transistors in the proposed CC-ATVCC so that the output voltage spikes are suppressed. In the proposed CC-ATVCC, a high gain analog drive circuit, consisting of an operational amplifier cascaded with a common-source amplification circuit, provides adjustable drive voltage, which flexibly changes the compensation current. Furthermore, a time-domain model is developed in this article to analyze the interaction between VRM and the proposed CC-ATVCC, guiding the circuit design under universal conditions. Finally, the proposed CC-ATVCC has been built and tested in a 12-phase 500 A interleaved buck converter. The results show that the overshoot of the output voltage can be reduced by 34% using the proposed CC-ATVCC and the footprint of CC-ATVCC is only 10% compared with the traditional capacitor-only solution. The proposed CC-ATVCC can reduce the number of output capacitors and greatly increase the power density of VRM.</description></item><item><title>A Two-Stage Stochastic Unit Commitment With Mixed-Integer Recourses for Nuclear Power Plants to Accommodate Renewable Energy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10243161</link><description>To provide flexibilities for peak regulations in power systems while addressing renewable energy uncertainties, this article proposes a two-stage stochastic unit commitment model with peak regulation constraints of nuclear power plants (NPPs) under the &#8220;12-3-6-3&#8221; mode. The first stage aims to determine the optimal thermal unit commitment, and the second stage tries to adjust the operation modes of an NPP and thermal unit generation output to cope with different renewable energy scenarios. Due to the discrete adjustments of NPPs, the proposed model is mathematically a two-stage stochastic optimization with mixed-integer recourses. Furthermore, a Fenchel cut based bilevel decomposition is proposed to solve this model, where the inner second-stage subproblem is first relaxed into a linear program and a Fenchel cut is then generated to recover the facet of the convex hull solution. The technique can significantly accelerate the computational speed of the proposed model with a special mathematical structure. Numerical results on a provincial power system verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and method.</description></item><item><title>Sky-Image-Derived Deep Decomposition for Ultra-Short-Term Photovoltaic Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10246013</link><description>Because of the stochastic and nonstationary weather changes, photovoltaic (PV) power exhibits high uncertainty and fluctuation, which severely challenges the operation of power systems. PV variations can be detected by investigating inherent properties and reflections of sky images. However, limited study has focused on the effect of sky image changes on PV inherent properties. Therefore, in this study, a novel sky-image-derived decomposition method was proposed for ultra-short-term PV power forecasting. First, historical PV series were decomposed into seasonal and trend parts with guidance of sky image sequence. The Auto-Correlation mechanism was adopted to enhance the temporal dependencies of seasonal parts. Then, to reduce the model instability in different weather scenarios, the latent features were handled by an improved density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise using a semi-supervised strategy to identify forecasting scenarios. Finally, a rolling scenario-wise decoder was proposed to conduct multi-step forecasting task. The proposed method was compared with various state-of-the-art methods, including empirical mode decomposition and deep decomposition methods. The results validated the high performance of the proposed method in terms of accuracy within forecast horizons of 5 to 30 min.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Management of Hybrid Energy Station Under Exogenous-Endogenous Uncertainties and Bounded Rationality</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10252038</link><description>Hybrid energy station (HES) systems coupling diverse energy sectors can facilitate the low-carbon and sustainable transition by integrating massive wind-solar power and energy conversion technologies. With the proliferation of renewable and flexible demand response (DR), different uncertainties are inevitably introduced into energy systems because of external volatile surroundings and internal consumers' mutable behavior. Moreover, the probability distribution function (PDF) of these uncertainties may be unavailable or ambiguous and even affected by decisions. In this work, we propose a hierarchical optimal framework for HES systems, in which the energy hub plant determines the schedules of generation and trade in different markets (upper-level) and users minimize energy expense by managing facilities operations considering decision-dependent uncertainties (lower-level). A scheme of energy transaction options is also provided under the bounded rationality of user sides. To tackle problems with uncertain PDFs, a tailored chance-constrained distributionally robust method is implemented. In the process, the correlation DR operation pattern and analytic pricing formulation are derived incorporating the property of users. Case studies with comparison tests validate the efficacy of the proposed model in handling uncertainties and pursuing economic profits.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Service Restoration of Distribution Networks With Volt-Var Devices, Distributed Energy Resources, and Energy Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10251925</link><description>The new energy resources in distribution systems have led researchers to consider the operation of such elements during service restoration. Hence, the current state-of-the-art regarding the restoration problem considers the operation of distributed resources in both island and grid-connected modes. Few articles also address the system's restoration capacity changes throughout the time needed to repair the network after an outage, given the variations in the system's demand and availability of energy sources. However, the solutions proposed in the literature converge in proposing a single topology that is feasible throughout the entire repairing time. In this article, we propose addressing the mutable nature of the system's restoration capacity by splitting the repairing time into several time intervals and associating each of them with a specific configuration that minimizes the out-of-service load. Energy storage systems, intermittent and dispatchable generators, and voltage-control devices are also considered. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). The model and its scalability are tested using the 53-, 217-, and 404-node systems, considering different fault scenarios and reliability indices. The results show that the nonsupplied energy during the repairing time decreases when dynamic changes in the system topology are considered. Furthermore, the effects of storage systems operation and their integration with dynamic topology changes are highlighted.</description></item><item><title>Coordinating Multi-Energy Microgrids for Integrated Energy System Resilience: A Multi-Task Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10255302</link><description>High-impact and low-probability events have occurred more frequently than before, which can seriously damage energy supply infrastructures. As localized small energy systems, multi-energy microgrids (MEMGs) can provide a viable solution for the system-wise load restoration of integrated energy systems (IESs), due to their enhanced flexibility and controllability. However, existing literature tends to realize MEMGs as corrective response rather than load restoration resource after extreme events, which cannot fully exploit the benefits of multi-MEMGs on IES resilience. This article introduces a decentralized operating paradigm for the real-time coordination of local multi-MEMGs towards system-wise IES load restoration, while a novel topology-aware multi-task reinforcement learning method with soft modularization is proposed to solve it. The multi-task learning framework enables MEMGs to simultaneously learn scheduling decisions across different network topologies and better adapt to unanticipated contingencies. Additionally, to avoid insecure MEMG operations, a physics-informed safety layer is embedded on top of the multi-task learning framework for action corrections. Case studies have been conducted on two IESs (33-bus power, 20-node gas, and 20-node heat network as well as 69-bus power, 40-node gas, and 62-node heat network) to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enabling effective coordination among multi-MEMGs towards system-wise IES load restoration.</description></item><item><title>Virtual Inertia Scheduling (VIS) for Real-Time Economic Dispatch of IBR-Penetrated Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10264213</link><description>A new concept called virtual inertia scheduling (VIS) is proposed to efficiently handle the increasing penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) in power systems. VIS is an inertia management framework that targets security-constrained and economy-oriented inertia scheduling and generation dispatch with a large scale of renewable generations. Specifically, it determines the appropriate power setpoint and reserved capacity of synchronous generators and IBRs, as well as the control modes and control parameters of IBRs to provide secure and cost-effective inertia support. First, a uniform system model is employed to quantify the frequency dynamics of IBR-penetrated power systems after disturbances. Leveraging this model, the s-domain and time-domain analytical responses of IBRs with inertia support capability are derived. Then, VIS-based real-time economic dispatch (VIS-RTED) is formulated to minimize generation and reserve costs, with full consideration of dynamic frequency constraints and the derived inertia support reserve constraints. The virtual inertia and damping of IBRs are formulated as decision variables. A deep learning-assisted linearization approach is further employed to address the non-linearity of dynamic constraints. Finally, VIS-RTED is demonstrated on a two-machine system and a modified IEEE 39-bus system. A full-order time-domain simulation is performed to verify the scheduling results.</description></item><item><title>Proactive Scheduling of Mixed Energy Resources At Different Grid Levels</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10265110</link><description>The optimal utilisation of distribution grids requires the proactive management of volatilities caused by mixed energy resources installed into different grid levels, such as buildings, energy communities (ECs) and substations. In this context, proactive control based on predictions for energy demand and generation is applied. The mitigation of conflicts between the stakeholders' objectives is the main challenge for the control of centralized and distributed energy resources. In this article, a bi-level approach is proposed for the control of stationary battery energy storage systems (SBES) supporting the local distribution system operator (DSO) at the transformer level, as well as distributed energy resources (DERs) operated by end customers, i.e., EC-members. Model predictive control (MPC)-based and hybrid approaches merging rule- and MPC-based control schemes are evaluated. Simulation studies based on a typical European low voltage (LV) feeder topology yield the performance assessment in terms of technical and economic criteria. The results show an advantage of hybrid approaches with respect to the DSO's cost savings from peak shaving. From the EC's perspective, both hybrid and MPC-based schemes can achieve effective cost savings from proactive energy management.</description></item><item><title>An Anti-Windup Mechanism for State Constrained Linear Control of Wave Energy Conversion Systems: Design, Synthesis, and Experimental Assessment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10266789</link><description>Motivated by the necessity of suitable state constraint mechanisms within linear time-invariant (LTI) energy-maximising control of wave energy converters (WECs), we present, in this article, an anti-windup (AW) scheme for state constraint satisfaction, where the associated unconstrained controller is designed via impedance-matching theory for WEC systems. As in the standard (input) AW scenario, the adopted technique provides a mechanism for &#8216;informing&#8217; the (unconstrained) controller when constraints are active, so that appropriate modifications to future control actions can be taken accordingly. The overall adopted AW technique is tested experimentally, on a prototype of the Wavestar WEC system, available at Aalborg University (Denmark). We explicitly demonstrate that the proposed AW scheme is able to consistently respect the defined state constraints, having a mild impact on overall energy absorption performance when compared to its unconstrained counterpart.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Objective Estimation of Optimal Prediction Intervals for Wind Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268627</link><description>Accurate and reliable wind power forecasting is crucial for efficient operation in a power system. Due to the substantial uncertainties associated with wind generation, probabilistic interval forecasting offers a distinct approach for assessing and quantifying the potential impacts and risks that may arise from the integration of wind energy into a power system. This article proposes a novel multi-objective lower upper bound estimation method to directly construct optimal wind power intervals without the assumption of any specific distribution function. Prediction intervals at a nominal confidence level are formulated through simultaneously optimizing the Winkler loss and coverage probability. The proposed framework is gradient descent-enabled and therefore allows flexible integration of various deep learning algorithms. An evaluation using four wind power datasets is conducted, and the results are analyzed and compared with those from several benchmark models. The findings indicate the proposed method outperforms its counterparts in terms of both reliability and overall performance.</description></item><item><title>Collaborative Response of Data Center Coupled With Hydrogen Storage System for Renewable Energy Absorption</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10269736</link><description>The demand response of data center is considered as an effective flexible method to absorb excessive renewable energy (RE) in the power system, especially for the data center with high-density hydrogen storages. Therefore, this article proposes a collaborative response framework considering regulations of data workload and hydrogen storage. It is expected to further improve the data center flexibility. However, this collaborative response is a high-order and non-convex optimization problem involving the multi-period and complex model. Considering the condition of uncertain RE supply, it is difficult for power optimization dispatch to realize the precise decision in this NP-hard problem. To address this issue, a global interval optimization (GIO) approach is developed. It is to obtain efficient and robust decisions in the collaborative response. This approach deduces an interval optimization model to achieve the global optimality of convergent solution. Furthermore, this article introduces a probability correction into the GIO approach. It is used for improving the decision accuracy in the actual renewable power scenarios. A case study based on the IEEE 24-bus system verifies superiority of the GIO approach. It further validates effectiveness of the collaborative response framework for RE utilization.</description></item><item><title>A Regulation Method Considering Coupled Voltage Violation and Unbalance in Three-Phase Four-Wire Hybrid AC/DC LVDNs With High Penetration PVs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10272708</link><description>Low-voltage distribution networks (LVDNs) have witnessed an increasing penetration of distributed photovoltaics (PVs), which exacerbates the existing voltage violation and voltage unbalance issues. PVs, energy storage systems, and voltage source converters can regulate voltages in hybrid AC/DC LVDNs. To solve the above two voltage problems simultaneously, a partition-based coordinated regulation method is proposed in this article considering the coupling of the two issues and the effect of active power on reactive power in electrical distance calculation. The voltage adjustments in different voltage violation scenarios are obtained based on a graph that describes the coupling of the two issues mathematically. In order to better determine control devices, the equivalent coefficient of active power adjustment on electrical distance calculation is considered in the partition method, in which regulation efficiency, regulation cost, and regulation capability are used as objectives. The coordination of controllable devices is achieved according to three-phase four-wire sensitivities. Case studies are performed to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed regulation method in hybrid AC/DC LVDNs.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Step Clustering and Generalized Nash Bargaining-Based Planning Strategy of Community-Shared Energy Storage for Large-Scale Prosumers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10274997</link><description>Inspired by economies of scale, the joint planning of community-shared energy storage (CSES) among prosumers provides a new solution to the issues of high investment costs associated with independent construction of individual energy storage. However, the cooperation among large-scale prosumers is rarely investigated and there is an urgent need to formulate an appropriate strategy. Hence, a multi-step clustering and generalized Nash bargaining (GNB)-based CSES joint planning strategy for large-scale prosumers is proposed. First, a CSES planning-oriented multi-step clustering algorithm based on nonparametric kernel density estimation (NPKDE) and a modified fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm is proposed to reduce the input data dimensionality of the planning model. Then, taking the optimal construction time sequence into consideration, a bi-level CSES joint planning model is established to minimize the total costs of prosumers. On this basis, a contribution rate index is designed to evaluate prosumers' bargaining power, and a GNB-based allocation strategy is formulated for realizing fair cost allocation. Finally, case studies show that the proposed strategy can help large-scale prosumers effectively deal with the joint CSES planning problem and achieve lower investment and operation costs. It also demonstrates that the proposed cost allocation approach is more efficient and practical than other cooperative game-based methods.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Coordinated Control Strategy for Frequency Regulation of MMC-HVDC Connecting Offshore Wind Farms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10278216</link><description>To solve the problems of weak inertia support and poor frequency regulation capability of power system, a novel coordinated control strategy for frequency regulation of MMC-HVDC connecting offshore wind farms (OWFs) is proposed to improve system frequency stability. In terms of inertia support, based on analyzing the available energy margin of MMC-HVDC, a virtual inertia control method based on decoupling control of DC voltage and capacitor voltage is proposed, which can fully utilize the energy margin of capacitors and improve its inertia support capability. The coupling relationship between the rotor speed of wind turbines and the frequency is directly established through DC voltage, an inertia support coordinated control strategy for MMC-HVDC and OWFs is designed to realize the rational utilization of available energy. In terms of primary frequency regulation, according to the local DC voltage, a primary frequency regulation control strategy is proposed for OWFs based on the variable speed control and pitch angle control. The overall coordination is realized through the reasonable design of control links and parameters, so as to improve the frequency stability of the system. Finally, the simulation model of MMC-HVDC connecting OWFs is built to verify the validity of the proposed control strategies.</description></item><item><title>Neural Networks-Based Inverter Control: Modeling and Adaptive Optimization for Smart Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10283888</link><description>The optimal voltage control of inverter-based resources, especially under the high penetration of solar photovoltaics, is critical to the stability of the distribution power system. However, the computational complexity as well as the coordinated operation performance of the voltage control optimization in the distribution power system limits the real-time applications. To mitigate this issue, a model-free based adaptive optimal control scheme for the smart inverter is proposed to maximize the active power generation, minimize the power loss, and maintain the bus voltages in smart distribution networks. An inverter-based optimization model for coordinated operation is first established, considering the uncertainties of renewable power generation. Subsequently, by collecting the data and control strategies, the neural networks (NNs) based algorithm is proposed to efficiently predict the best possible control strategy. The main objective of this scheme is to accurately predict candidate optimal solutions with near-negligible feasibility and optimization gaps, with the advantage of avoiding complicated iteration-based numerical algorithms. Thereafter, the co-simulation among OpenDSS, MATLAB, and Python is set up to fully take advantage of the three individual software. Experiments are conducted based on different control parameter characteristics and structures of NNs. The results reveal that an average mean squared error of 0.013 and 1 ms response time are achieved, which is lower than some state-of-the-art methods.</description></item><item><title>A Control Method Using Two Electromotive Forces and a Disturbance Observer to Improve the Dynamics of a Virtual Synchronous Machine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10285072</link><description>The modern power grid is facing a significant challenge due to decreasing grid inertia, which is caused by the high penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs). Virtual synchronous machines (VSMs) have been considered as effective solutions to support the grid by providing inertial responses similar to that of traditional synchronous machines. However, fast and flexible dynamic responses to reference inputs, which can be achieved by conventional RES interfacing inverters, are degraded when inverters emulate the behavior of a synchronous machine. In this article, a current-referencing electrified synchronous machine (CURESYM) is proposed as a control method to adjust the dynamics to the reference input regardless of the parameter settings for emulating a synchronous generator. That is, the output current of CURESYM can be regulated with an intended dynamic response to follow the current reference. In addition, the accuracy of the current regulation can be enhanced by virtue of a disturbance observer. The fundamental characteristics of CURESYM are described with laboratory-scale experimental results. Finally, the effectiveness of CURESYM is discussed with practical data from on-site tests that applied the proposed method to a battery energy storage system in an actual island microgrid.</description></item><item><title>Day-Ahead PV Power Forecasting Model Based on Fine-Grained Temporal Attention and Cloud-Coverage Spatial Attention</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292906</link><description>With the increase of grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) power plants, measuring the uncertainty of PV output forecast due to multiple meteorological factors has become an important method to ensure the stable operation of the power system. However, the manual similar days' extraction methods of historical power features and cloud motion features, which are commonly used for PV spatial-temporal prediction, are inefficient and coarse-grained. In this paper, focusing on automatic attention of the local similar sequences in daily features, we improve the attention scoring method of the original transformer to increase the calculation accuracy of the similarity of PV power sequences. We construct an end-to-end PV power prediction framework using an encoder-decoder architecture. Based on the spatial-temporal similarity characteristics of PV output, the fine-grained temporal and cloud-covered spatial attentions embedded in the prediction framework are proposed using the improved similar sequence attention module. Among them, fine-grained temporal attention can dynamically position and utilize similar historical PV power sequences for the predicted period; cloud-coverage spatial attention automatically captures the neighbor site's matching PV power sequences. Experiments were conducted on a real PV dataset, and the root mean square error was reduced by 21.34% on average compared to the baseline model. The results proved the effectiveness of the proposed model.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Wind Power Scenario Generation Based on Conditional Latent Diffusion Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10296015</link><description>Quantifying short-term uncertainty in wind power plays a crucial role in power system decision-making. In recent years, the scenario generation community has conducted numerous studies employing generative models. Among these generative models, diffusion models have shown remarkable capabilities with excellent posterior representation. However, diffusion models are seldom used to quantify renewable energy uncertainty. To fill this research gap, this manuscript proposes a novel conditional latent diffusion model (CLDM) adapted for short-term scenario generation. CLDM decomposes the wind power scenario generation task into deterministic forecasting and forecast error scenario generation. The embedding network is used to regress deterministic forecasts, which reduces the denoising complexity of diffusion models. The denoising network generates forecast error scenarios in a latent space. Subsequently, the wind power scenarios are reconstructed by combining deterministic forecasts and forecast error scenarios. The case study compares with existing state-of-the-art methods, CLDM demonstrates superior evaluation metrics and enhances the denoising efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Periodic Allocation Mechanism for Allocating Demand Response Reserves Deployed by Multiple Ancillary Services</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10296534</link><description>High penetration of renewable energy resources poses technical and economic challenges to system operation. Utilizing demand response to provide ancillary services is beneficial to the security of the grid, but for this, an adequate level of reserves to support possible ancillary services is required. Reasonable allocation of the demand response reserves (DRREs) deployed by different ancillary services can guarantee performance and participant profits during ancillary service provision. An allocation mechanism that periodically allocates DRREs for various ancillary services considering uncertainty and demand response resource (DRR) sufficiency is proposed to address this problem. The participants include purchasers and providers of DRRs. First, K-means clustering is used to obtain the occurrence characteristics of different ancillary service events. Second, the utility functions of the participants in the allocation process are modeled while fully considering the uncertainty in periodic allocation. Then, different types of Stackelberg games are formulated to determine the DRREs deployed by different ancillary services under different DRR sufficiency situations. Finally, an intraday scheduling method is presented to optimize the use of the allocated DRREs and achieve the expected regulation performance. Simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed allocation mechanism in terms of achieving a win-win situation for all participants.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Incentive Pricing on Charging Stations for Real-Time Congestion Management in Distribution Network: An Adaptive Model-Based Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10298595</link><description>This paper concerns the pricing strategy for real-time distribution network congestion management, aiming at maximizing the total social welfare while eliminating congestion. The difficulty lies in dealing with the complex time-varying relationship between price and charging demand in the integrated power system and transportation network, and ensuring the safe application of the proposed method with limited real historical data. To address these challenges, we first model the EV user charging decision-making process to indirectly reflect the unquantifiable price and demand relationship, and then formulate the pricing problem as a bi-level model with a constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). After that, we propose a model-based safe DRL framework and develop an adaptive model-based safe deep reinforcement learning (AMSDRL) algorithm to solve the CMDP problem. AMSDRL learns the environment transition model and uses a strict and adaptive cost constraint to offset potential modeling errors. Compared to the state-of-the-art safe DRL methods, AMSDRL can be deployed with security guarantees by training on limited historical data, which is more practical for applications. The numerical results on modified IEEE 33-bus and 118-bus systems and a transportation network with real-world EV data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Autonomous Energy Management Strategy for Multi-Paralleled Hybrid Energy Storage Systems in the DC Microgrid With Mismatched Line Impedance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10298785</link><description>In this paper, a decentralized P-V$^{2}$ droop-based energy management strategy for the hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs), including multiple batteries/supercapacitors (SCs), in the DC microgrid is proposed. By using the output voltage of the SC converter as the unified feedback voltage in each HESS, the impacts of non-negligible and mismatched line impedance on the power allocation performance and bus voltage tracking are eliminated. Compared with the I-V droop-based method, the adopted P-V$^{2}$ droop technique improves the stability of the HESS, especially considering the constant power loads (CPLs). In addition, the state-of-charge (SoC) recovery is considered for the SCs to prolong the service life of the HESSs. Finally, the experiment and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations have been carried out for the studied system to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.</description></item><item><title>A Bayesian Hierarchical Model to Understand the Effect of Terrain on Wind Turbine Power Curves</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10301539</link><description>This paper is concerned with explicitly modeling the effect of terrain on wind power curves. Terrain characteristics are spatially-varying but temporally constant, whereas other power curve-affiliating variables such wind speed, temperature, and wind power vary both spatially and temporally. In order to effectively model such two modes of variation in the data, we employ a Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) that connects the terrain characteristics with the parameters in a power curve. BHM jointly models the data from all turbines on a wind farm for attaining the turbine-specific, terrain-incorporating power curves. Our analysis shows that, out of the three terrain variables available in our data, ruggedness has the strongest effect on the power curve. We also evaluate the applicability of using the resulting power curve model for turbines on a different terrain and find that incorporating terrain information explicitly is beneficial. The specific BHM mechanism of using terrain information leads to 7&#8211;10% improvement over the group averaging approach.</description></item><item><title>A Stochastic Charging Station Deployment Model for Electrified Taxi Fleets in Coupled Urban Transportation and Power Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10306294</link><description>Metropolitansworldwide are increasingly adopting electric taxis (ET) to address concerns about transportation-related emissions. However, the widespread deployment of electric taxis presents challenges in terms of increased electricity demand and changing demand profiles. This transition impacts both the urban transportation network (TN) and the electricity power distribution network (PDN), highlighting the interdependence between these two systems. In this paper, we propose a two-stage stochastic programming planning model that aims to optimize both the TN and PDN, enabling efficient deployment of charging stations and grid upgrades. Our model seeks to strike a balance between meeting ET drivers' charging preferences, minimizing the costs associated with infrastructure deployment and grid expansion, and harmonizing the coordination between the TN and PDN. Additionally, we explore the potential benefits of utilizing an autonomous ET fleet to enhance overall system performance.</description></item><item><title>Low-Voltage Survivability of Islanded Microgrids With Mixture of Single-Phase and Three-Phase DGs under Harmonic Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308631</link><description>Unbalanced low-voltage survivability of islanded microgrids under three-phase nonlinear load conditions in terms of primary control of distributed generations (DGs) is a research gap. This paper bridges the gap by proposing dynamic-sliding mode controller (SMC) for the voltage control loop and a novel current limiting strategy (CLS) based on the sliding-discrete Fourier transform (DFT) algorithm. The proposed sliding-DFT-based CLS separates fundamental and harmonic components of the reference value of inverter current and only restricts its fundamental component to a value less than the threshold value. The proposed dynamic-SMC, which presents robust performance with low chattering phenomenon, in combination with the sliding-DFT-based CLS prevents DG's output voltage distortion. This feature is favorable for supplying local and sensitive loads. Moreover, single-phase washout filter-based power sharing method has been implemented to ensure precise active power sharing and frequency regulation of the microgrid with mixture of single-phase and three-phase DGs during asymmetrical short-circuit faults as well as better fault clearance dynamics than the conventional three-phase droop control method. The offline and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation results also confirm the effectiveness of the proposed CLS and voltage controller applied to the control structure of DGs operating in the grid-forming mode in comparison with existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Secondary Control With an Event-Triggered Consensus-Based Observer for Energy Storage Systems in Islanded DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10306326</link><description>This paper proposes a distributed secondary control strategy with an event-triggered consensus-based observer. Firstly, a voltage-shifting term is introduced in the proposed control strategy to ensure accurate current sharing, faster state-of-charge (SOC) balancing and bus voltage restoration. Since the SOC balancing speed becomes very slow when the difference in SOC between battery energy units (BEUs) is small, and SOC balancing of BEUs with low power is difficult. Therefore, an adaptive SOC balancing factor to improve the balancing speed is proposed in this control strategy. In addition, communication delay can lead to large errors in traditional consensus-based observers, and continuous communication can bring a significant burden. Considering these issues, the event-triggered consensus-based observer is proposed. This observer can achieve accurate average consensus under communication delay and greatly reduce communication burden. The convergence of the proposed observer under communication delay is theoretically proven, and the Zeno behavior is excluded. At last, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy has been verified in MATLAB/Simulink and RT-LAB experiments.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Agent Graph Reinforcement Learning Method for Electric Vehicle on-Route Charging Guidance in Coupled Transportation Electrification</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10310266</link><description>This paper proposes a multi-agent deep graph reinforcement learning-based EV on-route charging guidance strategy, aiming at minimizing the charging cost for EV drivers in an uncertain and complex environment. First, a real-time online EV charging guidance framework with bi-timescales coupled transportation electrification is proposed. On the slow timescale, the distribution locational marginal pricing of the node where the charging station is located is solved by the power purchase cost optimization of the power distribution network. On the fast timescale, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning is used to solve real-time EV requests. Second, charging stations are considered as agents, and the potential competition for future charging demand at charging stations is considered. A multi-agent actor critic algorithm with embedded graph attention networks is proposed to optimize charging decision-making of EV drivers, which exploits the interactions between agents&#8217; observations using graph attention networks. Case studies are carried out in a practical area of Xi'an, China. We analyze the necessity of model components. The effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing charging cost and its applicability in PV-equipped scenarios is verified. The convergence performance and scalability are verified by the comparison with SAC and MADDPG algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Committed Carbon Emission Operation Region for Integrated Energy Systems: Concepts and Analyses</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10313074</link><description>A novel concept called the committed carbon emission operation region (CCEOR) of integrated energy systems (IESs) is proposed in this paper, which provides a powerful tool for low-carbon operation analyses (LCOA) of IESs. The CCEOR of IESs is first defined, and a CCEOR model is then proposed by considering the uncertainty of renewable power outputs and the characteristics of low-carbon sequential operation. Based on the nonlinear constraint transformation method and distributionally robust chance-constrained (DRCC) approach, a reformulation method is developed to convert the proposed uncertain nonlinear CCEOR model into a deterministic mixed-integer convex CCEOR model. The characteristics of the CCEOR are investigated. Based on the transformed CCEOR model, the CCEOR is a high-dimensional and bounded region composed of finite convex sub-regions. A region approximation method is then presented to construct the CCEOR. The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed CCEOR model and method are validated by numerical simulation on three test systems. Simulation results indicate that the proposed CCEOR can characterize the low-carbon feasible space (LCFS) visually, the visual coupling relationships between observation variables and LCFS, and the comprehensive low-carbon operation information of operation points.</description></item><item><title>Joint Sizing Optimization Method of PVs, Hybrid Energy Storage Systems, and Power Flow Controllers for Flexible Traction Substations in Electric Railways</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10313989</link><description>Flexible traction substation (FTSS) integrates PVs, energy storage systems (ESSs), and railway power flow controllers (RPFCs) into the existing split-phase traction substation. It is a vital solution in advancing electric railways towards a low-carbon, efficient, and grid-friendly future. To improve the techno-economic performance of FTSSs, this paper proposes a sizing method to jointly size PV, RPFC, and battery-ultracapacitor hybrid ESS (HESS). Firstly, a flexible operation model of FTSS is established. It fully uses the capacity of RPFCs for improving the three-phase voltage unbalance and average power factor, thus, reducing the capacity requirements of RPFCs. Next, a linearized approach is developed for estimating battery aging affected by battery cycles, depth of discharge, state of charge, and calendar time. It facilitates obtaining battery sizing with relatively accurate life evaluation in sizing optimization. Then, a joint sizing optimization model of PV, HESS, and RPFC is established to minimize the total annualized investment and operation cost of an FTSS, and it is formulated as mixed-integer second-order programming. Finally, case studies show that the proposed method can optimize the total annualized cost of FTSSs while ensuring efficient energy utilization and improvements of the three-phase voltage unbalance and average power factor.</description></item><item><title>Novel Black Start Control Strategy With Power Boundary Analysis for PMSG-Based Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10319342</link><description>A novel power boundary analysis-based black start control (PBBC) strategy of PMSG-based wind turbines (WTs) is proposed in this paper to reduce the outage time of WTs and improve the reliability of wind power supply. The active power-rotor speed maximum boundary is quantified to estimate the kinetic energy (KE) reserve limit and the power response capability of the WTs during the black start period. In the power boundary analysis, the power response capability will collapse as the rotor speed increases to maximum. To achieve the trade-off between high KE reserve and power response capability, an overloaded power response control method during the black start period is developed, which can fully utilize the reserved KE. Moreover, the dc-bus capacitor charging model of WTs with initial KE is constructed, which can accurately represent the required KE of the WTs black start. The WTs are coordinated to achieve black start with the minimum backup power supply for the safety devices and auxiliary load according to the capacitor charging model. The proposed PBBC strategy can maximize the KE reserve of the WT and improve the power response capability, as well as reduce the backup power cost during the black start period.</description></item><item><title>Low Carbon Planning of Multiple Integrated Energy Systems Considering Trans-Regional Battery Logistics Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10323512</link><description>With the emergence of integrated energy system (IES) paradigm, planning and control of multiple interconnected IESs starts to draw attention in academia.

Mode I is active energy control. It is activated at high fault levels, when the reactive power output capability of the MMC is weak. Mode I uses the MMC sub-module energy to maximise the absorption of offshore surplus power to mitigate DC overvoltage problems. Mode II is dynamic reactive current optimization (DRO) control. It is activated at medium fault levels. It dynamically optimises the MMC active and reactive current command values within the permitted current margins. This simultaneously enables voltage support to the onshore grid and maximises offshore active power output, reducing offshore surplus power. Mode III is energy coordinated synchronous (ECS) control. It is activated under more mild faults. It allows simultaneous adjustment of the energy absorption rate of the wind farm-side MMC (WFMMC) and the grid-side MMC (GSMMC). This allows the energy margin of the MMCs to be utilised more fully to improve support to the onshore grid while maintaining fault ride-through capability. Finally the correctness and validity of the proposed method was verified by the PSCAD/EMTDC.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Objective Optimization Based Voltage Injection Technique for Minimizing Imbalance and Harmonics in AC Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10347373</link><description>Negative-sequence components and harmonics are generated in the current and voltage of an islanded AC microgrid under unbalanced and nonlinear loading conditions. Without any external controller or feedback signal filter, such components give power-sharing errors and develop voltage distortion at the output of participating inverters associated with particular sources. This paper proposes a decentralized inverter control scheme with an advanced voltage injection technique that minimizes the voltage unbalance factor (VUF) and reduces voltage total harmonic distortion (THD) in a low-voltage AC microgrid using Pareto multi-objective optimization (PMOO). It has a mean function with a second-order filter to minimize the DC offset and distortion in the feedback signal. It manages power sharing in a multi-bus distribution network with an advanced angle droop control. It also accounts for the line impedance, i.e., connecting the inverter unit to the network and the effect of zero sequence components. The simulation is tested on a modified CIGRE LV multi-bus distribution system with four wire configurations and experimentally validated on a two DG, single-bus resistive distribution model.</description></item><item><title>Data Driven Decentralized Control of Inverter Based Renewable Energy Sources Using Safe Guaranteed Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10354415</link><description>The wide integration of inverter based renewable energy sources (RESs) in modern grids may cause severe voltage violation issues due to high stochastic fluctuations of RESs. Existing centralized approaches can achieve optimal results for voltage regulation, but they have high communication burdens; existing decentralized methods only require local information, but they cannot achieve optimal results. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based methods are effective to deal with uncertainties, but it is difficult to guarantee secure constraints in existing DRL training. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes a projection embedded multi-agent DRL algorithm to achieve decentralized optimal control of distribution grids with guaranteed 100% safety. The safety of the DRL training is guaranteed via an embedded safe policy projection, which could smoothly and effectively restrict the DRL agent action space, and avoid any violation of physical constraints in distribution grid operations. The multi-agent implementation of the proposed algorithm enables the optimal solution achieved in a decentralized manner that does not require real-time communication for practical deployment. The proposed method is tested in modified IEEE 33-bus distribution and compared with existing methods; the results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving decentralized optimal control with guaranteed 100% safety and without the requirement of real-time communications.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Objective Stochastic Optimization Approach for Planning a Multi-Energy Microgrid Considering Unscheduled Islanded Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10354526</link><description>The multi-energy microgrid (MEMG) improves the energy supply economy through a multi-energy coupling operation. However, due to faults or maintenance, outages may occur in the main grid, forcing the MEMG switch to the islanded mode, which heavily impacts the energy supply reliability. To solve this problem, a multi-objective stochastic optimization approach for planning the MEMG considering unscheduled islanded operation is proposed in this paper. This method aims to optimize the planning decision, improve the operation economy in the grid-connected mode and enhance the energy supply reliability in the islanded mode. A planning-operation co-optimization model is established with two objective functions: the minimum total planning cost and the minimum expected economic loss caused by islanded operation. The model incorporates equipment capacity allocation constraints, operation constraints in two operation modes and load curtailment constraints in the islanded mode. In addition to considering the uncertainties of load and renewable energy, the model of the uncertain islanded mode is established using four correlated random variables, and the scenario tree is used for islanded scenario generation. The adaptive weighted sum (AWS) method is used to solve the multi-objective model and obtain an optimal and evenly distributed Pareto frontier. On this basis, the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) is employed to determine the final planning scheme. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which makes a trade-off between planning economy and energy supply reliability.</description></item><item><title>Grid-Forming Control of Offshore Wind Farms Connected With Diode-Based HVdc Links Based on Remote Active Power Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10361591</link><description>The connection of offshore wind farms (OWFs) via diode rectifier-based- high-voltage direct current (DR-HVdc) transmission requires the use of wind turbine (WT) converters with grid-forming (GFM) capability. However, active and reactive power coupling and oscillation issues have been revealed in WTs employing reactive power frequency (Q/f) droop-based control schemes. This paper proposes a GFM control for OWFs based on remote active power regulation. The proposed scheme remotely regulates the active power of the DR-HVdc link by adjusting the dc voltage of the onshore modular multilevel converter (MMC). As a result, the voltages of offshore point of common coupling and WT converters are freed from being controlled for active power. On this basis, the WT converters can be equipped with classical GFM control schemes that incorporate active power frequency (P/f) and reactive power voltage (Q/V) droop relationships. The offshore frequency acts as an indication of the OWF active power balance and it is measured and transmitted to the onshore MMC through a communication channel to close the remote active power control. Comparative studies of power coupling characteristics and stability reveal that the proposed control scheme can achieve efficient decoupling control of active and reactive power in WT converters, prevent oscillation risks, and significantly enhance the system's stability. The feasibility and advantages of the proposed control scheme are verified through comparative time-domain simulations.</description></item><item><title>Incentivizing the Collaboration Between Travelers and Power-Traffic Network Operators: An Asymmetric Nash Bargaining Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10363682</link><description>With the proliferation of electric vehicles and the deepened interdependence between power and traffic networks, tariff- and subsidy-based monetary incentives have been leveraged by network operators to shape vehicular&amp;amp;charging flow distributions to more closely align with network-level objectives. Travelers and network operators are generally regarded as two self-interested entities. As a result, the conflict between the system- and user-optimality usually forces travelers to bear an extra expenditure (either tariff payment or detour time) or requires network operators to dispense overmuch subsidies, both resulting in social welfare losses. The present work bridges this gap by designing a Cooperative Game based operation scheme that facilitates the collaboration between the two entities, in which collaborative travelers follow the social routing advice and then receive a certain level of reimbursement from network operators. To ensure a fair benefit allocation, we quantify the individual contribution as the difference of the path travel cost before and after the collaboration, then adopt the asymmetric Nash bargaining theory to settle the dispense of reimbursement. Numerical results on case studies indicate that the proposed model outperforms the subsidy-based non-cooperative Stackelberg Game in terms of promoting a win-win situation for both entities.</description></item><item><title>Wave Energy Optimal Control Structure With Second-Order Sliding Mode Tracking: Hardware-in-the-Loop Assessment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10363673</link><description>This article presents a hardware-in-the-loop assessment of a moment-based optimal controller including a robust super-twisting tracking term. The aim of the overall control structure is to maximise the energy extracted by a flap-type wave energy converter. An experimental assessment is performed via hardware-in-the-loop testing, which allows experiments in a controlled environment and repeatable conditions. Key aspects of the control structure are analysed in the results, with particular focus on the behaviour of the second-order sliding mode tracking term. Robustness against modelling uncertainties and finite-time convergence are evaluated, initially for a single sea state, and then across three different sea conditions. Excellent tracking performance is observed for all considered operating conditions. Finally, the super-twisting algorithm in the tracking loop is compared with the performance of a linear controller synthesised based on Youla-Ku&#269;era parametrisation, observing that the former presents better tracking capabilities, also outperforming in terms of energy extraction.</description></item><item><title>Fuzzy Adaptive Frequency Support Control Strategy for Wind Turbines With Improved Rotor Speed Recovery</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10365243</link><description>With the large-scale integration of wind power, the frequency stability of the power system is facing a significant challenge due to the wind power generation system typically operating in maximum power point tracking (MPPT) mode. Traditional frequency support control methods for wind turbines (WTs) do not consider the state of WTs and the frequency changes simultaneously. This article proposes a fuzzy adaptive frequency support control strategy for WTs with improved rotor speed recovery. Based on fuzzy logic control, the proportional gain is adaptively adjusted using the rotor speed and frequency deviation to support the grid frequency. It can fully utilize the frequency support capability of WTs with more available rotor kinetic energy while averting the over-deceleration of WTs with low rotor speed. Moreover, as the frequency deviation increases, the output power of WTs is increased by a larger proportional gain to alleviate the excessive frequency degradation. In response to the shortcomings of traditional rotor speed recovery methods, an improved rotor speed recovery method is presented by integral control, which can restore the rotor speed in stages without affecting the frequency support performance of WTs and can avoid secondary frequency drop (SFD). Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Fault-Tolerant and Attack-Resilient Cooperative Control in an Offshore Wind Farm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10366828</link><description>Modern wind farms promise increased capacity, sustainability, and efficiency through the integration of information technology with the existing wind energy technologies. However, this integration creates a new category of cyber-physical vulnerabilities stemming from physical faults and/or cyberattacks potentially leading to devastating physical impacts and catastrophic consequences. The large scale and high complexity of a wind farm, in addition to its growing connectivity, control functionality, and wind intermittency and variability make the task of cyber-physical protection particularly challenging. This paper introduces novel approaches for guaranteeing the safety, security, and reliability of a modern wind farm under simultaneous occurrence of faults and attacks using an advanced cyber-physical health monitoring scheme, defined as &#8220;intrusion detection and fault diagnosis system&#8221;, as well as fault-tolerant/attack-resilient control strategies at different levels. The proposed fault-tolerant control strategy is based on adaptive model predictive control at turbine level, enhanced with a control reallocation mechanism at farm level. The attack-resilient control strategy is based on an automatic signal correction (ASC) technique that is applied at network operator level. The effectiveness of the suggested approaches is demonstrated using an offshore wind farm model under wind turbulences, measurement noises, and realistic physical fault and cyberattack scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Dual Current Control of Renewable Energy Sources for Recent Grid Code Compliance and Reliability Enhancement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10373073</link><description>Inverter-interfaced renewable energy sources (IIRESs) are controlled to follow low-voltage ride-through requirements during different fault conditions to support grid voltages and enhance stability. However, these requirements could result in improper operation of conventional protection functions, e.g., phase selection, that are designed based on the fault current characteristics of conventional power systems. In this paper, a dual-current controller (DCC) is designed for IIRESs to allow precise operation of the conventional phase selection method (PSM) while following the positive- and negative-sequence reactive current generation (RCG) requirements imposed by recent grid codes (GCs). First, the negative-sequence current reference is designed to comply with GC requirements and inject the minimum value of negative-sequence-active current that secures a correct operation of phase selection. Subsequently, the positive-sequence-reactive current is designed to comply with RCG requirements and allow injecting the maximum combination of the positive-and negative-sequence currents without hindering the proper operation of PSM or RCG requirements. Comprehensive time-domain simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed DCC in meeting both PSM and recent RCG requirements during different fault types, resistances, and locations.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive BESS Controller for Stability Enhancement of Islanded Low Voltage Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10376028</link><description>Battery energy storage system (BESS), as grid-forming unit, can quickly regulate voltage and frequency for a 100% inverter-based islanded low voltage microgrid. However, due to some inherent characteristics of this network, such as: (a) coupling among voltage and frequency dynamics, (b) dynamics of dc source, and (c) timescale coupling among converter and network, small-signal stability is a major concern. This paper proposes an adaptive feed-forward compensation scheme for each BESS unit to reduce dynamic interactions among converters and network/load parameters. Additionally, the proposed scheme can enhance system damping capability for a wide range of operating conditions without the need for any prior/ continuous generation/network information or additional sensors. This technique can preserve the voltage/frequency regulation capability of the traditional ($\omega -P/V-Q$) droop control scheme for any low voltage networks. The existing small-signal model is modified to include dc-source, dc link, and proposed feed-forward dynamics, which assists in analyzing the impact of dc-side, ac-side, and network parameters on system small-signal stability. The system performance is analyzed with extensive case studies conducted on a CIGRE TF C$6:04:02$ benchmark system. The proposed model is validated using a real-time digital simulator with hardware-in-loop setup.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Power Imbalance Time Series With Solar Power Penetration: Butterfly Curve</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443304</link><description>Variable renewable energy (VRE) is known to be highly influenced by weather events and may ramp up or down abruptly. Therefore, increasing penetration of solar power will cause fundamental and structural changes to power system operation regimes. In this letter, we conduct an analysis of a 1-minute temporal resolution dataset from 6 Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) in the US during 2018 and 2019. By examining day-ahead power exchange and real-time power imbalance time series characteristics, distinct patterns can be observed: the day-ahead power exchange time series curve looks like the canyon, while the real-time power imbalance time series curve looks like a butterfly shape, which becomes bigger as solar penetration level increases. This letter will provide some scientific evidence for the reform of the day-ahead power exchange and real-time power balance operation in response to high solar power penetration.</description></item><item><title>Microgrid Modeling for Stability Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10293188</link><description>This document is a summary of a report prepared by the IEEE PES Task Force (TF) on Microgrid (MG) Dynamic Modeling, IEEE Power and Energy Society, Tech.

In this configuration, the dc MG naturally experiences a second harmonic current injection caused by the double-frequency component of the ac side instantaneous power. This paper proposes a new decentralized control method by utilization of the injected harmonic for power sharing. The proposed method enables accurate power sharing among dc sources and precise global power sharing among dc and ac sources without imposing any dc side voltage deviation. In this method, each dc source adjusts its power based on the frequency of the harmonic component. Additionally, the IC ensures that the voltage level of the dc MG remains at the rated value. Capacitive virtual impedances are integrated into the dc sources to facilitate second harmonic current sharing among them and prevent the circulation of harmonic current flow between the dc sources and the IC&#8217;s dc side capacitor. To fulfill the objectives, each dc source simultaneously regulates the second harmonic voltage of its output filter capacitor and the dc component current of its output filter inductor. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated through time-domain and frequency-domain simulations.</description></item><item><title>Systematic Controller Design for Inverter-Based Microgrids With Certified Large-Signal Stability and Domain of Attraction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10310265</link><description>Inverter-based resources (IBRs) introduce fast dynamics and high non-linearities to microgrids, degrading their stability and complicating the design of effective controllers. To address the arising vulnerability and non-linearities, this paper presents a systematic controller design approach that ensures large-signal stability and domain of attraction (DOA) for islanded microgrids. First, the nonlinear electromagnetic transient model of inverter-based microgrids is developed in the rotating dq reference frame, which is then transformed to a homogeneous-like system with nonlinear terms acting as superimposed parameter uncertainties. Next, the stability conditions, including certified stability, certified DOA, and their combination, are derived to rigorously guarantee a designated range to be a subset of DOA. The designated region is customized and flexible enough to cover microgrids&#8217; normal or emergency operational ranges, such as low- and high-voltage ride-through (L/HVRT) conditions. Then, a systematic method for identifying the candidate control parameter set is developed by integrating the analytical stability conditions. This approach is further exemplified in the droop controller design to improve microgrid stability and resilience. Finally, the proposed systematic controller design is verified through numerical simulation and power hardware-in-the-loop experiments to ensure large-signal stability and DOA of microgrids in emergency L/HVRT conditions.</description></item><item><title>More Efficient Energy Management for Hybrid AC/DC Microgrids With Hard Constrained Neural Network-Based Conversion Loss Surrogate Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10354442</link><description>Conversion loss modeling plays a crucial role in hybrid AC/DC microgrid (MG) energy management (EM). However, accurate calculation of the conversion losses is often very costly. Additionally, existing surrogate models typically rely on fixed-voltage DC buses, leading to excessive voltage magnitudes. To overcome these limitations, we propose surrogate models based on piecewise linear neural networks (NNs) that estimate conversion losses using converter power and variable-voltage DC buses. These NNs employs the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, allowing reformulation into linear constraints. During NN training, additional hard constraints are enforced via the augmented Lagrangian method to enhance feasibility. To limit the computational cost of the reformulated NN constraints, weights sparsity and ReLU stability regularizations are applied to the NN training process. The efficient energy management is implemented as a two-stage stochastic unit commitment (UC) problem with integer recourse. To solve this UC problem, we propose a finite iteration convergent Benders decomposition algorithm with several acceleration techniques, which reduce the computational burden significantly. Our case study demonstrates that: 1) the proposed surrogate model accurately approximates conversion losses while satisfying hard constraints, 2) optimizing the DC bus voltage leads to more efficient system operation, energy savings, and better overall performance, and 3) combining the NN weight optimization with Benders decomposition acceleration techniques significantly reduces the computational associated with the NN surrogates.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Volt/Var Control for Unbalanced Distribution Networks With Human-in-the-Loop Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10335935</link><description>This paper proposes a human-in-the-loop deep reinforcement learning (HL-DRL)-based VVC strategy to simultaneously reduce power losses, mitigate voltage violations and compensate for voltage unbalance in three-phase unbalanced distribution networks. Instead of fully trusting DRL actions made by deep neural networks, a human intervention module is proposed to modify dangerous actions that violate operation constraints during offline training. This module refers to well-designed human guidance rules based on voltage-reactive power sensitivities, which regulate PV reactive power to sequentially address local voltage violation and unbalance issues to obtain safe transitions. To efficiently and safely learn the optimal control policy from these training samples, a human-in-the-loop soft actor-critic (HL-SAC) solution method is then developed. Different from the standard SAC algorithm, an online switch mechanism between action exploration and human intervention is designed. The actor network loss function is modified to incorporate human guidance terms, which alleviates the inconsistency of the updating direction of actor and critic networks. A hybrid experience replay buffer including both dangerous and safe transitions is also used to facilitate the learning process towards human actions. Comparative simulation results on a modified IEEE 123-bus unbalanced distribution system demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in voltage control.</description></item><item><title>Primal-Dual Decomposed State Estimation for Multi-Energy Systems Leveraging Variational Bayesian Approximation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10298804</link><description>This paper proposes a new methodology for the tracking state estimation (SE) of multi-energy systems containing electricity, gas and heat networks.

The SE Kalman filter framework is extended to allow the application of the primal-dual decomposed constrained optimization. The primal problem is further decomposed into three sub-problems, corresponding to electricity, gas and heat networks. It is also proposed to solve the dual problem with a Newton &#8211; type second-order method. Efficient detection of bad data, without further aggravation of the measurement redundancy, is achieved by incorporating the Variational Bayesian approximation into the decomposed Kalman filter SE and developing the computation algorithms. The proposed methodology is tested on the developed regional and national multi-energy systems and its advantages are highlighted.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Scheduling of Mobile Energy Storage Capable of Variable Speed Energy Transmission</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304343</link><description>As a flexible type of energy transmission carrier, mobile energy storages usually are studied with a fixed driving speed, resulting in unsatisfactory system operation results. To address the problem, an optimal scheduling strategy of mobile energy storage capable of variable-speed energy transmission is proposed. Firstly, by analyzing the hydrogen-carrier vessel (HCV)&#8217;s variable speed-spatiotemporal characteristic mapping mechanism and the ability to supply hydrogen and electricity, an interisland energy variable-speed transmission model is developed. On this basis, an island energy microgrid (EMG) operation model compatible with variable-speed transmission energy is established, in order to reconcile HCV with hydrogen balance, power flow and frequency response. Additionally, considering the impact of uncertainties on the energy output, energy demand, frequency stability, and especially energy transmission sequencing, a stochastic dispatching strategy of the island energy microgrid groups (EMGG) is designed. This model is first linearized as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) problem, and then is solved quickly by a two-layer algorithm, where the upper layer finely manages the possible optimal EMG power reserve that ensures the frequency security, and the lower layer optimally coordinates the inter-island variable-speed energy transmission and island EMG operation. Finally, case studies on Island groups in the South China Sea verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Day-Ahead Scheduling and Online Dispatch of Energy Hubs: A Flexibility Envelope Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10333081</link><description>Energy hub is a micro energy system in industrial park or residential area. It makes full use of renewable resources through multi-energy integration. Proper coordination among generation units, battery and thermal storage devices provides additional flexibility to cope with volatile renewable power. Due to the lack of accurate predictions, the operator uses an interval estimation for day-ahead scheduling and makes online decisions in response to real-time observations without future renewable output values. This paper proposes an envelope-based approach which offers a thorough coordination between day-ahead scheduling and real-time dispatch. In the day-ahead stage, a flexibility envelope for admissible renewable power and action envelopes for controllable devices are determined from a convex quadratic program. In the real-time operation stage, online actions for generation facilities and storage devices are determined by a partial-quantile policy based on the current renewable output and those envelopes. Since the flexibility envelope intentionally caters to the interval estimation of renewable output, the online decisions would be less myopic. Test results demonstrate that the proposed method has an optimality gap smaller than 5% compared to the hindsight optimum, which is comparable to the model predictive control (MPC) method with exact predictions in the next 4&#8211;5 hours.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Stage Adaptive Stochastic-Robust Scheduling Method With Affine Decision Policies for Hydrogen-Based Multi-Energy Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10354055</link><description>Zero-carbon clean energy such as hydrogen has been developed rapidly to reduce carbon emissions, gradually promoting them as the main energy supply for multi-energy microgrids (MEMGs), which motivates the deployment of hydrogen-based MEMG (H-MEMG). The main difficulty of the H-MEMG scheduling problem is how to handle source/load uncertainties for ensuring the solution feasibility and economics in the actual operation. To this end, this paper proposes a novel multi-stage adaptive stochastic-robust optimization (MASRO) approach, which combines the ideas of stochastic programming and multi-stage robust optimization. The established model has the objective of the expected operation cost and ensures the solution feasibility by designed constraints rather than the &#8220;min-max&#8221; structure. Specifically, first, affine policies are adapted to describe the complex relationship between decision variables and uncertainty realizations; Second, an affine policy-based solution approach is proposed for the MASRO H-MEMG scheduling model. Then, the complex conversion relationship and coupling constraints are reformulated, and a tractable mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is established; Third, based on the solved affine functions, the real-time rolling and non-rolling economic dispatch models are proposed to respectively pursue the economic and computational requirements, and both can guarantee solution robustness and nonanticipativity. Numerical tests are implemented on a real H-MEMG, verifying that the proposed method could guarantee the feasibility and economic efficiency of actual H-MEMG operations.</description></item><item><title>A Game Bidding Model of Electricity and Hydrogen Sharing System Considering Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10412692</link><description>The uncertainty of renewable energy source (RES) and load may bring huge challenge to the operation of power systems. In order to meet the balance of supply and demand, a game bidding strategy considering uncertainty is proposed for the electric-hydrogen shared energy storage system (SESS). Firstly, based on Wasserstein distance in extreme scenarios, a reduced scale fuzzy set is constructed for the uncertainty of supply and demand. Secondly, Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism is introduced to deal with the misreporting and valuation behavior of microgrids (MGs). Then a two-stage distributed robust optimization (DRO) game model is designed for SESS&#8212;MGs through game bidding. The aim of Stage I can maximize the benefits of SESS, while the social welfare of each microgrid (MG) may be maximized in Stage II, which can achieve a unique Stackelberg equilibrium. So the DRO model is transformed into a solvable mathematical model by taking advantage of dual theory and adaptive McCormick algorithm. Finally, the case studies are simulated by using the IEEE 33 node power grid together with a 20 node hydrogen network, which can validate the effectiveness of the proposed model.</description></item><item><title>Power Reliability Service Provision and Pricing in Distribution Power Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10314417</link><description>For distribution utilities, it is important to match the power reliability service with the demand of users. However, since there are partial overlaps in the power supply paths of different nodes, the reliability of different nodes has the inherent coupling relation based on the network topology. The improvement of reliability level on individual nodes can hardly be separately controlled without causing any influence on other nodes. To solve this problem, this paper aims to study the co-optimization method of reliability service provision and pricing for the distribution utility. First, a joint placement method of common devices for reliability enhancement is presented. The coupling relationship between the load recovery states of different load nodes under the same fault is conveniently expressed. Second, a service menu design approach is introduced to determine the level and price of candidate reliability services. It considers that users have differentiated evaluations of service and select the service in the menu according to their profit maximization. Third, to overcome the free-riding issue that users receive unnecessarily high-reliability service, the load-shedding compensation method is proposed to exactly match the reliability level received by users to the service level selected by users. After the model transformation, the optimization model is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem. An acceleration algorithm with convergence guarantee is developed to mitigate the computational burden.</description></item><item><title>Incorporating Data-Driven Demand-Price Uncertainty Correlations Into Microgrid Optimal Dispatch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315234</link><description>A growing number of microgrid (MG) systems ipate in market trading as prosumers to improve their own operation profits, as well as the flexibility of power supply. To handle the MG dispatch problem with uncertainties in both load demands and electricity prices, this paper provides a data-driven robust optimization (RO) approach. Firstly, the correlations between the uncertainties of demands and prices are verified via the analysis of historical monitoring data from a real-world case. Based on the data-fitting for the rectangular and ellipsoidal intervals, a new data-driven demand-price uncertainty set with correlations is built to eliminate these unreasonable scenarios effectively. Secondly, a two-stage RO dispatch model is established considering multiple uncertainties of renewable-load power and prices in MGs. The bilinear objective term brings huge obstacles to the solution of the RO model, therefore a novel nested iterative algorithm is further exploited. The bilinear terms of power and price in the objective function are linearized by a binary expansion approach. Besides, to avoid the enumerations of numerous binary recourses in problem solving, the block coordinate descent (BCD) theory is adopted to co-optimize different types of variables, thereby enhancing the computational tractability. Numerical simulations indicate the validity and superiority of the developed RO model and the solution algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Frequency-Responsive Refrigerator Switching Controller</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10330137</link><description>Future low-inertia power systems will introduce challenges to system operators to maintain essential grid services such as fast frequency control (FFC). Hence, there is a need for efficient solutions that can provide the desired FFC capability and arrest high rate-of-change-of-frequency (RoCoF). Recent advancements in information and communication infrastructure within the smart grid concept have created new opportunities to optimally control and utilize the immense potential of thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs), such as refrigerators. However, modeling and controlling different types of TCLs to deliver a precise collective FFC response is challenging. In this regard, this paper develops an adaptive decentralized autonomous fuzzy-temperature-frequency (FTF) control strategy to enable refrigerators to alter their power consumption according to variations in the grid frequency. The ability of the proposed FTF controller to modify the power consumption of a population of refrigerators in accordance with a reference power profile is demonstrated through a set of simulations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller through a strong improvement in the frequency security parameters, i.e., RoCoF and frequency nadir, and with a negligible impact on the thermodynamic performance of refrigerators.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Practical Evaluation of AC&#8211;DC Solid-State Transformer With Electric Spring Functions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10330006</link><description>Power electronics (PE) devices have become ubiquitous in the modern power system. Their potential in participation in grid supporting has been gathering growing attention. PE-based electric spring (ES) technology has recently evolved from the low-voltage ac mains to the medium-voltage distribution network. When equipped with ES functions, solid-state transformers (SSTs) can be associated with energy storage and smart loads to absorb power fluctuations arising from renewable energy sources. Unlike previous studies in which PE systems are generally simplified as  ${V}$ ,  $\theta $ ,  ${P}$ ,  ${Q}$ , or represented by the simplest power converter topology, this paper implements and examines the grid-supporting functionality of a practical ES enabled-SST (ES-SST) system. The dynamic model of the ES-SST is presented and simulated, including both the circuit and control loops. Experimental results obtained from a scaled-down power system are also included to confirm the validity of the dynamic model in a microgrid environment. This dynamic model will facilitate smart-grid researchers to evaluate the use of a large group of distributed ES-SSTs in large power systems in future studies.</description></item><item><title>A Marginal Cost Consensus Scheme With Reset Mechanism for Distributed Economic Dispatch in BESSs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10302354</link><description>Battery energy storage systems (BESSs) are often integrated into the smart grid as the key equipment for valley filling and peak suppression. However, the internal power consumption and capacity degradation of battery cells can not be ignored. In addition, there are certain electric trading between the owner of the grid-connected BESSs and the electric company (EC). Therefore, an expenditure function for grid-connected BESSs is constructed in this paper, in which internal power consumption, capacity degradation and power trading are covered while meeting the balance of power supply and demand. On this basis, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition of the function is summarized as the consensus problem of marginal cost (MC) converging to time-phased electricity price. Thus, we plan to design a distributed MC consensus scheme for economic dispatch (ED) in BESSs based on multi-agent systems (MASs) on a small-time scale. In view of the low control accuracy and response speed of the existing distributed proportional protocol, this paper proposes a distributed ED (DED) scheme with reset mechanism based on a proportional integral (PI) control. When the proportional term encounters zero crossing, the integral term of the control scheme is reset to 0, which ensures that the signs of the two are aligned, thus accelerating MCs convergence and restraining overshoot. Parameter conditions for consensus, regularity and Zeno-free behavior are given through the relevant theoretical analysis. Several simulation cases are designed to verify the designed DED algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchically Distributed Energy Management in Distribution Systems: An Error-Tolerant and Asynchronous Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10302370</link><description>Distribution systems are becoming more complex with the integration of numerous distributed energy resources (DERs), such as distributed generators (DGs), distributed energy storages (DESs), and controllable end-users (EUs). Aggregators (Aggs) are emerging to bridge the gap between the distribution system operator (DSO) and EUs. This creates a hierarchical &#8220;DSO-Agg-EU&#8221; architecture that requires effective and efficient coordination among massive agents. However, this architecture faces challenges such as communication asynchrony and solution inexactness among different agents, which may undermine the performance of energy management or even cause unexpected failures. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an error-tolerant and asynchronous algorithm based on dual decomposition for hierarchically distributed energy management (HDEM). The algorithm is theoretically guaranteed to converge to a near-optimal value and can be further accelerated by Nesterov&#8217;s method. The algorithm is tested on the IEEE 123-bus distribution system and demonstrates high effectiveness and efficiency under asynchrony and inexactness.</description></item><item><title>Identifying Secure Operating Ranges for DER Control Using Bilevel Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10305207</link><description>Active distribution grids are accommodating an increasing number of controllable electric loads and distributed energy resources (DERs). A majority of these DERs are managed by entities other than the distribution utility, such as individual customers or third-party aggregators, who control the loads and DERs without consideration of any distribution grid constraints. This makes it challenging for a distribution system operator (DSO) to allow third-party aggregators and transmission operators to fully exploit the flexibility offered by these resources while also ensuring that distribution grid constraints such as voltage magnitude limits are not violated. In this paper, we develop a bilevel optimization-based framework to determine the aggregate power flexibility that can be obtained from an unbalanced distribution grid while ensuring that there is no disaggregation solution that leads to grid constraint violations. The results are a set of constraints and operating rules that are easy to communicate, and which provide the entities that procure flexibility from DERs (e.g., transmission operators or third-party aggregators) with the ability to freely implement their own disaggregation strategy without intervention from the DSO. The proposed approach is tested on two unbalanced distribution feeders and our simulation results indicate that it is possible to determine a wide range of aggregate power flexibility, as long as a simple set of rules for DER control activation are followed.</description></item><item><title>An Edge Intelligence-Based Framework for Online Scheduling of Soft Open Points With Energy Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10312803</link><description>Edge intelligence (EI) is an emerging interdiscipline to advance the coordination of artificial intelligence and edge computing. EI sinks the computation and decision-making process from centralized clouds to the edge node in proximity to terminal devices, which is robust to the unacceptable communication delay or disconnection. In this paper, we propose an EI-based framework for online scheduling of soft open points with energy storage (ES-SOPs), a novel power electronic device, to enhance both spatial and temporal flexibility in power distribution networks. The proposed framework empowers the edge computing via hybrid deep reinforcement learning (HDRL), which seamlessly combines advantages of both data-driven deep neural networks and physics-based ES-SOPs model. Inside the edge computing node, a deep neural network first learns a set of parameters from the historical data and ES-SOPs local status. Then, the outputs of the deep neural network are fed into a physics-based ES-SOPs model to construct its objective function, where rigorous operation constraints are included. Finally, this model is solved to obtain near-optimal ES-SOPs online scheduling. Case studies on a modified IEEE 33-node system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework under different levels of uncertainties and its superiority over safe DRL and model predictive control-based methods.</description></item><item><title>Optimized Energy Dispatch for Microgrids With Distributed Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315028</link><description>The increasing integration of renewable energy resources (RES) introduces uncertainties in modern power systems and makes the dynamic energy dispatch (DED) problem challenging. Uncertainties lead to dynamic grid control, which needs to be addressed for the optimized DED. Moreover, since energy usage and power generation are distributed, multiple parties can be involved in the DED problem. Thus, DED should be optimized in a distributed way for efficiency and privacy. With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning technology, various data can be gathered and analyzed to achieve intelligent energy management, and the dynamics of power grids should be considered for optimality. For this purpose, we investigate how reinforcement learning can be used to solve the DED problem for a dynamic microgrid (MG) environment. The objective is to determine the optimal power generation for each generator using fossil fuels at each time slot, to minimize the cumulative cost of power generation in a given time period. To achieve this goal, we first model the MG with the practical impact of batteries, photovoltaic (PV) panels, and load banks (external grids). Then we formulate the optimization problem of minimizing the total generation from fossil fuels. To solve this problem, we propose a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm to reduce communication costs and improve data privacy. In the proposed scheme, each generator is considered as an agent, which shares a global state and only obtains its own local loss. Then, different agents work jointly to minimize the global cost. Theoretical analysis is provided to prove the convergence of the proposed algorithms, which are also tested with real-world datasets. Results show that the policy learned from the proposed algorithms can balance the production and consumption in the MG for both fully and partially observable MG environments while simultaneously reducing the total generation cost from fossil fuels.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Objective Interval Optimization Dispatch of Microgrid via Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10345718</link><description>This paper presents an improved deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for solving the optimal dispatch of microgrids under uncertaintes. First, a multi-objective interval optimization dispatch (MIOD) model for microgrids is constructed, in which the uncertain power output of wind and photovoltaic (PV) is represented by interval variables. The economic cost, network loss, and branch stability index for microgrids are also optimized. The interval optimization is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP). Then, an improved DRL algorithm called triplet-critics comprehensive experience replay soft actor-critic (TCSAC) is proposed to solve it. Finally, simulation results of the modified IEEE 118-bus microgrid validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Day-Ahead Electricity Consumption Prediction of Individual Household&#8211;Capturing Peak Consumption Pattern</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315236</link><description>Day-ahead electricity consumption forecasting for individual residential consumers, especially the peak consumption time forecasting, is essential for home energy management system. However, it is considerably challenging since the single household consumption is highly volatile and stochastic and dependent on the underlying human behaviour. Further, the difficulties of accurately capturing the occurrence time of peak consumption in a house can limit the performance of existing machine learning-based load forecasting methods. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for day-ahead single-household electricity consumption forecasting by learning the peak consumption patterns of users. Instead of attempting to obtain the electricity consumption curve for the future 24 hours, the prediction of electricity consumption is achieved by combining the predicted base consumption, the predicted peak consumption occurrence time and the predicted amount of peak consumption within each time interval. The proposed framework can be used for both deterministic and probabilistic load forecasting of individual households. Case studies are conducted on hundreds of households from two different datasets. The results demonstrate that the performance of different deterministic load forecasting algorithms and probabilistic load forecasting algorithms can be improved after being integrated into the proposed framework.</description></item><item><title>Robust Co-Modeling for Privacy-Preserving Short-Term Load Forecasting With Incongruent Load Data Distributions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10454597</link><description>Short-term load forecasting (STLF) can support strategies for power retailers. Training based on aggregate load datasets can yield more precise STLF models. In real scenarios, however, retailers can only access the consumer information they serve. The aggregation of their data for centralized forecasting requires access to private local data, which may lead to potential security concerns. This paper proposes a method namely Privacy-Preserving  ${k}$ -means Federated Learning (PPK-Fed), to facilitate STLF co-modeling among retailers. Federated Learning (FL) is founded on the assumption of data consistency, which does not necessarily exist in real datasets. PPK-Fed incorporates  ${k}$ -means clustering together with convolutional neural networks into FL. PPK-Fed is proven to reduce the impact of potential data incongruence embedded in retailer local datasets. Besides, to address the sensitivity of the  ${k}$ -means prototype to the potential anomalies in the real dataset, PPK-Fed fuses density-based anomaly detection into  ${k}$ -means clustering under FL to improve robustness. For further model security, a secure multi-party computation (SMPC) scheme is designed in PPK-Fed. The model validity, privacy-preserving features, and robustness to anomalies have been verified using a real load dataset.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Vehicle Charging in Bilevel Power-Traffic Networks via Charging Demand Function</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10293190</link><description>Electric vehicle (EV) charging couples the operation of power and traffic networks. Specifically, the power network determines the charging price at various locations, while EVs on the traffic network optimize the charging power given the price, acting as price-takers. We model such decision-making processes by a bilevel program, with the power network at the upper-level and the traffic network at the lower-level. However, since the two networks are managed by separate entities and the charging expense term, calculated as the product of charging price and charging demand, is nonlinear. Solving the bilevel program is nontrivial. To overcome these challenges, we derive the charging demand function using multiparametric programming theory. This function establishes a piecewise linear relationship between the charging price and the optimal charging power, enabling the power network operator to manage EV charging power independently while accounting for the coupling between the two networks. With the derived function, we are also able to replace the nonlinear charging expense term with a piecewise quadratic one, thus guaranteeing solution optimality. Our numerical studies demonstrate that different traffic demands can have an impact on charging patterns and the power network can effectively incentivize charging at low-price nodes through price setting.</description></item><item><title>A Capacity-Based Regulation Method for Coordinating Electric Vehicle Charging Flows in Coupled Distribution and Transportation Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10295993</link><description>The proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) is bringing additional challenges to power distribution network (PDN) operations. Traditional regulation methods incentivize EVs to charge at expected places via price signals, which cannot guarantee a secure PDN operation due to uncertain responsiveness of EVs to charging prices. This paper explores the use of available EV charging station (EVCS) capacities as signals and proposes a regulation method to coordinate EV charging flows in coupled power and transportation networks. First, the proposed bi-level model optimizes the available charging capacities and schedules the least-cost power generation at the upper level, while assigning the traffic flows by user equilibrium and navigating the EV charging at the lower level. The adverse impact of EV charging behaviors on PDN operations is eliminated by the proposed model. Second, a branch price and cut-based decomposition algorithm is proposed to tackle the computational intractability and infeasibility brought about by the capacity regulation. Third, the inverse optimization technique is exploited to yield an enhanced regulation strategy that alleviates the impact of system adjustments on EV users. Finally, case studies are carried out on a practical network, which demonstrate the merits of the proposed capacity-based method over the traditional price-based method.</description></item><item><title>EV-EcoSim: A Grid-Aware Co-Simulation Platform for the Design and Optimization of Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10342763</link><description>To enable the electrification of transportation systems, it is important to understand how technologies such as grid storage, solar photovoltaic systems, and control strategies can aid the deployment of electric vehicle charging at scale. In this work, we present EV-EcoSim, a co-simulation platform that couples electric vehicle charging, battery systems, solar photovoltaic systems, grid transformers, control strategies, and power distribution systems, to perform cost quantification and analyze the impacts of electric vehicle charging on the grid. This python-based platform can run a receding horizon control scheme for real-time operation and a one-shot control scheme for planning problems, with multi-timescale dynamics for different systems to simulate realistic scenarios. We demonstrate the utility of EV-EcoSim through a case study focused on economic evaluation of battery size to reduce electricity costs while considering impacts of fast charging on the power distribution grid. We present qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the battery size in tabulated results. The tabulated results delineate the trade-offs between candidate battery sizing solutions, providing comprehensive insights for decision-making under uncertainty. Additionally, we demonstrate the implications of the battery controller model fidelity on the system costs and show that the fidelity of the battery controller can completely change decisions made when planning an electric vehicle charging site.</description></item><item><title>When Mobile Energy Meets Active Distribution Networks: A Security&#8211;Economic Coordination Perspective</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10342820</link><description>This article explores the interaction between active distribution networks (ADN) and mobile energy, specifically mobile charging robots (MCRs) and electric vehicles (EVs). We introduce the concept of MCR operator, who acts as a mediator between EVs and the ADN. To realize the interaction among the three parties, a cloud-edge-terminal control framework is formulated considering the coupling factors with the transportation systems. On this basis, the interaction between MCRs and EVs is achieved based on the game theory, which is implemented in a fully distributed manner to protect the data privacy. To reduce the computation complexity, the game-based interactive problem is further decomposed into a charging price bargaining problem and a charging decision and power regulation problem. Furthermore, the power quality of the ADN is guaranteed through incentivizing the charging/discharging behaviors of MCRs, which is formulated as a coordination between the ADN operator and the MCR operator, and the topology switching is also taken into consideration, thus the voltage regulation ability of the ADN and the economics of the MCR operator can be enhanced at the same time. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach, which also indicate that mobile energy and the ADN can achieve a win-win situation by benefiting all parties: Improving the utility for the EV aggregator by 35.48% (reducing the charging cost for EV owners), increasing the charging revenue for the MCR operator by 12%, and addressing the voltage issue for the ADN with a 100% voltage security rate.</description></item><item><title>Online Electric Vehicle Charging Strategy in Residential Areas With Limited Power Supply</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10345701</link><description>Electric vehicle (EV) demand is considerably increasing, aided by battery technology development and government policy support. Therefore, it is necessary to consider various charging infrastructures and secure sufficient power to support this. In several cities or countries, a large population lives in a small area, and the supply of large residential complexes such as apartments is common. Given that old apartments may not have sufficient power capacity, it is challenging to secure additional power for charging EVs. In particular, power shortages can intensify during high power usage, such as the summer season, and may become an obstacle to the spread of EVs. Therefore, an efficient charging strategy for residential complexes must be established under the condition of limited power supply. This study proposes two scheduling methods to optimally charge EVs in residential complexes considering limited power supply. The proposed scheduling algorithms are thoroughly examined through extensive simulations with parking data collected from real situations and are demonstrated to be effective for online EV charging systems.</description></item><item><title>Joint Trading and Scheduling Among Coupled Carbon-Electricity-Heat-Gas Industrial Clusters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10293189</link><description>This paper presents a carbon-energy coupling management framework for an industrial park, where the carbon flow model accompanying multi-energy flows is adopted to track and suppress carbon emissions on the user side. To deal with the quadratic constraint of gas flows, a bound tightening algorithm for constraints relaxation is adopted. The synergies among the carbon capture, energy storage, power-to-gas further consume renewable energy and reduce carbon emissions. Aiming at carbon emissions disparities and supply-demand imbalances, this paper proposes a carbon trading ladder reward and punishment mechanism and an energy trading and scheduling method based on Lyapunov optimization and matching game to maximize the long-term benefits of each industrial cluster without knowing the prior information of random variables. Case studies show that our proposed trading method can reduce overall costs and carbon emissions while relieving energy pressure, which is important for Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG).</description></item><item><title>A Decentralised Transactive Energy Market Considering Physical System Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10314804</link><description>Local energy markets leveraging direct Peer-to-Peer (P2P) trading have been proposed as a solution, which can increase prosumer participation in lower cost and more reliable supply of energy to consumers. Many approaches have been proposed to determine the optimal dispatch of distributed resources; however, existing approaches either provide inadequate representation of the physical layer or insufficient handling of infeasibilities for a continuous pricing mechanism. Hence, a gap remains in the research to date on efficiently allowing for prosumer decision autonomy while ensuring that the physical layer of the power system is considered. This paper addresses these issues with a proposed decentralised transactive solution that retains prosumer negotiation and decision autonomy, while using market determined prices to allocate limited system resources for a feasible system state. This is achieved through a transaction fee mechanism for prosumer interactions that considers the network characteristics such as topology and line congestion, and a congestion-clearing process to ensure efficient allocation of network resources. Previously reported distribution networks are used to compare the economic performance and transaction decisions of the proposed solution with existing approaches.</description></item><item><title>A Gradient-Based Wind Power Forecasting Attack Method Considering Point and Direction Selection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304287</link><description>Machine learning methods have been prevailing in wind power forecasting, while these data-driven based methods are susceptible to cyberattacks. Typical attack methods inject malicious data into influence factors according to the gradient direction of the forecasting model to randomly increase or decrease forecasting results, ignoring the number of attacks and attack effect. In this paper, an attack sample selection model is proposed to select vulnerability sample points for attack in order to reduce the number of attacks. At the same time, an attack direction judgment model is developed to launch the attack in the correct gradient direction to maximize the attack effect. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated on two public wind power datasets and nine typical machine learning based forecasting models such as ANN, ENN, RNN, LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, BiGRU, CNN and TCN. Compared with the existing gradient-based attack methods, the proposed attack method increases MAPE values of the nine models by about 9% on average while improving the attack concealment.</description></item><item><title>Complex-Value Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks and Its Applications to Electric Power Systems AI</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10317877</link><description>The effective representation, processing, analysis, and visualization of large-scale structured data over graphs, especially power grids, are gaining a lot of attention. So far most of the literature considered exclusively real-valued graph signals. However, graph signals are often sparse in the Fourier domain, and more informative and compact representations for them can be obtained using the complex envelope of their spectral components, as opposed to the original real-valued signals. This is the case for the AC carrier, and motivates its complex phasor representation. Focusing on applications in power systems, in this paper we generalize graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) to the complex domain, incorporating a complex-valued graph shift operators (GSO) based on the admittance matrix of power grids in the definition of graph filters (GF) and process complex-valued voltage phasor graph signals (GS). The theory developed is generalized to handle spatio-temporal complex network processes. We prove that complex-valued GCNs can be stable with respect to perturbations of the underlying graph support, by bounding of the error propagation through multiple NN layers. The paper showcases the benefits of complex GCN relative to several benchmarks, in power grid state forecasting and cyber-attack detection and localization.</description></item><item><title>Lyapunov-Based Resilient Cooperative Control for DC Microgrid Clusters Against False Data Injection Cyber-Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10319320</link><description>With the high penetration of renewable energy sources in power systems, DC microgrid clusters are widely installed and employed that can interface several types of renewable energy sources to different types of loads. However, being highly dependent on communication networks, DC microgrids are exposed to cyber-attacks. Therefore, in this paper, a resilient cooperative control method is proposed for DC microgrid cluster systems, that is able to achieve both the voltage regulation and power sharing in the presence of cyber-attacks. Firstly, a comprehensive microgrid cluster model is developed taking the grid forming converters, grid feeding converters, loads and line impedances into account. Based on the Lyapunov-based stability analysis, a design guideline for controller that depends only on parameters of the local microgrid is then presented. Next, steady state analysis is carried out showing that the controller is capable of eliminating the impact of cyber-attacks on the microgrid. Finally, the resilience performances of the provided control scheme are validated by experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Bayesian GAN-Based False Data Injection Attack Detection in Active Distribution Grids With DERs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10335615</link><description>Advancements in information and communication technologies have revolutionized monitoring and control capabilities within smart grids. However, it also brings new vulnerabilities to data acquisition systems and state estimation functions, which attackers can subtly tamper with the measurement data through compromising the communication network. Moreover, the high penetration of renewable energy sources with the inherited characteristics of uncertainty and variability further complicates the design of effective intrusion detection systems. In this paper, a Bayesian deep learning-based approach is developed to detect cyber attacks and maintain the security of smart grids. Our method specifically addresses the prevalent issue of imbalanced data in real power systems, which arises from the predominance of normal system operations over compromised or attacked states. Employing a novel Bayesian GAN-based technique, our approach successfully discriminates between secure and compromised measurement data, even in scenarios with significant data imbalance. Furthermore, the proposed method accommodates various practical application factors, ensuring accurate intrusion detection despite the presence of measurement noise. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed detection mechanism are validated by testing on IEEE 13-node and 123-node test systems. Simulation results and comparisons with literature methods demonstrate the superiority of proposed cybersecurity solutions.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Modeling and Mitigation of Cascading Failures in Power Grids With Interdependent Cyber and Physical Layers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10336916</link><description>Modeling and prevention of cascading failure in power systems are important topics of research. We propose a dynamic cascading failure model that considers realistic interdependencies between power and communication networks used for system monitoring and control in power grids. In this model, power line outages do not immediately disconnect communication links, whereas communication nodes have battery backup that starts depleting after considerable load shedding in the collocated bus or bus outage. When a communication node&#8217;s battery is fully depleted, the node disconnects from the cyber layer, potentially reducing the observability and controllability of the power grid. A centralized optimal preventive controller (OPC) to minimize load shedding is proposed for cascade mitigation, which is applied selectively on fully observable and controllable islands. The OPC considers AC power flow equations, multiple hard constraints, and treats overloading of lines as soft constraints. The results of Monte-Carlo simulations on the IEEE 118-bus and the 2,383-bus Polish systems demonstrate that the proposed OPC is effective in mitigating cascading failures. Finally, we demonstrate that our recently proposed Backward Euler method with Predictor-Corrector can reduce the average simulation time by approximately 9&#8211;26-folds compared to the Trapezoidal method with acceptable accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Training a Dynamic Neural Network to Detect False Data Injection Attacks Under Multiple Unforeseen Operating Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10345789</link><description>As a cyber-physical attack targeting power systems, False Data Injection Attack (FDIA) has raised widespread concern in recent years. Many FDIA detection approaches in the literature train learning models using historical data to distinguish attacked measurements from normal ones. These approaches typically suffer from severe generalization problems. Although they can achieve good detection performance when the data has a similar distribution in the offline training and online application phases, they often perform poorly when an online operating condition is unforeseen during offline training. To address this problem, this paper proposes a two-layer Dynamic Neural Network (DyNN) framework for FDIA detection. The lower layer is like a traditional FDIA detection model, which uses a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network to extract latent features, and employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to make detection decisions based on the extracted features. However, unlike traditional approaches where the internal parameters of the learning model are fixed after training, the internal parameters of the MLP are dynamically generated according to the online data by an upper-layer DyNN adapter. An interactive co-training mechanism is also proposed to coordinate both layers and ensure that the dynamically generated MLP parameters are best suited for FDIA detection in the current operating condition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the two-layer DyNN framework can achieve satisfactory FDIA detection performance even though the training and test data are collected under completely different operating conditions. In the most extreme cases, the average accuracy and F1 score of the proposed DyNN-based FDIA detection framework are 4.91% and 4.24% higher than that without DyNN, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Coordinated Defense Strategy for Time-Sensitive Networking Enabled Cyber&#8211;Physical Power System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10398470</link><description>Cyber-physical power system (CPPS) stability is severely affected by the communication network performance due to cyber-physical interdependence. Thus, uncertain cyber-physical coordinated attacks (CPCA) pose more significant threats to CPPS than physical attacks. However, the defense strategies in recent works assume real-time and reliable transmission under an ideal cyber-attack, leading to inaccurate cyber-physical interdependence modeling. Therefore, the strategies are ineffective against uncertain CPCA. This paper proposes a hierarchical CPPS network architecture that integrates time-sensitive networking (TSN) to improve resilience against uncertain CPCA. To model the uncertain CPCA, a coordinated N-K ambiguity set is proposed considering all possible link failures on both cyber and physical layers. For the cyber layer, we propose a joint routing-scheduling model of TSN-based network to support deterministic and reliable data transmission, which improves the accuracy of cyber-physical interdependence. A distributionally robust coordinated defense (DRCD) strategy integrated with cyber-physical interdependence is then proposed to mitigate the priority-based load shedding considering the uncertainties of CPCA. The formulated DRCD strategy is linearized and transformed into a tri-level optimization problem which is efficiently solved by C-CG algorithm. Case studies indicate that the DRCD strategy has superiorities in improving the resilience of CPPS compared with other conventional models.</description></item><item><title>Stochastic Dynamic Power Dispatch With Human Knowledge Transfer Using Graph-GAN Assisted Inverse Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304374</link><description>This paper proposes a novel approach for dynamic economic dispatch (DED) of distribution networks, based on graph-generative adversarial network (Graph-GAN) assisted inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) with human knowledge transfer via demonstration. Firstly, the proposed method utilizes graph convolutional network (GCN) to capture the complex and nonlinear relationships between dispatch decision and system state. Secondly, a GAN-based approach is proposed to imitate the reward function from expert demonstration data, which avoids the need for manually designed reward functions. The trained policy network is then used for decision-making in real-time optimal dispatch of distribution networks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional IRL methods and achieves supply-demand balance. Computation efficiency of the proposed method is thoroughly analyzed and shows that it is practically scalable to large-scale distribution networks. Overall, the proposed approach presents a promising alternative by incorporating human knowledge into reinforcement learning for DED of distribution networks.</description></item><item><title>Stabilizing an Islanded Microgrid via Tie Switch Controls</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10409554</link><description>In contrast to the traditional power control viewpoint, this letter explores the problem of islanded microgrid stabilization from the topological control perspective: How to stabilize an islanded microgrid through tie switch controls?

These systems employ directional antennas to enable acceptable link distances. Directional receiver antennas hence rotate in azimuth to capture the strongest received signal in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) regions. In this paper, we present our measurement results for the 90 GHz band for three different scenarios: indoor, outdoor, and an unusual environment: an airport maintenance hangar. We address line-of-sight (LOS), NLOS, mixed, and LOS-to-NLOS transitions. We used a 500 MHz bandwidth chirp signal and estimate parameters for the close-in free space reference distance path loss model using both simulated (ray-tracing software) and measured data. Path loss exponents are 1.6 for outdoor and 1.8 for indoors, smaller than for free space. We also estimate channel delay dispersion, and statistical stationarity distance for some channel transitions. We observed rapid path loss changes in the LOS to NLOS transition regions, 13 dB for indoor and 17 dB for outdoor. Abrupt changes of the strongest-component angle of arrival, up to 60 degrees over a few cm were observed. We also quantify path loss and root-mean square delay spread (RMS DS) for LOS, NLOS and mixed environments in an airport maintenance hangar. This hangar contains various aircraft, and multiple metallic objects whose positions changed over the measurement time. The maximum path loss exponent was 3.14 for these mixed environments. The RMS DS was a maximum of 16.23 ns in the NLOS region. Rotating the receiver antenna to capture the maximum-power signal from a reflecting object decreased the RMS DS by approximately 4 ns (25%). We observed a small minimum stationarity distance, i.e., six wavelengths in NLOS and a large minimum stationarity distance, approximately six hundred wavelengths in LOS.</description></item><item><title>Event-Triggered Distributed Adaptive Fixed-Time Formation Control of QUAVs With Input Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10372127</link><description>This paper considers the distributed fixed-time formation control problem of multiple quad-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (QUAVs) subject to input constraints. With an emphasis on resolving the &#8220;explosion of complexity&#8221; problem, the fixed-time command filter is constructed. Aiming at eliminating the impact of filtering errors, the error compensation signals based on fractional-power are designed. Additionally, the problem of singularity is skillfully addressed with the help of the piecewise function. To compensate for the influence of input constraints, the auxiliary signal with fixed-time convergence is devised. By incorporating the event-triggered control mechanism into the command filtered backstepping design process, an event-triggered distributed adaptive fixed-time formation control algorithm for multiple QUAVs is developed. It is strictly proved that all closed-loop signals are fixed-time bounded and the formation tracking errors are driven into a small neighborhood of the origin within a fixed time. Finally, two simulation examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fixed-time formation control scheme.</description></item><item><title>Enhanced On-Off Keying Modulation for Wireless Power Transfer Systems to Improve Efficiency Over a Wide Load Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10366863</link><description>Maximum efficiency point tracking (MEPT) is a key concept to improve the ac-ac efficiency of the wireless power transfer (WPT) systems by controlling the equivalent load impedance with a dc-dc converter or an active rectifier. The on-off keying (OOK) modulation can reduce the switching losses of the converters to achieve MEPT but generates relatively large dc voltage ripples. In order to solve this problem, this article proposes an enhanced on-off keying (EOOK) modulation method by adding a half-bridge mode based on OOK modulation for WPT systems. By combining the three operation modes, both the inverter and the active rectifier can operate in full-bridge-half-bridge mode or half-bridge-zero mode to adapt to different power levels and achieve MEPT simultaneously. Meanwhile, the ZVS condition and the low voltage ripple are achieved as well. The circuit model of the proposed method is analyzed to derive the equivalent load resistance, the output voltage gain, and the output power with respect to the modulation of EOOK. The reason for output voltage ripples and the power losses on both the transmitting and receiving sides are also revealed. An experimental prototype is built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method can maintain constant voltage output and achieve MEPT as well as ZVS operation, with high efficiency of up to 94.761% over a wide range of load conditions.</description></item><item><title>Wideband Via-Less Reconfigurable Reflection and Transmission Linear-Circular / Linear-Cross Polarizer for Vehicular Satellite Communication Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10366851</link><description>This work proposes a novel wideband reconfigurable via-less Frequency Selective Surface (FSS) based linear-circular, linear-cross polarizer in both reflection and transmission modes. The design consists of top and bottom FSSs on either side of the Taconic TLY-5 substrate. PIN diodes mounted on the back FSS turn the polarizer transmissive and reflective in different states. For a linearly polarized wave incidence, the transmitted wave would be circularly polarized with a 3 dB Axial Ratio (AR) from 8.03&#8211;16.30 GHz (67.98%) and 30.05&#8211;31.70 GHz (5.34%). In reflection mode, this design performs linear-circular conversion in 9.38&#8211;10.49 GHz (11.17%) and 15.14&#8211;30.27 GHz (66.64%). On the other hand, the unitcell behaves as a reflective linear-cross converter with a minimum 90% Polarization Conversion Ratio over 11.43&#8211;13.43 GHz (16.09%) and 31.67&#8211;34 GHz (7.10%). Multiple surface plasmonic resonances are the reason behind the different conversions. The unitcell periodicity (0.150&#955;L &#215; 0.123&#955;L) is the compact and low-profile thickness of 0.043&#955;L. The proposed work's novelty lies in the miniaturized architecture of the linear-circular polarization converter, covering the lower frequency (X/Ku) in transmission mode and higher frequency (Ku/K) in the reflection mode, which made this polarizer a suitable candidate for vehicular satellite communication applications.</description></item><item><title>A Flexible Resource Allocation Scheme for NR V2X Based Vulnerable Road User Protection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375790</link><description>New Radio (NR) Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) based Vulnerable Road User Protection (VRUP) can effectively reduce traffic accidents, making it a promising application in intelligent transport systems. However, considering the scarcity of radio resources and the inefficiency of resource allocation, the performance reduction caused by resource collisions may restrict its development in the V2X network. In this paper, we propose a flexible resource allocation scheme, namely Zone cluster Resource Reuse (ZRR), to reduce resource collision and achieve a better delivery performance of NR V2X based VRUP. We then develop a theoretical framework based on stochastic geometry to efficiently characterize the VRUP message delivery process under ZRR, taking into account the specified factors of NR V2X. With the help of the framework, we are able to derive two important performance metrics, namely message delivery probability and the User Equipment (UE) transmit power, and we can further search for the optimal parameter setting of ZRR. Extensive simulation and theoretical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of ZRR and the framework. Under the optimal parameter setting, ZRR is very desirable for VRUP message delivery, especially in the resource-constrained and access-intensive scenario.</description></item><item><title>Cooperative Caching, Rendering, and Beamforming for RIS-Assisted Wireless Virtual Reality Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10368344</link><description>Wireless virtual reality networks(WVRNs) provide seamless connectivity between virtual reality devices with colossal application and commercial value. However, the main problem restricting its development is the high energy and computational consumption in 3D video rendering on VR devices. To address this issue, we propose a novel coordinated multi-point (CoMP) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) assisted system, where the video is rendered by multiple collaborative mobile edge computing (MEC) servers simultaneously. Besides, BSs associated with these MEC servers are formed as a CoMP cluster to achieve a high data rate. This paper aims to minimize long-term power consumption by jointly optimizing the video caching and rendering at the MEC servers and the beamforming for both BSs and RIS. We propose an online, hybrid learning framework that combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for video caching and rendering, and an alternating optimization for the beamforming of all BSs and the RIS. In particular, the reward of each action in the DRL algorithm is calculated by the proposed alternating optimization problem, thus reducing the action space and accelerating convergence speed. Numerical results and comparison experiments show that our proposed method can effectively reduce the long-term average power consumption of the system, satisfy the requirement of 3D video transmission with low computational complexity, and outperform that without CoMP and RIS techniques.</description></item><item><title>Estimation of Signal and Array Parameters in the Orientational Beamforming System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10368327</link><description>In this paper, the direction of arrival (DOA) and orientation of array (OOA) estimation problems in the recently proposed orientational beamforming (OBF) system are investigated. We show that existing DOA estimation methods can be directly applied to estimate the DOA information in the OBF system. Therefore, this paper mainly focuses on the OOA estimation problem. Three OOA estimation methods are first proposed based on the assumption of accurate DOA estimation. In each method, the OOAs of different transmitting arrays are estimated individually by searching in the one-dimensional parameter space. If the power spectral density (PSD) of the source signal emitted from a transmitting array is known, the OOA of the transmitting array can be estimated by the proposed PSD-based least squares method. Otherwise, the electronical rotation-based OBF (ER-OBF) and single-source-array OBF (SSA-OBF) methods are proposed. In both methods, the OOA of a transmitting array is estimated by detecting the peak in its corresponding orientational beampattern obtained by electronically rotating the receiving array. The electronical rotation of the receiving array is achieved by appropriately delaying received signals according to the DOA of the source signal. Based on the proposed ER-OBF method, the SSA-OBF method further proposes to use a transform matrix to suppress the mutual interference between signals from different transmitting arrays. Simulation results show that the probability of successful estimation of the proposed methods increases as the signal bandwidth and array aperture size increase. Moreover, observing that the DOA estimation error impacts the performance of the proposed OOA estimation methods, a modified random search method is developed to achieve OOA estimation in the presence of DOA estimation error.</description></item><item><title>Lightweight Differential Frameworks for CSI Feedback in Time-Varying Massive MIMO Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10372108</link><description>Channel state information (CSI) is vital for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to provide high channel capacity and energy efficiency. However, the massive antennas will lead to high feedback overhead in frequency division duplex (FDD) MIMO systems. To leverage the temporal correlation of the channel in CSI feedback, recent applications of recurrent neural networks have demonstrated promising results but with tremendous complexity. The MarkovNet reduces the overall complexity but owns the high complexity at the user equipment (UE), which is not suitable for practical deployment. In this work, we aim to improve the reconstruction performance and reduce the complexity of the UE. Leveraging the channel temporal correlation, we propose two differential frameworks called DIFNet1 and DIFNet2 to improve feedback accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, we explore the real part and imaginary part correlations of channel differential terms to reduce the complexity. Finally, we unfold the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) to provide excellent reconstruction performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed frameworks improve the reconstruction performance while greatly reducing the complexity of UEs.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Overhead Dynamic Formation Method for LEO Satellite Swarm Using Imperfect CSI</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10373866</link><description>In 6G systems, non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) are poised to address the limitations of terrestrial systems, particularly in unserved or underserved areas, by providing infrastructure with mobility that enhances reliability, availability, and responsiveness. Among various types of mobile infrastructures, low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SATCOM) has the potential to offer extended coverage that supports numerous devices simultaneously with low latency. Consequently, LEO SATCOM attracts significant attention from academia, government, and industry. The dynamic formation problem must be solved to form a swarm connecting to the ground station with the most appropriate satellites to achieve LEO SATCOM systems with higher throughput. Existing solutions use computationally demanding methods to solve the NP-hard problem and cannot be employed for SATCOM systems with short coherence time. Furthermore, precise channel state information (CSI) between the ground station and all candidate satellites is required for formation designs, resulting in significant signaling overheads. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a learning-based dynamic formation method for real-time dynamic formation capability. Specifically, motivated by the channel features of LEO SATCOM, we develop a CSI estimation method to provide coarse CSI (i.e., imperfect CSI) solely based on available geometrical information of LEO SATCOM and without any signaling overhead. Then, our approach can utilize the obtained coarse CSI as inputs and provide valuable guidelines as priorities to access specific satellites for fine-grained CSI (i.e., precise CSI). The prediction results are validated using a small-scale brute force method to determine the final formation. Our intensive simulation results suggest that the proposed method can aid current LEO SATCOM by providing real-time formation results, particularly in low-transmit power regions. Specifically, the proposed method can achieve 90% of full capacity with only 32% signaling overhead to build high-throughput LEO SATCOM.</description></item><item><title>UxNB-Enabled Cell-Free Massive MIMO With HAPS-Assisted Sub-THz Backhauling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10387578</link><description>In this article, we propose a cell-free scheme for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) base stations (BSs) to manage the severe intercell interference between terrestrial users and UAV-BSs of neighboring cells. Since the cell-free scheme requires enormous bandwidth for backhauling, we propose to use the sub-terahertz (sub-THz) band for the backhaul links between UAV-BSs and central processing unit (CPU). Also, because the sub-THz band requires a reliable line-of-sight link, we propose to use a high altitude platform station (HAPS) as a CPU. At the first time-slot of the proposed scheme, users send their messages to UAVs at the sub-6 GHz band. The UAVs then apply match-filtering and power allocation. At the second time-slot, at each UAV, orthogonal resource blocks are allocated for each user at the sub-THz band, and the signals are sent to the HAPS after analog beamforming. In the HAPS receiver, after analog beamforming, the message of each user is decoded. We formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of users by finding the optimum allocated power as well as the optimum locations of UAVs. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme compared with aerial cellular and terrestrial cell-free baseline schemes.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Intelligent Receiver for OTFS Communication in Internet of Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375127</link><description>With the continuous maturity of fifth-generation (5G) mobile communication technology, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has become a key scenario for future intelligent transportation system. One of the vital challenges of the IoV is how to provide reliable wireless communication in high mobility scenarios. Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) is widely concerned due to its robustness in high-speed mobile scenarios at high carrier frequency, which is particularly suitable for IoV communication. This paper proposes a data-driven intelligent receiver from the perspective of signal processing for OTFS communication. The proposed intelligent receiver utilizes the designed efficient MobileNet (EMNet) to jointly optimize all signal recovery modules of OTFS receiver, which complete end-to-end information recovery process. Meanwhile, the lightweight structure of EMNet reduces the computing power and storage capacity of hardware devices required for model deployment. In order to verify the system reliability of the intelligent receiver in IoV, the performance of the traditional receiver and the intelligent receiver for OTFS communication are compared and analyzed under different conditions. Simulation results show that, compared with the traditional receiver, the proposed intelligent receiver can recover information with a lower bit error rate and improve the reliability of wireless communication in the IoV.</description></item><item><title>Physical Layer Security Optimization With Cram&#233;r&#8211;Rao Bound Metric in ISAC Systems Under Sensing-Specific Imperfect CSI Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375133</link><description>The integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) endows the next generation of wireless networks with the new paradigm to the security communication. In this paper, the dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) with the property of spectral and energy efficiency is considered to strengthen the physical layer security (PLS) under the channel state information (CSI) uncertainty of the eavesdropper, where satisfies the tolerate sensing requirement and the minimum secrecy rate for each legitimate user. Specifically, we propose the PLS optimization model which employs the Cram&#233;r-Rao bound (CRB) as the sensing metric, and characterize the sensing-communication trade-off under the PLS enhancement. The efficiency closed-form solution composed of the generalized eigenvector and the power budge is derived for the case of single legitimate user with the perfect CSI of the eavesdropper. Considering the general case of multiple users, we first propose the novel sensing-specific imperfect CSI model to construct the inherent integration between the sensing capacity and the norm bound of the imperfect CSI. Further, the infinite uncertainty is handled by the S-procedure, and we propose the block coordinate descent (BCD) iterative algorithm to solve the PLS optimization problem comprising with the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and the successive convex approximation (SCA) to address the non-convexity. Simulation results demonstrate the performance gain and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in the average secrecy rate over other baseline schemes.</description></item><item><title>UAV-Enabled Federated Learning in Dynamic Environments: Efficiency and Security Trade-Off</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375744</link><description>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be deployed as flying base stations to provide wireless communication and machine learning (ML) training services for ground user equipments (UEs). Due to privacy concerns, many UEs are not willing to send their raw data to the UAV for model training. Fortunately, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an effective solution to privacy-preserving ML. To balance efficiency and wireless security, this paper proposes a novel secure and efficient FL framework in UAV-enabled networks. Specifically, we design a secure UE selection scheme based on the secrecy outage probability to prevent uploaded model parameters from being wiretapped by a malicious eavesdropper. Then, we formulate a joint UAV placement and resource allocation problem for minimizing training time and UE energy consumption while maximizing the number of secure UEs under the UAV's energy constraint. Considering the random movement of the eavesdropper and UEs as well as online task generation on UEs in practical application scenarios, we present the long short-term memory (LSTM)-based deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm (LSTM-DDPG) to facilitate real-time decision making for the formulated problem. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed LSTM-DDPG algorithm outperforms the state-of-arts in terms of efficiency and security of FL.</description></item><item><title>Optimizing Task Offloading and Resource Allocation in Vehicular Edge Computing Based on Heterogeneous Cellular Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10368331</link><description>5G is a promising technology for improving the Quality of Service (QoS) in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) applications, including Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC).

To address this issue, we propose a VEC architecture based on heterogeneous cellular networks, in which vehicles can select the appropriate communication network by classifying tasks according to their maximum tolerable latency. In order to further enhance the overall performance of the VEC system, we developed an efficient scheme that optimizes task offloading decisions and computation resource allocation in the proposed architecture.

Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme is superior to other solutions in computing latency, energy consumption, and failure rate.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Energy Cooperation in Multicell Wireless Powered Communication Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10368358</link><description>This paper investigates a general multicell wireless powered communication network, in which multiple access points (APs) provide energy to the Internet of Things devices (IoT-Ds), and the IoT-Ds utilize the harvested energy to send information back to their associated AP. Within the network, a scheme enabling information and energy cooperation among APs is proposed to realize data transmission among cells as well as mitigate the risk of energy supply-demand imbalance. Based on such cooperation scheme, APs with surplus energy can share energy with other APs with deficient power supply, and the energy efficiency maximization problem is studied for the considered network of two practical scenarios including APs with energy-storage devices (ESDs) and without ESDs. To solve the optimization problems, a novel distributed scheme is designed to jointly the optimize energy cooperation strategy and time allocation, where each AP communicates only with neighboring APs to independently update its own optimal decision. Different from the centralized methods requiring global parameters such as all channel status information (CSI) that may be unavailable, APs in the developed distributed scheme jointly undertake the computational tasks without knowing all CSI. This results in faster convergence and higher scalability for multicell networks compared to the centralized schemes. Finally, simulation examples of two scenarios are presented to validate the performance of the proposed distributed scheme.</description></item><item><title>Pareto-Optimal Aerial-Ground Energy Minimization for Aerial 3D Mobile Edge Computing Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10372106</link><description>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are a crucial integrated component in mobile edge computing (MEC) for extending service coverage, where UAVs' and devices' energy consumption are two fundamental problems. In this paper, we consider a UAV-enabled three-dimensional (3D) MEC network and study the Pareto-optimal aerial and ground energy minimization problem by jointly optimizing offloading time allocation, resource allocation, and UAV 3D trajectory. We first investigate the problem of minimizing energy consumption for the UAV, and then shift our focus to minimize the energy consumption of the devices. To tackle them, we propose two efficient alternating optimization algorithms with different outer and inner structures to address the two optimization problems. To be specific, we split the original problem into two subproblems in the outer structure. The inner structure addresses the subproblems with difference-of-convex (D.C.) framework and successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. Based on the energy consumption lower bounds for the UAV and devices obtained by these two aforementioned original problems, a Pareto-optimal solution is proposed, in which the aerial-ground energy tradeoff can be balanced. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme and reveal two insightful tradeoffs for 3D UAV-enabled MEC networks, i.e., aerial-ground energy tradeoff and altitude-related angle-distance tradeoff.</description></item><item><title>Joint Task Offloading and Resource Allocation in Multi-User Mobile Edge Computing With Continuous Spectrum Sharing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10373153</link><description>This paper investigates the joint task offloading and communication/computation resource allocation in a multiuser mobile edge computing (MEC) system. In particular, we consider the multi-channel scenario, in which there are multiple channels each at a different frequency band, and the spectrum of each channel is shared by one or more mobile users (MUs) for offloading continuously. Our objective is to minimize a weighted sum of the energy consumption at MUs, by jointly optimizing the offloading time duration, the offloaded task data bits, the bandwidth allocations of different MUs at these channels, and the computing frequencies at both MUs and edge servers. Because the formulated problem has coupled optimization variables, it is non-convex and difficult to get the optimal solution. To address the challenge, we propose to decompose the formulated problem into two levels. For the lower-level problem with given offloading time duration, we employ the block coordinate descent framework to optimize two groups of optimization variables iteratively, for each of which the optimal solution is obtained in well structures with low complexity. For the upper-level problem for optimizing the offloading time duration, we find the optimal solution by performing variable manipulations and transforming the problem to a standard monotonic optimization problem. Numerical results show that our proposed method is effective in achieving the global optimality of the energy minimization problem and its advantages over other benchmark schemes.</description></item><item><title>UAV-Aided Secure Communication With Imperfect Eavesdropper Location: Robust Design for Jamming Power and Trajectory</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375787</link><description>This paper exploits the mobility of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to improve the physical layer (PLS) security against potential eavesdropping scenarios, where the sensitive data transmitted from a ground base station (GBS) to multiple information receivers (IRs) is easily eavesdropped by multiple non-colluding eavesdroppers (Eves). Specifically, the UAV is employed as a friendly jammer to transmit artificial noise to degrade the wiretap channels. By leveraging the UAV's mobility and the possibility of establishing line-of-sight links, the UAV can move close to the Eves and opportunistically jam them. Especially, two practical factors, namely, the imperfect location information of Eves and the existence of no-fly zones are considered. Since only the partial position information of the Eves can be known, as the worst case, the minimum average secrecy rate of IRs is robustly optimized by jointly designing the trajectory and jamming power of the UAV, and the transmission power of the GBS to ensure the security of all IRs. However, the formulated problem with coupled variables is non-convex and intractable. As such, an efficient alternative iterative suboptimal algorithm is proposed to solve this problem by applying the block coordinate descent, successive convex approximation, slack variables, and $\mathcal {S}$-Procedure. Numerical results reveal that the proposed robust algorithm can substantially improve the max-min average secrecy rate, and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is further verified by comparing it with three benchmark schemes.</description></item><item><title>Achievable Rate Analysis of Intelligent Omni-Surface Assisted NOMA Holographic MIMO Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10381741</link><description>An intelligent omni-surface (IOS) assisted holographic multiple-input and multiple-output architecture is conceived for $360^\circ$ full-space coverage at a low energy consumption. The theoretical ergodic rate lower bound of our non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme is derived based on the moment matching approximation method, while considering the signal distortion at transceivers imposed by hardware impairments (HWIs). Furthermore, the asymptotically ergodic rate lower bound is derived both for an infinite number of IOS elements and for continuous aperture surfaces. Both the theoretical analysis and the simulation results show that the achievable rate of the NOMA scheme is higher than that of its orthogonal multiple access counterpart. Furthermore, owing to the HWIs at the transceivers, the achievable rate saturates at high signal-to-noise ratio region, instead of reaching its theoretical maximum.</description></item><item><title>Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Assisted Uplink NOMA for eMBB and URLLC Coexistence</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10373954</link><description>In fifth-generation (5G) and next-generation mobile communication systems, one of the main design objective is to support different types of devices with disparate requirements.

Interference management strategies of different complexity &#8211; ranging from treating interference as noise to successive interference cancellation &#8211; may be implemented at the base station to address this problem. In this context, this work investigates the role that intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) may play in shaping the interference between enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) devices. Specifically, we investigate the joint design of power allocation and IRS reflection matrix, and draw conclusions on the relative advantages of decoding strategies at the base station by accounting for the interference management capabilities of an IRS-aided uplink.</description></item><item><title>Device Scheduling for Relay-Assisted Over-the-Air Aggregation in Federated Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10373941</link><description>Federated learning (FL) leverages data distributed at the edge of the network to enable intelligent applications. The efficiency of FL can be improved by using over-the-air computation (AirComp) technology in the process of gradient aggregation. In this article, we propose a relay-assisted large-scale FL framework, and investigate the device scheduling problem in relay-assisted FL systems under the constraints of power consumption and mean squared error (MSE). we formulate a joint device scheduling, and power allocation problem to maximize the number of scheduled devices. We solve the resultant non-convex optimization problem by transforming the optimization problem into multiple sparse optimization problems. By the proposed device scheduling algorithm, these sparse subproblems are solved and the maximum number of federated learning edge devices is obtained. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme as compared with other benchmark schemes.</description></item><item><title>Active-RIS-Aided Covert Communications in NOMA Systems With Cooperative Jamming</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10374265</link><description>In this paper, cooperative jamming is employed to enhance the covert communication performance of active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system. Taking into account the constraints of the active-RIS power budget and covertness requriments, we formulate the covert rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the transmit power allocation, jamming power allocation, and active-RIS beamforming. To tackle the highly coupled non-concave covert rate maximization problem, the optimal solutions for the decoupled sub-problems of the transmit power allocation, jamming power allocation, and active-RIS beamforming are derived, respectively. Specifically, closed-form expressions for the transmit power and jamming power optimization sub-problems are derived and a penalized Dinkelbach transform approach is proposed to optimize the rank-1 constrained active-RIS beamforming. Finally, the enhanced covert communication performance of our proposed scheme is demonstrated and corroborated by numerical results.</description></item><item><title>Channel Estimation for Backscatter Communication Systems Under Circuit Sensitivity Constraint</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375798</link><description>Backscatter communication (BC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling energy-efficient and low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) systems. However, one practical constraint that is often neglected in BC studies is the circuit sensitivity of the backscatter device (BD), which sets the minimum signal strength required to activate it for signal reflection. In this paper, we address the channel estimation (CE) problem in the BC system with a circuit sensitivity constraint. Specifically, we propose three channel estimators for the receiver in the BC system that is unaware of the activation states of the BD, namely the maximum likelihood (ML), linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE), and maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimators. We derive both the Cram$\acute{\text {e}}$r-Rao bound (CRB) and Bayesian Cram$\acute{\text {e}}$r-Rao bound (BCRB) to evaluate the performance of the proposed estimators. Finally, we provide simulations to validate our analysis. Our results demonstrate that the proposed LMMSE and MAP estimators outperform traditional estimators that neglect the circuit sensitivity constraint.</description></item><item><title>Review of Mono- and Bifacial Photovoltaic Technologies: A Comparative Study</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10464335</link><description>This article reviews the recent works on bifacial and monofacial photovoltaic (PV) technologies. Furthermore, the effectiveness of bifacial PV technologies over that of monofacial technologies is examined. Unlike monofacial PVs, bifacial PVs have light sensitivity on both the front as well as the rear surface and, therefore, have higher PV yield compared to monofacial PVs. However, because of higher energy output, thermal and electrical behavior are critical in bifacial PV, which needs to be optimized for bifacial PV cells to maintain the optimum cell efficiency. Studies show that bifacial thin-film Si-heterojunction PV cells have the maximum laboratory efficiency. Surface area, the fraction of light reflected, geographical location, economy, and efficiency are key contributing factors that govern the selection of bifacial PV systems. The dual use of land gives an edge to bifacial PV systems over monofacials. The dual use of land cases, such as agri-PVs with bifacial, vertical bifacial, and floating-PVs with bifacial, are unique systems where monofacial PV modules are less effective.</description></item><item><title>Coupled Process/Device Modeling and Point Defect Engineering of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 Solar Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10460087</link><description>Point defects directly impact solar cell device performance by limiting the carrier lifetime. In this work, density functional theory calculations are first used to determine the formation energy and diffusion energy barriers of dominant defects in Cu(In,Ga)Se2. Next, continuum reaction&#8211;diffusion models are developed to analyze the redistribution of defects during manufacturing processes. We estimate defect capture cross sections using a first-principles-based approach. These cross sections are combined with our calculated defect profiles and trap energy levels to parameterize a Shockley&#8211;Read&#8211;Hall recombination model, which we implement into a device simulator to predict carrier lifetimes and device performance. In that way, a predictive technology computer aided design model is built to predict and optimize the performance of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells.</description></item><item><title>Dual-Wavelength Laser Power Converters Equipped With Intermediate Bands Compatible With Highly Efficient Solar Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10464283</link><description>This article propose the basic structure of laser power converters (LPCs) on the basis of intermediate-band solar cells (IB-SCs) assisted by the quantum ratchet (QR) mechanism. The LPCs convert efficiently both high-power and low-cost laser light of 800&#8722;1000 nm in wavelength and eye-safe laser light of &#8764;1500 nm to electricity. Furthermore, the LPCs operate as highly efficient SCs. Thus, the proposed dual-wavelength (DW) LPCs fulfill the functions required for LPCs used for optical wireless power transmission to driving electric vehicles; the solar-cell function charges the secondary batteries anywhere during daytime. I designed the electronic band structures of the DW-LPCs and calculated the limiting conversion efficiencies, revealing that the DW-LPCs equipped with the QRs potentially yield high conversion efficiencies for each light competitive with those of the conventional single-function devices dedicated. However, new IB materials must be developed to realize the high efficiency, because the required electronic band structures are significantly different from those of previously reported IB-SC materials.</description></item><item><title>TCAD Modeling and Simulation of Dark Current-Voltage Characteristics in High-Periodicity InGaN/GaN Multiple-Quantum-Wells (MQWs) Solar Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10473022</link><description>Gallium nitride (GaN) based high periodicity indium/GaN multiple quantum wells solar cells have recently been proposed for different applications: from operation in harsh environments, like space applications, to their use in concentrator solar harvesting system and wireless power transfer system. In this article, we extensively investigate the mechanisms, which influence the in-dark current-voltage characteristics of these device under no excitation by means of experimental measurements and numerical simulations performed with the technology computer-aided design (TCAD) Sentaurus suite from Synopsys. Two different nonlocal models are introduced: the first one considers intrabarrier tunneling, which was found to be the dominant conduction mechanism for voltages above the main diode turn-on; the second model considers trap-assisted tunneling, implemented through traps uniformly distributed in space and energy, to reproduce the current flow in the sub turn-on region. A good matching is obtained between the experimental and simulated electrical characteristics, by considering these nonlocal models in addition to the thermionic escape.</description></item><item><title>Evaluation and Enhancement of Laser Power Transfer Efficiency in the Presence of Atmospheric Turbulence</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10473035</link><description>Laser-based wireless power transfer (LWPT) technology has attracted more and more attention in the field of long-range wireless power transfer (WPT). In practical applications, the light intensity distribution of the laser beam at the receiving end has a crucial impact on the efficiency of the power transfer system. In this article, the optimization of photovoltaic (PV) array configuration is explored in an atmospheric turbulent environment under the irradiation of Gaussian (GS) and flat-top (FT) laser beams. By comparing the photoelectric conversion efficiency of 3&#215;3 PV arrays under the irradiation of GS beams and three different orders of FT beams, we conducted a comprehensive investigation on the impact of GS beam and FT beams as light sources on the performance output of PV arrays. We develop a model of atmospheric turbulence and analyze its effects on laser power transmission. Further numerical simulation was performed to evaluate the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the two laser beams when irradiated by the PV array after experiencing atmospheric turbulence. The results indicate that the FT beam exhibits superior characteristics compared to the GS beam in most cases. FT beams with orders 2, 5, and 10 exhibit an over 8% increase in power compared to a GS beam upon direct irradiation. After passing through weak turbulence for a distance of 2 km, the power enhancement exceeds 9% for all three FT beams. These findings highlight the potential advantages of FT beams in LWPT and offer new insights into the design and optimization of long-range WPT systems.</description></item><item><title>Simultaneous Photovoltaic Power Generation and Electroluminescence in Three-Terminal Tandem Solar Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478732</link><description>Optical wireless power transmission (OWPT) using 2-terminal single-junction solar cells or light-emitting diodes is limited because it cannot generate photovoltaic power while transmitting light signals. In this study, we determine the feasibility of using a three-terminal tandem (3TT) solar cell for OWPT with two-way optical wireless communication (OWC). Accordingly, we perform fundamental experiments on simultaneous photovoltaic power generation and electroluminescence in the 3TT solar cell, which comprises a top GaAs and bottom InGaAsP subcells. The results indicate that the top cell can be operated for electroluminescence, whereas the bottom cell can be simultaneously operated for power generation under solar or near-infrared laser irradiation. These results imply that a 3TT solar cell can be utilized as an OWPT/OWC device, particularly for small Internet of Things sensors, such as in implantable bioelectronics. In future studies, we will focus on the tradeoff between the optical communication and power generation performances.</description></item><item><title>Photovoltaic Cell Defect Detection by Lock-In Thermography Using 2-D Gaussian Profile</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10438520</link><description>The electrical energy produced by photovoltaic systems can be critically affected by a variety of factors. In order to detect defective photovoltaic cells, several monitoring techniques, such as lock-in thermography, have been widely used alongside some analytical methods that avoid subjectivity. This article proposes a method with low computational cost that provides a simple and easily implementable way to quantifiably discern if a photovoltaic cell is defective or not. A two-dimensional Gaussian fit is applied to images generated by fast Fourier transform and principal component analysis algorithms on thermographic data from lock-in thermography tests. The considered coefficient of determination ${R}^2$ was found to be a good measure of fitting quality. Additionally, the method highlighted the potential of its application on first principal component, with ${R}^2$ between 0.944 and 0.986, and magnitude images, with ${R}^2$ between 0.965 and 0.985, in order to identify and distinguish nondefective cells from defective ones.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Inclination and Azimuth Angles of a Photovoltaic Module With Load Patterns for Improved Power System Stability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10488860</link><description>Globally, large-scale photovoltaic (PV) systems are being installed to achieve maximum power generation efficiency. However, this often results in severe power fluctuations, impacting the stability of the power system. To enhance the power system stability, it is crucial to effectively distribute the times of maximum power output. This can be achieved by making changes to the inclination angle and azimuth of PV modules at power plants. The modeling results indicate a prediction error of 3.65% relative to the actual measurements. To assess system stability based on each installation method, new concepts called demand gradient (DG) and demand gradient average (DGA) were introduced and analyzed using the load pattern in Metropolitan Seoul. The electricity usage was categorized into four divisions: residential (dwelling), public, service, and manufacturing. The analysis revealed that optimal inclination angles for the dwelling, public, service, and manufacturing sectors were 60&#176;, 30&#176;, 30&#176;, and 15&#176;, respectively. As for installation azimuths, the optimal values were 0&#176;, 80&#176;, 160&#176;, and 230&#176;, respectively. When both the inclination angle and azimuth were varied simultaneously, their optimal installation methods included inclination angles of 60&#176;, 60&#176;, 35&#176;, and 50&#176;, and azimuths of 330&#176;, 210&#176;, 230&#176;, and 190&#176; for the dwelling, public, service, and manufacturing sectors, respectively. Among the various scenarios, the most significant improvement in grid stability was observed in the existing south-facing installation of DGA in the dwelling sector, demonstrating a remarkable 77% reduction from 0.1 to 0.057.</description></item><item><title>A Comprehensive Shade Resilient Approach for Enhanced PV Array Performance Under Irradiance Mismatch Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10474027</link><description>This article proposes a comprehensive shade-resilient approach to enhance the overall productivity of the two most widely used photovoltaic (PV) configurations: total-cross-tied (TCT) and series-parallel (SP), under irradiance mismatch conditions (IMCs). The proposed generalized panel rearrangement strategy (GPRS) for TCT and SP-GPRS for SP arrays is applicable to arrays of any dimensions, including PV arrays with odd, even, and mixed numbers of rows and columns. An extensive performance evaluation is conducted, comparing the proposed approach with various contemporary reconfiguration methods, using both simulation and hardware setups. In the simulation analysis, a 9 &#215; 9 PV array is exposed to four unique shading cases. Comparative performance assessment, utilizing prominent performance indices, demonstrates that the proposed GPRS reduces mismatch loss (ML) by up to 75.4% compared to a TCT PV array of comparable dimensions. Additionally, SP-GPRS yields up to 35.6% lower ML than the SP arrangement. Efficiency enhancements of up to 15.18% and 10.03% are achieved by optimizing the module positions in a 9 &#215; 9 PV array within the TCT and SP frameworks using the proposed GPRS and SP-GPRS, respectively. Experimental implementation of the proposed approach reveals significant power augmentation, with improvements of up to 31% and 16.1% for TCT and SP arrangements, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Power Prediction of PV Modules Contaminated by Bird Droppings via an Image Thresholding Process</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443925</link><description>Environmental factors that influence marine photovoltaic (PV) systems differ considerably from those affecting overland PV systems. The bird dropping, which is one of them, is a main cause of marine PV power reduction. The power prediction of a PV module contaminated by bird droppings is hard because light could pass through the bird dropping depending on the thickness of it unlike hard shading condition. This article shows differences between a bird-dropping shading and hard shading of the contaminated modules, and suggests a prediction model considering a transmittance of a bird dropping using image processing (IP). First, the shading rate (SR), which is the PV module surface ratio covered by bird droppings, is calculated using IP technologies. The accuracy of the SR is verified through an experiment creating artificial hard shading on the module using black masking tape. It has an error rate of 3% compared to our targeted benchmark SRs. Subsequently, an equivalent step methodology, which combines IV curves from individual cells to yield an IV curve for the entire PV module, was adopted to predict the power. The accuracy of this methodology is confirmed, and it showed a 5% error. However, in the case of real bird-dropping shades, discrepancies up to 15% are observed. In this article, the light penetration through bird droppings by a transmittance function was considered to predict the output of modules contaminated by the bird droppings. Errors fluctuate between 1%&#8211;20% based on the quantification of light interferences.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Calibration of Bit Weights in SAR and Pipelined SAR ADCs Based on Code Distribution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10489909</link><description>This article comprehensively analyzes the effects of differential capacitor array mismatches on the decision levels of charge-redistribution-based successive-approximation-register (SAR) analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), reveals the intrinsic relation between the differential CDAC mismatches and the output code distribution of SAR, and proposes a bit-weight calibration (BWC) algorithm for SAR in terms of raw output codes, which does not require any modification to the original design. The proposed BWC is applicable to other architectures that incorporate a SAR as a substage, such as a pipelined SAR (P-SAR). Physical measurement results are presented for a pure SAR and simulation results are presented for a two-stage P-SAR, both of which verified the theoretical analyses and the proposed calibration method.</description></item><item><title>ADC/DAC-Free Analog Acceleration of Deep Neural Networks With Frequency Transformation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10473702</link><description>The edge processing of deep neural networks (DNNs) is becoming increasingly important due to its ability to extract valuable information directly at the data source to minimize latency and energy consumption. Although pruning techniques are commonly used to reduce model size for edge computing, they have certain limitations. Frequency-domain model compression, such as with the Walsh&#8211;Hadamard transform (WHT), has been identified as an efficient alternative. However, the benefits of frequency-domain processing are often offset by the increased multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations required. This article proposes a novel approach to an energy-efficient acceleration of frequency-domain neural networks by utilizing analog-domain frequency-based tensor transformations. Our approach offers unique opportunities to enhance computational efficiency, resulting in several high-level advantages, including array microarchitecture with parallelism, analog-to-digital converter (ADC)/digital-to-analog converter (DAC)-free analog computations, and increased output sparsity. Our approach achieves more compact cells by eliminating the need for trainable parameters in the transformation matrix. Moreover, our novel array microarchitecture enables adaptive stitching of cells column-wise and row-wise, thereby facilitating perfect parallelism in computations. Additionally, our scheme enables ADC/DAC-free computations by training against highly quantized matrix-vector products, leveraging the parameter-free nature of matrix multiplications. Another crucial aspect of our design is its ability to handle signed-bit processing for frequency-based transformations. This leads to increased output sparsity and reduced digitization workload. On a  $16 \times 16$  crossbars, for 8-bit input processing, the proposed approach achieves the energy efficiency of 801 tera operations per second per Watt (TOPS/W) without early termination strategy and 2655 TOPS/W with early termination strategy at VDD = 0.85 V for 16-nm predictive technology models (PTM).</description></item><item><title>Toward Efficient Retraining: A Large-Scale Approximate Neural Network Framework With Cross-Layer Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504795</link><description>Leveraging approximate multipliers in approximate neural networks (ApproxNNs) can effectively reduce hardware area and power consumption, making them suitable for edge-side applications. However, the propagation of layer-by-layer errors limits the application of approximate multipliers to large-scale ApproxNNs and complex tasks. Currently, retraining techniques that consider approximate multiplication errors are commonly used to compensate for the accuracy loss. However, due to the irregularity of the errors introduced by approximate multiplier, it is difficult for the existing generic acceleration hardware (e.g., GPU) to efficiently simulate its function and accelerate retraining, which thereby leads to a huge retraining overhead in ApproxNNs&#8217; application. In this article, we propose an ApproxNN framework that introduces errors with regular and controlled positions for high-efficiency retraining of large-scale ApproxNNs. An approximate multiplier design that matches this framework is also presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed ApproxNN framework. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed ApproxNN framework is able to achieve up to  $46\times $  speedup in retraining, and the proposed approximate multiplier reduces area/power-delay product (PDP) by 31%/63% compared to the exact multiplier. Compared with the floating-point neural network (NN) model, an accuracy decrease of only 1.13% is achieved when applied to ResNet50 on ImageNet dataset with only 15-epochs retraining, which surpasses other state-of-the-art designs.</description></item><item><title>An Energy Efficient Soft SIMD Microarchitecture and Its Application on Quantized CNNs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478774</link><description>The ever-increasing computational complexity and energy consumption of today&#8217;s applications, such as machine learning (ML) algorithms, not only strain the capabilities of the underlying hardware but also significantly restrict their wide deployment at the edge. Addressing these challenges, novel architecture solutions are required by leveraging opportunities exposed by algorithms, e.g., robustness to small-bitwidth operand quantization and high intrinsic data-level parallelism. However, traditional hardware single instruction multiple data (Hard SIMD) architectures only support a small set of operand bitwidths, limiting performance improvement. To fill the gap, this manuscript introduces a novel pipelined processor microarchitecture for arithmetic computing based on the software-defined SIMD (Soft SIMD) paradigm that can define arbitrary SIMD modes through control instructions at run-time. This microarchitecture is optimized for parallel fine-grained fixed-point arithmetic, such as shift/add. It can also efficiently execute sequential shift-add-based multiplication over SIMD subwords, thanks to zero-skipping and canonical signed digit (CSD) coding. A lightweight repacking unit allows changing subword bitwidth dynamically. These features are implemented within a tight energy and area budget. An energy consumption model is established through post-synthesis for performance assessment. We select heterogeneously quantized (HQ) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) from the ML domain as the benchmark and map it onto our microarchitecture. Experimental results showcase that our approach dramatically outperforms traditional Hard SIMD Multiplier-Adder regarding area and energy requirements. In particular, our microarchitecture occupies up to 59.9% less area than a Hard SIMD that supports fewer SIMD bitwidths, while consuming up to 50.1% less energy on average to execute HQ CNNs.</description></item><item><title>Better-Than-Worst-Case: A Frequency Adaptation Asynchronous RISC-V Core With Vector Extension</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475190</link><description>In recent years, asynchronous circuits have become more popular in neural network chips and the Internet of Things (IoT) due to their potential advantages of low-power consumption and high performance. However, the existing design methods for asynchronous circuits are still constrained by critical paths, increasing power consumption and hindering the further improvement of performance. In this article, a fully digital design method for frequency adaptation asynchronous bundled-data (BD) circuits is proposed. The proposed method is straightforward, effective, widely applicable, and independent of asynchronous controllers. It allows to automatically work on different frequencies as required, which can improve performance and reduce power consumption, achieving better-than-worst-case. To verify the proposed method, an asynchronous RISC-V processor with vector acceleration extension is designed on both TSMC 65-nm process and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platform. According to the postlayout simulation results, compared with its synchronous version, the asynchronous processor achieves a 10% speed improvement (from 227.3 to 250 MHz) with a 37% power reduction (from 135 to  $85~\mu \text{W}$ /MHz) under ideal conditions. Even under the worst conditions, the asynchronous processor achieves equivalent performance to the synchronous processor, while still reducing power consumption by 29% (from 133 to  $95~\mu \text{W}$ /MHz). On the FPGA platform, asynchronous processor also achieves higher speed while lower power consumption.</description></item><item><title>A Reliable and Efficient Online Solution for Adaptive Voltage and Frequency Scaling on FPGAs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10453488</link><description>Adaptive voltage and frequency scaling (AVFS) technology adjusts the supply voltage and clock frequency based on the actual operating conditions of the circuit. It can significantly improve performance or reduce the power consumption of the device. Existing online field-programmable gate array (FPGA) AVFS solutions have relatively low adjustment efficiency. Many existing solutions rely on offline steps, which do not consider the runtime operating conditions. This article proposes a complete FPGA AVFS solution, which includes a versatile self-checking timing monitor (SCTM) with small resource overhead, efficient AVFS algorithms without any offline steps, and user-friendly comprehensive automation software. Compared with existing online solutions, the proposed solution improves scaling efficiency by reducing the number of configuration times for the clock generation unit. The effectiveness of the solution is evaluated by a set of pubic benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that it can set an appropriate voltage&#8211;frequency operating point for the application circuit within dozens of milliseconds. For power-oriented adjustment, the proposed solution can save power ranging from 33.93% to 43.46%, while keeping the frequency not slower than the one reported by the static timing analysis (STA). For performance-oriented adjustment, it can achieve a performance improvement ranging from 60.26% to 101.90% at the nominal voltage.</description></item><item><title>Built-In Self-Test of SFQ Circuits Using Side-Channel Leakage Information</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10495792</link><description>Cryogenic testing and verification of single-flux quantum (SFQ) circuits consist of various challenges, such as limited number of input&#8211;output pins, flux trapping, and cooling power constraints. Developing design for testability (DFT) techniques for SFQ circuits, which address these challenges, is an important research area. In this work, a built-in self-test (BIST) methodology of SFQ circuits is proposed, which focuses on a novel way of the readout of test signals by using side-channel leakage information. The side-channel leakage can exhibit the dependence of internal data (logical &#8220;1&#8221; and &#8220;0&#8221;) on the power consumption. By measuring the variations in the power supply of an SFQ circuit at room temperature, the information about internal test signal states can be extracted with the proposed BIST methodology. As a case study, a rapid SFQ (RSFQ) 4-to-2 priority encoder circuit is considered. The existing Josephson junction (JJ)-based stuck-at fault model is applied with the proposed BIST methodology. The proposed BIST design is compared with a conventional shift register-based readout circuitry. The proposed BIST design can provide 79% lower static power consumption and 65% lower layout area. In addition, other advantages and drawbacks of the proposed design are discussed, such as yield, number of pins, testing time, interpretation of test results, and hardware security.</description></item><item><title>SCAR: Power Side-Channel Analysis at RTL Level</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10508974</link><description>Power side-channel (PSC) attacks exploit the dynamic power consumption of cryptographic operations to leak sensitive information about encryption hardware. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a PSC analysis to assess the susceptibility of cryptographic systems and mitigate potential risks. Existing PSC analysis primarily focuses on postsilicon implementations, which are inflexible in addressing design flaws, leading to costly and time-consuming postfabrication design re-spins. Hence, presilicon PSC analysis is required for the early detection of vulnerabilities to improve design robustness. In this article, we introduce SCAR, a novel presilicon PSC analysis framework based on graph neural networks (GNNs). SCAR converts register-transfer level (RTL) designs of encryption hardware into control-data flow graphs (CDFGs) and use that to detect the design modules susceptible to side-channel leakage. Furthermore, we incorporate a deep-learning-based explainer in SCAR to generate quantifiable and human-accessible explanations of our detection and localization decisions. We have also developed a fortification component as a part of SCAR that uses large-language models (LLMs) to automatically generate and insert additional design code at the localized zone to shore up the side-channel leakage. When evaluated on popular encryption algorithms like advanced encryption standard (AES), RSA, and PRESENT, and postquantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms like Saber and CRYSTALS-Kyber, SCAR, achieves up to 94.49% localization accuracy, 100% precision, and 90.48% recall. Additionally, through explainability analysis, SCAR reduces features for GNN model training by 57% while maintaining comparable accuracy. We believe that SCAR will transform the security-critical hardware design cycle, resulting in faster design closure at a reduced design cost.</description></item><item><title>Analyzing the Vulnerabilities of External SDRAM on System-on-Chip Field Programmable Gate Array Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478320</link><description>System-on-chip (SoC) field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices are becoming increasingly prominent in a vast range of applications. The fusion of the FPGA&#8217;s unmatched parallel computing capacity and flexibility with a full-bore processing system makes these devices extremely powerful. With recent technological progress, SoC FPGA devices are implemented in increasingly complex systems where security and safety are often issues of concern. To cater to these concerns, these devices are commonly fit with encryption and authentication capabilities to ensure the confidentiality and authenticity of externally stored bitstreams, firmware, and bootloaders. However, while much effort is placed into securing these partitions when stored in external memory, little attention seems to be paid to the security of this data once it is decrypted for execution. This article investigates how vulnerable systems are to attacks that target decrypted data during execution. We demonstrate that data stored in external synchronous dynamic random access memory (SDRAM) can provide access to trusted and secured interfaces of SoC FPGA devices even with diligently applied security features.</description></item><item><title>FLAT: Layout-Aware and Security Property-Assisted Timing Fault-Injection Attack Assessment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478871</link><description>The ease and inexpensive setup of injecting timing faults in a hardware design make it vulnerable to adversaries, resulting in confidentiality or integrity violations. The state-of-the-art fault-injection attack assessment frameworks do not consider significant timing variations during layout generation from a gate-level design when assessing security threats of timing faults. Additionally, existing mitigation methods focus on higher design abstractions (e.g., register transfer level (RTL) and gate level), resulting in substantial area, power consumption, and latency overhead. To address these limitations, we propose our layout-aware and security property-assisted timing fault-injection attack assessment (FLAT) framework that automatically assesses the feasibility of injecting controlled timing faults into the layout of a design using clock glitches and quantifies its vulnerability concerning security properties. If the design is vulnerable, FLAT modifies the layout to tune the fan-in path delays of the security-critical registers as local countermeasures. Unlike system-wide mitigation approaches, these countermeasures incur minimal overheads at an IP or system-on-chip (SoC) design regarding power, performance, and area while ensuring security against timing faults. To demonstrate the effectiveness of FLAT, we perform security assessments on the postlayout designs of various benchmarks [e.g., advanced encryption standard (AES), rivest-shamir-adleman (RSA), and floating-point unit (FPU)] by targeting major fault injection attack vectors and deploying local countermeasures. These assessments indicate that the FLAT framework adeptly evaluates each design&#8217;s susceptibility to timing faults and implements the countermeasures to mitigate this susceptibility to the desired level.</description></item><item><title>A 128-Gbps Pipelined SM4 Circuit With Dual DPA Attack Countermeasures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10487004</link><description>In this brief, a high-speed secret merchant-4 (SM4) cryptographic circuit with strong robustness against differential power analysis (DPA) attacks is proposed for securing the wireless networks for the first time. To achieve a high-throughput design for the SM4 algorithm, 32-stage pipelined encryption rounds and key expansion rounds are employed. Moreover, to resist DPA attacks, one pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) is embedded to randomly alter the SM4 circuit with a 32-stage or 34-stage pipeline, the other PRNG is utilized for realizing redundant operations to further break the correlation between the processed data and power dissipation of the SM4 circuit. When compared to a regular SM4 cryptographic circuit, the proposed SM4 architecture is capable of achieving a high throughput and satisfactory robustness against DPA attacks without compromising much power, area, and performance overhead.

The subsampling phase detection technique widely used in the low jitter phase-locked loop design is adopted for the CDR&#8217;s clock recovery operation. It brings not only a design simplification but also the low-power consumption of the CDR. The 1/5-rate subsampling phase detection circuit is also introduced for further power reduction. The false-lock detector is proposed that monotonically ascends or descends the clock frequency until the phase lock is achieved. It shares the outputs of the subsampling phase detection circuit and removes the frequency detector from the CDR loop. The measured power consumption and efficiency of the proposed CDR at 12.5 Gb/s are 8.8 mW and 0.7 pJ/bit, respectively. At the same time, the peak-to-peak and rms jitters show 21 and 3.7 ps in 2.5-GHz clock signal, respectively. The high-frequency jitter tolerance is 0.52 UIpp. The CDR including a 1-to-5 DEMUX occupies a core area of 0.087 mm2 using 65-nm CMOS process.</description></item><item><title>A 200-GHz Power Amplifier With 18.7-dBm Psat in 45-nm CMOS SOI: A Model-Based Large-Signal Approach on Cascaded Series-Connected Power Amplification</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10354379</link><description>This article proposes a novel approach on cascaded series-connected power amplifier (PA) design. High-frequency transistor modeling is employed to analyze the stacked cell, and a methodology is developed to maximize the output power ( $P_{\text {out}}$ ) and power-added efficiency (PAE) of each cell. The  $P_{\text {out}}$  and power gain of the cell are studied, and the optimum operation point is determined.

This DPT can provide two optimum inductive values at two different frequency bands to optimally design the matching networks for each band without using any switch circuitries. It operates as the output and input matching networks in a parallel power combiner and divider, respectively. DPT-based PA breaks the trade-off between bandwidth and performance in conventional wideband PAs by separating one whole wideband into two narrow bands providing optimum input and output matchings for each band. The DPT-based PA has two input and two output ports. One set of input and output ports is dedicated to a lower frequency band and the other set of input and outport ports can be used for a higher frequency band. Each output port can drive a separate antenna in a phased array for each frequency band. The proposed PA prototype is fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process achieving 15.3 and 14.0 dBm of saturated output power in 28 and 39 GHz. The peak efficiency of the PA is 34.1% and 30.2% at 28 and 39 GHz frequency bands.

To address synchronization and interference issues in the conventional noncoherent transceiver with on&#8211;off keying (OOK) modulation, two techniques are proposed. The first one is twin-OOK (T-OOK) modulation, in which two pulses are used to represent 1-bit data. A short-duration synchronization pulse is employed for baseband synchronization, while a long-duration data pulse based on frequency-hopping (FH) OOK is employed for data transmission. The proposed modulation scheme not only addresses the synchronization problem of a transceiver baseband but also enhances the spectrum efficiency of a transmitter by adopting an FH method. The second one is uncertain-intermediate frequency (IF) down-conversion with quadrature demodulation. The quadrature uncertain-IF receiver achieves robust demodulation over frequency drift and good narrowband-interference (NBI) tolerance with an on-chip bandpass filter (BPF). In addition, ranging accuracy is enhanced with in-phase and quadrature (IQ) two-path signals. A prototype 6&#8211;8-GHz communication/ranging UWB transceiver is implemented in 65-nm CMOS. The transceiver achieves&#8211;71-dBm sensitivity at 10 Mb/s and 0.96-cm root-mean-square (rms) ranging accuracy. The transmitter and the receiver have the power consumption of 3.83 and 5.38 mW, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Highly Selective Receiver With Programmable Zeros and Second-Order TIA</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10352437</link><description>This article presents a wideband blocker tolerant receiver (RX) for fifth-generation (5G) user equipment applications. Two programmable zeros around the channel bandwidth are introduced to sufficiently suppress the close-in blockers of 5G applications. Since the effect of zeros gradually diminishes at larger out-of-band offset frequencies, an auxiliary current-sinking path is also introduced to reduce the RX input impedance at far-out offset frequencies. Moreover, a simple second-order transimpedance amplifier (TIA) is adopted to enhance the proposed RX selectivity. The utilized TIA synthesizes two complex conjugate poles to achieve a flat gain response and &#8722;40 dB/dec roll-off. A 40-nm CMOS RX prototype occupies 1.15mm2 and consumes 84&#8211;140mW from a 1.3-V supply voltage over the 0.5&#8211;3-GHz operating frequency range. The RX achieves a 160-MHz RF bandwidth, 2.6&#8211;4.2-dB noise figure, a &#8722;0.3-dBm blocker 1-dB compression point (B1dB), and an out-of-band third-order intercept point (IIP3) of 22.5 dBm. As a test case, using the 3GPP standard, a &#8722;15-dBm continuous wave (CW) close-in out-of-band blocker located at 85-MHz offset from the passband edges is applied to the RX. Thanks to the receiver&#8217;s high selectivity, the RX achieves 100% throughput while detecting 100-MS/s quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) signal with 16 dB higher power than the reference sensitivity.</description></item><item><title>A 16-GHz Background-Calibrated Duty-Cycled FMCW Charge-Pump PLL</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10325605</link><description>A 16-GHz charge-pump phase-locked loop (CP-PLL) for a robust duty-cycled frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar chirp generation is presented.

In this article, we presented an FD receiver (RX) with multi-domain SICs using capacitor stacking (CS)-based delay cell in the RF canceller which breaks the trade-off among delay, loss, form-factor, and noise. In addition, a delay bandwidth (BW) expansion method is proposed to break the limitation of delay BW product, which is demonstrated in the BB canceller. A prototype is fabricated in 65 nm CMOS process. The proposed FD RX can operate in 0.5&#8211;4 GHz with a gain of 29&#8211;32 dB. At 2 GHz local oscillator (LO) frequency, the RF canceller can achieve a delay of ~2&#8211;7.5 ns while consuming 10 mW. The baseband (BB) canceller can achieve a delay of 9&#8211;15 ns while consuming 4.4 mW. These large nanosecond-scale delays ensure 32&#8211;38 dB SIC over 20 MHz signal BW in case of applying a commercial circulator (isolation of 23&#8211;26 dB). In FD mode, the RF and BB cancellers degrade the RX noise figure (NF) by less than 0.9 and 0.4 dB at 2 GHz LO frequency, respectively. The RX power handling is improved by 11.5 dB. The active chip area is only 0.4 mm2.</description></item><item><title>A 30-&#956;W 94.7-dB SNDR Noise-Shaping Current-Mode Direct-to-Digital Converter Using Triple-Slope Quantizer for PPG/NIRS Readout</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10329563</link><description>This article presents a low-power, high-resolution, high dynamic range (DR) current-mode direct-to-digital converter (CM-DDC) using a noise-shaping triple-slope quantizer. Both thermal and quantization noises can be first-order shaped out of band, increasing the resolution effectively. High resolution can be realized without using a high sampling rate or high-order shaping architecture. A coarse-fine zoom style quantization is exploited, which reduces the conversion time and, thus, the power consumption of active circuit blocks with dynamic biasing. On the circuit level, a chopped current digital-to-analog converter (DAC) is proposed to reduce 1/ $f$  noise of the current DAC, enhancing the DR. The CM-DDC with light-emitting diode (LED) driver and digital control circuitry is implemented in a standard 55-nm CMOS process and characterized experimentally. The converter achieves a signal-to-noise and distortion-ratio (SNDR) of 94.7 dB and a cross-scale DR of 136.5 dB in 20-Hz bandwidth with 30- $\mu \text{W}$  power for photoplethysmography (PPG)/near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) applications. Thanks to the shortened conversion time, the converter&#8217;s sampling frequency and signal bandwidth can be adjusted to 200 Hz and 2 kHz, achieving 90.5- and 79.2-dB SNDR, respectively, which allows various current sensing applications. The proposed CM-DDC is also validated with on- body chest PPG measurement.</description></item><item><title>Enabling Online GaN Power Device Self-Health Monitoring With Analog SGD Supervised Learning and TJ-Independent Precursor Measurement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10320386</link><description>In order to mitigate reliability challenges on emerging wide-bandgap (WBG) gallium nitride (GaN) power devices, this article investigates a software&#8211;hardware codesign solution utilizing online device condition monitoring and machine-learning technologies, with an ultimate goal of achieving intelligent device self-health learning efficiently and effectively. Specifically, an on-die logarithm-based analog stochastic gradient descent (SGD) supervised learning engine is developed to train a GaN power circuit to establish and update its own device thermal model seamlessly through autonomously self-tested condition precursor  $r_{\text {DS}\_{}\text {ON}}$ . To remove the adverse temperature ( $T_{J}$ ) impact on condition monitoring efficacy, a nonintrusive online  $T_{J}$  sensing scheme is introduced by evaluating the ambient temperature ( $T_{A}$ ) and the instant power loss ( $P_{\text {LOSS}}$ ) to accomplish a truly  $T_{J}$ -independent precursor measurement. To validate this research effort, a GaN-based switching power converter prototype was built.

The proposed always-dual-path multi-phase scheme as well as three-step voltage conversion ratio (VCR) transition strategy can ensure dynamic  $C_{\mathrm {FLY}}$  reallocation to achieve continuous output charge delivery for both steady state and VCR transition operations without extra  $C_{\mathrm {FLY}}$ . Together with the customized digital controller, the proposed SC converter can enable  $C_{\mathrm {LOAD}}$ -free operation for fast and robust DVS transitions while relaxing the associated dynamic loss. We further investigate on an all NMOS power switch implementation to optimize both the DVS speed and switching loss. Fabricated in 65-nm CMOS, the proposed SC converter achieves step-down VCRs of 5:4/3/2/1. It can provide an output voltage  $V_{\mathrm {OUT}}$  from 0.16 to 0.96 V with an input voltage  $V_{\mathrm {IN}}$  of 1.2 V, while achieving a measured steady state peak power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 93.4%. The measured peak dynamic PCE when switching between 5:4 and 5:3 at a VCR transition frequency ( $f_{\mathrm {VCR\_{}TRAN}}$ ) of 100 kHz is 89.6%. With  $f_{\mathrm {VCR\_{}TRAN}}$  increasing from 1 to 800 kHz, the measured dynamic PCE droop for 5: $4\leftrightarrow ~5$ :3 is only 0.83%. This work achieves high peak PCE over a wide VCR range while exhibiting a DVS speed up to 222.5 mV/ns, corresponding to a  $\sim 2\times $  improvement over similar prior arts.</description></item><item><title>A 94.9% Efficiency Always-Power-Delivered SIDO Buck Converter With Continuous Current Balancing and Complementary Adaptive-Switching Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10360851</link><description>This article proposes a single-inductor dual-output (SIDO) buck converter which always deliveries continuous power to outputs. The proposed converter has adopted complementary adaptive-switching regulation (CASR) with a continuous current balancing (CCB) mechanism and an auxiliary current path to passively bypass output switches in turn. The proposed converter and its control scheme can enhance output current continuities and power efficiencies while decreasing voltage ripples and fluctuations due to equivalent series resistance (ESR) and equivalent series inductance (ESL) at each output.

This article proposes a synchronized switch harvesting on an inductor (SSHI) rectifier with a duty-cycle-based (DCB) maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm. The proposed DCB MPPT algorithm is based on the mathematically derived relation between the MPPT efficiency and the duty cycle of the bridge rectifier. The resulting equation shows that the MPPT efficiency only depends on the rectifier duty cycle, and is independent of any other system variables, such as voltage bias-flipping efficiency, the open-circuit voltage from the harvester, vibration frequency, etc. As a result, MPPT can be achieved by regulating the duty cycle, simplifying circuit implementation, and achieving self-regulating and continuous MPPT. This design was fabricated in a 180-nm BCD process. The measured results show 98% peak MPPT efficiency and up to 738% output power enhancement.</description></item><item><title>A 27 W Wireless Power Transceiver With Compact Single-Stage Regulated Class-E Architecture and Adaptive ZVS Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10335186</link><description>This work presents a reconfigurable single-stage regulated Class-E (SSRE) wireless power transceiver that delivers 27 W for wireless charging at 6.78 MHz. The power stage of the transmitter merges a buck and a Class-E power amplifier (PA) into one conversion stage, saving one inductor and one capacitor with improved system efficiency. Instead of using a bulky external impedance tuning block to ensure a 50% duty cycle operating point, the proposed Class-E zero-voltage switching (ZVS) controller allows the Class-E stage to work at an adaptive duty cycle without an off-chip tuning circuit. The high voltage and high current stress of the Class-E stage is handled by a GaN transistor, the driver of which uses an NMOS transistor for the high-side switch that realizes a rising edge of 2.8 ns with no overshoot. For directly sensing high voltage without using a resistor divider, an HV-NMOS shielded push-pull comparator is designed. An adaptive dead time control based on a sample-and-hold (S/H) feedback loop is proposed to reduce reverse conduction and recovery loss of the buck stage. The proposed solution demonstrates good trade-off among power level, efficiency, and power density. The SSRE WPT system delivers a maximum dc output power of 27 W with an end-to-end (E2E) efficiency of 63.0% if the receiver uses a traditional passive rectifier. The peak E2E efficiency of 80.0% is achieved at dc output power of 9.5 W; furthermore, in a two-chip differential transmitter configuration, the maximum output power reaches 45 W, and the maximum E2E efficiency is 83.7%.</description></item><item><title>A Multimode 157 &#956;W 4-Channel 80 dBA-SNDR Speech Recognition Frontend With Direction-of-Arrival Correction Adaptive Beamformer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10327732</link><description>This work introduces a speech recognition frontend system that solves the problems of conventional adaptive beamforming (ABF) with: 1) low digital signal processing (DSP) power consumption (3 $\times $  lower than state-of-the-art ABF) thanks to an innovative greedy blocking matrix (GBM) employing simple calculations; 2) automatic direction-of-arrival (DOA) error compensation with direction tracking delay-and-sum beamformer aided by the GBM; 3) a multimode hybrid analog-to-digital converter (ADC) adapts to signal conditions; and 4) multimode beamforming takes advantage of high-signal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to reduce total power by 54%.

First, to reduce fabrication cost by eliminating a 32.768-kHz crystal, an on-chip real-time clock (RTC) using a machine-learning (ML)-based RC oscillator (RCO) calibration is proposed for the excellent frequency stability of the RTC; thus, it achieves a 0.68-ppm/&#176;C stability, nearly comparable to that of an RTC crystal, with the power consumption of 48.2  $\mu \text{W}$ . Second, to extend battery life through a fast start-up operation of the XO, the sampling phase-locked loop (S-PLL)-based injection technique reduces the start-up time and energy by 18.2 and 8.8 times, respectively, despite a high swing of 1.2 V. Finally, to mitigate a phase noise (PN) degradation according to a capacitive load ( ${\rm C_{L}}$ )-trimming of XO for the temperature compensation, a  ${\rm C_{L}}$ -dependent feedback resistor adjusting a 4kTR noise through a pulsewidth modulation is also proposed; thus, the 76.8-MHz XO accomplishes a PN of less than &#8722;158.2 dBc/Hz at 100-kHz offset while consuming the power of 1.08 mW. Consequently, the proposed single-XO-based CMIC meets all reference clock requirements of the system-on-chipset (SoC) and RF chipsets for 5G frequency range (FR)1 and FR2 communication.</description></item><item><title>Design of Dual Lower Bound Hysteresis Control in Switched-Capacitor DC&#8211;DC Converter for Optimum Efficiency and Transient Speed in Wide Loading Range for IoT Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10319457</link><description>This article proposes a dual lower bound hysteresis control (LBHC) method with frequency control for the design of switched-capacitor (SC) dc&#8211;dc converters in always-on Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. Conventional SC control methods often face a tradeoff between speed and efficiency. Efficiency is crucial for battery life, while speed is essential for system responsiveness. This article aims to use the proposed method to achieve frequency-independent regulation of the output dc level. This helps achieve a fast response time at the system level by tuning controller frequencies without compromising stability. Furthermore, the proposed dual LBHC loop guides frequency and power scaling, ensuring consistent efficiency over a wide range of load currents through two clock-gated comparator operations per clock cycle. By analyzing the operating principle, this article also discovered that designing the dual LBHC based on its maximum load current point can guarantee its stability over the entire load range. To illustrate this concept, a fully integrated 2:1 capacitive dc&#8211;dc converter was implemented using a 180-nm CMOS process. The results demonstrate guaranteed efficiency of at least 75% across load current ranges up to  $228\times $ , with a peak efficiency of 80.4%. In addition, an active response time of 80 ns is achieved during load transients ranging from 0.04 to 4 mA.</description></item><item><title>A 10-Gb/s Wireline Receiver Using Linear Baud-Rate CDR and Analog Equalizer for Free Space Optical Communication Over 10- and 100-m Distances</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10387436</link><description>Free-space wireless optical communication (FSO), which adopts the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology, transmits and receives various data and wavelength combinations on a single channel. The mixed data and wavelengths are separated by WDM demodulation using the different refraction of light. Due to chromatic dispersion, the phase of the arriving optical signal would depend on the wavelength. Therefore, clock and data recovery (CDR) is required to determine the optimum sampling point in FSO-WDM systems. The proposed baud-rate CDR uses an integrator to generate a clock phase at the data center. Because the integrator output determines early or late signals, the proposed CDR does not require any reference voltage or additional clock phase. The proposed analog equalizer (AEQ) of the receiver in the front end compensates for the inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by the electrical-to-optical converter, atmospheric channel, and optical-to-electrical converter. The AEQ reduces the ISI by using a feedback loop. The prototype receiver achieved a bit error rate (BER) of 10&#8722;11 regardless of the wavelength thanks to the proposed AEQ and baud rate CDR in FSO-WDM system over 10- and 100-m distances. The power efficiency and area of the proposed receiver were 3.8 pJ/bit and 0.147 mm2, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Voltage Level Detection for Near-VTH Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10251163</link><description>Voltage level detectors (VLD) are used to monitor the supply voltage in integrated circuits (ICs) to determine when the system can initiate computation. The VLD must detect its own supply voltage, which is more challenging for low-voltage applications such as near- $V_{\mathrm {TH}}$  computing (NVTC), which also requires low latency and rapid supply changes; furthermore, internal races in the VLD may cause false indications or glitches in the system and should be prevented by design. This work presents a glitch-free VLD that can detect supplies as low as 385 mV at a power of 217 nW and a measured latency of 10  $\mu \text{s}$ . This was achieved by inserting a deterministic delay into one of the internal nodes, as well as low-voltage circuitry. The circuit is fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process and occupies a footprint of 6900  $\mu \text{m}^{2}$  with a measured temperature drift of 105  $\mu \text{W}/^{\circ }\text{C}$  and a sigma variation of 8 mV across 32 units.

However, they also face integration and current-sharing challenges. To tackle these challenges, this article presents an all-digital dual-loop distributed LDO with one global controller (GC) and multiple scalable local voltage regulators (LVRs). For fully synthesizable and easy integration, all the control circuits are implemented using standard digital cells. In each LVR, we use a 5-bit time-to-digital converter (TDC) for fast local voltage sensing. The global integral loop provides the dynamic reference bits for all the LVRs, compensating the TDC PVT variations in the LVRs. This all-digital comparator-TDC quantizer, combined with coarse-fine tuning and asynchronous window control, enables the proposed LDO architecture to obtain high output accuracy and one-cycle transient response. For current balancing in distributed scenarios, we introduce a digital primary-secondary one-time calibration scheme to tackle the mismatches among the local TDCs. A distributed LDO prototype with one GC and nine LVRs is implemented in a 28-nm bulk CMOS process. Measurements with one LVR and multiple LVRs demonstrate the stability and scalability of the proposed architecture. With nine LVRs, the measured droop is 54 mV under a 1.35-A/10-ns sharp load step. We also obtain a good load regulation of 3 mV/A, a peak current efficiency of 99.67%, and a current density of 16.7 A/mm2.</description></item><item><title>A 28.8-mW Accelerator IC for Dark Channel Prior-Based Blind Image Deblurring</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10374412</link><description>This work presents an accelerator that performs blind deblurring based on the dark channel prior.

However, SRAM-based CiM cells have rather low density and thus very limited total on-chip memory capacity. This fact, unfortunately, results in undesired weight data reload operations from the off-chip dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) in data-intensive scenarios and may even tarnish the energy efficiency of CiM at the task level. Therefore, exploration toward higher density CiM in CMOS is critical to ensure truly high energy efficiency in practice. Aligned with the goal of ultrahigh density, this article presents the first one-transistor (1T) multi-level-cell (MLC) read-only memory (ROM) CiM macro for multi-bit MAC. The highlights of the proposed ROM CiM techniques include: 1) multi-source-driven (MSD) 1T-MLC ROM; 2) charge-domain capacitor sharing (CDCS) for ultrahigh CiM memory density; and 3) ROM-based transfer-learning architectures to provide flexible support of different tasks with minor accuracy degradation. These techniques are demonstrated with a fabricated 2-Mb 1T-MLC ROM CiM macro for 8 b  $\times $  8 b MAC computing. This macro features a record-high cell density of 0.096- $\mu \text{m}^{2}$ /bit and a macro weight density of 3984 kb/mm2 in a 65-nm pure CMOS technology. It also achieves 3.8 $\times $ &#8211;55.3 $\times $  lower energy consumption per image inference than the state-of-the-art CiM macros when considering the possible DRAM access.</description></item><item><title>A 28-nm 50.1-TOPS/W P-8T SRAM Compute-In-Memory Macro Design With BL Charge-Sharing-Based In-SRAM DAC/ADC Operations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10335178</link><description>This article presents a low-cost PMOS-based 8T (P-8T) static random access memory (SRAM) compute-in-memory (CIM) macro that efficiently reduces the hardware cost associated with a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). By utilizing the bitline (BL) charge-sharing technique, the area and power consumption of the proposed DAC have been reduced while achieving similar conversion linearity compared to a conventional DAC. The BL charge-sharing also facilitates the multiply-accumulate (MAC) operation to produce variation-tolerant and linear outputs. To reduce ADC area and power consumption, a 4-bit coarse-fine flash ADC has been collaboratively used with an in-SRAM reference voltage generation, where the ADC reference voltages are generated in the same way as the MAC operation mechanism. Moreover, to find the suitable ADC sample range and resolution for our CIM macro, a CIM noise-considered accuracy simulation has been conducted. Based on the simulation results, a 4-bit ADC resolution with a cutoff ratio of 0.5 is chosen, maintaining high accuracy. The 256  $\times $  80 P-8T SRAM CIM prototype chip has been fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process. By leveraging charge-domain computing, the proposed CIM operates in a wide range of supply voltage from 0.6 to 1.2 V with an energy efficiency of 50.1-TOPS/W at 0.6 V. The accuracies of 91.26% and 65.20% are measured for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, respectively. Compared to the state-of-the-art SRAM CIM works, this work improves energy efficiency by 1.2 $\times $  and area efficiency by 6.5 $\times $  due to the reduced analog circuit hardware costs.</description></item><item><title>MACC-SRAM: A Multistep Accumulation Capacitor-Coupling In-Memory Computing SRAM Macro for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10322874</link><description>This article presents multistep accumulation capacitor coupling static random-access memory (MACC-SRAM), capacitor-based in-memory computing (IMC) SRAM macro for 4-b deep convolutional neural network (DNN) inference. The macro can simultaneously activate all its 128  $\times $  128 custom 9T1C bitcells to perform the vector-matrix multiplication (VMM). MACC-SRAM also integrates 128 stepwise-charging and discharging input drivers (SCD-IDRs) to efficiently convert the digital codes of the input activations into analog voltages in a 2-b serial fashion. As a result, it can save up to 66% of the capacitor-driving energy. Also, the macro adopts an adder-first architecture to reduce the analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion overhead for the analog-mixed-signal (AMS) computation. The partial sums of the four adjacent rows, representing different bit positions in the 4-b weights, are first accumulated with an analog switched-capacitor adder and then converted to digital codes by a 6-bit successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Compared with the ADC-first architecture, where partial sums of each row are first converted to digital codes and then accumulated in the digital domain, the adder-first architecture can save 60.7% of the area and 66.7% of the energy consumption of the A/D conversion. Moreover, the co-optimization of the DNN model by increasing the sparsity further reduces 39.4% of the capacitor-driving energy with a neglectable 0.4% DNN accuracy loss. We prototyped the macro in 28 nm technology, and the measurement shows an energy efficiency of 163 tera-operations per second per watt (TOPS/W) and a throughput of 211 giga-operations per second (GOPS) for a 4-b/4-b DNN model under 0.9 V supply, among the highest of the recent IMC SRAMs.</description></item><item><title>eDRAM-CIM: Reconfigurable Charge Domain Compute-In-Memory Design With Embedded Dynamic Random Access Memory Array Realizing Adaptive Data Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10310140</link><description>This article presents a compute-in-memory (CIM) architecture for a large-scale machine learning (ML) accelerator, which employs  $1T1C$  embedded dynamic random access memory (eDRAM) bitcells as charge domain circuits for convolution neural network (CNN) multiply-accumulation-averaging (MAV) computations. By repurposing existing  $1T1C$  eDRAM columns to construct an adaptive data converter, dot-product, averaging, pooling, and rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation on the memory array, the eDRAM-CIM design eliminates the need for an extra dedicated hardware accelerator, which significantly reduces the hardware implementation cost and increases the reconfigurability of the CIM computation circuit. In the eDRAM-CIM design, 8 b digital inputs from image pixel values are converted to analog domain directly on eDRAM columns. The dot-product is computed without disturbing the kernel weights, which are stored in the eDRAM array, preventing data duplication and additional intra-memory data movement. In addition, the convolution results are transferred back to the digital domain using an in-eDRAM adaptive dynamic range successive-approximation (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) utilizing a narrow range of dot-product distribution to reduce ADC latency and energy. A 16 Kb eDRAM-CIM prototype, implemented in the 65 nm CMOS process, demonstrates the concept and the functionality of the test-chip using the CIFAR-10 dataset with 8 b input and 8 b signed weight, achieving 90.77% accuracy, 4.71 GOPS throughput, 4.76 TOPS/W energy efficiency, and 8.26 GOPS/mm2. A scalability analysis is developed to show that the presented eDRAM-CIM approach, which was adopted in an advanced eDRAM technology node, shows promising energy efficiency (11.21 TOPS/W) and throughput (22.2 TOPS), suggesting its potential for application in large-scale energy-efficient CIM designs.</description></item><item><title>HGRP: A 181-&#956; W Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition Processor Based on Bi-Directional Convolution and Iteration-Free Feature Clustering</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10412130</link><description>Hand gesture recognition (HGR) has become a prevalent human&#8211;computer interaction (HCI) approach on smart edge devices.

The number of applications that use negative-R to compensate for the DC-gain, unity gain bandwidth (UGB), and noise of operational amplifiers (op-amps) is increasing. However, due to process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variations, conventional negative-R has limitations in providing ideal compensation. Therefore, this paper presents an auto-tuning (AT) negative-R that can automatically calibrate for PVT variations, overcoming the limitations caused by mismatching issues in conventional negative-R. The proposed single-bit 3rd-order CTDSM applies AT negative-R to the first integrator, resulting in consistent and optimal integrator performance.

However, voltage scaling will degrade the radiation-aware reliability of traditional latch obviously. In addition, although the shrinkage of feature sizes results in the reduction of latch area, the occurrence possibility of double node upset (DNU) and triple node upset (TNU) events are increasing. Achieving a good balance among delay, power, area and reliability performance is becoming an important issue in the design of radiation-hardened latches, especially considering the coming commercial aerospace applications. Therefore, this paper proposes a TNU self-recoverable latch with wide voltage range (TRLW), which is low overhead and very suitable for UDVS technique. The TRLW latch is mainly composed of two completely interlocking triangle structures, and is able to self-recover from any possible TNU event. Clock-gated isolated cells are skillfully utilized to avoid current conflict. Meanwhile, six transmission gates are carefully integrated into TRLW latch to reduce the propagation delay  ${t}_{d2q}$  and critical path delay  ${t}_{crit}$ . Accordingly, the overall performance of TRLW latch is always excellent from normal voltage to near-threshold voltage (NTV). Simulation results based on 28nm CMOS process show that TRLW latch can achieve complete SNU, DNU and TNU self-recovery in all possible cases, and the soft error rate of TRLW latch only raises by 4.6% when the supply voltage is decreased from 0.9 V to 0.3 V. Moreover, compared with the other reported TNU self-recovery latches, TRLW latch consistently achieves the minimum delay, power, area and delay-power-area product (DPAP) under different process, voltage and temperature (PVT) conditions, and obtains average reductions of  $3.43\times $ ,  $3.03\times $ ,  $2.66\times $ ,  $1.40\times $  and  $10.83\times $  for  ${t}_{d2q}$ ,  ${t}_{crit}$ , power, area and DPAP when operating from 0.5 V to 1.0 V.</description></item><item><title>AxOCS: Scaling FPGA-Based Approximate Operators Using Configuration Supersampling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504662</link><description>The rising usage of AI/ML-based processing across application domains has exacerbated the need for low-cost ML implementation, specifically for resource-constrained embedded systems. To this end, approximate computing, an approach that explores the power, performance, area (PPA), and behavioral accuracy (BEHAV) trade-offs, has emerged as a possible solution for implementing embedded machine learning. Due to the predominance of MAC operations in ML, designing platform-specific approximate arithmetic operators forms one of the major research problems in approximate computing. Recently, there has been a rising usage of AI/ML-based design space exploration techniques for implementing approximate operators. However, most of these approaches are limited to using ML-based surrogate functions for predicting the PPA and BEHAV impact of a set of related design decisions. While this approach leverages the regression capabilities of ML methods, it does not exploit the more advanced approaches in ML. To this end, we propose AxOCS, a methodology for designing approximate arithmetic operators through ML-based supersampling. Specifically, we present a method to leverage the correlation of PPA and BEHAV metrics across operators of varying bit-widths for generating larger bit-width operators. The proposed approach involves traversing the relatively smaller design space of smaller bit-width operators and employing its associated Design-PPA-BEHAV relationship to generate initial solutions for metaheuristics-based optimization for larger operators. The experimental evaluation of AxOCS for FPGA-optimized approximate operators shows that the proposed approach significantly improves the quality&#8212;resulting hypervolume for multi-objective optimization&#8212;of  $8\times 8$  signed approximate multipliers.</description></item><item><title>Sparsity-Aware In-Memory Neuromorphic Computing Unit With Configurable Topology of Hybrid Spiking and Artificial Neural Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478711</link><description>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have shown great potential in achieving high energy efficiency and low power consumption compared to artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, there remains a significant accuracy gap between SNNs and ANNs. To address this issue, we present an in-memory neuromorphic computing (IMNC) chip that supports hybrid spiking/artificial neural networks (S/ANNs) and sparsity-aware data flows. With the IMNC chip, we aim to improve inference accuracy while simultaneously achieving high energy efficiency through optimization at the algorithm, architecture, and circuit levels. First, at the algorithm level, we note that SNNs extract temporal features from input spikes using time-domain convolution operations. Based on this insight, we efficiently utilize leaky integrate (LI) neurons to hybridize SNNs and ANNs, thereby improving accuracy while maintaining highly sparse operations. Second, at the architecture level, we design a sparsity-aware architecture that supports a hybrid S/ANN topology with varying sparsity. Finally, at the circuit level, we propose a ring-based in-memory computing (IMC) macro, whose energy consumption is inversely proportional to the input sparsity, making it ideal for performing energy-efficient multiplication and accumulation (MAC) operations in both SNNs and ANNs.

The carrier frequency is selected as the  ${k}$ -th order harmonic of the PWM switching frequency. This choice enables operation within an extended frequency range for a particular switching transistor in contrast to the conventional RFPWM approach, where the carrier and switching frequencies are identical. The feasibility of this methodology is verified by both extensive simulations and experimental measurements. While there is a reduction in output power proportional to the harmonic number, this approach has the potential to set the transmitted power to these fixed steps in an all-digital format without compromising spectral performance, as evidenced by comprehensive simulations. Furthermore, the method exhibits strong spectral performance within and outside the desired frequency bands across different quantization scenarios, covering carrier frequencies up to four times the switching frequency. The proof of concept for Sub-Nyquist RFPWM transmitter is a fully digital field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation, enabling adaptability to multistandard signals. The pulse position/pulse-width modulation is based on an outphasing approach, using the FPGA transceivers to generate the high-speed binary waveform. Measurements were carried out using a 1.4-MHz LTE 64-QAM signal with a PWM switching frequency of 311 MHz, achieving ACPR values below &#8722;39 dBc when the second and third harmonics were used as carrier frequencies (622 MHz and 933 MHz, respectively).</description></item><item><title>Impact of Aging and Process Variability on SRAM-Based In-Memory Computing Architectures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10493861</link><description>As the SRAM-based In-memory Computing (IMC) paradigm arises as a promising candidate to break the memory wall bottleneck and deliver optimal energy efficiency, reliability has been paid less attention. Serious reliability issues that concern a conventional SRAM cell includes increased process variations as well as the dominant transistor aging mechanisms, such as Bias Temperature Instability (BTI) and Hot Carrier Injection (HCI) phenomena. These degradation impacts the speed, noise margin and input offset voltage a SRAM structure. Though the vulnerability of a SRAM cell to transistor aging has been extensively studied in the literature, there is still missing information on how aging impacts the SRAM-based IMC architectures along with the process variability. In this work, through simulation, we present a comprehensive study on impact of aging and process variability on commonly employed SRAM-based 6T- and 8T- IMC architectures. In the current study, degradation&#8217;s stochastic behavior is examined by coupling process fluctuations brought on by aging. The confluences of two degradation mechanisms help to identify the worst-case failures. This study serves as one of the first ones that provide BTI induced aging analysis on multiple IMC logic operations and offer perspectives for designing robust SRAM-based IMC based architectures.</description></item><item><title>A 32-Bit Ripple-Ling Hybrid Carry Adder</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10409891</link><description>The low-order bits of the Ling adder are not on the critical path, eliminating the need for a carry lookahead method to calculate their output sums. In this paper, we propose a hybrid carry adder that combines high-order Ling and low-order ripple techniques. The low 11 bits of the adder utilize a ripple-carry structure, while the high 21 bits employ a Ling-based parallel prefix structure. This approach simplifies the low-order sum circuit without compromising the critical path length of the adder. Furthermore, new intermediate variables are introduced to facilitate Shannon expansion and enable efficient implementation of the output sum. This ensures that the control signal of the output MUX maintains a delay consistent with its input signal. The output sum circuit is further custom designed using reusable logic circuits. The proposed adder is verified using the conventional 180 nm and 28 nm processes, as well as the advanced 14 nm FinFET process, with the layout area as  $4557.5 \mu \text{m}^{2}$ ,  $193.2 \mu \text{m}^{2}$ , and  $73.8 \mu \text{m}^{2}$ , respectively. Testing results show that the maximum delay is 0.83 ns, 0.312 ns, and 0.183 ns respectively for the adder using 180 nm, 28 nm, and 14 nm processes respectively. The proposed adder provides an area optimization of approximately 10%~30% and optimizations of 10% in power and speed compared to the conventional Ling adder.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Latency Power Series Approximate Computing and Architecture for Co-Calculation of Division and Square Root</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10454097</link><description>The calculation of division and square root is widely used in edge computing related to image processing, clustering, recognition, and reconstruction, among others. Their common multi-stage serial calculation takes longer, and requires a higher latency, and more redundant hardware resources for multi-dimensional parallel computations. This work proposes a low-latency power series approximate digital computing (PSADIC) paradigm and architecture, which achieves a fast low-latency calculation of multi-dimensional mathematical expressions, focusing on the co-calculation of division and square root. This approach allows to compute not only the division and the square root, but also the inverse and the inverse square root. Moreover, serial and pipelined architectures have been designed here to achieve smaller areas and lower latencies, respectively. Compared to the multi-stage calculation with CORDIC (COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer), the mean relative error distance (MRED) is reduced by 67% in PSADIC. Under TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) 40nm CMOS technology, the proposed serial and pipelined architectures achieve a 66.67% overall latency reduction compared to the CORDIC when using both its own maximum clock frequency, and a 75% cycle latency reduction. Meanwhile, both the ADP (Area Delay Product) and PDP (Power Delay Product) are also optimized.</description></item><item><title>DCIM-GCN: Digital Computing-in-Memory Accelerator for Graph Convolutional Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10500021</link><description>Graph convolutional network (GCN) has gained great success in a diverse range of intelligent tasks. However, the hardware performance of GCNs is often bounded by random and non-continuous memory accesses due to the sparse graph data, which incur high latency and high power consumption. The emerging computing-in-memory (CIM) architecture significantly reduces the overhead of data movements, which is suitable for memory-intensive GCN acceleration. Existing analog-based CIM solutions require a large amount of analog-to-digital (AD) and digital-to-analog (DA) conversions, which dominate the overall area and power consumption. Furthermore, the analog non-ideality can degrade accuracy and reliability of CIM. To address these challenges, this work proposes a digital CIM accelerator based on SRAM, called DCIM-GCN, to accelerate GCN algorithm. DCIM-GCN introduces innovations on three levels: circuit, architecture, and algorithm. At the circuit level, digital CIM is proposed with SRAM sub-arrays to eliminate the power and area expensive AD/DA converters. Furthermore, we have incorporated the multi-address feature into the digital CIM, thereby leveraging its ability to efficiently process sparse matrix multiplication. At the architecture level, the sparsity-aware computation engine takes advantage of sparsity in GCNs and leverages CIM to minimize memory accesses and data movements. Finally, at the algorithm level, the balance mapping algorithm tackles workload imbalance issues, while the vertex reorder algorithm reduces idle states for aggregation engines, resulting in increased hardware utilization. Our DCIM-GCN achieves  $1.89\times $  and  $2.42\times $  speedup and  $4.58\times $  and  $9.46\times $  energy efficiency improvement on average over other CIM-based graph accelerators, e.g., PASGCN and PIM-GCN, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A 593nJ/Inference DVS Hand Gesture Recognition Processor Embedded With Reconfigurable Multiple Constant Multiplication Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10506245</link><description>Hand gesture recognition (HGR) is a popular technique for edge-based human-computer interaction. Dynamic vision sensors (DVS) are often used in HGR systems due to their low latency, high dynamic range, low energy consumption, and asynchronous event triggering. While Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are commonly thought to consume less energy than Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in DVS-based HGR systems, this work demonstrates that a DVS-based HGR system on chip (SoC) incorporating CNN can achieve lower power consumption through algorithm and hardware co-design. The proposed edge-side processor for DVS-based HGR integrates a median filter processing core and an AI accelerator core for preprocessing and CNN inference on the DVS output data. To reduce hardware costs without sacrificing accuracy, the median filtering core uses a simplified median filtering function tailored to the specific application scenario. The paper suggests using reconfigurable multiple constant multiplication (RMCM) techniques for the AI accelerator core to share computational resources among processing element (PE) arrays, thereby reducing computational costs and power consumption. The entire DVS gesture processor was implemented in a 65nm technology, achieving an energy requirement of 593.4nJ per inference on-chip with a guaranteed accuracy of 92.4%.</description></item><item><title>Low-Power Row Driver for Digitally Driven OLEDoS Microdisplay</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10415282</link><description>Microdisplays are a key component in many contemporary portable electronic systems.

Power supply noise is strongly related to the design quality of the power distribution network and the activity of transient currents. In this paper, a method for estimating the worst-case voltage supply based on the ramp time of the transient current is proposed. At the same time, the worst-case current activity can also be obtained which can be used to guide the core or field programmable gate array (FPGA) design for a given power distribution network. The ramp current is first encoded and divided into segments. Then, two dynamic matrices are used to track the worst-case accumulated voltage noise and worst-case current activities. The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art approaches showing consistent advantages in estimating the worst-case power supply noise. Its accuracy is also validated by comparing the simulated and measured data.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Distributed H&#8734; Current Sharing Consensus Optimal Control of DC Microgrids via Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10444694</link><description>Distributed control of DC microgrid is becoming more and more important in modern power system. An important control goal is to ensure voltage stability and current sharing of DC bus. In the presence of constant power loads and uncertainties, a novel distributed quadratic optimum control technique based on reinforcement learning (RL) is developed in order to ensure correct current sharing and adequate performance. Firstly, the system model with power coupling is established and transformed into a linear heterogeneous multi-agent system (MAS) with unknown disturbances. Subsequently, a neural network (NN)-based adaptive model-free observer is developed. Since not all followers have direct access to the leader&#8217;s information, a distributed cooperation performance index with discount component is created by fusing the dynamics of the observer and the follower. The  $Q$ -learning technique is applied to obtain the optimal control strategy to achieve voltage stabilization and current sharing without using system dynamics. Finally, simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of this strategy.</description></item><item><title>Finite-Time Decentralized Sliding Mode Control for Interconnected Systems and Its Application to Electrical Power Systems: A GA-Assisted Design Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10444614</link><description>This paper addresses the problem of finite-time decentralized sliding mode control (SMC) for interconnected systems under Round-Robin communication protocol.

However, their deployment remains a significant challenge, primarily due to their intensive computational and memory requirements. Hardware acceleration and efficient quantization are promising solutions to address the two issues. In this paper, a quantization and hardware architecture co-design is presented for matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) of LLMs. During quantization, we uniformly group weights and activations to ensure workload balance for hardware. To enhance the performance of quantization, we further propose two approaches called channel sorting and channel selection, which can be applied simultaneously. To support the proposed quantization scheme, we develop two precision-scalable MVM hardware architectures. They are specifically designed for high speed and high energy efficiency, respectively. Experimental results show that our proposed quantization scheme achieves state-of-the-art performance among all the reported post-training schemes that quantize both weights and activations into integers. Compared to MVM architecture of the state-of-the-art LLM accelerator OliVe, our design exhibits significant advantages in terms of area efficiency and energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Integrating OFDM Into Switching Power Supplies for Visible Light Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10505911</link><description>Visible light communications (VLC) is a promising technology that combines the ubiquity of illumination devices with broadband communication to provide connectivity. The most recent VLC communication standards specify orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) as the underlying modulation due to its spectral efficiency and compatibility with existing broadband modems. However, a key challenge remains in realizing VLC modulators capable of generating OFDM signal compatible with the primary illumination function, while ensuring the efficacy of the luminaires. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to integrate OFDM modulation into a switching power supply. Commutating diodes in the DC/DC converter are replaced by light-emitting diodes (LEDs) which are used for communication while the larger illumination string of LEDs is left unmodulated preserving the quality of illumination and luminaire lifetime. Biasing the switching MOSFET to its saturation region during its off states allows for the MOSFET to act as an amplifier, amplifying the OFDM communication signal and injecting it to the light-emitting commutating diode (LECD). As a result, energy efficient LED drivers capable of OFDM signal transmission are realized. Both simulation and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, showcasing superior performance compared to existing literature in terms of component count, efficacy, illumination quality, and reliability. Notably, based on simulation results, the efficacy of our approach surpasses the bias-T approach by approximately 6.25%.</description></item><item><title>Observerless Output Feedback Control of DC-DC Converters Feeding a Class of Unknown Nonlinear Loads via Power Shaping</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10460357</link><description>In microgrids, DC-DC converters play an important role in energy conversion.

Then, it is proved that the closed-loop systems are asymptotically stable. Finally, the performance of the controllers are verified by detailed simulations and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>A Scalable Single-Inductor Multiple-Output DC&#8211;DC Converter With Constant Charge-Transfer and Power-Up Sequencing for IoT Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10398740</link><description>This paper presents a single-inductor, multiple-output (SIMO) DC-DC converter suitable for the micro-battery-powered IoT (Internet-of-Things) applications operating with a very low activity factor. Targeting an average output power of few  $\mu $ W with a peak output power requirement of a few mW in each output channel, the proposed converter transfers constant-charge to its outputs in a complete switching cycle. Multiple IoT nodes are serviced in a time-division multiplexing under discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) of operation for minimizing the cross-regulation issue. An internal priority sequencing logic ensures reliable power-up sequencing during startup. Additionally, the proposed SIMO converter offers an inherent soft-start mechanism, effectively mitigating current-stress on power MOSFETs. Also, the features of priority-based servicing under dynamic conditions, resolve a conflict when catering to multiple outputs at the same instant. The design is highly scalable towards meeting the increased load demand. Implemented in a standard 180 nm CMOS technology, the proposed converter generates three outputs (0.9 V, 1.2 V and 1.5 V) with a maximum load current of 5 mA simultaneously in each of the output channels.

By resolving this instability, C2SFF is always contention-free and has low leakage, while maintaining low dynamic power by eliminating unnecessary transitions of internal clocked nodes. Without additional sizing efforts, C2SFF operates reliably down to 0.32V by removing all contention paths. Post-layout simulation results using a 65 nm CMOS process design kit show that the power consumption of C2SFF is reduced by 62.1%/52.8% with 10%/20% activity at 1V, and 56.9%/49.0% with 10%/20% activity at 0.4V, respectively, compared to transmission-gate FF (TGFF). In addition, C2SFF shows the second-best setup-hold window among tested FFs.</description></item><item><title>A 1-Mb RRAM Macro With 9.8 ns Read Access Time Utilizing Dynamic Reference Voltage for Reliable Sensing Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475670</link><description>Resistive RAM (RRAM) has emerged as a promising candidate for the next generation of non-volatile memories (NVMs) due to its low write voltage and compact area that is compatible with CMOS technology. In this brief, we propose a 1Mb macro consisting of two 512Kb sub-arrays, with the macro area reduced by implementing a common source-line (SL) structure. A voltage-mode sense amplifier (VSA) is designed to overcome the challenge of the low ratio between high-resistance and low-resistance states (R-ratio). Two columns of replica cells situated in the center of the RRAM array are used to generate the reference voltages, which exhibit behavior that closely tracks the changes in the bit-line (BL) voltage even under PVT variations.

We aim to balance speed, power, and area by employing specific architectural choices in its pull-up and pull-down networks. The pull-up network (PUN) employs a Wilson current mirror to effectively reduce static current. The pull-down network (PDN) incorporates a diode-connected P-type transistor as a current limiter, further reducing static power consumption. An improved split-controlled inverter is introduced as the output driver to further minimize both static and short-circuit currents. The proposed level shifter can operate at a minimum  $V_{DDL}$  of 100 mV at  $V_{DDH}=$  1.2 V and 1 MHz input frequency. Performance comparison with prior works reveals a significant performance improvement in terms of delay, power-delay product (PDP), and energy-delay product (EDP), with a delay of 4.79 ns, a PDP of 355 ns*nW, and an EDP of 326 fJ*ns when operating in a conversion range of 0.3 - 1.2 V, making it a robust choice for energy-efficient ultra-low voltage level shifting applications.</description></item><item><title>A 12V-to-1V Outphase-Interleaved SC Hybrid Converter With Enhanced Inductor De-Energizing Slew Rate and Adaptive Deadtime Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10473120</link><description>This brief presents a high step-down outphase-interleaved switched-capacitor hybrid converter with enhanced inductor DC current reduction and flying-capacitor  $(C_{\mathrm{ F}})$  inrush current suppression for 12V-to-1V voltage conversion, which is appealing in automotive and date center applications. The main novelties and contribution of this brief are three folds: 1) a hybrid converter topology with well-reduced inductor DC  $(I_{L,DC})$  current and  $C_{\mathrm{ F}}$  inrush current to achieve high conversion efficiency and power density for high step-down conversions, 2) an adaptive dead-time (ADT) controller for minimizing the body diode conduction loss adaptive to different load condition, and 3) a body diode series conduction (BDSC) technique for enhancing heavy-to-light load transient response. Implemented in a 180-nm Bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD) process alongside total power passive components in a 4.84 mm3 volume, the proposed converter achieves a peak efficiency of 91.1% for 12V-to-1V conversion at a load current  $(I_{\mathrm{ LOAD}})$  of 0.8A. It retains an efficiency of 83.9% at 2.5A  $I_{\mathrm{ LOAD}}$ . The ADT control improves light-load efficiency by ~1%. When  $I_{\mathrm{ LOAD}}$  steps from a 2.5A to 0.5A under 12V-to-0.6V conversion, the proposed BDSC technique boosts the inductor de-energizing SR by  $1.8\times $  and reduces output overshoot by 46mV.</description></item><item><title>A 12.9-to-24 GHz Dual-Mode Multi-Coil VCO Achieving 199.2 dBc/Hz Peak FoMT in 65-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10382575</link><description>This brief reports a mode-switching dual-core multi-coil voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) with improved frequency tuning range (FTR) and phase noise (PN).

In-memory computing implementation of HDC (IM-HDC) provides a robust and energy-efficient approach to process spatio-temporal (ST) signals since it significantly reduces data transfer overhead. However, previous IM-HDC suffers from the large peripheral circuit overheads to assist the component-wise hypervector operations. To address these issues, we propose a voltage-mode two-transistor-two-resistor (2T2R) RRAM-based IM-HDC encoder for ST signal processing. The in-memory hyperdimensional encoding has been achieved by performing binding/bundling in the 2T2R RRAM array and permutation on specially designed digital peripheral circuits.

Existing asynchronous AER circuits using bundled data protocol are mainly constructed in pipelined tree structure. The delay and area of these circuits increase significantly as the input channel number increases. This brief proposes a new AER unit using mask-based arbitration scheme, which is able to significantly reduce the area and delay for sparse event at the cost of high power consumption and low throughput. A dual-level mask AER structure is proposed to mitigate the drawbacks. According to the simulation result, the dual-level mask AER has a reduction of 48% in area and 17%-39% in delay with respect to pipelined tree AER, while the power consumption increasement is no more than 19% of pipelined tree.

The system must be capable of continual learning (CL), i.e., learning new information from a temporal stream of data in situ without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. However, creating a personalized CL framework poses significant challenges due to limited compute and storage resources on edge devices. Existing methods rely on large memory storage to preserve past data while learning from incoming streams, making them impractical for such devices. In this article, we propose Chameleon as a hardware-friendly CL solution for user-centric CL with dual replay buffers. The strategy takes advantage of the hierarchical memory structure commonly found in edge devices, utilizing a short-term replay store in on-chip memory and a long-term replay store in off-chip memory. We also present an FPGA-based analytical model to estimate the compute and communication costs of the dual replay strategy on the hardware, making effective design choices considering various latent layer options. We conduct extensive experiments on four different models, demonstrating our method&#8217;s consistent performance across diverse model architectures. Our method achieves up to  $7\times $  speedup and improved energy efficiency on popular edge devices, including ZCU102 FPGA, NVIDIA Jetson Nano, and Google&#8217;s EdgeTPU.

However, the attention mechanism requires huge computational efforts to process unnecessary calculations, significantly limiting the system&#8217;s performance. To reduce the unnecessary calculations, researchers propose sparse attention to convert some dense-dense matrices multiplication (DDMM) operations to sampled dense&#8211;dense matrix multiplication (SDDMM) and sparse matrix multiplication (SpMM) operations. However, current sparse attention solutions introduce massive off-chip random memory access since the sparse attention matrix is generally unstructured. We propose CPSAA, a novel crossbar-based processing-in-memory (PIM)-featured sparse attention accelerator to eliminate off-chip data transmissions. 1) We present a novel attention calculation mode to balance the crossbar writing and crossbar processing latency. 2) We design a novel PIM-based sparsity pruning architecture to eliminate the pruning phase&#8217;s off-chip data transfers. 3) Finally, we present novel crossbar-based SDDMM and SpMM methods to process unstructured sparse attention matrices by coupling two types of crossbar arrays. Experimental results show that CPSAA has an average of  $89.6\times $ ,  $32.2\times $ ,  $17.8\times $ ,  $3.39\times $ , and  $3.84\times $  performance improvement and  $755.6\times $ ,  $55.3\times $ ,  $21.3\times $ ,  $5.7\times $ , and  $4.9\times $  energy-saving when compare with GPU, field programmable gate array, SANGER, ReBERT, and ReTransformer.</description></item><item><title>Toward Write Optimization for Skyrmion Racetrack Memory by Skyrmion Repermutation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10388033</link><description>Skyrmion racetrack memory (Sky-RM), as an emerging nonvolatile memory technology, provides both high-density data storage and low-access latency, accompanying with a novel feature of using current to shift data along a racetrack. However, it is time-comsuing and energy-hungry to write/inject new particle-like Skyrimons on Sky-RM compared with other manipulations. Thus, the goal of this work is to presents a novel strategy to optimize write performance in Sky-RM, permutation-write (PW). Particularly, PW reduces the number of Skyrmion injections when writing data, by &#8220;repermuting&#8221; existing Skyrmion particles within a racetrack. Moreover, based on the flexible concept of repermutation, this work further proposes PW+ strategy, which is an optimized PW strategy integrated with injection and shift optimizations to achieve better performance. Our evaluation results justify that PW+ can greatly reduce the amount of Skyrmion injections, which are considered highly expensive in Sky-RM, by at least 50%, compared with other state-of-the-art write-optimized strategies. Furthermore, PW+ only incurs 1.79 injections, averaged for every 64-bit-word write. We show that PW+ strategy can bring significant benefits over other state-of-the-art write-optimized strategies by about 16%&#8211;50% for every 64-bit-word write, for both performance and energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>An Energy-Efficient In-Memory Accelerator for Graph Construction and Updating</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10404048</link><description>Graph is widely utilized as a key data structure in many applications, such as social network and recommendation systems. However, many real-world graphs are constructed with large-scale correlated data, which typically involves massive random memory accesses and distance calculation resulting in considerable processing time and energy consumption on CPUs and GPUs. In this work, we present GCiM, a specialized processing-in-memory architecture for efficient graph construction and updating. By directly deploying the computing units on the logic layer of the 3-D stacked memory, GCiM benefits from memory-level parallelism and further improves the memory access efficiency with both optimized processing ordering and data layout. In addition, we notice that the computing engines for graph updating suffer from dramatic utilization imbalance and integrate a power gating module to cut down the power supply of the idle computing engines at runtime and further enhance the energy efficiency. According to our experiments, GCiM shows  $634.64\times $  and  $56.27\times $  speedup while consuming  $1194.14\times $  and  $505.07\times $  less energy compared to CPU and GPU, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Mobile Transformer Accelerator Exploiting Various Line Sparsity and Tile-Based Dynamic Quantization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375766</link><description>Transformer models are difficult to employ in mobile devices due to their memory- and computation-intensive properties. Accordingly, there is ongoing research on various methods for compressing transformer models, such as pruning and quantization. However, general computing platforms, such as central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), are not energy-efficient to accelerate the pruned model because the unstructured sparsity they exhibit causes degradation of parallelism. In this article, we propose a low-power accelerator for transformers that can handle various levels of structured sparsity induced by line pruning with different granularity. Our approach accelerates pruned transformers in a head-wise and line-wise manner. We present a head reorganization and shuffling method that supports head-wise skip operations and resolves the load imbalance problem among processing engines (PEs) caused by the varying number of operations in each head. Furthermore, we implemented a sparse quantized general matrix-to-matrix multiplication (SQ-GEMM) module that supports line-wise skipping and on-the-fly tile-based dynamic quantization of activations. As a result, compared to mobile GPU and CPU, the proposed accelerator improved the energy efficiency by  $2.9\times $  and  $12.3\times $  for the detection transformer (DETR), and  $3.0\times $  and  $12.4\times $  for the vision transformer (ViT) models, respectively. In addition, our proposed mobile accelerator achieved the highest-energy efficiency among the current state-of-the-art FPGA-based transformer accelerators.</description></item><item><title>U-SWIM: Universal Selective Write-Verify for Computing-in-Memory Neural Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10390540</link><description>Architectures that incorporate computing-in-memory (CiM) using emerging nonvolatile memory (NVM) devices have become strong contenders for deep neural network (DNN) acceleration due to their impressive energy efficiency. Yet, a significant challenge arises when using these emerging devices: they can show substantial variations during the weight-mapping process. This can severely impact DNN accuracy if not mitigated. A widely accepted remedy for imperfect weight mapping is the iterative write-verify approach, which involves verifying conductance values and adjusting devices if needed. In all existing publications, this procedure is applied to every individual device, resulting in a significant programming time overhead. In our research, we illustrate that only a small fraction of weights need this write-verify treatment for the corresponding devices and the DNN accuracy can be preserved, yielding a notable programming acceleration. Building on this, we introduce U-SWIM, a novel method based on the second derivative. It leverages a single iteration of forward and backpropagation to pinpoint the weights demanding write-verify. Through extensive tests on diverse DNN designs and datasets, U-SWIM manifests up to a  $10\times $  programming acceleration against the traditional exhaustive write-verify method, all while maintaining a similar accuracy level. Furthermore, compared to our earlier SWIM technique, U-SWIM excels, showing a  $7\times $  speedup when dealing with devices exhibiting nonuniform variations.</description></item><item><title>FedStar: Efficient Federated Learning on Heterogeneous Communication Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10373574</link><description>The proliferation of multimedia applications and increased computing power of mobile devices have led to the development of personalized artificial intelligent (AI) applications that utilize the massive user-information residing on them. However, the traditional centralized training paradigm is not applicable in this scenario due to potential privacy risks and high communication overhead. Federated learning (FL) provides an option to these applications. Nevertheless, the heterogeneity of computing and communication latency among devices have posed great challenges to building efficient learning frameworks. Existing optimizations on FL either fail to speed up training on heterogeneous devices or suffer from poor communication efficiency. In this article, we propose FedStar, an efficient FL framework that supports decentralized asynchronous training on heterogeneous communication networks. Considering the heterogeneous computing power in the network, FedStar supports running heterogeneity-aware local steps on each device. What is more, considering the heterogeneous communication latency and possibly unreachable communication path between some devices, FedStar generates a decentralized communication topology that can achieve maximal training throughput. Finally, it adopts weighted aggregation to guarantee high convergence accuracy of global model. Theoretical analysis results show the convergence behavior of FedStar under nonconvex settings. Experimental results show that FedStar can achieve a speedup of  $4.81 \times $  than the state-of-the-art FL schemes with high convergence accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Data Extraction Circuit for Posit Number System: LDD-Based Posit Decoder</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10374246</link><description>Since being proposed in 2017, the posit number system has attracted much attention due to its advantages over the IEEE 754 standard floating-point format for better dynamic range and higher accuracy, which are crucial to many applications such as neural networks. Those advantages are yielded from a varying-length segment, regime bits, which lead to the size variations for all rest components except the sign bit. Consequently, it requires an extra decoding process to extract the numerical value of a posit number. The state-of-the-art posit decoder is designed based on a leading one/zero detector. However, we find that this conventional method holds implicit redundancy when dealing with binary numbers. In this article, we design a novel hardware architecture, i.e., the leading difference detector, to optimize the circuit operation by eliminating the redundancy. The experimental results show that the proposed architecture can decrease the delay and power consumption by over 41% compared to the conventional designs for 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit posit decoders.</description></item><item><title>Silicon-Proven ASIC Design for the Polynomial Operations of Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10415637</link><description>In this work, we elaborate on our endeavors to design, implement, fabricate, and post-silicon validate CoFHEE (Nabeel et al., 2023), a co-processor for low-level polynomial operations targeting fully homomorphic encryption execution.
