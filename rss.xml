The main idea could be used to integrate any magnetic device, such as decoupled inductors, decoupled transformers, or decoupled inductor with transformer, in the same core. In this article, a case of two decoupled inductors integrated in the same core using two orthogonal windings is presented. The proposed magnetic device features two inductive coils, wound on a single magnetic core, arranged perpendicularly in three-dimensional space. This specific configuration ensures nearly zero magnetic coupling between the coils, effectively transforming the integrated magnetic device into two independent inductors with higher power density. The three-plate structure distributes the magnetic flux in a more uniform manner, mitigating magnetic concentration within the structure. The uniform distribution of magnetic flux enables the device to handle stronger H-fields before reaching saturation, thus increasing the power density of the device. The design holds promise for various dc&#8211;dc converter applications, potentially leading to cost and size reduction with higher power density. The article provides a comprehensive analysis of the magnetic performance of the proposed magnetic device through detailed finite element method simulations. The magnetic performance of the proposed device is compared with that of the recently proposed two-plate, quadratic-legs structure. The adoption of the three-plate design led to a 25% reduction in the magnetic flux density, for the same load conditions, enabling the device to handle 60% higher current than the quadratic-legs structure. A prototype, tested using a 250 W 2-phase interleaved boost converter and compared with discrete core inductors, revealed that the proposed device achieved a 50% reduction in the volume of the magnetic component of the system without compromising system efficiency, which remained consistent at 94% for both discrete core inductors and the proposed magnetic device.</description></item><item><title>A Radially Symmetrical Star-Shaped Core Multiwinding Transformer With Controllable Magnetic Integration for N-Port MAB Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10806644</link><description>Dual active bridge (DAB) and multiple active bridge (MAB) converters are widely used in the on-board propulsion systems of transportation electrification applications. The tendency of power density improvement leads to the magnetic integration investigation of the isolated HF links, that is to integrate the series inductors and a high-frequency transformer (HFT) into a single magnetic component by increasing the leakage inductance of the HFT. This article proposed a novel radially symmetrical star-shaped core high-frequency multiwinding transformer (HFMT) with split windings for the generalized N-port MAB converters. The proposed HFMT can adjust the leakage inductances within a wide range by the magnetic integration control parameters, which includes lengths of extension legs, side, and central pillars, horizontal air gaps, turns of windings, and winding distribution ratio. Port consistency is promised by the insertion of vertical flux barriers. Based on the magnetic circuit analysis, accuracy of leakage inductance estimation can be guaranteed. A cross-shaped-core HFMT is designed for a quadruple active bridge to validate the effectiveness of the proposed RSSC HFMT as a case study. 3-D finite element analysis simulation and prototype experiments were conducted to validate the theoretical analyses.</description></item><item><title>High-Frequency Transformer Loss Measurement and Modeling: A DC Loss Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10806751</link><description>High-frequency transformer is a key component in power electronic converters, yet accurately modeling their losses remains a big challenge. This article introduces a novel direct current (dc) loss measurement method to model losses in two-winding high-frequency transformers. By conducting multiple tests, the dc loss method can measure the equivalent resistances of a transformer at different operating points. Instead of using conventional circuit analysis models, the proposed method utilizes an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the losses in the excitation inverter. The ANN overcomes the difficulties caused by nonlinear parasitic parameters in inverters for loss prediction, thereby significantly enhancing measurement accuracy. A testing platform based on the proposed method was constructed, and the loss models of several high-frequency transformers were measured. The measurement results were compared with those obtained using the finite element method (FEM) and impedance analyzer, demonstrating the high accuracy of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Minimum Torque Ripple Control for Brushless Doubly-Fed Induction Generator-DC System Under Power Winding Open-Phase Fault</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10777292</link><description>In order to cope with the severe torque ripple caused by the open-phase fault of the power winding (PW) in the brushless doubly-fed induction generator-dc (BDFIG-DC) system, a novel minimum torque ripple control method is proposed in this article. The proposed method does not rely on additional external hardware devices and can minimize the torque ripple in the faulty system, thereby reducing damage to the machine bearings. First, this article analyzes the harmonic components of the torque caused by PW open-phase fault in detail and derives the simplified torque expression. Second, by regulating the 3rd and 5th harmonic currents of PW, a minimum torque ripple control method is proposed. To obtain the real-time reference values of PW 3rd and 5th harmonic currents, Newton's gradient descent method is adopted. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is proven by comprehensive experimental results on a 5-kVA BDFIG-DC system platform.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Torque Ripple Suppression Method With High Power Factor for Electrolytic Capacitor-Less IPMSM Drive Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10787135</link><description>The torque ripple is an important concern in the electrolytic capacitor-less interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) drive system. In this article, a novel method based on d-axis harmonic current injection is proposed to reduce the torque ripple while maintaining a high power factor. The main fluctuating components in the torque with respect to the d-q axis current are derived, and possible configurations of the d-axis current reference are analyzed to obtain an optimal solution to reduce the torque fluctuations. To further improve the power factor, an active damping method based on virtual damping resistor is used to suppress harmonics in the grid current, and a feedforward power compensation link is added to improve the grid current quality. The torque ripple component can be reduced and the requirements of EN61000-3-2 can be satisfied by applying the proposed method. Experimental results on an IPMSM drive platform with a small film capacitor verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Robust Adjustable Speed Drive to Operate in Polluted Grid Conditions With Improved Line Current Harmonics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10806790</link><description>With an increase in the abnormalities in the supply voltage, it is required that the Adjustable Speed Drive (ASD) connected to the grid be immune to those disturbances. Based on the field Power Quality (PQ) data study, distortion in the supply voltage is found to be the dominant disturbance followed by unbalance. It is found that these disturbances mainly affect the lifetime of dc bus capacitor and in critical cases, it may lead to a failure. In order to save the ASD from such grid disturbances, a compensation module is introduced in this article. While reducing the stress on the capacitor, this module also mitigates the harmonics in the source current of ASD. The proposed module can be a retrofit to the existing commercial ASD and can be used where the supply voltage quality is poor. The proposed topology is analyzed by simulations and validated by the test setup created in the lab.</description></item><item><title>Open-Circuit Fault Diagnosis for Active Rectifiers in Doubly Salient Electromagnetic Generator Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10807085</link><description>The performance of the double salient electromagnetic generator (DSEG) system is improved by replacing diode rectifiers with active rectifiers. However, the fault rate of power switches is higher than that of diodes. Thus, diagnosing faults in active rectifiers is necessary. This article proposes a fault diagnosis method for power switch open-circuit faults of active rectifiers in DSEG systems. First, power switch open-circuit faults are divided into two types. Fault type I: the insulate-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) is an open-circuit, and its freewheeling diode (FWD) can work normally. Fault type II: the IGBT and its FWD are open-circuits. The causes and effects of the two fault types are analyzed. Second, the IGBT open-circuit is common to both types. The rapid diagnosis of the IGBT open-circuit is achieved by utilizing the changes in the dc-link current before and after faults as fault features. The overlap areas of fault features are analyzed to avoid missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis. Moreover, if the IGBT open-circuit fault is diagnosed in a certain sector, then the two fault types are distinguished by the phase current features of the two other sectors. Finally, experiments are conducted on a 12/8-pole DSEG experimental platform to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Stability Analysis and Harmonic Filtering Enhancement of Single-Voltage-Loop PI- Controlled Grid-Forming Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10795211</link><description>Grid-forming converters (GFMCs) remain on a strong growth trajectory in the field of power electronics due to ac voltage formation and frequency regulation capabilities. Compared with multiloop control strategies, single-loop voltage control benefits from the simplicity of sensors and controllers, rapid dynamics, and no voltage/current control interaction. However, as revealed by this article, LCL-filtered GFMCs with single-voltage-loop proportional&#8211;integral (PI) controllers feature a high resonance frequency for stable operation in grid-tied and islanded scenarios, which deteriorates switching harmonic filtering due to the small filter size. As such, we propose a switching harmonic filtering enhancement strategy for GFMCs by the use of the LLCL filter, whose LC trap forms a serial resonance at the switching frequency and, thus, allows improved harmonic attenuation. In this way, we achieve strong switching harmonic filtering of LLCL-filtered single-voltage-loop PI-controlled GFMCs. Furthermore, this article derives relevant stability regions. Finally, simulation and experimental results verify the theoretical analysis and switching harmonic attenuation capability.</description></item><item><title>Impacts of the Bottom Copper Layer of Direct-Bond Copper Substrates on the Partial Discharge Performance in Power Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10794661</link><description>This article studies the impacts of the bottom copper layer of direct-bond copper (DBC) substrates on the partial discharge (PD) performance of the power modules. Finite element simulation models of DBC samples with various layouts are developed, and their electric field distributions are compared and analyzed. The results show that by floating the bottom copper layer, applying half of the high voltage, or partially or completely removing the bottom copper layer, the maximum electric field concentrated at the triple point of DBC substrates can be significantly reduced. Multiple DBC samples are manufactured, and their PD performance is experimentally tested. The partial discharge inception voltage (PDIV) can be increased by more than 79% by completely removing the bottom copper layer. Experimental results show good agreement with the simulation analysis and verify the findings. A mimic power module employing the concept of completely removing the bottom-layer copper is made and tested for PD performance under IEC 60270 standard. Compared to the conventional power module structure, the PDIV of the new power module structure can be increased by 63%. The findings in this article can provide guidance and potential strategies to reduce the electric field in encapsulated DBC substrates, which will contribute to optimizing the insulation design of future medium voltage power modules.</description></item><item><title>Switch Fault Diagnosis for Switched Reluctance Motors Based on Current Double-Measurement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10801196</link><description>Fault diagnosis of power switches is essential for enhancing the reliability of switched reluctance motor (SRM) systems.

In addition, the application analysis is provided in detail for SRMs with different control strategies and chopping modes. Furthermore, the phase current detection can be effectively performed under switch fault conditions. Finally, experiments using an 8/6 four-phase SRM are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis method.</description></item><item><title>Research on Remaining Lifetime Evaluation for Traction System IGBT Devices of Electric Locomotives With Different Service Mileage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10803108</link><description>In electric locomotive system, the function of traction converter depends heavily on insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) module, and IGBT module is prone to failure. Traditionally, ensuring safety has involved expensive and wasteful &#8220;mileage maintenance,&#8221; which includes regular replacement of IGBT modules. Therefore, assessing the residual reliability of these modules, taking into account their different service miles, is meaningful. First, the dynamic and static characteristics of IGBT modules under different service mileage are compared and analyzed. Second, the power cycling test for different mileage IGBT modules is carried out to analyze the differences between them. Then, the microscopic analysis of the failure module further confirms the results of the failure analysis. Finally, the fatigue accumulation state of IGBT modules can be deduced from the power cycling test data to predict the remaining life of IGBT modules. This study reveals that the health state is unevaluable using dynamic or static characteristic parameters. It is proved that the power cycling tested results are significantly different for different service-mileage devices. Finally, a remaining lifetime predicted method of power devices is proposed, where the health status is inverted by the power cycling tests.</description></item><item><title>An Online Monitoring Method of Bond Wire Lift-off Unevenness in Multichip SiC MOSFET Power Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10805559</link><description>Monitoring bond wire lift-off unevenness is the basis for high-reliability operation of multichip silicon carbide (SiC) metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (mosfet) power modules. The traditional methods of monitoring bond wire lift-off can only monitor the overall number of the bond wire lift-off for one module. In this article, a new method is proposed to monitor the number of the bond wire lift-off for each parallel chip, which breaks through the limitations of traditional methods. A Kelvin source electrode is added in each parallel chip of the module. Under a constant current source, the voltage ratio related to the bond wires is used to monitor the number of bond wire lift-off for the chip. The validity of the proposed method is verified online by experiments based on a buck converter, a half-bridge inverter, and a double pulse test. Experiments show that the number of bond wire lift-off of each chip can be effectively monitored by the voltage ratio. The normal operation of the converter is not disturbed by the proposed method. The proposed method is not affected by the junction temperature and the gate-oxide degradation of SiC mosfet.</description></item><item><title>Robust Power Self-Balancing Control for Wind-Hydrogen Direct-Connected System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10787432</link><description>Harnessing wind power through hydrogen offers a promising renewable energy solution. Yet the intermittency of wind poses challenges in coordinating wind turbines and electrolyzers. To solve this problem, the wind-hydrogen power coordination control based on the dc bus voltage signal can be adopted. However, because of the mismatch between wind and hydrogen, the dc bus voltage exceeds the normal range frequently, which threatens the safe and stable operation of the system. Focusing on this challenge, this article first establishes a dynamic model of the dc bus voltage for the wind-hydrogen direct-connected system. Then, the fluctuation mechanism is analyzed through detailed mathematical derivations. On this basis, a robust power self-balancing control is proposed using an adaptive arc-tangent function to maintain the dc bus voltage within a proper range while ensuring rapid power matching between the wind turbine and electrolyzer under fluctuating conditions. Finally, the findings are validated through the corresponding wind-hydrogen direct-connected experiment platform.</description></item><item><title>Automated Power Converter Topology Derivation Methodology Based on Exhaustive Graph Search</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10804588</link><description>Due to increasing electrification, there is a need for new power converter topologies. Traditionally, deriving these topologies require skill and experience. Recently, graph theory has been employed in an effort to automate the formation process of nonisolated converters with dc ports. This article proposes an extension of this methodology, introducing ac ports and isolated topologies. This is accomplished by taking into account the directional properties of the power electronic components. As a result, a distinction can be made between unidirectional/bidirectional and dc/ac ports. Besides, other asymmetrical characteristics, such as the need for bidirectional switches, can be verified. Furthermore, the methodology provides a solution for the inclusion of components with more than two terminals. This allows for the introduction of isolation transformers. After the derivation of candidate topologies, the voltage relations and current flows are automatically checked, verifying the operational boundary conditions. The article demonstrates the proposed methodology in a PV-battery system use-case. This showcases the resulting original circuits incorporating a dc input port, dc bidirectional port, and ac output port.</description></item><item><title>Autonomous Battery Equalization Module Using Capacitively Coupled Input-Parallel Output-Series Structure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10803961</link><description>An autonomous battery equalization module, which utilizes an energy circulation technique to equalize the voltage across individual battery cells in a series-connected batteries, is presented. Its structure consists of two power conversion stages. The first stage converts the battery string voltage into a high-frequency ac voltage to form a capacitively coupled ac link. The second one contains multiple diode-based rectifiers with their inputs connected to the ac link via coupling capacitors and their outputs connected in series to individual battery cells. Based on the property that the coupling capacitor voltage equals the battery cell voltage, and the rectifier input voltage are shared across the ac link, the magnitude of the current delivered by the second-stage converter is determined by the difference between the coupling capacitor voltage and the ac-link voltage. As the current taken from the first stage is common to all battery cells, charging or discharging of individual battery cells is autonomously adjusted by the output current of the second stage. Apart from equalizing the voltage of the battery cells within a module, the proposed architecture also allows multiple modules connected via the ac link. Individual battery cell can be charged by or discharged to the rest of battery cells in the same module or other modules. Two four-cell modules for equalizing eight 3.6 V, 18 650 batteries have been built and evaluated.</description></item><item><title>Collaborative Design of Multiloop Controllers for DFIG-Based Wind Turbines to Optimize Inertia Characteristics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10804647</link><description>Controller parameter optimization-based inertia provision methods for wind turbines (WTs) have received much attention, due to their economy and convenience. However, the existing methods fail to consider the effect of multiple controllers on the magnitude-phase characteristics of inertia, which may cause a short support time of WT's inertia response and even deteriorate the system frequency dynamics. To cope with it, this article proposes a collaborative design of multiloop controllers for doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based WTs to optimize inertia characteristics. First, the magnitude-phase characteristics of WT's inertia and their effect on system frequency are analyzed. Then, based on the Sobol' sensitivity analysis method, the dominant influences affecting the magnitude and phase of WTs&#8217; inertia are revealed, respectively. On this basis, a collaborative design method of multiloop controllers is proposed from the perspective of the magnitude-phase characteristics optimization of WT's inertia, which can support system frequency effectively while satisfying constraints of stability as well as rotor kinetic energy. Finally, the analysis and the proposed design method are verified by hardware-in-loop experiments.</description></item><item><title>An Ultrawide Range Pulse Width Modulated LLC Converter With Voltage Multiplier Rectifiers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10804659</link><description>This article presents a voltage multiplier rectifier-based LLC resonant converter that achieves an ultrawide range of the output voltage with pulse width modulation (PWM) of the auxiliary switches on the secondary side. Compared with the pulse frequency modulated LLC topologies, the proposed topology operates at a fixed frequency and features a bounded voltage gain range. Thus, the resonant tank design can be optimized at one frequency, and high efficiency can be realized throughout the output voltage range. Furthermore, the proposed topology greatly extends the maximum PWM normalized voltage gain range to 4.0 with two-mode operations. Meanwhile, zero-voltage switching is realized for all the switches, and a seamless mode transition is achieved by the proposed converter. At last, a time-domain-based analysis and optimization methodology are proposed. A 300 kHz, 1 kW, 400 V input/250&#8211;1000 V output prototype demonstrates high efficiency through the output range and achieves 97.69% peak efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Output Modular Wireless Power Transfer System With Constant-Current Characteristic</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10786202</link><description>In the medium- and high-capacity power applications, typically multiple switches connected in series and parallel are used in power electronic converters to handle high voltages and currents. Powering the driving circuits and auxiliary units with high insulation requirements is challenging. This article proposes a modular multioutput wireless power transfer system with constant-current (CC) output characteristics for auxiliary power supply. Compared with conventional solutions, there is no need for complex control circuits and much magnetic material. The dual-frequency topology with CC outputs is derived by applying the analytical method that used to obtain the dual-frequency topology with constant-voltage (CV) outputs. The conditions for the system to maintain zero phase angle at different frequencies are discussed. Lower output fluctuations than single-frequency multioutput systems and dual-frequency CV output systems are verified. A magnetic coupler with integrated compensation inductors is designed to eliminate the need for discrete inductors and improve the power density. An experimental prototype is built to verify the validity of the theory. The WPT system achieves an output current fluctuation of no more than 4.78%, a maximum system efficiency higher than 85%, and an output power of more than 10 W at a single port, which can well meet the requirements of auxiliary power supply.</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid Control Strategy of LCC&#8211;LCC Compensated Electric Vehicles Wireless Charging System With Wide ZVS Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10797685</link><description>In this article, a hybrid control strategy considering zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) of the inverter within a wide load range is proposed for LCC&#8211;LCC compensated electric vehicles wireless charging system. The modified asymmetric voltage cancellation and half-bridge (HB) control modes are combined to satisfy output requirements. Based on the hybrid control strategy, constant-current and constant-voltage outputs can be easily achieved by fixed-frequency phase shift without complex control and additional auxiliary circuits. A time-domain model considering harmonics and rectifier load is developed, based on which an optimal parameter design method is presented for the hybrid control strategy to achieve ZVS and minimize circulating reactive power. Finally, a 3.3 kW experimental prototype is built to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. The results show that ZVS can be achieved over the range of 10&#8211;100% rated output power. Compared with the conventional hybrid control strategy that combines symmetric phase shift and HB control, the efficiency can be improved by 1.2&#8211;3.6% and the maximum efficiency is 94.1%.</description></item><item><title>Duty and Phase Control of a Self-Synchronized Class E Rectifier for High-Frequency Wireless Power Transfer System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10795204</link><description>This article proposes a high-frequency (HF) wireless power transfer (WPT) system using duty and phase control of a self-synchronized class E rectifier considering the nonlinear internal capacitance of field-effect transistors (FETs). In HF WPT systems ($&gt;$$ \text{13.56}\,\text{MHz}$), the self-synchronized class E rectifier provides a precise gate signal by compensating for the propagation delay. However, when controlling the output power of the HF WPT system, the nonlinear capacitance $C_{\text{oss}}$ of FETs distorts the shape of the drain-voltage waveform, which reduces the efficiency due to nonzero-voltage switching or partial diode operation. To mitigate this issue, we propose an $\alpha$ (=duty ratio) and $\beta$ (=phase delay) control method for a self-synchronized class E rectifier while considering the nonlinear $C_{\text{oss}}$ of FET. To achieve robust control and performance of the HF WPT system, we employed a regression method to estimate the value of $C_{\text{oss}}$ more accurately. Specifically, considering the impact of $C_{\text{oss}}$ on the performance of the HF WPT system, we selected two optimized control points $P_{\text{max}}$ and $P_{\text{min}}$ and developed a first&#8211;order polynomial equation representing the relationship between $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Following the determined $\alpha$$\beta$ relationship, the output power of the WPT was adjusted by hysteresis control while maintaining the highest efficiency. In the experimental validation, the proposed WPT system achieved a conversion efficiency of 82% to 76% in the 160&#8211;90 W output power range. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control method was also verified in closed-loop control during dynamic operation from 160 to $100\,\mathrm{W}$, with a minimal ripple (1.7%) in the output power.</description></item><item><title>Front-End Parameter Identification Method Based on Adam-W Optimization Algorithm for Underwater Wireless Power Transfer System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10795256</link><description>Monitoring coupler parameters in underwater wireless power transfer (UWPT) systems is crucial for improving the system transmission characteristics. Due to the eddy current effect, the equivalent circuits of the magnetic coupler are more complex and contain more parameters than those in air-based circuits. Traditional parameter identification methods, which rely on solving circuit matrix equations, often struggle with the complex UWPT systems or require significant computational resources to solve high-order multivariate equations. This article proposes a coupler parameter identification method based on the adaptive moment estimation with a weighted adjustment (Adam-W) optimization algorithm to address the multiparameter identification problems in the UWPT system. This method transforms the problem of solving high-order matrix equations into an optimization problem to address multiparameter identification problem caused by seawater eddy effect, which is challenging for traditional methods. In addition, it facilitates online monitoring of the characteristic parameters of the system's coupler by detecting the system's front-end input current and voltage without wireless communication and additional sensor modules, and exhibits better reliability in underwater environments. The experimental results show that the proposed Adam-W algorithm achieves a high parameter identification accuracy within 1 s and 94 iterations with an average error of 2.78%. Comparably, an average error of 56.74% is achieved by gradient descent and 41.49% by adaptive moment estimation, and 37.42% by particle swarm optimization in 150 iterations. The proposed Adam-W algorithm achieves higher accuracy in parameter identification of the UWPT system within a shorter time and demonstrates better applicability in seawater environments.</description></item><item><title>A Multipolarity-Coupling Composite Design for Enhancing Lateral and Rotational Misalignment Tolerance of Long-Track DWPT Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10799203</link><description>Lateral misalignment accompanied with rotational angle is unavoidable in the long-track dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) system. This results in an undesirable degradation in transmission performance. To address this vexing misalignment issue, a receiver (Rx) side topology based on multipolarity-coupling composite design is proposed in this article. The designed Rx composite assembly, consisting of a circular coil and three rectangular solenoid coils, effectively catches both vertical and horizontal magnetic fields, complementing each other to suppress mutual inductance variation during misalignment. Only two design variables are included for parameter optimization process, which features simple design flow and convenient implementation without resorting to changing the existing ground assembly configuration. Efficiency stability enhancement is unveiled through power loss analyses combined with theoretical calculation. A scaled-down long-track DWPT system with nearly 320 W output power is built as an example to validate the proposed design. The experimental results show that the system dc&#8211;dc efficiency variations remain below 10% with a 40 mm lateral misalignment (53% of the transmitter track width) across a full deflection angle range of [&#8722;90&#176;, 90&#176;].</description></item><item><title>An Integrated Charger of Wireless Power Transfer, Onboard Charger, and Auxiliary Power Module for Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10804007</link><description>The rapidly developing electric vehicles (EVs) calls for improvement in the charging system for the high-voltage (HV) and low-voltage (LV) batteries in EVs. In the conventional EV charger, wireless power transfer (WPT), onboard charger (OBC), and auxiliary power module (APM) are three separate structures. This article proposes an integrated charger for WPT, OBC, and APM by sharing power conversion stages with the advantages of cost effectiveness and high-power density. The transformer of OBC can be seen as two strongly coupled coils, and the secondary-side coil can be loosely coupled with the transmitting coil of the WPT system, serving as a receiving coil. A transformer can be employed on the receiving side to integrate the APM with WPT. In this way, the receiving coil, the compensation network, and the power electronics converter can be shared. The integrated structure can work in three modes. In the first mode (wireless charging mode) and the second mode (conductive charging mode), the utility delivers power to the HV and LV batteries simultaneously. In the third mode (HV-LV mode), the LV battery is charged by the HV battery through APM. An experimental prototype is implemented to validate the proposal.</description></item><item><title>An Optimization Approach for Efficiency and Interoperability Enhancement of WPT Systems for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10804657</link><description>Wireless power transfer (WPT) systems for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have emerged as a significant application.

This control method can quickly respond to the change of the resonant frequency of the system. It could solve the problem of UWPT system mismatch caused by complex marine environment with the help of a digital phase-locked loop. The circuit structure is simplified without adding any additional components or changing the topology. In addition, the constant voltage level or the constant current level of the dc output of the UWPT system is realized by adjusting the phase shift angle. The control method can adjust the resonant frequency and the dc output voltage or current without requiring an external circuit. Finally, an experimental platform of 500 W UWPT system is built to verify the theory analysis and the design. The experimental results show that this control method could track the resonant frequency well when the resonant frequency of the UWPT system is offset. At the same time, it can effectively maintain a constant output voltage or current when the load impedance of the system changes.</description></item><item><title>UAV Fleet Charging on Telecom Towers With Differential Capacitive Wireless Power Transfer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10812032</link><description>This article introduces a capacitive differential wireless power transfer architecture to efficiently charge an array of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) on a telecom tower as a UAV airport.

To achieve optimal charging performance, several requirements must be met. First, it is necessary to simultaneously achieve constant current (CC) and constant voltage (CV) charging modes using the same compensation network, while maintaining zero-phase angle (ZPA) at the input impedance. Second, it is desirable for the charging modes to remain unaffected by the coupling coefficient (k). Third, a systematic and straightforward method is needed to design the compensation network topology and parameters. In this article, we propose a novel systematic compensation network design method that fulfills all three requirements for the first time. The method represents the magnetic coupling transformer and the compensation network as a series of cascaded T-type modules. By analyzing the requirements for achieving CC or CV modes with ZPA conditions in the basic T-type module and extending these requirements to multiple T-type modules, the parameters of the compensation network can be determined. This approach enables the identification of a series of compensation networks that simultaneously achieve CC and CV modes with ZPA characteristics, independent of the k. Additionally, we introduce a simplified compensation network, LLCC-S, which satisfies the aforementioned requirements with least compensation components. Numerical simulations and experimental results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed compensation network. The results demonstrate the network's ability to achieve the desired CC and CV modes with ZPA features, irrespective of the k.</description></item><item><title>Generalized Interleaved Geometric Modulation for Parallel Grid-Connected AC/DC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10614945</link><description>A generalized interleaved geometric space vector modulation (SVM) method is designed by utilizing the equilateral geometry of the space vector structure. The reference voltage vector in any sector is synthesized using two switched voltage vectors of equal magnitude but displaced by 60${}^{\boldsymbol{\circ}}$. The proposed method can be iterated to multiparallel converters and multilevel converters, as opposed to existing SVM methods which are tailor made for fixed number of converters in parallel. Two variants of geometric modulation&#8212;a four-vector modulation (4VM) and a three-vector modulation (3VM) are proposed for two two-level converters in parallel to minimize the zero sequence circulating current (ZSCC), differential mode circulating current (DMCC), differential mode voltage (DMV), and common-mode voltage (CMV). The 4VM uses the zero DMV vectors to eliminate the ZSCC flow and maintains the CMV within $\boldsymbol{\pm}({\boldsymbol{V}_{\textbf{dc}}}\boldsymbol{/}{\textbf{6}})$. The 3VM is designed to restrict the DMCC flow to only one phase leg and the DMV and CMV levels are within $\boldsymbol{\pm}({\boldsymbol{V}_{\textbf{dc}}}\boldsymbol{/}{\textbf{3}})$. The efficacy of the proposed methods is validated using hardware experiments. The proposed method can be applied for multiparallel converter applications such as interlinking converters in ac/dc microgrids, electric vehicle charging stations, and so on.</description></item><item><title>Investigation and Diagnosis of Current Sensor Fault in Permanent Magnet Machine Drives</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10616109</link><description>Dc offset and gain errors are common failures in current sensor which may be caused by drift in the temperature and supply voltage. The wrong feedback deteriorates the current tracking capability and significantly impacts the performance of the drives. Thus, this article first investigates the fault behaviors of current sensors, and then a fault diagnosis method is proposed for typical machine drives equipped with two current sensors based on signal injection. For current sensor dc offset faults, this article utilizes the fundamental component of the dq-axis current for detection. Changes in amplitude and phase angle are then employed after injecting a dc offset signal to identify the faulted phase and direction. Recognizing more clear fault characteristics of gain faults at high frequency (HF), this article introduces a fault detection method involving HF voltage injection. The fault phase and direction are determined based on the amplitude of the HF current. The proposed method first time provides all the requisite signals including fault type, location, and polarity. Extensive experimental tests are designed and performed. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach in the current sensor fault diagnosis.</description></item><item><title>A Three-Level Auxiliary Resonant Commutated Pole Inverter for 800-V Electric Vehicle Powertrain</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10616013</link><description>Shifting the electric vehicle (EV) bus voltage from 400 to 800 V has a major impact on EV inverters design. Three-level inverters are designed to cope with high battery voltage. Among three-level inverter topologies, the neutral point clamped (NPC) has better harmonic spectrum and lower semiconductor losses, which results in achieving higher power density and simpler cooling system. Nevertheless, in this topology, higher switching frequencies will result in more power losses in the inverter. The higher switching frequency capability enables the use of higher speed motors leading to overall reduction in the size of the electric drive system. This article proposes a new soft-switching NPC inverter in which a unidirectional auxiliary resonant commutated pole (ARCP) circuit assists commutation from the clamped diodes to the transistors and eliminates losses of this transition. In this topology, zero-current switching (ZCS) for all auxiliary switches and zero-voltage switching (ZVS) for main outer switches is achieved. Unlike the conventional transformer-assisted ARCP topologies, this structure does not utilize a saturable inductor to reset the transformer, which leads to a more compact design. Simulation and experimental results on a 3-kw prototype verify the effectiveness of the proposed topology in terms of achieving soft-switching.</description></item><item><title>Midpoint Voltage of Bridge Arm Based Fault Diagnosis Method of Inverter and Phase Winding for DSEM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10630606</link><description>In the motor drive system, there are the same fault characteristics for the open circuit (OC) fault of phase winding (OCFOPW) and the two OC fault types of power switch (OCFTOPS). However, there is no method addressing the diagnosis of both OCFOPW and OCFTOPS. In order to solve this problem, this article proposes a fault diagnosis method of inverter and phase winding for doubly salient electromagnetic motor (DSEM) based on the midpoint voltage of bridge arm. First, based on unidirectional conduction of diode and the variation characteristics of back electromotive force (EMF), fault diagnosis is realized by constructing a forward voltage on the antiparallel diode. Then, a voltage threshold is set to eliminate misdiagnosis caused by the conduction voltage drop on the device, and the variation rate of excitation current is varied to ensure effective diagnosis in the case that the back EMF is less than voltage threshold. Finally, the experiments on a 12/8-pole DSEM validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Simultaneous Wireless Power and Data Transfer System With Full-Duplex Mode Based on Half-Cycle OFDM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10627931</link><description>A simultaneous wireless power and data transfer system (SWPDT) with full-duplex mode based on half-cycle orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology is proposed to suppress interference from the power and ipsilateral carriers. The power carrier is regarded as the subcarrier carrying all the &#8220;1&#8221; data, which is used as the reference frequency, and the data subcarrier frequencies are determined according to the orthogonal properties of the power and data carriers to achieve full-duplex transmission. Demodulation integration cycle is reduced to half of the fundamental wave period, which doubles the data transmission rate. Depending on the proposed OFDM-based modulation and demodulation scheme, there is no need to use additional topologies to suppress interference from the power carrier and crosstalk from ipsilateral data source. In this article, simplified models of power and data transmission channels are developed, analyzed, and optimized to improve the data transmission gain. Finally, a 220 W experimental prototype was built, and tests show that the full-duplex communication rate could reach 170 kbps, which validates the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed SWPDT system.</description></item><item><title>Low Output Current Ripple Ultra High Step-Down Two-Phase Buck Converter With Low Switching Losses</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10614944</link><description>This article introduces a new two-switch step-down dc&#8211;dc converter. By integrating Valley-Fill circuit with coupled inductors, and using the cross-coupled inductor technique, the proposed converter achieves a substantial reduction in the output current ripple. This configuration not only improves the voltage gain of the converter but also alleviates voltage stress on diodes. Employing dual magnetic elements provides the realization of a dual-phase buck mechanism, enhancing converter efficiency. Moreover, the converter demonstrates ripple cancellation capabilities. One switch in the proposed converter turns on under zero current switching conditions, while the other incurs minimal switching losses due to its low drain-source voltage, which reduces both switching losses and the capacitive turn-on loss. Detailed analysis and design guidelines are presented to validate the performance of the proposed converter. Experimental validation is provided through a 300 to 24 V 120 W prototype converter, which affirms the circuit's operational integrity and theoretical analysis.</description></item><item><title>Single-Step Trajectory Model Predictive Control for 100 kHz Large-Signal Multiphase Converters With Fast Dynamic Response</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10616107</link><description>Low-total harmonic distortion (THD) and fast dynamic response of multiphase converters are the major challenges for high-order quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) in low-frequency (LF) communication (30&#8211;300&#160;kHz). This article proposes a single-step trajectory model predictive control (SST-MPC) for 100&#160;kHz lager-signal multiphase converters, which improves the dynamic performance of optimized pulse patterns (OPPs). Low THD of multiphase converters at a steady state can be achieved by OPPs, which is well applied to LF communication. SST-MPC proposed in this article takes the transient trajectory into account and designs a new transient trajectory to reduce the settling time. Meanwhile, the first step and the second step predictive output voltage can be calculated in parallel only by the first step future multilevel output voltage. Even if the ratio of the control frequency to the output frequency is low, fast dynamic response and over/undershoot-free can be achieved by SST-MPC. The computational burden of SST-MPC is similar to the traditional single-step model predictive control (SS-MPC). Simulation and experimental results are given to verify the excellent dynamic performance of SST-MPC. Compared with the settling time of the two state-of-the-art SS-MPCs, the average improvements of SST-MPC are 37.02% and 30.24%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Integrated OBC and LDC System with Improved Cross-Regulation Performance for Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10627962</link><description>This article presents a novel integrated on-board charger (OBC) and low-voltage dc&#8211;dc converter (LDC) system to improve the cross-regulation performance of electric vehicles. The proposed system improves the cross-regulation performance of OBC and LDC by using the magnetically decoupled OBC and LDC windings of a single transformer. Based on the above winding structure of the transformer, the proposed system operates as a dual active bridge converter for OBC and an inductor-inductor-capacitor (LLC) resonant converter for LDC without additional devices, resulting in an improvement in cross-regulation performance. Furthermore, it inherently mitigates the unintended high-voltage problem on the input dc-link capacitor caused by the multiwinding transformer in the LDC standalone mode without any additional control method. To validate the proposed system, an experimental prototype with an integrated 3.3-kW OBC and 1.0-kW LDC is configured and tested.</description></item><item><title>Single-Stage Two-Flyback PFC Converter With Low Voltage Stress on a Switch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10616009</link><description>The proposed converter consists of two flyback ac&#8211;dc/dc&#8211;dc modules. Some power stored in a first coupled inductor is directly transferred to a load and the other is stored in two dc-link capacitors. Since a flyback ac&#8211;dc module operates in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), line input current is in phase with the instantaneous line voltage and high power factor (PF) is achieved. In a next period, the energy stored in two capacitors is moved to a load by means of a second flyback dc&#8211;dc module. To achieve low voltage stress on a switch, two dc-blocking diodes are added so that the dc-link voltage is lower than a peak input voltage. The voltage stress on a switch is clamped to the double dc-link voltage. For a reduction of switching loss on a switch, the first flyback ac&#8211;dc module operates in DCM and the second flyback dc&#8211;dc module operates in critical conduction mode (CRM). The proposed converter features higher efficiency and higher PF than a conventional single-stage boost-flyback PFC converter. The performance of the proposed converter is verified from a 48&#160;V and 100&#160;W prototype, including its theoretical analyses and design procedures.</description></item><item><title>Solid State Pulsed Power Modulator With Asymmetric Bipolar Pulse and High Repetition Rate for Semiconductor Manufacturing Process</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10623624</link><description>This article proposes a solid-state pulsed power modulator (PPM) with asymmetric bipolar pulses and high repetition rates for semiconductor manufacturing processes. Since the proposed PPM is based on high voltage solid-state switches (HVSSes) consisting of series connected silicon carbide (SiC) metal-oxide silicon field effect transistors (MOSFETs), it is simple to obtain variable asymmetric bipolar pulses as well as unipolar pulses. To solve the voltage unbalance problem, which is a critical challenge when the SiC MOSFETs are connected in series, a simple voltage balancing circuit is proposed. This balancing circuit shows superior features such as low loss and high reliability because it is composed of only passive components such as transformers and capacitors. In addition, the proposed PPM can achieve the high repetition rate since the soft switching of all SiC MOSFETs can be accomplished by the balancing transformer. Furthermore, the soft switching characteristic and the low loss of balancing circuit can contribute to the miniaturization of PPM by reducing the sizes of components and cooling systems. The design and implementation of 5 kV PPM with high repetition rate of 500 kHz are presented. Experiment results from the developed PPM are shown to verify the proposed works.</description></item><item><title>A Generic Modeling Approach for Dual-Active-Bridge Converter Family via Topology Transferrable Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10627933</link><description>The emerging gray-box modeling for power converters effectively mitigates model discrepancies seen in traditional physics-based white-box models while offering a data-light, explainable alternative to data-driven black-box models. However, a significant challenge remains existing gray-box modeling approaches suffer from poor generalization to out-of-domain topologies. This limitation necessitates rebuilding or retraining the model when a new topology is encountered, hindering widespread adoption. Catering for these challenges, this article proposes a generic gray-box modeling approach tailored for the dual-active-bridge (DAB) converter topology family, which is based on a proposed topology transferrable physics-in-architecture mixture density network (T2PA-MDN). As the core part, the T2PA network retrofits recurrent neurons to embed circuit physics seamlessly via discretized numeric methods, enabling efficient topology transfer. Moreover, a probabilistic mixture density network (MDN) quantifies ambient fluctuations using a mixture of Gaussian distributions, mitigating model discrepancies. The proposed modeling methodology is demonstrated with three topology transfer design cases, in which the model is trained on a nonresonant DAB with merely a five-time series and is easily transferred to resonant, multilevel, and multiport topologies with no extra data or training. Algorithm analysis and 2-kW hardware experiments have verified the feasibility and the superiority of T2PA-MDN. This research aims to pioneer a new direction for the future gray-box modeling of power converters, toward generalization across diverse topologies but effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Continuous Control Set Model Predictive Control Using Nash Equilibrium for Flying Capacitor Multilevel Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10616177</link><description>This article presents a novel distributed model predictive control (DMPC) method for multilevel converters with multiple switching configurations. The central aspect of the control approach is to organize the dynamic game among multiple subcontrollers and achieve the Nash equilibrium to realize the deadbeat control of the multilevel converter. Compared with the conventional lumped structure finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) method, DMPC is more flexible in structure and easy to expand. Moreover, the output of DMPC is duty cycle for modulation resulting in fixed switching frequency and improved ripple. The DMPC method has been experimentally validated with a 100 kHz GaN-based five-level flying capacitor (FC) converter. Experimental results show that compared with FCS-MPC, the current ripple, the voltage ripple, and the total harmonic distortion (THD) under DMPC control are reduced by 80%, 70%, and 90%, respectively. At the same time, the computational burden of DMPC is only 16% of that of FCS-MPC. These advantages would promote the implementation of fixed frequency and deadbeat nonlinear control of the FCMC at high levels.</description></item><item><title>A PSO-ANN-Aided DC-Bias Current Suppression Strategy for Three-Phase DAB Converter With Variable Duty Cycles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10612826</link><description>Dynamic performance is a critical index for three-phase dual active bridge (3ph-DAB) converter. However, the presence of dc bias in inductor current poses significant effects, such as overcurrent stress and increased power loss for 3ph-DAB converter. Additionally, the intricate structure and three control variables in variable duty cycles (VDCs) modulation pose significant challenges in analysis and deduction procedures, which suffer from high-manpower burden and low accuracy. This article proposes an artificial neural network (ANN) method to suppress the dc bias current without the need for human intervention. First, the traditional method based on space vector and piecewise modeling method is reviewed. Furthermore, the optimal objective function is established by analyzing the behavior of the converter, considering the deviation of the peak value of the inductor current between the transient and subsequent steady state. The PLECS software is utilized to acquire optimal datasets of transient variables that minimize the objective function via the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Subsequently, two ANNs are then developed by utilizing these optimal datasets to yield data-driven models for transient variables. Finally, experimental results are given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing a reduction in the transient period to within one-third of the switching period and current stress to 88.5% compared to conventional schemes.</description></item><item><title>Forward-Based DC-DC Converter With Eliminated Leakage Inductance Problem</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10621906</link><description>The novel forward-based converter for low-power solar applications is presented in this work. The proposed converter provides an efficient performance in a wide range of the input voltage with low component count. The proposed dc-dc topologies are advanced forward dc-dc converters with an additional clamped output capacitor.

Multiple GFM converters connected to the same point of common coupling (PCC) should not only ensure harmonic current sharing, but also reduce the PCC voltage harmonics. Most of the existing harmonic control of GFM converters do not consider both islanded and grid-connected modes. Moreover, these methods need to extract and control each harmonic sequence separately, resulting in enormous calculation. To solve this problem, a harmonic control method for GFM converters based on unified harmonic voltage&#8211;current droop is proposed. By establishing a unified droop relation between all harmonic components of PCC voltage and output current, we manage to share harmonic current while reducing PCC voltage harmonics. The proposed method is applicable in both grid-connected and islanded modes, without extracting individual harmonic sequences. Compared with existing control methods, it requires less computation burden. The design of harmonic control parameters based on closed-loop pole analysis is discussed in detail. Experimental results show that with limited computation resources, the proposed control achieves superior harmonic control effects in both grid-connected and islanded modes than existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Dual-Loop Continuous Control Set Model Predictive Control for a High-Voltage and High-Power Energy Storage System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10621854</link><description>In this article, a dual-loop continuous control set model predictive control (CCS-MPC) method is proposed for high-voltage and high-power energy storage system (ESS) based on dc dynamic voltage regulator (dc-DVR). Different from the conventional control method, the proposed control method uses a cascade dual-model-predictive control for the inner and outer control loops. The mathematical model of ESS is established. The inner-loop MPC controller is based on the inductance characteristic equation, which is used to control the inductance current of dc-DVR. The outer-loop MPC controller is based on the capacitance characteristic equation, which is used to control the output voltage to track the reference value. In this proposal, the parameters of the inner-loop and outer-loop MPC controllers are updated at each control cycle to improve the robustness to load changes and parameter uncertainties. In addition, the proposed method is combined with interleaved parallel control. It not only realizes the current balance between the parallel phases of dc-DVR, but also reduces the voltage and current ripple. Several advantages can be highlighted such as fixed switching frequency, short output voltage dynamic adjustment time, and robustness to system parameter mismatch. The proposed method is verified by an experiment platform.</description></item><item><title>Disturbance Observer-Based Fixed-Time Event-Triggered Control for Networked Electro-Hydraulic Systems With Input Saturation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10614934</link><description>The electro-hydraulic system (EHS) has been widely utilized in modern industry due to its high power-to-weight ratio and payload capacity. In this study, a disturbance observer-based fixed-time event-triggered controller is designed for a networked EHS with input saturation. First, a fixed-time disturbance observer (FTDO) is designed to compensate for the model uncertainties and unknown external disturbance. Subsequently, to alleviate the communication pressure of the EHS, a switching threshold event-triggered mechanism (STETM) is constructed to determine the control voltage update. Additionally, an input saturation estimator (ISE) is used to avoid the input saturation caused by the high-order error items and derivative explosions of virtual control variables. The rigorous theoretical derivations demonstrate that the designed controller guarantees the convergence of both the observation error and the position tracking error within a fixed time period, regardless of the initial EHS states. Furthermore, the network communication resources of the EHS are saved while the system stability and satisfactory tracking performance are guaranteed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified by the simulation results and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Series Elastic Actuator With Variable Transmission Ratio Using Reconfigurable Epicyclic Gearing for Hip Exoskeletons</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10621907</link><description>Series elastic actuators (SEAs) are extensively employed in exoskeletons due to high actuation transparency, reliable back-drivability, and accurate force control. However, existing SEAs designed for exoskeletons fail to deliver a wide range of torque-speed characteristics for activities including walking, running, ramp ascent, and ramp descent. In this study, a novel variable transmission SEA that incorporates reconfigurable epicyclic gearing and two clutches is presented to achieve three distinct speed-torque characteristics and enhance transparency. To ensure robust position tracking for the actuator in torque-speed characteristics switching, a disturbance observer is developed to estimate the lumped disturbance induced by external load and internal modeling uncertainties. Comparative experimental results demonstrate that, under unload and load conditions, the sinusoidal tracking error of the proposed controller is reduced by more than 30% compared to the controller without a disturbance observer, and the energy consumption of the actuator system is reduced by more than 40% compared to traditional SEAs.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Velocity and Acceleration Control of Autonomous Vehicle Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10621848</link><description>This article proposes a combined adaptive velocity and acceleration control (CAVAC) law for autonomous vehicles in the presence of uncertainties and nonlinearities. In particular, the global asymptotic stability of the nonlinear vehicle system under the proposed adaptive velocity control is shown to hold without real-time estimation of the vehicle parameters. Moreover, the CAVAC law is shown to achieve the string stability against energy bounded disturbances, and ensures the required intervehicle spacing, crucial to avoiding collisions in vehicle platoons. The simulation studies illustrate the advantages of the CAVAC law for the autonomous vehicle platoon in dealing with the speed limit changes, in mitigating issues induced by merging-exiting, in suppressing energy bounded disturbances, and in improving collision avoidance. The experiments on an electric vehicle (EV) validate the effectiveness of the proposed control laws.</description></item><item><title>A Virtual Phase Current-Based Current Balance Method for the Interleaved Boost Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10614940</link><description>This article presents a novel current-balancing control method using virtual phase current for the interleaved boost converter. By theoretical derivation, it can be found that the output voltage contains useful information used to calculate the ratio between phase currents. The proposed method uses the ratio and the total input current to generate the virtual phase current. Once the virtual phase current is achieved, the phase current can be autotuned to balance due to the same reference from the voltage regulation control loop. Despite the N number of the phase, only a current sensor is needed. Moreover, instead of the input current details, only effective values are required, which will reduce sampling costs. A limiter is added to reduce the impact of the current balance on the stability and transient response of the voltage regulation control loop. It is also beneficial to improve the robustness against noise and external disturbances. The proposed method is easy to implement in the existing controller, including the double closed-loop controllers. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability.</description></item><item><title>A Large-Scale Sensing-Monitoring Integrated Aircraft Smart Skin with Ultralow Weight and Ultralow Power Consumption for Structural Health Monitoring</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10616008</link><description>Impact monitoring is important for ensuring aircraft service safety. Usually, a large-scale piezoelectric transducer (PZT) network is arranged and connected to a monitoring system via heavy cables to implement impact monitoring.

Thus, based on the truncation number selection method of the harmonic state-space (HSS) model, a high-fidelity HSS model of MMC-HVDC is obtained. Then, the analysis results show that the 150 Hz oscillation comes from the interaction between the internal dynamics (up to fourth harmonic) and circulating current suppressing control (up to sixth harmonic). Finally, some optimizations for 150 Hz oscillation are given, and the results are verified in real-time LAB (RT-LAB).</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Short-Term Wind Power Forecasting Based on the Strategy of &#8220;Dynamic Matching and Online Modeling&#8221;</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10620613</link><description>Ultra-short-term wind power forecasting plays a vital role in real-time scheduling, frequency regulation, and intraday market transactions. Due to the complexity of weather systems, unit aging, wind farm control strategies, etc., the temporal dependency relationship in wind power series changes from time to time (known as concept drift), which leads to the low forecasting accuracy of the commonly used offline modeling methods. Online modeling can effectively deal with concept drift by utilizing the latest information in the flow data and capturing the latest concepts during the modeling process. However, the existing online modeling methods cannot meet the timeliness requirements of the power grid for ultra-short-term wind power forecasting. Therefore, a strategy of &#8220;dynamic matching and online modeling&#8221; for ultra-short-term wind power forecasting is proposed in this paper. Training samples are dynamically selected according to the characteristic similarity of amplitude and fluctuation, aiming to improve the representativeness of samples and reduce the training time simultaneously. In addition to historical power, Numerical Weather Prediction wind speed is also introduced in the process of &#8220;dynamic matching&#8221; to improve the forecasting accuracy. Operation data from three wind farms in China is used to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. The results show that the forecasting accuracy can be improved by 1.18%&#8211;4.32% for 4 hours in advance.</description></item><item><title>Resilience-Oriented Two-Stage Restoration Considering Coordinated Maintenance and Reconfiguration in Integrated Power Distribution and Heating Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10620409</link><description>The inherent linkage between a power distribution system (PDS) and a district heating system (DHS) necessitates coordinated load restoration after natural disasters.

Then, the acceleration principles are proposed to determine the load status variables. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed model are validated by extensive cases, which demonstrate the performance of the coordinated maintenance and reconfiguration in integrated energy systems for fault recovery.</description></item><item><title>A Comprehensive Control Strategy for F-SOP Considering Three-Phase Imbalance and Economic Operation in ISLDN</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638221</link><description>With the increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RES) and single-phase loads, three-phase imbalance and transformer lightly/heavily loaded operation issues has become more prominent in low-voltage distribution networks (LDN). However, existing research on interconnected systems of LDN (ISLDN) rarely addresses the comprehensive management of both three-phase imbalance and lightly/heavily loaded operation issues. To this end, a comprehensive control strategy for three-phase imbalance and lightly/heavily loaded operation in ISLDN based on a four-leg soft open point (F-SOP) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the comprehensive loss characteristics model of ISLDN including the F-SOP and the transformer are established, revealing that both imbalance and load rate can affect the equipment efficiency. Secondly, considering the objective of minimizing power loss, an optimization dispatch strategy with constraints of three-phase imbalance and the optimal economic operation area is proposed to obtain the dispatch power commands for the F-SOP. Furthermore, an improved peer-to-peer control for F-SOP is proposed to ensure the conduct of the optimization dispatch strategy and enhance stability performance of system. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed comprehensive control strategy are validated by the simulations and experiments.

However, this makes power systems even more uncertain and complex, so uncertainty-aware accurate forecasting needs to be considered for the massive penetration of renewable energy. To this end, we propose a scalable and missing-insensitive framework for probabilistic multi-site photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting, specifically focused on large-scale PV sites and space-time missing data. By leveraging the graph neural network (GNN), the proposed scalable graph learning mechanism with random coarse graph attention and probabilistic spatio-temporal learning performs efficiently for large-scale PV sites in terms of forecasting accuracy and model training complexity. At the same time, our framework adaptively imputes the missing PV data in the space and time domain, respectively. Ablation study results demonstrate that our framework is effective for extracting complex spatial-temporal features across large-scale PV sites. Under extensive experiments, our framework shows 7$-$10% and 6$-$25% improvement on average for over 1600 PV sites and three types of space-time missing data, which ensures accurate and stable forecasting.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Dispatch Strategy for a Multi-Microgrid Cooperative Alliance Using a Two-Stage Pricing Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10648707</link><description>To coordinate resources among multi-level stakeholders and enhance the integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into multi-microgrids, this study proposes an optimal dispatch strategy within a multi-microgrid cooperative alliance using a nuanced two-stage pricing mechanism. Initially, the strategy assesses electric energy interactions between microgrids and distribution networks to establish a foundation for collaborative scheduling. The two-stage pricing mechanism initiates with a leader-follower game, wherein the microgrid operator acts as the leader and users as followers. Subsequently, it adjusts EV tariffs based on the game's equilibrium, taking into account factors such as battery degradation and travel needs to optimize EVs' electricity consumption. Furthermore, a bi-level optimization model refines power interactions and pricing strategies across the network, significantly enhancing demand response capabilities and economic outcomes. Simulation results demonstrate that this strategy not only increases renewable energy consumption but also reduces energy costs, thereby improving the overall efficiency and sustainability of the system.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Optimization Operation of Improved Power-to-Hydrogen-and-Heat Method at Low Temperature for Reducing Carbon Emissions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654708</link><description>The power-to-hydrogen-and-heat (P2HH) method is a potential means of improving energy efficiency while reducing carbon emissions. However, existing P2HH methods are ineffective at low temperatures, and do not consider physical constraints on heat exchange between the electrolyzer and heating network. Hence, this paper proposes an improved P2HH (IP2HH) method to overcome these shortcomings. First, this paper proposes a novel collaborative mechanism between the electrolyzer and the heating network. In this system, the electrolyzer can not only transfer excess heat to the heating network when at high temperatures, but can also be heated by the heating network when at low temperatures. Second, this paper takes the physical limitations of heat exchange between electrolyzer and heating network into consideration, and models the regulating valve of heat exchanger. These considerations allow produce simulation results that better approximate real-world scenarios. Finally, a convex model integrated with the IP2HH approach is established. Compared with the existing P2HH method, the IP2HH method may allow electrolyzer to work intermittently based on fluctuations in renewables supplies while maintaining high hydrogen production efficiency. Such improvements could reduce carbon emissions by 35.5%, costs by 10.7%, and renewables curtailment by 26.4% at ambient temperature of 1 $^{\circ }$C.</description></item><item><title>Scheduling Multiple Industrial Electrolyzers in Renewable P2H Systems: A Coordinated Active-Reactive Power Management Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654460</link><description>Utility-scale renewable power-to-hydrogen (ReP2H) systems typically consist of multiple electrolyzers (ELZs), many of which are powered by thyristor rectifiers (TRs). A TR-powered ELZ has a nonlinear and nondecouplable relation between its active and reactive loads. The on-off switching and load allocation across multiple ELZs impact the efficiency of P2H energy conversion and the active and reactive power flows in the electrical network. Improper scheduling may result in an excessive reactive load from the hydrogen plant, causing voltage violations and increased network losses, which compromise both safety and profitability. To address these issues, this paper first explores the tradeoffs between the energy efficiency and reactive loads of ELZs. Then, we propose a joint active-reactive power management method to coordinate the loads and thermal properties of the ELZs, renewables, energy storage, and var compensation to improve the overall productivity and profitability. Mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) is established to achieve these goals, and a decomposition algorithm enables its applicability in large-scale systems. Case studies show that the proposed method, at best, increases the hydrogen yield by 2.49% while reducing network losses by 3.12% compared to the state-of-the-art strategies based on wind and solar power data from Inner Mongolia, China. The optimal var resource configuration for ReP2H systems is also briefly discussed.</description></item><item><title>Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning for Real-Time Optimal Power Flow With Renewable Energy Resources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10660524</link><description>The serious uncertainties from the extensive integration of renewable energy generations put forward a higher real-time requirement for power system dispatching. To provide economic and feasible generation operations in real-time, a physics-informed reinforcement learning (PIRL) method based on constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) for optimal power flow (OPF) is presented in this paper. In the proposed method, a physics-informed actor based on the power flow equations is designed to generate generation operations that satisfy the equality constraints of OPF. To specify inequality constraints in actor optimization, the policy gradient is augmented with the constraints to correct unfeasible generation operations. In particular, the cost functions related to inequality constraints can be directly calculated based on the output of the actor, which is more accurate than using networks to approximate in general CRL methods. The proposed method is tested on the IEEE 118-bus system, and the simulation result shows that the proposed method achieves a significant improvement in computation speed compared with the traditional interior point method while obtaining a similar generation cost.</description></item><item><title>Exploiting the Flexibility of District Heating System for Distribution System Operation: Set-Based Characterization and Temporal Decomposition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10660566</link><description>The proliferation of distributed renewable resources increases the uncertainty in distribution systems. Coupling the distribution system and district heating system helps leverage the flexibility of thermal storage and thus supports the operation of the electrical grid. This paper proposes a method to characterize flexibility from district heating system via polyhedral sets. First, a recursive robust feasibility condition that ensures heat supply adequacy under uncertain demand is established. Then, stagewise robust feasible sets of thermal storage levels are calculated using a customized projection algorithm. Finally, dynamic bounds of electric heaters are computed by a further projection step. With those dynamic bounds, the electric heaters behave like reducible loads, and the demands in each period are decoupled over time, although the dispatch of thermal storage units must comply with inter-temporal constraints. The proposed method allows the two coupled systems to be operated in a distributed way without forecasts and extensive communications. Numerical simulations on small and practically sized testing systems validate the advantage of the proposed method. On average, the set calculation takes about 8 minutes for the day-ahead problem and 11 seconds for real-time dispatch on a portable laptop, and the prediction-free operation policy has an average optimality gap of 3.6% compared to the hindsight optimum.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Volt-VAR Coordinated Scheduling With Mobile Energy Storage System for Active Distribution Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10664000</link><description>In order to improve the voltage distribution and operation cost for ADN, A scheduling strategy is designed to integrate flexible resources, particularly mobile energy storage systems, within the coupling of ADN and TN, under an uncertain environment. A day-ahead Volt-VAR coordinated scheduling framework for ADN and TN can be proposed through incorporating a data-driven day-ahead scenario generation method based on denoising diffusion probabilistic model. First, the historical data may be employed to learn the error relationship between real power curves and predicted power curves for generating RES scenarios. The probability distribution for prediction error is constructed which can describe the day-ahead output power curve of RES. Subsequently, a SCCO approach is employed to measure voltage operating risk in uncertain environment, which can effectively utilize the controllability of different resource at timescale and spatial scale in ADN to fulfill the anticipated operational requirement. Finally, The ADN coupled with TN model can be linearized and converted into the mixed-integer linear programming method. Numerical simulations based on the IEEE 33-bus distribution system coupled with 15-node transportation network may verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Photovoltaic-Grid Integrated System for the Residential Power Management</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10663696</link><description>This paper proposes a photovoltaic (PV)-Utility integrated system with inductive power transfer (IPT) for electric vehicle (EV) charging applications in residential management applications. To realize this objective, a buck boost-interleaved H-bridge (BBIHB) configuration is proposed to integrate the PV source with the DC link of the front end converter (FEC) while achieving maximum power from the PV and power delivery to the IPT simultaneously. The DC bus of the IPT in the proposed system is obtained through the additive connection of the PV and FEC DC-link, which results in inherent boost of the DC bus voltage for the IPT system thus enhances the transmission power for the EV charging. Furthermore, the FEC allows bidirectional power flow between the utility and BBIHB converter by sharing the deficient or excess power in the system based on PV power availability. The complete modeling of the system and a control algorithm to achieve the above mentioned objectives is presented in this paper. Other features of the proposed system include inherent voltage boosting, a simple control strategy, and the absence of a separate converter for the PV to extract maximum power. Finally, an experimental hardware setup is developed in the laboratory and tested up to 4 kW of output power to validate the proposed system's performance, achieving a maximum DC-to-DC efficiency of 94% at this condition.</description></item><item><title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Dynamic Droop Control Strategy for Real-Time Optimal Operation and Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10664502</link><description>The optimal operation of an islanded AC microgrid system is achieved by proper power sharing among generators. The conventional distributed cost optimization strategies use a communication system to converge incremental costs. However, these methods are dependent on the distributed communication network and do not consider frequency deviations for real-time load variability. Thus, this paper proposes a DRL-based dynamic droop control strategy. The proposed twin delayed DDPG-based DRL interacts with the environment to learn the optimal droop gain for reducing generation cost and frequency deviation. The trained agent uses local information to transmit dynamic droop gains to the primary controller as demand load changes. It can simplify the control structure by omitting the secondary layer for optimal operation and power quality. The proposed control strategy is designed with a centralized DRL training process and distributed execution, enabling real-time distributed optimal operation. The comparison results with conventional distributed strategy confirms better control performance of the proposed strategy. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed strategy was verified by experiment on AC microgrid testbed.</description></item><item><title>Cross-Timescale Interaction Analysis Between Current Control and Rotor Speed Control Timescale Dynamics in a High-Proportion DFIG-WT System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10665985</link><description>Power electronics (PE) equipment contains multiple timescale energy storage components and control loops. As a result, the dynamic process presents multiple timescale characteristics in PE-dominated power systems. For simplicity, single timescale dynamics are often the focus of corresponding analysis, and the influence of different timescales (i.e., cross-timescale analysis) is rarely considered. However, there is an interaction effect between multiple timescale controls and energy storage components, which complicates system dynamics. In this study, the cross-timescale impact of current control on the dynamics of rotor speed control timescale are evaluated. First, based on a two-machine two-area system comprising a phase-locked loop (PLL)-synchronized doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbine (WT), the influence of the PLL on cross-timescale interactions is revealed via modal analysis. Then, a current control equivalent circuit is derived for analyzing its cross-timescale influence on rotor motion, and the LC resonance mechanism related to the current control is revealed. Moreover, the impact of the PLL on cross-timescale interactions is elucidated. Finally, the cross-timescale influence phenomena and mechanisms are verified via real-time digital simulations.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Short-Term Prediction of Wind Farm Cluster Power Based on Embedded Graph Structure Learning With Spatiotemporal Information Gain</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10669105</link><description>Ultra-short-term prediction of wind farm cluster power (UPWFCP) is of great significance for the development of intra-day power generation plan, and the power prediction accuracy is difficult to be further improved due to the chaotic effect of the weather system and the incompleteness of the information. In this regard, this paper proposes an embedded graph structure learning method for wind farm cluster (WFC) that incorporates spatiotemporal information gain (STIG) theory. The graph structure describing the spatiotemporal evolution relationship of information between wind farms (WFs) is constructed based on the spatiotemporal transfer relationship of power waveforms between WFs. An embedded graph attention network (EGAN) is proposed to learn STIG adjacency relationship among WFs, and a dynamic grouping scheme of redundant nodes in WFs based on STIG distance is constructed to reduce the modeling complexity. The proposed method is applied to the WFC of Inner Mongolia, China, and the results show that the NRMSE, NMAE, and MAPE of the proposed method are on average 2.63%, 2.09%, and 20.95% lower, and the R2 and Pr are on average 7.66% and 6.64% higher, respectively, compared with the rest of the comparison methods at all time scales.</description></item><item><title>Integrating Air-Source Heat Pumps into the Demand-Side Fast Frequency Response Service: A Study Based on Thermal Dynamic Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10669175</link><description>Fast frequency response services, designed to quickly balance the electrical grid within seconds, have a critical importance for managing sudden anomalies in low-inertia power systems. Battery systems often serve as versatile prosumers on the demand side to facilitate fast frequency response services. However, the nature of fast frequency response services leads to a highly fluctuating power profile for batteries, which can shorten their lifetime. In contrast, distributed air-source heat pumps in residential areas have a substantial untapped potential to support fast frequency response services. This paper seeks to integrate them into the existing services through a controller upgrade. We analyze the influence of air-source heat pumps' inherent complex thermal dynamics on fast frequency response services, revealing control challenges posed by unpredictable operating condition changes. Such a challenge is tackled with a standard droop control structure which is tuned through ${{H}_\infty }$ method, guaranteeing practical and stable operations within the permitted operating condition range. Finally, the proposed fast frequency response service scheme is tested through multiphysics simulations on a small-size low-inertia residential microgrid. The obtained results strongly supported the proposed new service.</description></item><item><title>Globally Optimal Distributed Operation of Integrated Electric and Heating Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10677480</link><description>Unit commitment (UC) is a key player in the coordinated operation of integrated energy systems. However, the participation of multiple market entities with widely different characteristics in large-scale energy systems has urged the critical need for the application of a distributed scheme to the UC problem. The NP-hard UC problem is a challenging mixed-integer programming problem. The presence of a large number of binary variables in the UC subproblems, which are solved by each participating entity after implementing the UC decomposition, fails to guarantee the convergence and the optimality of existing solution methods. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a distributed method, using logic-based Benders decomposition (LBBD), for the UC problem in a typical multi-entity system, i.e., integrated electric and heating system (IEHS). By searching the branch and bound tree of the district heating system (DHS) subproblem, the lower bound of its objective function is rigorously derived as a valid Benders cut to ensure the convergence to global optimal results. This distributed method is suitable for both deterministic and robust UC solutions. Numerical simulations are conducted on two test systems to demonstrate the performance of the proposed model and its distributed solution method.</description></item><item><title>Set-Valued Regression of Wind Power Curve</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10678875</link><description>Precise wind power curves are pivotal for monitoring the status of wind turbines and predicting wind power, which are important parts of utilizing wind energy in power systems. However, the data sets for training wind power curve models have a critical issue. A considerable proportion of the data sets is abnormal due to communication failure and other factors. Using the data sets with abnormal data will significantly deteriorate the fitting performance. This paper resolves the above issue by proposing a unified way to achieve abnormal data detection and curve fitting. Instead of regression with scalar output, set-valued regression of the wind power curve is considered, giving a set of wind power for a given wind speed. Interval neural network is adopted as the model for set-valued regression. A chance-constrained optimization problem is formulated to train an interval neural network. The obtained interval neural network can specify a subset with the normal data area, which can be used to give the threshold for abnormal data detection. Besides, the center points of the interval can be used as the fitted wind power curve. Since the formulated chance-constrained optimization problem is intractable, a sample-based sigmoidal approximation method is proposed to approximately solve it. The convergence and probabilistic feasibility of the approximation are given. Finally, experimental validations have been conducted to compare the proposed method with several existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Preserving Normal Power Curve Data With Sparse Density via Wind Speed-Power Correlation Trend Cleaning Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10678883</link><description>Stochastic wind conditions and curtailment lead to a sparse distribution of normal data compared to outliers on the Wind Power Curve (WPC). This results in the removal of sparse normal data during the data cleaning process, hampering short-term wind power assessment and forecasting. To address this issue, this paper proposes a decision boundary construction method that utilizes the wind speed-power correlation trend to retain normal WPC data. First, leveraging the positive correlation between wind speed and power, an incremental trend search strategy is used to obtain the trend curve. Building on this curve, a scatter motion trend algorithm is introduced to eliminate densely clustered curtailed power data. Finally, a kernel function-based 3-sigma boundary construction method is suggested to further reduce the influence of remaining clustered outliers on decision boundaries. The proposed method is compared to eight advanced algorithms using data from 17 wind turbines across three wind farms, demonstrating superior performance, especially in scenarios with sparse normal data.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Inertial Control for Wind Turbine Generators in Fast Frequency Response Based on the Power Reduction Period Assessment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10678806</link><description>Fast frequency response of wind turbine generators (WTGs) is achieved by injecting incremental power to the grid followed by power reductions to avoid over-deceleration and ensure secure rotor speed recovery. Second frequency deeps (SFDs) are the results of such power reductions that are challenging during abrupt frequency transients that may lead to under-frequency load shedding, or cascading events leading to blackouts. To address this issue, this paper presents an adaptive inertial control (AIC) scheme for WTGs designed to maximize the improvement in frequency nadir without causing SFD. The proposed method is developed through an assessment of power reduction period of WTGs during fast frequency response. This analysis investigates the impacts on the system frequency of a) injecting different shares of disturbance size (SoDSs) by WTGs and b) latency/delay in power injection. Derived from this analysis, the AIC is proposed to inject the maximum possible SoDS during the over-production period and successfully stabilize and recover the rotor speed during the assigned optimal power reduction period with SFDs disabled. This is achieved by adaptively adjusting the AIC in the reduction period based on the SoDS injected by WTGs during the over-production stage. Also, the AIC is modified to adapt against wind speed deviations. To evaluate the performance of the AIC, a comprehensive verification is carried out by comparing AIC with thirteen existing inertial control schemes and maximum power point tracking control in various cases using wind-integrated IEEE 39-bus system in Digsilent PowerFactory and real-time experimental tests. The results confirm the effectiveness of AIC in terms of achieving maximum improvement in frequency nadir without generating SFD.</description></item><item><title>Causal Mechanism-Enabled Zero-Label Learning for Power Generation Forecasting of Newly-Built PV Sites</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10679087</link><description>Power forecasting of newly built photovoltaic (PV) sites faces huge challenges owing to the lack of sufficient training samples. To this end, this paper proposes an unsupervised zero-label learning method for power generation forecasting of newly built PV sites without relying on any historical power output data. The main idea is to extract invariant causal structures across different PV sites and leverage this causality to enhance the power forecasting performance on the newly built ones. In particular, a causality-enabled domain adaptation network (CEDAN) is designed to capture the causal mechanism of PV generation from the multiple fine-grain segments of time-lagged data. It relaxes the causal relationships to an associative structure which is further concretized as attention score vectors through the designed intra- and inter-variable attention mechanisms. To quantify the distribution discrepancies between source and target domain causal structures, a specific domain adaptation loss function is designed for the optimization of CEDAN. It is further extended to a domain adaptation quantile loss to handle the uncertainties of PV power output. By jointly minimizing the domain adaptation loss and power forecasting error/conditional quantile loss, an invariant power generation causal mechanism across data domains for a newly built PV site can be learned. This allows the proposed method to achieve accurate and highly generalized power generation forecasting for newly built PV sites without relying on labeled data. Extensive experiments utilizing real PV generation data demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art transfer learning methods by 7.57% at least in deterministic forecasting and 8.37% at least in probabilistic forecasting.</description></item><item><title>Startup Control of Grid-Forming Offshore Wind Turbines Connected to the Diode-Rectifier-Based HVDC Link</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10680154</link><description>The Diode-Rectifier (DR) based HVDC has been considered as an economical solution to connect remote offshore wind turbines (WTs) to the onshore power grid. However, the DR is a passive device and cannot support the startup of the WTs. Therefore, it is worth finding an appropriate and cost-effective startup strategy for the DR-connected WTs. This paper investigates to use of wind energy to startup those WTs to avoid the need for additional grid support or the energy storage system, which can reduce the overall cost of such transmission system. The first challenge for this strategy is that the output active power of WTs can be extremely low during the startup process, which puts the WT rotor at a high risk of overspeed. Another challenge is to prevent power surges between synchronizing WTs. To address those issues, the pitch control has been innovated for the DR-connected WTs. In addition, a seamless synchronization control of the DR-connected WTs is proposed, which does not need the phase-locked-loop and can facilitate the whole startup process of the DR-connected WTs. The feasibility of these proposed control strategies for the startup of the DR-connected WTs is verified by comprehensive simulation studies.</description></item><item><title>Reliability-Based Planning of Cable Layout for Offshore Wind Farm Electrical Collector System Considering Post-Fault Network Reconfiguration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10681539</link><description>The electrical collector system (ECS) plays a crucial role in determining the performance of offshore wind farms (OWFs). Existing research has predominantly restricted ECS cable layouts to conventional radial or ring structures and employed graph theory heuristics for solutions. However, both economic efficiency and reliability of the OWFs heavily depend on their ECS structure, and the optimal ECS cable layout often deviates from typical configurations. In this context, this paper introduces a novel reliability-based ECS cable layout planning method for large-scale OWFs, employing a two-stage stochastic programming approach to address uncertainties of wind power and contingencies. To enhance reliability, the model incorporates optimal post-fault network reconfiguration strategies by adjusting wind turbine power supply paths through link cables. To tackle computation challenges arising from numerous contingency scenarios, a customized progressive contingency incorporation (CPCI) framework is developed to solve the model with higher efficiency by iteratively identifying non-trivial scenarios and solving the simplified problems. The convergence and optimality are theoretically proven. Numerical tests on several real-world OWFs validate the necessity of fully optimizing ECS structures and demonstrate the efficiency of the CPCI algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Transient Interaction Mechanism Analysis and Stability Control of Multi-Paralleled DFIG-Based WTs During Asymmetrical Grid Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10681307</link><description>In this article, from the perspective of DC-link voltage (DCV) control, the transient interaction mechanism of multi-paralleled doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbines (WTs) is investigated during asymmetrical grid faults. Firstly, considering the coupling characteristics of positive and negative sequence (PNS) components and the interaction characteristics between the rotor side converter (RSC) and grid side converter (GSC), a large-signal nonlinear model of multiple-parallel DFIG-based WTs in DC-link voltage control time-scale is obtained. Furthermore, by using the energy function method, the dynamic interaction mechanism of multiple-parallel DFIG-based WTs is analyzed. The influence of different parameters on the transient characteristics of DC-link voltage is analyzed by using phase trajectory diagram. The dominant factors affecting the transient stability of the WTs and stability level of DC-link voltage are obtained. In addition, considering the interaction among WTs, the dynamic interaction between RSC and GSC, as well as the requirement of grid codes, a transient stability optimization strategy during asymmetrical grid faults is proposed to improve the transient stability level of the DC-link voltage and the transient stability of multiple-parallel DFIG-based WTs. Finally, simulation and experimental results validate the correctness of theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Reactive Power Optimization for Flexible Distribution Networks With Successive Relaxation Iteration Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10682812</link><description>The flexible soft open point (SOP) connected to active distribution networks (ADNs) offers a promising manner of improving voltage and VAR control (VVC) by providing flexible power regulation. Due to the expansion of interconnective networks, the centralized optimization method has recently faced various challenges. This paper thus proposes a novel distributed coordinated reactive power optimization strategy for SOP-based multiregional ADNs based on local model decoupling and iterative interactions. By applying the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), the centralized VVC optimization problem is divided into several subproblems, allowing each area to optimize its local subproblem in a fully distributed manner. Multiple resources are thereby coordinated by the VVC, including both discrete and continuous devices. To ensure computability of both integer and non-convex problems, the relaxation iteration and successive linear approximation methods are nested to the ADMM framework, within this approach to allow ready solution to the distributed VVC optimization problem to be generated using a relaxation iterative algorithm, which significantly improves algorithm convergence and computational efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in this work using a modified IEEE standard interconnection system.</description></item><item><title>Fast Power Regulation Method During System Restoration for D-PMSG-Based Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10685139</link><description>The speed of the pitch action is one of the primary constraints that limit the power ramp rate of wind turbines (WTs). By storing kinetic energy (KE) within the wind wheel, blades, and generator rotor, the output power of the WT can be regulated more rapidly with less pitch action. This capability is beneficial in specific situations where additional power injection is required by the external system, such as during the system restoration process after a blackout. In this paper, a novel fast power regulation method for direct-drive PMSG-based (D-PMSG-based) WTs is proposed. This method allows for the early completion of the most time-consuming pitch reduction process and ensures that KE can be stored within the WT before the external system becomes available. As a result, the WT will be able to achieve maximum power output before the system restoration is fully completed. The potential operation boundary and the maximum external power support capability of D-PMSG-based WTs are analyzed. By following the operation boundary, converter modulation problem caused by high KE reserve can be avoided. The proposed fast power regulation method can significantly reduce the power increase speed and maximize the output power capability of D-PMSG-base WTs.</description></item><item><title>Research on PV Hosting Capacity of Distribution Networks Based on Data-Driven and Nonlinear Sensitivity Functions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693542</link><description>Voltage calculations are critical for assessing photovoltaic hosting capacity; however, acquiring precise parameters and the topology of the medium voltage distribution networks poses a significant challenge, thereby rendering traditional power flow computational methods ineffective. To address this issue, this paper introduces a hybrid method that utilizes a data-driven approach in conjunction with nonlinear functions to determine node voltages. Firstly, a deep neural network model for distribution network's power flow and voltage-power sensitivity analysis is established using historical data. This model captures the data-driven error, which reduces time consumption and increases accuracy. Secondly, a fourth-order Taylor expansion of power to voltage is derived based on the power flow mathematical equation to extrapolate voltage. This is necessary because when photovoltaic generators are connected to the nodes, the load data often exceeds the historical data range, rendering neural networks inapplicable. Finally, the sparrow search algorithm is employed to determine the hosting capacity. The proposed methods are validated using IEEE 33 and IEEE 69 case systems, demonstrating that the data-driven approach, combined with nonlinear functions, can ensure the accuracy in obtaining node voltage and the hosting capacity.</description></item><item><title>Analytical Evaluation to Power System Oscillation Damping Capability of DFIG-POD Based on Path Damping Torque Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693531</link><description>The increasing wind power decreases power system damping and may intensify low-frequency oscillation (LFO). The LFO are usually damped by the power system stabilizer (PSS) at synchronous generator (SG), and now by the power oscillation damper (POD) at doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG). The existing damping torque analysis (DTA) sets the parameters of the PSS and evaluates its damping capability, but can not be applied to the POD due to the difficulty of finding the damping path related to the DFIG and the coupling between the POD and the DFIG, which are studied in this paper. At first, the analytical expression of the coupling between the POD and DFIG is newly derived with linear fractional transformation (LFT) technique. Then the path damping torque analysis (PDTA) is proposed to reconstruct the damping path of the POD. Thirdly, the damping indicator based on the return difference matrix is proposed to evaluate the contribution of damping path to the LFO. Finally, numerical results of test system are given to validate effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed model, and parameter optimization to the multi-input POD (MIPOD) is performed to show the application value of the proposed model.</description></item><item><title>Spatiotemporal Adversarial Domain Generalization for Locating Subsynchronous Oscillation Sources Under Unseen Conditions in Large-Scale Renewable Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693450</link><description>Subsynchronous oscillations (SSOs) in renewable power systems have emerged as a major challenge, jeopardizing the stability and safety of power system operations. Thus, it is essential to accurately and timely locate SSO sources. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods for locating SSO sources have become increasingly popular, existing AI-based methods usually fail in practical applications due to unavailable or insufficient real-world SSO data for model training, and significant distribution gaps in samples under different operational conditions. They also fail to fully utilize the temporal characteristics of oscillations and the spatial topology of the system. Moreover, these methods only focus on locating either negative-damping-SSO or forced-SSO sources. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel strategy termed Spatiotemporal-Adversarial-Domain-Generalization (STADG) to locate oscillation sources in both SSO scenarios of real power systems. This method allows the model to train on multi-source domains (simplified-simulation power systems) with sufficient labeled samples, and to be directly applied to an unseen test target domain (real power system) under unknow operating conditions. The proposed approach employs a graph-attention network and a long-short-term-memory network to fully leverage spatial and temporal features of SSOs. Extensive experiments on the modified IEEE-39 and WECC-179 bus systems confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Two-Level Distributed Consensus Control of Multiple Wind Farms for Fast Frequency Support</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10694712</link><description>The neighboring wind farms have great frequency support potential. The wind turbine generators (WTGs) in these wind farms are influenced by wake effects and have different frequency support capabilities. In order to fully utilize the WTGs' support capabilities under different operating states, this paper proposes a two-level distributed consensus (TLDC) control to cooperate all the WTGs. Level I is leader-follower control, which is equipped within the wind farms. Level II is leaderless control which is used among the wind farms. This method is able to assign different values of power commands to different WTGs in the system to achieve better frequency support effect and stability. Based on MATLAB/Simulink and Opal-RT real-time simulation platforms, the two-area power system and Guangshui system (100% renewable energy power system) are analyzed, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed TLDC method has a better effect compared with other frequency support methods. It can also flexibly respond to communication interruptions and delays.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Stage Integrated Transmission and Distribution Expansion Planning Under Uncertainties With Smart Investment Options</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10694803</link><description>The shift towards a decentralized paradigm in power systems in response to decarbonization and deregulation efforts necessitates stronger coordination between transmission and distribution operators for cost-effective operation and planning. However, long-term uncertainties in the transition to net-zero are posing major challenges for decision-making. Moreover, literature has traditionally focused on the transmission and distribution expansion planning problems independently, as is customary in industry, leading to a lack of sophisticated integrated planning methods and inefficient expansion decisions in practice. This paper proposes a novel multi-stage stochastic programming framework for the integrated transmission and active distribution networks expansion planning under multi-dimensional uncertainties. Infrastructure investments are co-optimized with non-network alternatives with diverse techno-economic characteristics to support flexible planning. To manage the increased computational complexities, a machine learning-assisted multi-cut Benders decomposition approach is implemented. The case studies firstly highlight the strategic and economic advantages of the proposed multi-stage formulation, and then demonstrate the significant role and value of smart investment options in managing uncertainty. Lastly, the application of the proposed model on a study involving a 229-bus test system and 18 long-term scenarios validates its scalability and practical applicability.</description></item><item><title>Interaction Modeling and Stability Analysis of Grid-Forming Energy Storage System Based on SISO Transfer Functions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10700987</link><description>With the rapid expansion of photovoltaic (PV), grid-forming energy storage systems (GFM-ESS) have been widely employed for inertia response and voltage support to enhance the dynamic characteristics. Converters with different synchronization methods represent significant differences in dynamic behavior. The interactions between grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) devices with multi-time scale control may lead to small-signal instability in hybrid systems. This paper investigates a grid-connected system comprising a grid-forming energy storage system and a grid-following PV system (GFL-PV). Based on single-input-single-output (SISO) transfer functions, a dynamic interaction model for the PV-ESS system is established. Combining the open-loop transfer functions of full-loop and sub-loop, the proposed model reveals how GFM-ESS modifies the dynamic characteristics of GFL-PV under weak grid conditions. Subsequently, the impact of different control loops and parameters on the small-signal stability of the system is analyzed. The stability margins of both devices are also compared through the SISO model. Electromagnetic transient simulation results in MATLAB/Simulink and experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed models and analyses.</description></item><item><title>Impedance Characteristic Analysis and Phase-Locked Angle Feedforward-Based Stability Improvement for LCC-HVDC in Sending AC Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10704965</link><description>With the increasing penetration of wind power, the line-commutated converter-based high-voltage direct-current (LCC-HVDC) system in sending AC grid faces a potential risk of sub/super-synchronous oscillations (SSSOs), which threatens the stability of the power system. The impedance-based method is an effective way to analyze and suppress the SSSOs. However, since the effects of each control part in LCC-HVDC on the stability of sending AC grid are not yet well-investigated, there is a lack of theoretical guidance for implementing the impedance reshaping strategy for LCC-HVDC. Therefore, this paper establishes and analyzes the modular impedance model of LCC-HVDC, to elucidate the contribution of each control part and the interaction between different control loops. On this basis, an impedance reshaping strategy based on phase-locked angle feedforward (PAF) is proposed to improve system stability by attenuating the interaction. Compared to the existing virtual impedance-based method, the proposed PAF-based method addresses its possible failure in suppressing the SSSOs of sending AC grid. The theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the aforementioned conclusions and the effectiveness of the proposed impedance reshaping strategy.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Operation Flexibility in Modular Power to Hydrogen Based Ammonia Industries</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10706701</link><description>Modularization of Hydrogen Electrolyzers (HEs) is projected to be immediate, resilient, and efficient for load management in large-scale Hydrogen Consuming Industries (HCIs). It offers a scalable and flexible solution that can adapt to changes in hydrogen and power system demands. However, Modular HEs are studied primarily as small-scale wind hydrogen systems only, converting excess Renewable Energy (RE) into hydrogen without the integration of rigid downstream operations. Downstream constraints in HCIs, like rigid hydrogen demands, device operational/ramping limits, and storage constraints, can limit or regulate modular HE's use for power system services. Furthermore, oversimplified HE operational modeling within HCIs leads to suboptimal outcomes for integrated modular HCI and RE-rich power system (RPS) operations, resulting in RE curtailments and inaccurate flexibility estimations. This happens due to improper loading rates arising from unrealistic inter and intra-modular HE operations. This work proposes a comprehensive model for modular HE management in integrated ammonia (HCI) and power systems for flexibility in sector-coupled scenarios. The work considers and demonstrates how downstream constraints regulate HEs flexibility through a unit commitment problem framework. HE operations with detailed and extended electrochemical dynamics are considered to improve and enhance operational flexibility calculations of growing RPS-based modular HCIs. This allows for better sectoral integration and estimation of power system services.</description></item><item><title>An Overvoltage-Averse Model for Renewable-Rich AC/DC Distribution Networks Considering the Sensitivity of Voltage Violation Probability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10709908</link><description>The increasing renewable generation increase the probability of voltage violation. The spatial and temporal power transfer can be achieved in AC/DC distribution networks based on voltage source converters (VSCs) and energy storage (ES), which can effectively avoid system voltage violation. However, the existing voltage violation mitigation methods in uncertain scenarios are either limited by the long solution time or complex modeling, which are difficult to meet the overvoltage probability reduction requirements of intra-day dispatch. In addition, the power transfer will simultaneously affect interconnected systems because the power is coupled through the VSCs. Overvoltage probability reduction on one line may lead to an increase on the other. This paper proposes a two-stage overvoltage-averse model considering the sensitivity of voltage violation probability. The proposed method analytically depicts the impact of power adjustment on the system overvoltage probability. The day-ahead optimization model is established as chance-constrained model. The intra-day optimization model is established as a quadratic convex model, which can be efficiently solved. Simulation results verify that the method proposed can effectively achieve the overvoltage probability reduction of renewable-rich AC/DC distribution networks.</description></item><item><title>A Mimicking-Avoiding Short-Term Probabilistic Power Forecasting Method for Wave Energies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10709879</link><description>Wave energy is essential for sustainable marine development. However, complex marine weather conditions cause fluctuating wave power outputs, resulting in a mimicking phenomenon in predictions. Moreover, the lack of accurate numerical weather prediction (NWP) data sources aggravates the prediction inaccuracy. To address these obstacles, a series characteristic perception (SCP) method coordinated with an advanced hybrid model, the quantile liberty loss gated recurrent unit kernel density estimation (QLB-GRU-KDE), is proposed for the floating point absorber wave energy system. In the first stage, the SCP method gains prior knowledge via ensemble approaches. In the second stage, a liberty loss function is used to mitigate the mimicking phenomenon. Furthermore, a hybrid model that integrates a GRU and KDE is adopted for the probabilistic forecasting of wave energy generation. In addition, a metric is proposed to evaluate the severity of the mimicking. A case study based on a real-world wave dataset is conducted, where both deterministic and probabilistic prediction approaches are examined. Comparisons with the cutting-edge counterparts reveal that the designed liberty loss effectively mitigates the mimicking issue. The comprehensive performance of the proposed model, including the accuracy, stability, reliability and sharpness in wave power prediction, is validated by multiple metrics.</description></item><item><title>Approximate Optimal Energy Management of Thermal-HESS System for MIMO Fuzzy Logic Controller Based AGC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10710156</link><description>Compared to one-type of energy storage device, hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) offer benefits for Auto generation control (AGC) command tracking and can reduce investment in energy storage. Traditional control method, although effective in meeting the matching of AGC commands at a specific moment, often lacks coordination across multiple time intervals, resulting in frequent and irregular charging/ discharging which reduces the overall lifetime. To address this, this paper presents an approximate optimal operation strategy for Thermal-HESS system, aiming to enhance the AGC performance of the generating unit and improve the energy management capability of the HESSs. Firstly, an auto-adjust Markov Chain prediction method is proposed to forecast the power demand of the AGC command tracking to determine power demand's tendency. Secondly, a stochastic model predictive control (SMPC)-based optimal model, which considers the current step and cost-to-go function, is proposed. However, the SMPC based model is multiple-step optimal operational problem, which will increase the computational burden of the controller. Therefore, this paper further designs a Multiple-Input-Multiple-output (MIMO) fuzzy logic controller to approximate the optimal alternative to the cost-to-go function of SMPC model, meeting the computational and application requirements more effectively. Finally, numerical case studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in AGC command tracking and HESSs energy management.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Resilience of Urban Electric-Road-Metro Interdependent Network Considering Electric Bus Scheduling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10711253</link><description>With the increasing electrification of urban transportation, urban power and traffic systems are highly coupled and influence each other, leading to a challenge for the post-event resilience enhancement of urban electric-traffic interdependent network (ETIN). In this context, we propose a multi-layer electric-metro-road interdependent network where the metro network (MN) depends on the distribution power network (DPN) and interacts with the road traffic network (RTN) synchronously. Electric buses (EBs), as one public dispatchable resource, are considered and explored to provide bridging routes for disabled MNs and supply power for failed DPNs, with consideration of three different service trips, i.e., the original trip, bridging trip, and charge-discharge trip. On this basis, a spatio-temporal network-based EB route schedule model is constructed. To consider the evacuation demand of affected MN routes, a fast DPN restoration strategy is proposed to minimize the time cost of lost load by integrating the network reconfiguration with the collaborative allocation of repair crews (RCs) and EBs. Finally, a distributed method is further devised for the coordination among different stakeholders. The proposed method is verified on two electric-traffic systems to show that the collaborative scheduling of RCs and EBs can effectively enhance the resilience of ETIN under metro service disruptions.</description></item><item><title>An Integrated Sparse Gated Graph Density Network Based on Transfer Learning for Multi-Site Probabilistic Forecasting of Renewable Energy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10714034</link><description>Large-scale new energy grid-connected poses significant challenges to the safe and efficient operation of smart grids. Renewable energy probabilistic forecasting (REPF) technology can analyze uncertainties in power generation, quantitatively balance risks, and prevent the breakdown of the grid. However, current REPF methods reliant on spatio-temporal maps fail to accurately estimate the probability density function (PDF) of renewable energy, resulting lacking comprehensive uncertainty analysis for distributed power generation systems (DPGS). To fill this gap, in this study, an integrated sparse gated graph density network (ISGGDN) that incorporates transfer learning to tackle the REPF challenge. A sparse gated graph dynamic convolutional network based on cross attention and residual connection is developed, which can effectively extract spatial features and spatio-temporal interactions between sites and improve the accuracy of probabilistic prediction. Furthermore, to effectively identify the types of features lost during the transfer process and to enhance the transfer learning (TL) capability, we developed an integrated approach involving multiple fine-tuning strategies based on TL. We evaluated the proposed model using wind and photovoltaic (PV) power generation data from two neighboring multi-sites, and the experimental results demonstrate that ISGGDN outperforms other existing solutions in terms of accuracy and effectiveness in REPF.</description></item><item><title>Aggregating Large-Scale Residential Users for Regulation Reserve Provision: Truthful Combinatorial Auction Based Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10715698</link><description>The proliferation of flexible loads has empowered residential users in contributing both upward and downward frequency regulation reserves to the power grid. Due to barriers like minimum bid size, residential users with relatively small power consumption must be aggregated before they can enter the reserve market. However, the large number of residential users renders the aggregation mechanism design problem a challenging task. In particular, the cost for reserve provision of each user is not only highly heterogeneous, but also coupled through both the temporal dimension and the up/down regulation direction. In order to allow the users to fully express their costs, in this paper, we propose a combinatorial reverse auction (CRA) framework as the market mechanism for user aggregation. In this auction, the aggregator is the auctioneer and procures reserves from residential users. The users submit package bids consisting of combinations of both upward and downward reserves over multiple time-slots, capturing the coupling in the user cost. Furthermore, to address the infamous computational challenges of large-scale combinatorial auctions, we develop a novel fast combinatorial auction (FCA) mechanism that can be solved in polynomial time. It includes an approximate winner determination algorithm and a critical payment scheme. Notably, our proposed mechanism is rigorously proved to possess desirable economic properties such as truthfulness and individual rationality. Extensive simulations have validated the theoretic properties of the proposed CRA mechanism and its advantages over existing methods. In particular, compared with the widely employed truthful Vickery-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, CRA can be $10^{4}$ times faster than VCG when the user number is above 1000. Meanwhile, it is able to achieve near-optimal social cost, where the average optimality loss is 2.92%.</description></item><item><title>Coordinated Planning for Stability Enhancement in High IBR-Penetrated Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10716464</link><description>Security and stability challenges in future power systems with high penetration Inverter-Based Resources (IBR) have been anticipated as one of the main barriers to decarbonization. Grid-following IBRs may become unstable under small disturbances in weak grids, while during transient processes, system stability and protection may be jeopardized due to the lack of sufficient Short-Circuit Current (SCC). To solve these challenges and achieve decarbonization, the future system has to be carefully planned. However, it remains unclear how both small-signal and transient stabilities can be considered during the system planning stage. In this context, this paper proposes a coordinated planning model of different resources in the transmission system, namely the synchronous condensers and GFM IBRs to enhance system stability. The system strength and SCC constraints are analytically derived by considering the different characteristics of synchronous units and IBRs, which are further effectively linearized through a novel data-driven approach, where an active sampling method is proposed to generate a representative data set. The significant economic value of the proposed coordinated planning framework in both system asset investment and system operation is demonstrated through detailed case studies.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Swing PLL Synchronization Transient Stability of Grid-Connected Paralleled Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10720168</link><description>During grid faults, the grid-connected paralleled converter systems is susceptible to a phase-locked loop (PLL) synchronization transient instability. Most existing studies focus on first-swing transient stability analysis using the equal-area criterion. However, achieving first-swing transient stability does not guarantee overall stability, as the system may still experience multi-swing transient instability. This paper analyzes the type of multi-swing transient instability issue from two aspects: transient instability mechanism and transient stability assessment. Firstly, the mechanism of multi-swing transient instability is revealed from the transient energy conversion point of view. Then, considering transient interactions between converters, the largest estimated domain of attraction (LEDA) is constructed utilizing the Takagi-Sugeno method. Using the LEDA, the multi-swing transient instability problem of the grid-connected paralleled converter systems is quantitatively analyzed. Finally, the theoretical results are verified based on the RT-LAB hardware-in-the-loop experimental platform.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Planning of Multi-Microgrid System With Shared Energy Storage Based on Capacity Leasing and Energy Sharing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10660302</link><description>Microgrids (MGs) are important forms of supporting the efficient utilization of distributed renewable energy resources (RES). To achieve high proportion penetration of distributed RES and improve the system efficiency, this paper focuses on the multi-microgrid (MMG) system with shared energy storage (SES) and an optimal planning method of MMG system with capacity leasing and energy sharing for PV carrying capability enhancement is proposed. Firstly, a collaborative optimization framework between the multi-microgrid operator (MMGO) and the shared energy storage operator (SESO) is proposed. Secondly, the PV carrying capability index is proposed from two dimensions: the hosting capability and the accommodation capability, and the capacity planning model of the MMG system considering PV carrying capability index is established. Then, the capacity leasing and energy sharing model among MGs as well as between MMG systems and SES system is established. Based on this, a collaborative capacity planning model of MMGO and SESO with the Nash Bargaining game is developed and a distributed solution algorithm is designed. Finally, through a comprehensive case study we can draw that, the proposed planning method with capacity leasing and energy sharing can enhance PV carrying capability of the MMG system while improving economics of MMGO and SESO.</description></item><item><title>Enabling High-Efficiency Economic Dispatch of Hybrid AC/DC Networked Microgrids: Steady-State Convex Bi-Directional Converter Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10666856</link><description>The use of bi-directional converters (BDCs) is crucial for enhancing power exchange in hybrid AC/DC networked microgrids (NMGs). However, the dynamic nature of their conversion efficiency and the non-convex conversion direction expression of BDC models result in a highly non-convex programming problem, which leads to significant computational challenges. This paper proposes a least squares approximation approach to simplify the complex trigonometric function that characterizes the dynamic changes in BDC conversion efficiency with power. The simplified expression transforms the original non-convex relationship into a computationally efficient convex form. Subsequently, we systematically explore and validate the sufficient conditions to achieve non-simultaneous rectification and inversion behaviors of BDCs in a convex form. These explored conditions are further customized and extended to various practical application scenarios. Case studies are conducted on a hybrid AC/DC NMG with 66 nodes. The results demonstrate that our proposed least squares approximation method transforms the computationally intractable model into one that is solvable. Additionally, the explored conditions contribute to a substantial reduction in solution time by more than two orders of magnitude. These results verify the superiority of our proposed method, and showcase its applicability in practical scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Incipient Fault Detection of Medium-Voltage Distribution Cable Systems Using Time-Frequency Analysis of Grounding Wire Currents</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10637287</link><description>Incipient cable faults pose a significant risk to the normal operation of power grids. Addressing the issue of detecting incipient faults in underground cables is particularly difficult due to their hidden external characteristics that are not easily observable. Furthermore, these faults occur randomly, with short durations, which further complicates their detection. This paper firstly establishes a cable field-circuit equivalent model that considers multi-conductor electromagnetic coupling for incipient faulty scenarios. The mathematical relationship between the grounding wire currents (GWCs) and fault conditions is then theoretically deduced specifically. A novel method is developed to detect incipient faults in three-core cables by analyzing the time-frequency characteristics of GWC frequency components considering the time-varying fault resistance. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, showing little impact from fault initial conditions, disturbances, and distributed generations (DGs). Finally, the method is verified in an actual 10 kV distribution network.</description></item><item><title>Tensor Convolution-Based Aggregated Flexibility Estimation in Active Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10663439</link><description>Power system operators require advanced applications in the control centers to tackle increasingly variable power transfers effectively. One urgently needed application concerns estimating the feasible available aggregated flexibility from a power system network, which can be effectively deployed to mitigate issues in interconnected networks. This paper proposes the TensorConvolution+ algorithm to address the above application. Unlike related literature approaches, TensorConvolution+ estimates the density of feasible flexibility combinations to reach a new operating point within the p-q flexibility area. This density can improve the decision-making of system operators for efficient and safe flexibility deployment. The proposed algorithm applies to radial and meshed networks, is adaptable to new operational conditions, and can consider scenarios with disconnected flexibility areas. Using convolutions and tensors, the algorithm efficiently aggregates the combinations of flexibility providers&#8217; adjustable power output that can occur for each flexibility area set point. Simulations on the meshed Oberrhein and radial CIGRE test networks illustrate the effectiveness of TensorConvolution+ for flexibility estimation with high numerical confidence and a minor computing effort. Additional simulations highlight how system operators can interpret the estimated density of feasible flexibility combinations for decision-making purposes, the algorithm&#8217;s capability to estimate disconnected flexibility areas, and adapt to new operating conditions.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Coordinated Scheduling of Port Integrated Energy System and Bulk Terminal With Two-Tier Incentives</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10637267</link><description>Given the increasing energy interconnection and coupling between port integrated energy system (PIES) and bulk terminal, this paper proposes a coordinated scheduling strategy to realize the potential of their coordination to improve energy efficiency and operational benefits of PIES. First, a coordination framework of energy system operators (ESO), logistics system operators (LSO), and infrastructure operators (IO) with two-tier incentives (TTI) is constructed to enable LSO and IO to coordinate ESO to cope with demand response incentives (DRI) set by the power grid. By analyzing the operating load characteristics of facilities in bidirectional bulk cargo logistics (BBCL) and the energy use comfort characteristics of infrastructure loads at bulk terminal, the scheduling models of ESO, LSO, and IO are then constructed. A mixed-integer two-level optimization model based on analytical target cascading (ATC) is developed to realize a decentralized autonomy and coordinated solution of the scheduling models. And an efficient LSO scheduling based on parallel machine scheduling (PMS) is built to further improve the solution efficiency of the optimization model. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy to improve the economic benefits of each operator and increase the energy efficiency of PIES.</description></item><item><title>Stochastic-Robust Planning of Networked Hydrogen-Electrical Microgrids: A Study on Induced Refueling Demand</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10659235</link><description>Hydrogen-electrical microgrids are increasingly assuming an important role on the pathway toward decarbonization of energy and transportation systems. This paper studies networked hydrogen-electrical microgrids planning (NHEMP), considering a critical but often-overlooked issue, i.e., the demand-inducing effect (DIE) associated with infrastructure development decisions. Specifically, higher refueling capacities will attract more refueling demand of hydrogen-powered vehicles (HVs). To capture such interactions between investment decisions and induced refueling demand, we introduce a decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) set and build a trilevel stochastic-robust formulation. The upper-level determines optimal investment strategies for hydrogen-electrical microgrids, the lower-level optimizes the risk-aware operation schedules across a series of stochastic scenarios, and, for each scenario, the middle-level identifies the &#8220;worst&#8221; situation of refueling demand within an individual DDU set to ensure economic feasibility. Then, an adaptive and exact decomposition algorithm, based on Parametric Column-and-Constraint Generation (PC&amp;amp;CG), is customized and developed to address the computational challenge and to quantitatively analyze the impact of DIE. Case studies on an IEEE exemplary system validate the effectiveness of the proposed NHEMP model and the PC&amp;amp;CG algorithm. It is worth highlighting that DIE can make an important contribution to the economic benefits of NHEMP, yet its significance will gradually decrease when the main bottleneck transits to other system restrictions.</description></item><item><title>Asynchronous Communication-Based Distributed Control Strategy for ON/OFF State Thermostatically Controlled Loads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10636803</link><description>Thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) obtain significant potential for providing auxiliary services to the power grid. Aggregators typically utilize centralized strategies when implementing direct load control (DLC) to manage TCLs, but these strategies consume substantial communication resources when dealing with large-scale TCLs. This paper proposes a distributed control strategy for ON/OFF state TCLs to alleviate the aggregator&#8217;s communication burden. The concept of temperature-based priority is introduced to ensure fair scheduling among TCLs. TCLs can determine their priority order in the cluster by communicating with neighboring TCLs and locally decide their operation states to achieve reference power tracking. A sub-priorities splitting method is introduced to further enhance power tracking accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed strategy utilizes an asynchronous communication mechanism in the coordination process, making it highly suitable for practical implementation. The study conducts numerical simulations and semi-physical experiments to validate the practical feasibility of the proposed strategy. The results conclusively demonstrate that the proposed strategy can effectively achieve accurate reference power tracking by the TCLs cluster.</description></item><item><title>Coordinative Operating Strategy of Grid-Interactive FTPSS-HST for Cost-Efficient Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10640147</link><description>The expansion of high-speed railways (HSR) has led to a surge in railway electricity demand, especially in Europe and East Asia. To address this issue, traction-power-supply systems (TPSS) that consist entirely of railway loads, are being upgraded to flexible-TPSSs (FTPSS) that incorporate distributed energy resources (DER). Since high-speed trains (HSTs) have the potential to enhance the system flexibility by utilizing their controllable power, integrating HSTs and FTPSS presents an opportunity to further improve the system economy and flexibility. In this paper, FTPSS and HSTs are integrated to form a grid-interactive railway power system for the first time. Further, the coordinative operation including trajectory control of HST and energy management of FTPSS is proposed. To improve the cost-efficiency rate, a microscopic kinetic-electric model of HST is established to characterize its energy conversion process and dynamic power. Additionally, the time-domain model of the system is transformed into the space-domain model using state transformation according to HST displacement. On this basis, the hp-adaptive spatial-pseudospectral method is developed. This method can capture the spatiotemporal conditions of the power and railway systems and is suitable for the operating characteristics of HST. The real-data simulation verifies that the proposed method significantly improves the economic benefits of HSR operation under grid interactive operation.</description></item><item><title>Source-Load Collaborative Frequency Control With Real-Time Optimality in Power Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10666801</link><description>With the increasing uncertainties on both supply and demand sides, how to improve the performance of the current multiple time-scales frequency control architecture is the main focus of this study. Inspired by reverse- and forward-engineering, we propose a novel frequency control scheme based on existing distributed control mechanisms to restore the frequency after disturbances while achieving global economic efficiency. We bridge the time gap between conventional secondary frequency control and economic dispatch. On the load side, after showing that the physical network dynamics can solve well-defined optimal load control problems, we develop a fully decentralized frequency controller that realizes system-wide economic objectives solely based on local measurement. On the generation side, we design a distributed control mechanism so that each bus can automatically track the most economically efficient operating points while realizing frequency recovery. A substitution method is proposed to remove disturbances from the update procedure of auxiliary variables. We characterize the equilibrium and establish the asymptotical convergence of the overall system based on optimization techniques. Finally, a numerical test is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Approach for Modeling Spatial and Temporal Correlations of PV Generation Applied to Prosumer Virtual Power Plants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10640112</link><description>Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) play a crucial role in the increasing grid and market integration of distributed energy resources. However, as VPP complexity and geographic scale increase, the variable nature of PV generation makes accurate prediction of the VPP aggregate output challenging. The problem is further exacerbated by the paucity of smart meter data, making some prosumers unobservable to the VPP aggregator. To address these challenges, we propose a Bayesian Vector Autoregression approach to quantify the generation variance of a VPP consisting of an aggregation of residential rooftop PV systems spread over a large geographical area. The key idea is to generate synthetic data for unobserved prosumers using observed prosumers&#8217; local correlation microstructure and temporal cross-correlation, allowing the simulation of the VPP output. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach by using two different Australian data sets. We study two use cases, considering the impact of the level of prosumer observability and the VPP size on the variance of the aggregate VPP output. Compared to the existing approaches, the proposed nonparametric approach provides a more accurate forecast of VPP output variance, allowing the VPP operator to manage market risk better.</description></item><item><title>Supply Resilience Constrained Scheduling of MEGs for Distribution System Restoration: A Stochastic Model and FW-PH Algorithm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643213</link><description>Mobile emergency generators (MEGs) are critical resources for distribution system restoration after disaster- induced outages. However, insufficient fuel storage can cause MEGs to cease operation, leading to secondary interruptions of restored services. To enhance supply resilience, we include fuel tank (FT) dispatch as part of the MEG-aid restoration strategy. An integrated sequential service restoration model is developed to optimize the spatiotemporal travel behavior of MEGs and FTs, restoration paths, and load pickup sequences in the distribution network. To account for uncertain distribution line faults and traffic congestion, a stochastic programming approach is used. The proposed method optimally prepositions MEGs and routes them to target locations to restore critical loads by gradually forming microgrids. Moreover, the FTs in the transportation network are scheduled to ensure adequate fuel for the uninterrupted and reliable operation of MEGs. The presence of both uncertainty and discreteness presents computational challenges to the stochastic mixed-integer programming model. Thus, a distributed algorithm that combines the progressive hedging and Frank-Wolfe methods is applied to enhance computational efficiency while ensuring global convergence. Simulation results showed the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the reliability of restoration schemes and computational efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Research on Active Protection Method for Microgrids Based on Harmonic Injection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10663462</link><description>With the increasing penetration of inverter interfaced distributed generators (IIDGs) in microgrids, traditional protection schemes are difficult to cope with the complexities of microgrids. Harmonic-injected protection schemes based on power electronic devices can simplify the harmonic component equivalent network of the microgrid into a single-source radial structure. However, the performance of these schemes is degraded by the shunt effect of the non-harmonic injection source IIDGs and the utility grid. This paper focuses on the active protection method for microgrids based on harmonic injection. A fault control strategy based on harmonic current control and principles for PCC filter parameter design are proposed to address the shunt effect. With the proposed strategy, harmonic currents of varying frequencies are injected into the microgrid by the IIDGs, and the major portion of the injected harmonic currents can flow to the fault point. By analyzing the fault characteristics, a fault location method based on harmonic injection is proposed. Finally, simulation analysis is carried out on MATLAB/Simulink platform, and the effectiveness of the proposed active protection scheme is verified by the results.</description></item><item><title>Small-Sample Event Identification Based on Adaptive Second-Order MDF and Triplet CNNs Using Distribution-Level Synchronized Measurements</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10666857</link><description>Distribution-level synchronized measurements serve as a valuable resource for event-type identification. The precision in identifying events offers crucial information for fault analysis, asset monitoring, state estimation, and ensuring the reliability of power delivery. Currently, a major issue in the event identification task arises from the scarcity and imbalance of event samples, attributed to the brief installation period of the distribution-level synchrophasor measurement system. To address this, a novel few-shot learning event identification method is proposed in this paper. The Adaptive Second-order Motif Difference Field (A2-MDF) is developed for feature transformation, which allows extracting higher-order patterns and structural information from time series data into images to extract fused features at different time scales. A dual strategy involving sample enhancement through Data Augmented Generative Adversarial Networks (DA-GAN) and sample balancing via Random Under Sampling (RUS) is also developed to mitigate the issues associated with sample scarcity and imbalance across different event types. Finally, a triplet network employing three Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is proposed for classification in small-sample scenarios. Results using both simulation and field data demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method with limited labelled data.</description></item><item><title>Fog-Computing-Based Joint Flow Calculation Method of Coupled Power and Transportation Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10634988</link><description>In recent years, the rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) has led to frequent interactions and tight coupling of the power distribution network (PDN) and transportation network (TN). To effectively analyze the dynamic interactions between PDN and TN, this paper proposes a joint traffic-power flow calculation method using a fog computing architecture, which combines macroscopic traffic flows with microscopic individual vehicle characteristics, improving the link transmission model to describe the dynamic traffic transmission among links in TN and between charging stations (CSs) and TN, as well as the dynamic charging and queuing process of EVs at CSs. Moreover, this paper develops a travel time estimation model and an energy consumption estimation model for EVs, effectively describing the dynamic power transmission among EVs, CSs, and PDN. Numerical results show that the method can effectively capture the spatio-temporal interactions among PDN, TN, CSs, and EVs, even under system incidents. The scalability and computational efficiency of this method are demonstrated through testing on a large-scale coupled network.</description></item><item><title>Developing a Security Metric for Assessing the Power Grid&#8217;s Posture Against Attacks From EV Charging Ecosystem</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10664647</link><description>Providing reliable and efficient services for EV users necessitates the use of cyber layers on top of physical layers in EV ecosystems. The deployment of such cyber layers, however, makes these ecosystems an appealing target for various cyber-attacks&#8212;e.g., data manipulation, malware injection, and intrusions&#8212;which are crafted to deteriorate the operation of power distribution networks. On this basis, this paper develops a metric that captures the security posture of EV ecosystems, considering the possible attacks and their associated impacts on distribution grids. First, potential attack graphs are obtained to show the connections between the adversaries&#8217; access points and the consequences of attack vectors. Then, a Markov decision process (MDP) tree is generated, using probabilities of adversaries&#8217; success rates for a specific attack vector and unique reward functions. The developed MDP tree is then resolved by a policy iteration algorithm to calculate the value function of each state, related subsequent adversarial actions from the attackers&#8217; viewpoint, and quantify the security posture of each state. Finally, using the obtained metric, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained offline to notify the distribution system operators (DSOs) of the security status of EV ecosystems, i.e., secure and alarm situations. DSOs can use the developed security metrics to design consequent corrective actions during critical cyber attacks. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed security metric in quantifying the security status of the grid, a cyber-physical testbed is built. This testbed integrates a virtual sphere (vSphere) to simulate the cyber parts of the EV ecosystem as well as a real-time simulator to model two distribution networks, i.e., IEEE 33- and 141-bus, under DSO control center based on IEC 61850. For a distribution network with dynamic sections that can be created using the operation of tie-switches, a supplementary strategy has also been suggested. This strategy is evaluated under the IEEE 69-bus distribution network to calculate the related security metric and update the security monitoring framework.</description></item><item><title>Power Line Monitoring-Based Consensus Algorithm for Performance Enhancement of Energy Blockchain Applications in Smart Grid 2.0</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643430</link><description>Energy blockchain applications are becoming inevitable with the transformation of electricity distribution networks into the decentralized Smart Grid 2.0 architecture. The scalability of the blockchain platform plays a key role in catering to the increasing number of nodes connected due to consumer-turned-prosumers being integrated into the distribution grid in a distributed manner. Hence, this study aims to optimize blockchain utilization for Smart Grid 2.0 applications through a novel consensus mechanism, which eliminates the requirement for performing additional complex computations to mine a new block. The algorithm utilizes the grid monitoring process through the existing smart meters, and thus has been capable of reducing the energy footprint for block mining to a fraction of that of the legacy Proof-of-Work algorithm, and reducing the block creation time by  $\sim \lt 60\%$ . The proposed Power Line Monitoring-based Consensus Mechanism (PLMC) algorithm is validated using the Process Analysis Toolkit (PAT). In addition, data collected while monitoring the network for block mining is utilized for power quality measurement purposes.</description></item><item><title>Network Sustainability Enhancement Through Optimal Fairness Management for Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10659185</link><description>In a prosumer rich environment, most of the peers are likely to be equipped with distributed resources based facilities, this results in network sustainability enhancement if the fairness of energy trading be optimally managed through the network. Developing a decentralized energy pricing methodology while considering the proper arrangement of the network is inevitable. This paper proposes a new approach for conducting effective negotiations between peers in a novel peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture to contrive a fair energy trading mechanism by enhancing the authority of benefiting the grid for all peers through their transactions. The proposed methodology increases the market participants&#8217; welfare as well as improves the system&#8217;s operational conditions and derives a dynamic network usage price (NUP) in contrast to conventional P2P and available works. Also, fairness in energy trading is developed here for P2P trading by addressing the derived network utilization welfare function in which those transactions that impose negative impacts on the network condition are effectively prevented to enhance the fairness of the grid without sacrificing accessibility to generation for demands. Requiring low computational burdens as well as low information exchange are other innovations that are achieved by implementing the proposed algorithms. The effectiveness and performance of the proposed approach are verified by means of extensive simulation studies and the obtained results show fast convergence, scalability, readily implemented, and guaranteeing maximum peer&#8217;s welfare as well as optimal network fairness of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>DST-GNN: A Dynamic Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network for Cyberattack Detection in Grid-Tied Photovoltaic Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638139</link><description>The increasing deployment of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in the electric grid, aimed at addressing the energy crisis and surging power demands, has expanded the potential vulnerability to cyberattacks due to the inter-networking of the grid-connected power electronics converters. In this paper, we propose a dynamic spatiotemporal graph neural network (DST-GNN) for cyberattack detection in grid-tied PV systems. Specifically, to exploit the inherent graph topology of the grid-tied PV system, we start by employing a GNN with a dynamic weighted adjacency matrix to capture the latent spatial correlations within signal data. Then, a one-dimensional convolution neural network (1D-CNN) is utilized to extract the underlying temporal patterns. Notably, we leverage the system dynamics to determine the dynamic graph weights and the number of graph convolution layers, while the hyper-parameters of 1D-CNN are designed based on the periodicity of input signals. Finally, the integration of the priori physical system knowledge further enhances the interpretability and improves the detection performance of DST-GNN. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that embeds the grid-tied PV system into a graph structure for cyberattack detection. The effectiveness of DST-GNN is evaluated through comprehensive case studies on a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) grid-tied PV testbed, and numerical results demonstrate its superiority over baseline methods.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Preserving Power Flow Analysis via Secure Multi-Party Computation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10667665</link><description>Smart grids feature a bidirectional flow of electricity and data, enhancing flexibility, efficiency, and reliability in increasingly volatile energy grids. However, data from smart meters can reveal sensitive private information. Consequently, the adoption of smart meters is often restricted via legal means and hampered by limited user acceptance. Since metering data is beneficial for fault-free grid operation, power management, and resource allocation, applying privacy-preserving techniques to smart metering data is an important research problem. This work addresses this by using secure multi-party computation (SMPC), allowing multiple parties to jointly evaluate functions of their private inputs without revealing the latter. Concretely, we show how to perform power flow analysis on cryptographically hidden prosumer data. More precisely, we present a tailored solution to the power flow problem building on an SMPC implementation of Newton&#8217;s method. We analyze the security of our approach in the universal composability framework and provide benchmarks for various grid types, threat models, and solvers. Our results indicate that secure multi-party computation can be able to alleviate privacy issues in smart grids in certain applications.</description></item><item><title>Decision-Oriented Modeling of Thermal Dynamics Within Buildings</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638763</link><description>To enhance the quality of energy management tasks, accurately representing the thermal dynamics of buildings is crucial. Traditional methods aim to improve the building model in regards to an arbitrary statistical metric, before feeding the trained model to the optimization-based energy management process. In this paper, we advocate for a more integrated approach, consisting of incorporating the downstream optimization directly into the training pipeline. The goal is to improve the building model in strategic operating zones, where the greatest impact on decision-making will be achieved. To that end, we first formulate the thermal dynamics as ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using neural networks. The model parameters are then updated through an end-to-end gradient-based training strategy wherein the downstream optimization is used as the loss function. To increase the robustness of the approach, the proposed loss is combined with traditional physics-informed accuracy-oriented training, employing a novel coordinated gradient descent algorithm. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed modeling method, regarding both the optimality of decisions and their physical interpretability.</description></item><item><title>Seamless and Multi-Resolution Energy Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643199</link><description>Forecasting is pivotal in energy systems, by providing fundamentals for operation at different horizons and resolutions. Though energy forecasting has been widely studied for capturing temporal information, very few works concentrate on the frequency information provided by forecasts. They are consequently often limited to single-resolution applications (e.g., hourly). Here, we propose a unified energy forecasting framework based on Laplace transform in the multi-resolution context. The forecasts can be seamlessly produced at different desired resolutions without re-training or post-processing. Case studies on both energy demand and supply data show that the forecasts from our proposed method can provide accurate information in both time and frequency domains. Across the resolutions, the forecasts also demonstrate high consistency. More importantly, we explore the operational effects of our produced forecasts in the day-ahead and intra-day energy scheduling. The relationship between (i) errors in both time and frequency domains and (ii) operational value of the forecasts is analyzed. Significant operational benefits are obtained.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Transient Dynamics Stabilization in Islanded Microgrids Through Adaptive and Hierarchical Data-Driven Predictive Droop Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10665992</link><description>The transient dynamics of microgrids is primarily impacted by low-inertia power electronic interfaces, energy generation of distributed energy resources (DERs), load demand fluctuations, and the control strategies employed for system integration. This paper focuses on the enhancement of the transient dynamics to achieve a stable steady-state operation for the microgrid by minimizing the overall islanded system&#8217;s frequency deviations. A modularized physics-informed sparse identification technique is developed for system identification that can accurately predict the future states of the microgrid with interconnected DERs. The data-driven prediction model is then incorporated into the model predictive control framework to generate an optimal control input that can augment with conventional droop control for frequency stabilization. Given the inherent fluctuations in typical microgrid operations, stemming from factors such as varying load demands, weather conditions, and other variables, reachability analysis is also performed in this work. By doing so, we aim to facilitate the design of data-driven models and implement effective control strategies for microgrids subject to disturbances, and thus, ensuring the safety, reliability, and efficiency of microgrids across a wide range of operating conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is verified in this paper with numerical examples where the developed controller is tested in various worst-case scenarios generated by the reachable set computation.</description></item><item><title>Deciding When to Use a Personalized Model for Load Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10644149</link><description>Load forecasting plays a vital role in achieving supply-demand balance in power systems and lays the foundation for economic dispatch, demand response, etc. Conventionally, a global forecasting model will be constructed for the whole dataset. The problem of non-independently and identically distributed (non-i.i.d) data causes performance degradation of the global model. Many studies suggest building personalized models to account for heterogeneous distributions. However, there lacks a discussion about how much benefit can be achieved by the personalization over the global model and when it is necessary to conduct the personalization. To this end, we investigate when to use a personalized model for load forecasting. To answer this question, we first compare the generalization bound of the personalized model to the global model, demonstrating the potential for personalization to enhance performance. Then, we propose a Cluster-Oriented Representations Encoder (CORE) model to map the input feature space into representation space with clustering structure. The mixture distributions of the global dataset can be recognized to construct sub-representation datasets to lay the foundation for personalization. Subsequently, we quantify the personalization gain achieved by fine-tuning the global model with mathematical derivation. Finally, we decide whether to use the personalized model at each timestep and develop an adaptive personalization strategy for load forecasting. Comprehensive case studies have been carried out to validate the efficacy of the proposed adaptive personalization strategy in both single-load and multi-load forecasting and demonstrate the necessity to balance the global and personalized modeling approaches.</description></item><item><title>Improving Model Generalization for Short-Term Customer Load Forecasting With Causal Inference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10660529</link><description>Short-term customer load forecasting is vital for the normal operation of power systems. Unfortunately, conventional machine learning-based forecasting methods are susceptible to generalization issues (e.g., the customer heterogeneity and distribution drift of load data), manifested in model performance degradation. In recent years, some studies have employed the advanced deep learning technology, such as online learning, to overcome the aforesaid problems. However, these methods can only alleviate the adverse impacts of generalization problems on model performance, because they are inherently built on unstable relationships (i.e., correlations). In this paper, we propose a novel causal inference-based method to improve the generalization for short-term customer load forecasting models. Specifically, we first investigate the causal relations between input features and the output in existing methods, and introduce the load characteristics as an extra model input to enhance the causality. Then, we closely inspect the causality in models by using the causal graph to distinguish the confounder, followed by employing the causal intervention with do-calculus to eliminate the spurious correlations caused by the confounder. Moreover, we propose a novel load forecasting framework with the load characteristic extraction, characteristic pool approximation and characteristic-injected model to realize the causal intervention in an efficient and fidelity way. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method are validated on a public dataset.</description></item><item><title>A Large Language Model for Determining Partial Tripping of Distributed Energy Resources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10675341</link><description>Knowing the status of individual distributed energy resources, i.e., being tripped or not, after a contingency can inform the development of an aggregated DER model.

Herein, the realistic functional Vulnerability Index (VI) is originally determined based on a modified algorithm based on DCOPF with practical assumptions regarding load shedding and controllability, which is time-consuming as expected. For this modified functional VI, the supply-demand imbalances and line overloading situations are distinguished considering the urgency of their required corrective actions affecting the consequences of uncontrollability. Moreover, focused on both accuracy and evaluation time, a new topological VA framework is developed emphasizing the electrical properties of the power systems in the VI calculation, especially the adequacy. The proposed topological VA framework consists of four simple calculation criteria, avoiding complex optimization problems while checking the network&#8217;s capability to handle both over and under-frequency cases based on available generation reserve and load flexibility. The correctness and effectiveness of the proposed schemes have been validated based on the simulation results of the IEEE 39-bus system. The proposed topological method reduces the computation burden by 60% while having over 99% accuracy compared to the modified functional framework.</description></item><item><title>Electrical Circuit Analogy-Based Maximum Latency Calculation Method of Internet Data Centers in Power-Communication Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10714408</link><description>This letter has developed an electrical circuit analogy-based maximum latency calculation (MLC) method of the Internet data center (IDC) in power-communication network.

However, the increase in essential supporting Electric Vehicle Supply Equipments (EVSEs) has led to a large and diverse cryptographic demand for charging aggregators. The growing demand for computational power cannot be met by local cryptographic computing clusters, while cryptographic computing services on the cloud bring risks such as cross-VM (cross-Virtual-Machine) attacks. Meeting the requirements of security and timeliness simultaneously poses challenges for cryptographic service architecture and scheduling algorithms. To address these challenges, a heterogeneous task processing architecture is proposed to integrate local and cloud computing resources. Next, a task queue is constructed to transform the dynamic scheduling problem of multiple cryptographic tasks into a queue-jumping sequential decision-making problem. By modeling security requirements as constraints, the problem is modeled as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) formulation. A Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method with recurrent networks and a safe action mechanism are proposed to solve the formulation, which utilizes the temporal characteristics of cryptographic tasks to achieve better scheduling performance under constraints. Finally, compared with the state-of-the-art method, our proposed approach is validated through simulation experiments, demonstrating superior security and enhanced processing efficiency across various scenarios.</description></item><item><title>A Probabilistic Graphical Model for Predicting Cascade Failures of Electric Vehicle Charging Networks Caused by Hurricanes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10679196</link><description>Electric vehicle charging networks (EVCNs) are vulnerable to power outages. The resilience of critical charging infrastructures is vital for providing uninterrupted service. When a hurricane occurs, the offline charging stations (CSs) may cause the redistribution of EV traffic flow, resulting in the congestion at the healthy CSs and potentially leading to a cascade failure. This paper presents a probabilistic graphical modeling (PGM) framework for predicting the hurricane-induced cascading failures of EVCNs. A Bayesian network is proposed to capture the relationships between a hurricane, the power and traffic systems coupled by an EVCN. An AC-based Cascading Failure model (ACCF) is established to simulate the line overloading and load shedding. EV load redistribution is formulated as a traffic assignment problem considering the road impedance between the nearby CSs. The proposed PGM is trained by the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm considering the traffic flow as the hidden variable. Clique tree method is used to infer the propagation probability of cascading failure. The case study demonstrates the causal relationship between hazards and cascading failures of EVCNs under different hurricane scenarios. Results show that the proposed method can predict the propagation of cascading failures in EVCNs by identifying and quantifying the correlation among the susceptible CSs.</description></item><item><title>Co-Optimizing Power-Transportation Networks With Circulating Loads and Particle-Like Stochastic Motion</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10679187</link><description>Coupling power-transportation systems may enhance the resilience of power grids by engaging energy-carrying mobile entities such as electric vehicles (EVs), truck-mounted energy storage systems, and Data Centers (DCs), which can shift the computing loads among their network. In practice, the co-optimization problem for power-transportation systems can be overly complicated due to a great deal of uncertainty and many decision variables rooted in the EV population and mobile energy storage. Another challenge is the heterogeneity in terms of size and supporting capability due to various types of such mobile entities. This work aims to facilitate power-transportation co-optimization by proposing and formalizing the concept of Circulating Loads (CirLoads) to generalize these spatial-temporal dispatchable entities. With the new concept, the stochastic process of CirLoads&#8217; movement is introduced using Brownian particles for the first time. Such novel particle motion-based modeling for EVs can reflect their stochastic behaviors over time without requiring exact data of EVs. The distributions of CirLoads are further aggregated with Gaussian Mixture Models to reduce the dimensions. Based on this aggregated model, a co-optimization framework is proposed to coordinate the bulk of EVs while respecting data privacy between transportation and power systems. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description></item><item><title>A Distributed and Game-Theoretic-Based EV Charging Pricing Model Under Coupled Energy-Transportation-Information Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10680115</link><description>Optimized charging prices for the electric vehicles (EVs) under the coupled energy, transportation and information networks architecture is helpful to dig out the spatiotemporal flexibility potential of EVs and benefit the coupled networks in return. However, most existing studies scarcely investigated the whole process of optimized EV charging pricing issues under the coupled networks architecture. To this end, our main purpose in this study is to carry out an applicable architecture, design a sustainable business model for the EV charging related entities and optimize the EV charging prices. Firstly, an architecture and business model of the EV charging related entities is established, which reflects the energy, information and money flow among these entities. Secondly, a two-stage and distributed optimal charging pricing model is proposed for EV charging station (EVCS) based on game theory, taking the TAP-UE model into consideration. Lastly, the formulated pricing model is solved by the classical Gauss-Seidel algorithm. The proposed pricing model has been verified by the IEEE 33-node distribution system and a 12-node transportation network using the real-world data, the results showing that the utilization rate of distribution network assets is balanced, and the traffic congestion issue mitigated while the utility of EVs satisfied.</description></item><item><title>Highway Service Area Multi-Timescale Optimization Scheduling Considering the Spatiotemporal Dynamic Evolution of Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10634981</link><description>With the increasing demand for long-distance travel of electric vehicles (EVs), the uncertain fast charging behavior of EVs poses great pressure on the energy system of highway service areas (HSAs). The development of information and communication technology provides new insights for promoting advance perception and coordinated optimization among various entities. In this context, this paper proposes an HSA multi-timescale optimization scheduling strategy considering the spatiotemporal dynamic evolution of EVs. Firstly, the information exchange structure among various functional departments of the highway is formulated, and the highway topology model and spatiotemporal extended EV model are established as the basis for EV charging selection and EV load prediction. Then, a multi-timescale scheduling strategy suitable for multi-energy systems in HSAs is proposed to support the economic and self-sustained operation of the system. The chance-constrained method in the day-ahead stage and the two-layer model predictive control (MPC) method in the intraday and real-time stages are employed to mitigate fluctuations in power generation and demand. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is widely validated through simulations, the results indicate that the proposed EV evolution method can effectively predict the EV load, and the scheduling strategy can ensure the economy and reliability for the operation of HSA energy system.</description></item><item><title>Battery Health-Informed and Policy-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning for EV-Facilitated Distribution Grid Optimal Policy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10680085</link><description>Electric vehicles play a crucial role in modern active distribution system operation, owing to their flexibility and mobility. The joint optimization of power grid operation and EV scheduling is expected to achieve better decision-making for both power and transportation systems. However, such joint optimization can suffer from high computational complexity and a lack of information about the other system. One possible approach for the power system operator is to assume the charging/discharging pattern of the EV population and make dispatch decisions based on such estimated EV profiles. This practice results in grid-level policies. The problem arises as whether the EV population complies with and fulfills the grid-level policies is not easy to monitor. To address this issue, we further investigate and expand upon the innovative concept of grid facilitation for electric vehicles (EVs). A newly designed probabilistic incentive signal is introduced to assist in implementing grid policies. Correspondingly, we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for EV prosumer scheduling that effectively balances EV autonomy with the execution of grid policies. Cast as a demand response signal, the grid-level policy is capable of managing overall grid operation with the facilitation of individuals and decoupling the co-optimization of the operator and EV owner. For the DRL of the EV, the training reward considers both the EV operation cost and the grid facilitation incentive, featuring a dynamically shrinking EV battery&#8217;s feasible operation range in terms of voltages and currents, and the health-informed reward. The policy-aware reward utilizes the Jensen-Shannon divergence to quantify the gap between the actual EV power injection pattern and the system operator&#8217;s assumption. Invalid action mask tricks are integrated to prevent infeasible actions for EVs. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the facilitation effect of EV on system operation planning.</description></item><item><title>Operational Economics of Renewable Energy-Hydrogen System With Hydrogen-Powered Transportation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693480</link><description>Green hydrogen, produced from renewable energy sources, is undergoing a global resurgence as a clean energy solution driving decarbonization and fueling sustainable mobility. However, the major challenge facing the hydrogen economy is its scalability, particularly in the transportation sector. In response, this research develops innovative business models that utilize the low-emission attributes of green hydrogen to alleviate its financial constraints. The decrease in costs, in turn, can stimulate the growth of green hydrogen-powered transportation and facilitate the transition toward a carbon-neutral future. Key components of the proposed business workflow are elaborated, mathematical formulations of market parameters are derived, and case studies are presented to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed business models.

Such a framework is formulated upon a spherical-wave propagation paradigm that allows to account for two important factors pertaining to wave polarization that are not jointly considered in the state of the art, namely: the anisotropic radiation characteristics of practical antennas, and the variations in time and space of the channel depolarization effects. The joint characterization of these two factors is important, e.g., for the analysis of mobile communication systems that rely on highly dynamic radio links, such as vehicular networks. The channel depolarization function is modeled by a linear transformation in the form of a simple rotation matrix that is transparent to the antenna polarization and to the geometry of the propagation scenario. The effects of multipath depolarization on the average power, the first-order envelope distribution, the average per-path Doppler shift, and the mean Doppler shift of mobile fading channels are analyzed mathematically and numerically. An open geometrical configuration of the propagation scenario is considered for the mathematical analysis, whereas a particular configuration given by a new geometrical street model with reflecting surfaces is adopted for the numerical analysis. The obtained results show that the aforementioned statistical quantities are strongly influenced by the anisotropic antenna pattern characteristics and by the time-space variations of multipath depolarization, demonstrating the importance of incorporating both factors into the modeling of mobile fading channels.</description></item><item><title>RDP-FedGAN: A R&#233;nyi-Differential Privacy Empowered Federated Learning GAN in Smart Parking</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10682080</link><description>Leveraging smart parking systems can effectively improve urban traffic congestion and parking efficiency. Due to the widespread application of smart sensors, vehicle-mounted devices and Internet technology, the data collected and analyzed by smart parking systems has increased exponentially. Moreover, sensitive information can have the risk of leaking user privacy such as vehicle location, dwell time and real-time environment. In response to these challenges, we present a r&#233;nyi-differential privacy empowered federated learning generative adversarial networks (RDP-FedGAN) in smart parking. Specifically, we first design a FedGAN model, where GAN can generate synthetic data to train the model in conjunction with the federated learning framework without sharing the original data. Additionally, we propose an adaptive Gaussian noise dynamic adjustment strategy and give rigorous mathematical proof that the proposed mechanism can flexibly adjust the trade-off between privacy and data utility while satisfying r&#233;nyi differential privacy. Finally, extensive experiments executed on PyTorch under four datasets and various benchmarks with baseline comparison demonstrate the validity of our scheme. Specifically, Our scheme can not only effectively enhance the performance of collaborative models but also strike a flexible and effective balance between privacy preserving and data utility.</description></item><item><title>Semi-Asynchronous Over-the-Air Federated Learning Over Heterogeneous Edge Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10706930</link><description>As a distributed machine learning framework where many edge devices collaboratively train a model without data sharing, federated edge learning (FEEL) has been investigated extensively under wireless transmission scenarios. However, the traditional synchronous FEEL mechanism suffers from limited resources, leading to bottleneck nodes when the FEEL tasks are conducted in a wireless network. In this paper, we present a novel semi-asynchronous FEEL algorithm designed for application over wireless multi-access channels, particularly in scenarios involving data and devices with inherent heterogeneity. In this context, we embrace the concept of over-the-air computation (AirComp) to facilitate simultaneous processes of local model uploading and global model aggregation. We analyze the theoretical convergence performance of the proposed algorithm called PAOTA and formulate the upper bound of the expected optimal gap between the expected and optimal global loss values. Considering the staleness and divergence of local updates from edge devices, we minimize the convergence upper bound of the FEEL global model by optimizing the uplink transmit power of edge devices at each aggregation period. The simulation results demonstrate the robust performance of PAOTA using synthetic and real data in wireless networks. Furthermore, with the same target accuracy, the training time required for PAOTA is less than that of synchronous-based FEEL algorithms.</description></item><item><title>A Bin-Packing-Based Method for Path Planning of Air&#8211;Ground Cooperative System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10843078</link><description>An air-ground cooperative system integrates advantages of an autonomous air vehicle (AAV) and an autonomous ground vehicle (AGV). It has broad application prospects in large-scale intelligent surveillance and reconnaissance tasks. However, AAV cannot finish a large-scale task in one flight due to its limited power. Therefore, the points need to be partitioned into several subsets. AGV provides charging and limited distance communication for AAV. During the flight, AAV needs enough power to visit the points, each of which needs to be located in the communication range. In existing work, K-means is used to partition points. However, its partition results are determined by a preset number of subsets and the distribution of points. The generated subsets may contain too many or too few points such that the efficiency of one flight is reduced. The points in a subset may also be out of the communication range such that AAV cannot reach it directly., thus requiring extra charging and transportation. This work transforms a traditional target point partition into a bin packing one. A point is chosen to be packed only if AAV has enough power to visit it and falls into its communication range. The objective of bin packing is to pack all the points with the minimum number of bins. Thus, the number of flights is minimized such that AAV can visit as many points as possible in one flight. Simulations illustrate that the proposed method significantly reduces extra charging and transportation needs than the state of the art.</description></item><item><title>Cloud-Edge-End Collaboration for Intelligent Train Regulation Optimization in TACS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693302</link><description>Advancing from large-scale complex railway network construction to refined network operation management is a significant trend in promoting the high-quality development of modern rail transportation services. With the emergence of the next-generation train control system&#8211;Train Autonomous Circumambulation System (TACS), the transportation environment manifests obvious intricate correlations with strong couplings, multiple constraints, and rapid evolution. Most of the existing works focus on low-dimensional passenger flow prediction and independent train adjustment optimization, while the potential of network-level situation assessment and generalized experience across multi-tasks are neglected. In this paper, we propose a novel cloud-edge-end collaboration empowered TACS intelligent train regulation optimization scheme with situation awareness at end layer, arithmetic provision at edge layer, and intelligent fusion at cloud layer. Specifically, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based passenger flow prediction model is introduced to enable accurate assessment of the urban rail transit operation situation at the network level. Moreover, the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based train dynamic adjustment algorithm is proposed to ensure efficient matching of passenger and traffic flows. In addition, a Actor-Mimic based multi-task and transfer reinforcement learning method is implemented in TACS to facilitate generalizing the trained experience across multiple tasks and accelerate the ability to adapt to new environments. Extensive simulation results illustrate that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the transportation capacity matching of TACS and enhance the generalization of train dynamic adjustment strategies.</description></item><item><title>Security Transmission Scheme of NOMA Systems With an Untrusted Near User</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10689253</link><description>Aiming at the serious threat of untrusted users to the system security in the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) downlink system, where an untrusted near user assists a far user to receive data, a cooperative transmission scheme is proposed to improve the physical layer security (PLS) for our presented wiretap NOMA system model. The cooperative transmission scheme is implemented in two communication phases. In the first phase, the reverse power allocation method is used, in which the higher power is allocated to the data transmitted to the near user, and the far user is introduced as a cooperative jammer to send the artificial noise (AN), so as to improve the security when the base station sends data. Considering the situation that the near user decodes its data, two information forwarding processes are designed in the second phase. If the near user can decode its data, it will employ the amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol to forward the remaining signal after removing its own data. Otherwise, two relay selection (RS) strategies are explored to improve reliability of the considered system. In this case, the selected relay adopts the physical-layer network coding (PNC) technique, and the AN sent by the far user is regarded as the key to participating in the bit-level exclusive-or (XOR) operation, which ensures the absolute security of the data transmitted to the far user. The exact closed-form expressions of the outage probability (OP) and intercept probability (IP) are derived respectively, and the approximate results are also given under high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, the influence of relevant system parameters is discussed concretely. The numerical simulation results indicate that substantial performance gain is achieved over orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and other schemes, and the two RS strategies involved in this paper have the same reliability.</description></item><item><title>Power Optimization in Multi-IRS Aided Delay-Constrained IoVT Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10843080</link><description>With the advancement of video sensors in the Internet of Things, Internet of Video Things (IoVT) systems, capable of delivering abundant and diverse information, have been increasingly deployed for various applications. However, the extensive transmission of video data in IoVT poses challenges in terms of delay and power consumption. Intelligent reconfigurable surface (IRS), as an emerging technology, can enhance communication quality and consequently improve system performance by reconfiguring wireless propagation environments. Inspired by this, we propose a multi-IRS aided IoVT system that leverages IRS to enhance communication quality, thereby reducing power consumption while satisfying delay requirements. To fully leverage the benefits of IRS, we jointly optimize power control for IoVT devices and passive beamforming for IRS to minimize long-term total power consumption under delay constraints. To solve this problem, we first utilize Lyapunov optimization to decouple the long-term optimization problem into each time slot. Subsequently, an alternating optimization algorithm employing successive convex approximation and fractional programming is proposed to solve the optimization problems at each time slot. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms benchmark algorithms in terms of long-term total power consumption. Moreover, a trade-off between the number of IRS elements and system performance is also proved.</description></item><item><title>Dual Anti-Jamming Alleviation for Radio Frequency/Free-Space Optical (RF/FSO) Tactical Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10695133</link><description>In this paper, we design a jamming alleviation plan to protect a mixed radio frequency/free-space optical (RF/FSO) relay tactical network in the context that both RF and FSO systems are simultaneously attacked by enemy jammers. Unlike prior works that focused mainly on a single type of jamming attack (e.g. RF jamming), our proposed plan can protect the entire network against multiple types of jamming at the same time. We formulate a joint optimization problem of power allocation (PA) and Field-of-View (FoV) tuning strategy to maximize the RF uplink sum rate, subject to capacity and security constraints for both FSO and RF systems. To address this non-convex optimization problem, at first, we derive a closed-form expression of the optimal FoV angle. Then, the optimal FoV angle solution is computed to solve the PA problem. Since the PA problem has a non-convex form, we use an advanced technique of first-order Taylor approximation with the difference of convex functions method to solve it. The obtained solution of the optimization problem is then used for training a machine learning model that optimizes the system in real-time. Based on the Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) method, we develop a MADRL-based jamming alleviation algorithm to obtain the optimized solution of PA in near real-time. The numerical results show that the performance of the proposed MADRL-based jamming alleviation algorithm with low computational complexity is close to that of the optimization method.</description></item><item><title>Parameter Estimation for Perceptive Mobile Networks Based on Two-Level Block Sparsity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10684765</link><description>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a prospective technique that focuses on enabling simultaneous communication and sensing functions to enhance spectral and energy efficiency in future wireless systems. Perceptive mobile network (PMN) is a typical communication-centric ISAC system that integrates sensing capabilities into cellular networks. In current literature, the estimation of sensing parameters in PMNs has been formulated to a generalized delay-quantized channel model and solved as a block multiple measurement vectors (MMV) reconstruction problem. To further improve the reconstruction performance, this paper estimates the parameters jointly by exploiting the temporal correlation of channels. The sparse signals representing the channel parameters of consecutive symbols are modeled to share partial support, and then a two-stage block MMV orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm is proposed to solve the formulated reconstruction problem. In addition, we further provide the theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm based on restricted isometry property. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves higher accuracy in parameter estimation than the existing block MMV reconstruction algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Effective Computation Throughput Maximization for MEC-Enabled WP-IoT Networks With Short Packet Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10684556</link><description>As a promising paradigm to support wireless connections among massive devices, the Internet of things (IoT) is facing several challenges. Among them, the energy supply to IoT devices, the weak computation ability of IoT devices, and the stringent latency requirement of IoT applications are three major challenges, which can be tackled by radio frequency energy harvesting, mobile edge computing (MEC), and short packet communications (SPC), respectively. In this paper, we investigate resource allocation in MEC-enabled wireless powered IoT (WP-IoT) networks with SPC, and formulate the problem of optimizing the computation frequency, the packet length and the packet error rate, targeting maximizing the sum effective computation throughput. Since the problem is difficult to solve in general, we first simplify the problem by analyzing its properties, then design an efficient algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution in an iterative manner based on the bisection method, the block coordinate descent method, the successive convex approximation method, and the majorization-minimization method. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Particularly, it is shown that the proposed algorithm is of low complexity and achieves the performance close to that of the optimal exhaustive search, while also significantly outperforms other benchmark algorithms in existing literature.</description></item><item><title>Antenna Selection for Receive Spatial Modulation System Empowered by Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10685086</link><description>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) enhances signal quality by adjusting the phase of electromagnetic waves in wireless communication. Spatial modulation (SM), a prominent index modulation (IM) technique, provides high spectral efficiency and low energy consumption. In this article, a new wireless communication system is proposed by combining capacity-optimized antenna selection (COAS), antenna correlation antenna selection (ACAS), and Euclidean distance-optimized antenna selection (EDAS)-supported RIS-empowered receive SM (RIS-RSM) system (AS-RIS-RSM) in a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) structure. The proposed AS-RIS-RSM schemes (COAS-RIS-RSM, ACAS-RIS-RSM, and EDAS-RIS-RSM) provide better error performance compared to the traditional RIS-RSM system. Also, they offer higher spectral and energy efficiency compared to traditional wireless communication systems without IM. Integrating COAS, ACAS, and EDAS techniques into the system enables the selection of the channel with the best conditions, thus increasing the error performance of the proposed system. Also, using RIS increases the error performance of the system by controlling the transmitted signal to a certain extent. The analytical average bit error rate results of the proposed AS-RIS-RSM systems are derived and shown to overlap with simulation results. For the proposed systems, an optimal maximum likelihood (ML) detector and a sub-optimal low-complexity greedy detector (GD) are offered. Also, capacity analyses of the proposed AS-RIS-RSM systems are derived and it is observed that they have higher capacity compared to RIS-QAM/PSK and RIS-RSM systems. Then, computational complexity analyses of the proposed COAS-RIS-RSM, ACAS-RIS-RSM, and EDAS-RIS-RSM systems are presented. Moreover, the impact of imperfect channel state information on the error performance of the proposed AS-RIS-RSM systems is investigated, and throughput analysis is performed. The proposed systems have been compared to counterpart wireless communication systems including RIS-RSM, RIS-QAM, and RIS-PSK under equivalent conditions, demonstrating that the proposed systems achieve better error performance.</description></item><item><title>Energy Efficiency Optimization in Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Aided Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10685084</link><description>Energy efficiency (EE) is a challenging task in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where high spectral efficiency and low energy consumption appear as conflicting requirements. Although passive reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising technology for enhancing the EE of the ISAC system, the multiplicative fading feature hinders its effectiveness. This paper proposes the use of active RIS with its amplification gains to assist the ISAC system for EE improvement. Specifically, we formulate an EE optimization problem in an active RIS-aided ISAC system under system power budgets, considering constraints on user communication quality of service and sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A novel alternating optimization algorithm is developed to address the highly non-convex problem by employing the generalized Rayleigh quotient optimization, semidefinite relaxation (SDR), and the majorization-minimization (MM) framework. Furthermore, to reduce computational complexity, we derive a semi-closed form for eigenvalue determination. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showcasing significant improvements in EE compared to both passive RIS and spectrum efficiency optimization cases.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Cell-Free Network: Joint Beamforming and Location Optimization via UAV-IRS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10689361</link><description>Cell-free network and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) are considered as two promising technologies for improving future network capacity and coverage. They offer advantages such as low cost, low energy consumption, and compliance with green communication requirements. However, the static deployment of IRS restricts the network's ability to adapt to emergency coverage requirements and dynamic environments. To address this issue, we propose a flexible IRS-aided cell-free network, where network capacity and signal coverage are substantially improved by utilizing reflected signals from an aerial IRS. Our objective is to maximize the weighted transmission rate for users by jointly optimizing the active beamforming of the base stations (BSs), passive beamforming of the IRS, and the location of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Due to the non-convex and intractable nature of this problem, we decompose it into three subproblems. For the optimization problems of BSs' active beamforming and IRS's passive beamforming, we transform the log-sum problem into a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem by employing the lagrangian dual principle and multi-ratio fractional programming. Furthermore, for the more challenging location optimization, we further transform it into a convex problem using the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the weighted transmission rate and effectively enhance the network coverage as compared to other benchmarks.</description></item><item><title>Joint Resource Allocation for UAV-Assisted V2X Communication With Mean Field Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10689365</link><description>The Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, as the fundamental part of intelligent transport system, has the potential to increase road safety and traffic efficiency. However, conventional static infrastructures like roadside units (RSUs) often encounter overload issues due to the uneven spatiotemporal distribution of vehicles. Although the line-of-sight (LoS) propagation characteristics and high mobility of autonomois aerial vehicles (AAVs) have brought about UAV-assisted vehicular communication. The scarce spectrum resources, complex interference, restricted energy budgets, and the mobility of automobiles still pose significant challenges. In this paper, we combine mean-field game (MFG) theory with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to allocate resources for RSUs and UAVs in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) V2X communication networks. To find rational and reasonable global solutions for infrastructures under power and QoS constraints, a joint sub-band scheduling and transmit power allocation problem is addressed. The MARL technique is utilized to endow agents with the capability of self-learning. MFG theory is employed to tackle the tremendous overhead in agent interactions. The integration of MFG and MARL enables infrastructures to act as agents, engaging in mutual interactions and considering the impact of the surrounding environment, to achieve maximum global energy efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of UAV-assisted V2X communication and prove that the proposed method outperforms a state-of-the-art resource allocation scheme in both average energy efficiency and probability of failure.</description></item><item><title>Cache-Aware Cooperative Multicast Beamforming in Dynamic Satellite-Terrestrial Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10703079</link><description>With the burgeoning demand for data-intensive services, satellite-terrestrial networks (STNs) face increasing backhaul link congestion, deteriorating user quality of service (QoS), and escalating power consumption. Cache-aided STNs are acknowledged as a promising paradigm for accelerating content delivery to users and alleviating the load of backhaul links. However, the dynamic nature of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites and the complex interference among satellite beams and terrestrial base stations pose challenges in effectively managing limited edge resources. To address these issues, this paper proposes a method for dynamically scheduling caching and communication resources, aiming to reduce network costs in terms of transmission power consumption and backhaul traffic, while meeting user QoS demands and resource constraints. We formulate a mixed timescale problem to jointly optimize cache placement, LEO satellite beam direction, and cooperative multicast beamforming among satellite beams and base stations. To tackle this intricate problem, we propose a two-stage solution framework, where the primary problem is decoupled into a short-term content delivery subproblem and a long-term cache placement subproblem. The former subproblem is solved by designing an alternating optimization approach with whale optimization and successive convex approximation methods according to the cache placement state, while cache content in STNs is updated using an iterative algorithm that utilizes historical information. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, showcasing their convergence and significantly reducing transmission power consumption and backhaul traffic by up to 52%.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Aerial Cell Replacement Mechanism for Efficient Operation in 6G Wireless Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693554</link><description>Low-altitude platform (LAP)-based aerial cells require frequent replacement due to periodic and aperiodic triggers, like low battery, variations in capacity demands, and mechanical malfunctions while in service. During a replacement event, the ongoing data sessions for all connected users should be transferred from the source LAP to the target LAP without interruptions. Protocols based on user handover and link management between the source and target LAPs are slow due to the overheads of signaling, causing a degradation in user data throughput during replacement. Recent literature on aerial cell cloning (ACC) proposes a much faster protocol by replicating link and location parameters from source to target LAP, but with the limitation that it is directly proportional to the number of user contexts. As a result, the latency and energy consumption for replacement are higher with increased users. Another recent scheme, dual active protocol stack (DAPS) handover, does not apply to aerial cell replacement scenarios due to high packet forwarding overhead. This paper, at the outset, proposes a novel low overhead aerial dual active protocol stack (aDAPS) handover with reduced packet forwarding, applicable to aerial cell replacement in ultra-reliability and low latency (URLLC) scenarios. Next, it proposes a novel adaptive aerial cell replacement (ACeR) mechanism. ACeR assists the network in selecting an appropriate session transfer protocol for each user based on predicted data traffic volume, traffic characteristics, and the trigger for the replacement. ACeR jointly optimizes the latency and energy optimality of the network. The system is modeled mathematically, and extensive system-level simulation results show that the proposed ACeR mechanism is efficient. ACeR reduces network energy consumption by up to 34.5% and around 14% to 18% on an average compared to the fixed protocol used during replacement in the available literature.</description></item><item><title>Task Offloading and Resource Allocation in UAV-Assisted Vehicle Platoon System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10682817</link><description>Vehicle platooning is a key application in the realm of smart connected vehicles and autonomous driving technologies, holding significant potential to enhance road utilization and save energy consumption. Simultaneously, within intelligent transportation systems, the limited computing resources of vehicle users themselves fail to meet the computational demands of various new applications. Therefore, addressing the ever-increasing computational demands of vehicles is an urgent problem that needs resolution. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) equipped with edge computing servers leverage their advantages of flexible deployment and high maneuverability to promptly alleviate issues such as high latency and narrow bandwidth associated with processing remote data in cloud computing. This paper focuses on the scenario of UAV-assisted vehicle platooning, conducting research on task offloading and resource allocation mechanisms within UAV-assisted vehicle platooning systems. We construct a joint optimization problem for decision-making on task offloading, transmission power allocation, and CPU computing frequency allocation in UAV-assisted vehicle platooning systems. The objective is to minimize system energy consumption while ensuring the stability of the task computation queue. Since the formulated joint optimization problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, we decompose it into two sub-problems and simultaneously transform them into Markov decision processes. Subsequently, we proposed a continuous optimization algorithm based on Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) and deep deterministic policy gradient(DDPG). Simulation results validate the effectiveness of this method, demonstrating comparatively low energy consumption under different network environments and parameter settings.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Change-Point Detection Over Fully Decentralized Wireless Networks With Low Communication Rate</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10684506</link><description>Change-point detection (CPD), also known as quickest detection, aims to detect an abrupt change in the environment according to its observations as quickly as possible. Its applications in networks, such as wireless sensor networks and vehicular networks, motivate the study of distributed CPD, also known as multi-sensor CPD. In this context, multiple sensors monitor the environment via observations, but only an unknown subset of sensors is affected by the abrupt change. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed CPD algorithm, which simultaneously enjoys the advantages of being free of a fusion center, having low energy cost, being robust to the number of affected sensors, and suitable for a general data model. In particular, the proposed algorithm incorporates the thresholding technique into the a decentralized variant of cumulative sum (CUSUM) procedure. Sensors exchange information only when a designed local statistic exceeds a threshold, thereby reducing the number of communications and the energy cost. In addition, the proposed algorithm approximates the sum-CUSUM procedure and achieves robustness to the number of affected sensors. Theoretical analysis guarantees that the proposed algorithm achieves an exponential relationship between two detection performance criteria, the average running length (ARL), which measures the false alarm rate, and the expected detection delay (EDD). This result holds regardless of the number of the affected sensors. Furthermore, the thresholding operation only has a mild influence on the detection performance. Finally, we conduct simulations to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. We also apply it to distributed source detection task in multiple-antenna wireless networks as a potential application.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Adversarial Attacks Against DRL-Based Resource Allocation in Intelligent O-RAN for V2X</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10697477</link><description>Artificial intelligence (AI) is projected to be a critical part of open radio access networks (O-RAN) to enable intelligence for connectivity management in smart vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks and vehicle road cooperation systems. However, the openness and dependence of AI models on massive volumes of data render them subject to serious security vulnerabilities, such as adversarial attacks. This study investigates security issues in O-RAN's near real-time RAN intelligent controller (RIC), with an emphasis on deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based resource allocation. We introduce a novel attack manipulating environmental observations to mislead AI agents, resulting in erroneous allocations and decreased physical resource block (PRB) transmission rates for various vehicular communications. We also discover flaws where compromised users or signal jammers can fake signal power to trick the AI agent's state observation. This can lead to a policy infiltration attack that makes the network performance drop significantly. Evaluation results show up to a 40% decline in user data rates, a 77.74% reduction in packet delivery rates, and significant disruptions in ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (uRLLC) services such as remote driving and connected automated vehicles. The policy infiltration attack causes a 20% increase in packet losses and up to 150% delay overall. The attack efficiency emphasizes the need for adversarial training in protecting AI-driven applications, which should be addressed in future O-RAN security specifications and AI-powered vehicular networks.</description></item><item><title>Local Cooperative Sensing in 3D Spectrum Availability-Heterogeneous AAV Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10772000</link><description>The widespread application of autonomous aerial vehicles(AAVs) has put forward new demands on spectrum resources. In the more realistic spectrum availability-heterogeneous environments, where secondary users (SUs) may suffer from typically varied spectrum availability across different geographical areas, the effectiveness of the global cooperative spectrum sensing (SS) diminishes. To address this challenge, this paper investigates local cooperative sensing in 3D spectrum availability-heterogeneous cognitive radio networks (CRNs), with AAVs acting as SUs. A local cooperative sensing framework is proposed to ascertain spectrum status in this paper. Specifically, this framework utilizes the energy attenuation characteristics of the primary signal alongside a clustering algorithm to estimate primary user (PU) location, thereby facilitating the consistent spectrum availability for cooperative SUs and reducing the impacts of chaotic pathloss distribution. Then an information geometry (IG)-based data fusion method is incorporated to enable effective data processing on manifolds. Moreover, by drawing inspiration from deep learning (DL), a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier based on the coordinate attention (CA) mechanism is proposed to classify the fused samples, thus achieving the spectrum decision. Numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>Over-the-Air Federated Learning Under Time-Varying Wireless Channels Using OTFS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10685085</link><description>Due to increased scalability and enhanced data privacy, federated learning (FL) techniques become popular among the research community. Specifically, FL over wireless networks finds a broad spectrum of applications. However, they are often difficult to realize in practice primarily due to the challenges posed by wireless channels. In this paper, we propose an over-the-air (OTA) computation-based FL scheme suitable for time-varying wireless channels. An FL over time-varying wireless channel is challenging, therefore, the proposed scheme is designed based on orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation to make it resilient to time-varying wireless channels. To perform OTA computation, we develop a novel precoding technique under an optimal transmit power allocation for each user. Since precoding requires channel state information (CSI) of all the devices involved in FL, frequent exchange of CSI may increase control overhead significantly and eventually affect the performance of the FL scheme. Therefore, we develop an extended Kalman filter based CSI estimation scheme to reduce control overhead due to CSI exchange. Numerical simulations reveal that the proposed scheme has a better convergence rate and prediction accuracy than the orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing based learning schemes.</description></item><item><title>Joint Precoding and Phase Shift Design for RIS-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO With Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region Policy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10697454</link><description>Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) utilizes multiple distributed access points (APs) to achieve high spectral efficiency (SE). However, challenging propagation environments can degrade communication performance due to substantial penetration loss. Integrating a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into CF mMIMO can mitigate these issues by adjusting the phase and amplitude of the incident signals and adjusting the coefficients of its elements, providing a cost-effective and energy-efficient solution. This paper focuses on optimizing the joint precoding design of RIS-aided CF mMIMO systems to maximize the sum SE. This involves refining the precoding matrix at the APs and the reflection coefficients at the RIS. We introduce a fully distributed heterogeneous-agent reinforcement learning (HARL) algorithm that incorporates trust region policy optimization (TRPO). Unlike conventional multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods that rely on centralized training and execution, our HATRPO algorithm uses only local channel state information, reducing the need for high backhaul capacity by 13%. Simulation results demonstrate that our HATRPO algorithm significantly improves the sum SE in various scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Recent Developments of Charge Transporting Layers for High-Performance Monolithic Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10746558</link><description>The monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (PSTSCs) with high performance and low costs bring a new dawn to the photovoltaic industry.

Self-assembled monolayers present the most evocative prospect by measuring performance experimentally. Based on this kind of materials, the efficiency of tandem solar cells has risen to above 30% with texture surface and other strategies. Then, we focus on the further enhancements to propose the suggestion about further optimization on the basis of most promising charge transporting layers. A great scope of research brings many innovative experimental results about outdoor performance, presenting both opportunities and challenges to future researches.</description></item><item><title>On the Role of Solar PV for the Energy-Industry Transition in the Americas</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10726607</link><description>With the growth of solar photovoltaics (PV) in recent years as the largest power source by capacity added, the energy-industry transition towards high sustainability is accelerating. However, the energy-industry systems of the Americas are largely lagging as fossil fuels still dominate the electricity generation mix and the system as a whole. Energy-industry transition pathways are developed for all countries of the Americas reaching 100% renewable energy (RE) by 2050 for all energy and industry sectors. To benchmark the transition to 100% RE, the results are compared to current energy policies across the Americas, representing business-as-usual (BAU) conditions. The results indicate the significant potential to expand RE, especially solar PV, to reach the 100% RE target and fully defossilize each region's economy. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) can be reduced from its current level of 71 &#8364;/MWh to 24 &#8364;/MWh in 2050, and the levelized cost of final energy (LCOFE) sees reductions from 49 to 40 &#8364;/MWh from 2020 to 2050. Conversely, under BAU conditions, the LCOE only sees moderate reductions to 43 &#8364;/MWh in 2050, and the LCOFE remains relatively stable at 39 &#8364;/MWh in 2050. Widespread electrification across energy-industry sectors requires significant expansion of solar PV, which accounts for 78% of all electricity supply, leading to 14.8 TW of installed capacity. Furthermore, e-hydrogen for e-fuels and e-chemicals leads to an electrolyser capacity of 4.3 TWel. The dominating role of solar PV thus indicates that the future Americas energy-industry system can be characterized as a Solar-to-X Economy.</description></item><item><title>Comparison of Commercial TOPCon PV Modules in Accelerated Aging Tests</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10746853</link><description>Tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) is set to become the new mainstream cell technology despite pending reliability concerns.

In this research, we propose a high-quality flexible polyethyleneimine (PEI)/Ag/PEI-Zn electrode on common polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) flexible substrates to enhance the transmittance of conventional Ag ultrathin film electrodes in the visible wavelength range. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of flexible OSC devices based on Poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-fluorothiophen-2-yl)benzo [1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene)-co-(1,3-di(5-thienyl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhex yl)benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c']dithiophene-4,8-dione)] (PBDB-T-SF): IT-4F active layer achieves an optimal performance by annealing the PEI-Zn layer at 130 &#176;C through chelating Zn ions with PEI. The PEI-Zn layer serves as a high-quality electron transporting property and surface modifying layer on Ag film. Also, the PEI/Ag/PEI-Zn electrode exhibited remarkable mechanical durability of flexible organic solar cells (FOSCs) compared with indium tin oxiden (ITO)-based devices in consecutive bending experiments. PEI/Ag/PEI-Zn electrode was also applied in flexible perovskite solar cells. Their PCE performance reaches as high as 19.24% and also maintains 73% of its initial value after 500 bending cycles, which is much better than ITO-based flexible devices. Above all, both enhancement in light transmittance and PCE performance of both FOSCs and FPSCs underscores the superior properties of PEI/Ag/PEI-Zn flexible electrodes.</description></item><item><title>Performance of 2-D/3-D Mixed-Dimension Tin Perovskite Solar Cells and Their Prospects Under Bifacial Configuration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10769764</link><description>This work focuses on the design and development of lead-free halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, 3-D and 2-D/3-D mixed-dimension tin PSCs have been fabricated by adding phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI) in varying quantities. A maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE$|$MAX) of 11.03% has been obtained at a PEAI concentration of 15%, with indium tin oxide (ITO) and Ag as the front and rear electrodes, respectively. Addition of PEAI has also improved the stability of the solar cells. Using the measured properties from this device, monofacial and bifacial designs for the same material stack has been simulated by using suitable rear electrodes, without changing the front electrode. Silvaco 2-D TCAD software has been used for this purpose. With Ag and ITO as rear electrodes, the monofacial designs gave PCE$|$ MAX values of 17.94% and 12.79%, respectively. On the other hand, the bifacial design with a concurrent AM1.5G illumination of 1 sun intensity, the device gave a PCE$|$ MAX of 26.55%. The study also examined the impact of albedo effects from various reflecting surfaces on the performance of this bifacial perovskite solar cell (BPSC). Notably, snow albedo positively influenced efficiency of the BPSC, increasing it by 38.85% compared with that of monofacial perovskite solar cell (MPSC) with Ag rear electrode. Conversely, albedos from soil, seawater, and pond water resulted in lower efficiencies, even falling below those of MPSCs with Ag back electrodes. These results indicate that bifacial design has the potential to be an efficient and cost-effective solution for tin-based PSCs.</description></item><item><title>SnO2-Ti3C2 Blends as Electron Transport Layer for Efficient and Easily Fabricated Planar Perovskite Solar Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10769606</link><description>In this work, the SnO2-Ti3C2 hybrid electron transport layer (ETL) was prepared by incorporating two-dimensional Ti3C2-MXene into SnO2 and appropriate ultraviolet (UV) ozone treatment. The synergistic effect of Ti3C2 introduction and UV ozone treatment on the charge transport capacity of SnO2 ETL, interface properties of ETL/perovskite, perovskite morphology, and device performance was systematically investigated. The results show that the introduction of Ti3C2 does not affect the morphology and transmittance of SnO2 ETL. The perovskite films based on SnO2-Ti3C2 are not only dense, but also have smaller surface roughness, more uniform, and larger grain size, even penetrating the entire perovskite film. The surface oxidation of Ti3C2 induced by UV-ozone treatment enhanced the charge transport capacity of ETL. The electron extraction and charge transfer at the interface between SnO2-Ti3C2 ETL and perovskite are higher, and carrier recombination is effectively suppressed. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on SnO2-Ti3C2 ETL have larger charge recombination impedance and higher electron mobility, mainly due to enhanced ETL charge transport and optimization of interface properties. The short-circuit current (Jsc) and filling factor (FF) of PSCs are increased by 5% and 7% respectively, delivering a champion device with a relatively high FF of 79.38% and high power conversion efficiency of 19.52%, as well as good stability. Thus, this study provides a simple and effective method for the preparation of efficient and repeatable PSCs and paves the way for the industrialization of PSCs to a certain extent.</description></item><item><title>Effect of High Monochromatic Radiation on the Electrical Performance of CIGS Solar Cell</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10770815</link><description>In this article, we investigate the optically induced degradation of Cu(InGa)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells subjected to monochromatic laser irradiation. The devices under test are bifacial CIGS solar cells, fabricated on fluorine-doped SnO2 glass substrates. The electrical properties under dark and illumination conditions were characterized before laser exposure. The analysis of the current&#8211;voltage characteristics indicated that defect-assisted carrier transport dominates within the space charge region. Continuous laser exposure at constant optical power caused a decrease in open-circuit voltage (Voc). The study of the dark current&#8211;voltage curves highlights a change in the saturation current (IS) and ideality factor (n), whose increment follows a square-root dependence on time. This behavior is attributed to diffusion of Na ions toward the junction. Conversely, the Voc decay (which is correlated with the turn-on voltage decrease in dark I&#8211;V curve) is ascribed to a light-induced defect generation that enhances leakage current at the CdS/CIGS interface.</description></item><item><title>Electrical Modeling of Bifacial PV Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10777507</link><description>Although the bifacial photovoltaic (PV) module is now a mature technology, there still exists a gap in the literature on its electrical modeling and equivalent circuit representation. Most published studies have mainly focused on the photocurrent while overlooking other crucial parameters for the electrical response of the module. Even so, the photocurrent of the bifacial module is simplistically treated as the sum of individual currents of the front and rear sides, a hypothesis challenged in this study. Notably, our research has uncovered a discrepancy that can exceed 15%, and we address this issue by introducing a correction factor in this article. This article introduces a comprehensive electrical model that effectively integrates bifacial PV modules' front and rear sides into a single $-$ circuit representation. This novel model adopts the single $-$ diode equivalent circuit, formulating each of the five parameters as a function of the individual side's parameters. Indoor and outdoor measurements validate the accuracy improvement brought by this model, which can benefit energy yield studies and our theoretical understanding of bifacial PV systems.</description></item><item><title>Combining Production Data Timeseries and Infrared Thermography to Assess the Impact of Thermal Signatures on Photovoltaic Yield Over Time</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10750111</link><description>Photovoltaic (PV) modules with thermal signatures can be detected by infrared thermography (IRT) and the resulting power loss from these modules can be estimated through analysis of corresponding energy yield time series data. In the present work, we combine these methods to analyze the effect of PV module degradation modes on the overall energy generation in a 75 MWp PV power plant. We find that 0.2% of the PV modules are affected by thermal signatures after 5 years of operation and that the thermal signatures lead to a 0.06% reduction in power plant yield. We calculate a payback time of the IRT scan and subsequent replacement of modules affected by thermal signatures of more than 10 years for the investigated power plant. However, the power loss associated with thermal signatures seems to develop nonlinearly over time. This underlines the importance of continuous, long-term monitoring: it enables monitoring of performance in relation to warranty limits and supports prioritization of replacement actions required for cost-effective operations and maintenance strategies. This information is also required to understand PV module degradation modes, their time dependence and their dependence on module technology and climates.</description></item><item><title>Degradation Analysis of 38-Year-Old PV Modules Under the Weather Conditions of Sana'a-Yemen</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10740403</link><description>In this article, a degradation analysis of seventeen 38-year-old PV modules is conducted to estimate the degradation rates of PPeak, ISC, VOC, and fill factor, and identify the degradation modes that affected these modules. The modules under investigation were degraded under two different conditions: 16 modules were operated in the field, for 38 years, as a part of an off-grid photovoltaic system that was installed on the roof of the Faculty of Science, Sana'a University in Yemen, and one module was stored in a warehouse for the same period (exposure period&lt;48 h). Visual inspection, I&#8211;V curve measurement, infrared thermal imaging, electroluminescence imaging, and insulation test have been carried out for each module. Upon comparing with reference values as given by the manufacturer, the median peak power degradation rate of the field-exposed modules over the outdoor exposure period was found to be 25.37%. While the peak power degradation rate of the warehoused module was found to be 14.30%. Encapsulant delamination from cells along grid fingers, corrosion of cell fingers, and hot spots were detected in the warehoused module. On the other hand, encapsulant discoloration, shunting defect, humidity corrosion, front delamination, cell fingers corrosion, interconnect ribbons corrosion, hot spots, and finger interruptions were the principal causes of performance degradation of the field-exposed modules. A description of the detected degradation modes includes a brief discussion of the limitations and benefits of the design of these modules.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Ensemble CNN Framework With Weighted Feature Fusion for Fault Diagnosis of Photovoltaic Modules Using Thermography Images</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10755973</link><description>The global increase in the adoption of photovoltaic (PV) energy accentuates the imperative of maintaining system efficiency amidst environmental variabilities and faults. The processes of identifying, classifying, and rectifying defects are critical for ensuring the long-term sustainability and performance integrity of PV installations. This article introduces an innovative ensemble convolutional neural network (CNN) model that employs weighted feature fusion to enhance accuracy beyond what is achievable with a singular CNN architecture. By utilizing three proficient CNNs&#8212;VGG16, ResNet, and MobileNet&#8212;the fusion of deep features extracted from the last layers of these networks&#8217; augments performance, while also capitalizing on the integration of data from multiple CNNs with distinct configurations. This methodology was applied to a publicly available infrared thermography imaging dataset, which includes 12 distinct defects. The proposed models have been subsequently trained, validated, and tested on this dataset. The outcomes indicate a substantial enhancement in the accuracy of defect classification compared to individual CNN models, with an average accuracy of 96%. This approach underscores its utility in defect identification, particularly demonstrating the capacity of the ensemble CNN to classify defects with high precision</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Time-Series Approaches for Photovoltaic System Performance Forecasting With Sparse Datasets</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10735343</link><description>Solar-based power generation presents challenges for system and grid operators due to the intermittent nature of power supply. Predicting the performance of photovoltaic (PV) power plants and rooftop systems can often be challenging due to difficulties in data collection and incoherencies in interconnected systems. Following the hierarchical aggregation structure from geographical and temporal similarities between PV systems, we suggest a simplified approach to predicting the performance of individual installations and evaluating the impact of these hypothetical installations on the overall grid. We use the hierarchical nature of power generation and ascertain weather datasets to predict the performance of new or existing systems for locations with unmeasured input data. We demonstrate an approach that could improve grid stability by using a hierarchical model on publicly available datasets on utility and rooftop installations. Ensemble machine learning algorithms are trained with 16 weeks of known hourly input training features to form a baseline model for known locations. The prediction accuracy is then directly compared for locations with known and unknown input features, both on a granular and subregion level. We observe a reduction in prediction accuracy by 6&#8211;8% using the hierarchical approach. The accuracy of the hierarchical model can be further enhanced beyond our work by increasing the training dataset temporally, as well as by augmenting nested layers of the hierarchy.</description></item><item><title>ResAG-UNet: A Novel Residual Attention Gated UNet for Cloud Segmentation in Sky Image</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10749981</link><description>Cloud cover significantly impacts the solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface, thereby influencing the efficiency and output of solar energy systems. Consequently, an accurate cloud segmentation approach is crucial for understanding fluctuations in solar irradiance in real time and future ahead. Such understanding aids in optimizing energy production and grid management. In this article, we designed a novel deep learning architecture called Residual Attention Gated-UNet (ResAG-UNet) for accurate cloud segmentation. The proposed ResAG-UNet integrates residual blocks in both the encoder and decoder paths, along with an attention mechanism in the decoder path. The inclusion of residual blocks facilitates faster gradient movement due to skip pathways across them, thereby enhancing training efficiency. Furthermore, the incorporation of an attention module in ResAG-UNet allows for the learning of attention coefficients for various pixels. This mechanism actively highlights crucial characteristics while suppressing less significant ones in the cloud image. The proposed ResAG-UNet model is assessed and compared with benchmark segmentation models using NITK and SWIMSEG sky datasets. The proposed approach yields mean IOU, precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy of (0.8616, 0.8826), (0.9761,0.9965), (0.9863,0.9764), (0.9237,0.9613), and (0.9424, 0.9651) on the NITK and SWIMSEG sky datasets, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Drivers and Barriers to the Public Acceptance of Floating Photovoltaics Compared to Land-Based Photovoltaics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10747283</link><description>In floating photovoltaics (FPV), modules are installed on bodies of water to alleviate the land competition arising from the growing deployment of photovoltaics (PV). However, the installation of artificial structures on water basins can affect the landscape and raise concerns even among those in favor of renewables. This work specifically investigates the public acceptance of FPV among renewable energy supporters to identify its main drivers and barriers. The investigation was conducted through a public survey, which counted more than 300 respondents favorable to renewable energies. The findings reveal that, while public acceptance of FPV remains positive, it is lower than that experienced by renewable energy systems in general. This disparity is mainly due to concerns surrounding the landscape and fauna impacts of this novel technology. In particular, an inverse relationship between FPV acceptance and its perceived alteration of the landscape beauty is found. Notably, respondents expressing a negative opinion on FPV are also those most concerned by the landscape impact of traditional PV. The investigation also proposes some preliminary solutions for enhancing FPV's social acceptance. The effectiveness of these potential measures is evaluated, providing valuable insights for stakeholders and policymakers in the renewable energy sector.</description></item><item><title>A Compact 0.9&#956; W Direct-Conversion Frequency Analyzer for Speech Recognition With Wide- Range Q-Controllable Bandpass Rectifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10695034</link><description>The development of ultralow-power analog front ends for edge artificial intelligence (AI) is actively pursued; however, these front ends suffer from low-frequency selection accuracy, leading to increased training loads for the AI components and higher testing costs. In this article, we propose a novel circuit that fundamentally addresses these issues through direct conversion. By re-evaluating the circuit configurations of the multiplier, harmonic removal filter, and full-wave rectifier (FWR) from scratch, we have miniaturized and integrated an ultralow-power converter that transforms frequency components into pulse sequences. The frequency to be analyzed is determined by the local frequency input to the multiplier, which can be digitally controlled with high precision. In our system, the Q value is adaptively adjusted by the local frequency of the direct conversion, allowing the same circuit configuration to be applied to all frequency nodes, eliminating the need for filter design for each node and providing a highly design-friendly and scalable frequency analysis system.The test chip was fabricated with a 0.18- $\mu $ m process, operating at a 1.2-V supply, and outputting power pulse streams corresponding to 11 different frequencies ranging from 500 to 5 kHz. The total operating power was  $0.9\mu $ W, with an achieved equivalent Q factor ranging from 3.6 to 36. In a training experiment using a convolutional neural network (CNN) speech recognition model constructed with a functional model equivalent to this front end, a recognition rate exceeding 80% was achieved, demonstrating the practicality of this front end.</description></item><item><title>46-nA High-PSR CMOS Buffered Voltage Reference With 1.2&#8211;5 V and &#8722;40 &#9702;C to 125 &#9702;C Operating Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10682102</link><description>A nanopower, buffered CMOS voltage reference designed to operate across the entire industrial temperature range (from  $- 40~^{\circ }$ C to  $125~^{\circ }$ C) and with an input voltage range from 1.2 to 5 V (automotive applications) is presented. The solution provides 390 mV at  $20~^{\circ }$ C and is implemented in a standard BCD technology featuring 160-nm CMOS devices. It is characterized by an average temperature coefficient of 200 ppm/&#176;C, a line sensitivity (LS) of 0.138%/V, and a power supply rejection of &#8722;83 dB at 100 Hz. In addition, the circuit occupies a die area of 0.146 mm2 (with the reference circuit alone covering 0.043 mm2) and maintains a highly stable current consumption of around 45 nA across various process and input voltage conditions (25 nA for the reference circuit alone) while providing a maximum output current of  $630~\mu $ A with a load regulation of 0.016 mV/ $\mu $ A.</description></item><item><title>Bandwidth-Latency-Thermal Co-Optimization of Interconnect-Dominated Many-Core 3D-IC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10720515</link><description>The ongoing integration of advanced functionalities in contemporary system-on-chips (SoCs) poses significant challenges related to memory bandwidth, capacity, and thermal stability. These challenges are further amplified with the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), necessitating enhanced memory and interconnect bandwidth and latency. This article presents a comprehensive study encompassing architectural modifications of an interconnect-dominated many-core SoC targeting the significant increase of intermediate, on-chip cache memory bandwidth and access latency tuning. The proposed SoC has been implemented in 3-D using A10 nanosheet technology and early thermal analysis has been performed. Our workload simulations reveal, respectively, up to 12- and 2.5-fold acceleration in the 64-core and 16-core versions of the SoC. Such speed-up comes at 40% increase in die-area and a 60% rise in power dissipation when implemented in 2-D. In contrast, the 3-D counterpart not only minimizes the footprint but also yields 20% power savings, attributable to a 40% reduction in wirelength. The article further highlights the importance of pipeline restructuring to leverage the potential of 3-D technology for achieving lower latency and more efficient memory access. Finally, we discuss the thermal implications of various 3-D partitioning schemes in High Performance Computing (HPC) and mobile applications. Our analysis reveals that, unlike high-power density HPC cases, 3-D mobile case increases  $T_{\max }$  only by  $2~^{\circ } $ C&#8211; $3~^{\circ } $ C compared to 2-D, while the HPC scenario analysis requires multiconstrained efficient partitioning for 3-D implementations.</description></item><item><title>3DNN-Xplorer: A Machine Learning Framework for Design Space Exploration of Heterogeneous 3-D DNN Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10715720</link><description>This article presents 3DNN-Xplorer, the first machine learning (ML)-based framework for predicting the performance of heterogeneous 3-D deep neural network (DNN) accelerators. Our ML framework facilitates the design space exploration (DSE) of heterogeneous 3-D accelerators with a two-tier compute-on-memory (CoM) configuration, considering 3-D physical design factors. Our design space encompasses four distinct heterogeneous 3-D integration styles, combining 28- and 16-nm technology nodes for both compute and memory tiers. Using extrapolation techniques with ML models trained on 10-to-256 processing element (PE) accelerator configurations, we estimate the performance of systems featuring 75&#8211;16384 PEs, achieving a maximum absolute error of 13.9% (the number of PEs is not continuous and varies based on the accelerator architecture). To ensure balanced tier areas in the design, our framework assumes the same number of PEs or on-chip memory capacity across the four integration styles, accounting for area imbalance resulting from different technology nodes. Our analysis reveals that the heterogeneous 3-D style with 28-nm compute and 16-nm memory is energy-efficient and offers notable energy savings of up to 50% and an 8.8% reduction in runtime compared to other 3-D integration styles with the same number of PEs. Similarly, the heterogeneous 3-D style with 16-nm compute and 28-nm memory is area-efficient and shows up to 8.3% runtime reduction compared to other 3-D styles with the same on-chip memory capacity.</description></item><item><title>A 578-TOPS/W RRAM-Based Binary Convolutional Neural Network Macro for Tiny AI Edge Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10709360</link><description>The novel nonvolatile computing-in-memory (nvCIM) technology enables data to be stored and processed in situ, providing a feasible solution for the widespread deployment of machine learning algorithms in edge AI devices. However, current nvCIM approaches based on weighted current summation face challenges such as device nonidealities and substantial time, storage, and energy overheads when handling high-precision analog signals. To address these issues, we propose a resistive random access memory (RRAM)-based binary convolution macro for constructing a complete binary convolutional neural network (BCNN) hardware circuit, accelerating edge AI applications with low-weight precision. This macro performs error compensation at the circuit level and provides stable rail-to-rail output, eliminating the need for any ADCs or processor to perform auxiliary computations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BCNN full-hardware computing system achieves on-chip recognition accuracy of 90.7% (98.64%) on the CIFAR10 (MNIST) dataset, which represents a decrease of 0.98% (0.59%) compared to software recognition accuracy.

This leads to higher throughput for fractional motion estimation (FME) to meet the needs of real-time processing. In this context, this article proposes an interpolation-free algorithm based on an error surface to improve the throughput of FME hardware. The error surface is constructed by the rate-distortion costs (RDCs) of the integer motion vector (IMV) and its neighbors. To improve the prediction accuracy, a hardware-friendly RDC estimation strategy is proposed to construct the error surface. The experimental results show that the corresponding Bjontegaard Delta Bit Rate (BDBR) in Random Access (RA), Low Delay P (LDP) and Low Delay B (LDB) configuration increases by only 0.358%, 0.479%, and 0.511% compared with the VVC test model (VTM) 16.0. Compared with the default FME algorithms of VVC, the time cost of FME is reduced by 53.47%, 56.28%, and 54.23%, respectively, in RA, LDP, and LDB configurations. The algorithm is free of iteration and interpolation, which can contribute to low-cost and high-throughput hardware. The proposed architecture can support FME of all coding units (CUs) in a CTU with one layer of MTT under the quaternary tree (QT), and the CU size can vary from  $8\times 8$  to  $128\times 128$ . Synthesized using GF 28-nm process, the architecture can achieve  $7680\times 4320$ @60 fps throughput at 800 MHz, with a gate count of 244 K and power consumption of 76.5 mW. This proposed architecture can meet the real-time coding requirements of VVC.</description></item><item><title>Efficient ORBGRAND Implementation With Parallel Noise Sequence Generation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10718356</link><description>Guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND) is establishing itself as a universal method for decoding linear block codes, and ordered reliability bits GRAND (ORBGRAND) is a hardware-friendly variant that processes soft-input information. In this work, we propose an efficient hardware implementation of ORBGRAND that significantly reduces the cost of querying noise sequences with slight frame error rate (FER) performance degradation. Different from logistic weight order (LWO) and improved LWO (iLWO) typically used to generate noise sequences, we introduce a reduced-complexity and hardware-friendly method called shift LWO (sLWO), of which the shift factor can be chosen empirically to trade the FER performance and query complexity well. To effectively generate noise sequences with sLWO, we utilize a hardware-friendly lookup-table (LUT)-aided strategy, which improves throughput as well as area and energy efficiency. To demonstrate the efficacy of our solution, we use synthesis results evaluated on polar codes in a 65-nm CMOS technology. While maintaining similar FER performance, our ORBGRAND implementations achieve 53.6-Gbps average throughput ( $1.26\times $  higher), 4.2-Mbps worst case throughput ( $8.24\times $  higher), 2.4-Mbps/mm2 worst case area efficiency ( $12\times $  higher), and  $4.66\times 10 ^{{4}}$  pJ/bit worst case energy efficiency ( $9.96\times $  lower) compared with the synthesized ORBGRAND design with LWO for a (128, 105) polar code and also provide  $8.62\times $  higher average throughput and  $9.4\times $  higher average area efficiency but  $7.51\times $  worse average energy efficiency than the ORBGRAND chip for a (256, 240) polar code, at a target FER of  $10^{-7}$ .</description></item><item><title>Highly Defect Detectable and SEU-Resilient Robust Scan-Test-Aware Latch Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10702558</link><description>Soft errors have been a severe threat to the reliability of modern integrated circuits (ICs), making hardened latch designs indispensable for masking soft errors with redundancy. However, the added redundancy also masks production defects as soft errors; this makes it hard to detect defects in hardened latches, thus significantly reducing their reliability. Our previous work proposed the scan-test-aware hardened latch (STAHL) design, the first for addressing the issue of low defect detectability of hardened latch designs. However, STAHL still suffers from two problems: 1) it is not self-resilient to soft errors and 2) a STAHL-based scan design requires one additional control signal. This article proposes a high defect detectable and single-event-upset (SEU)-resilient robust (HIDER) latch to address the issues of the low defect detectability of existing hardened latches and the STAHLs lack of SEU-resilient capability. Two scan designs [HIDER-based scan-cell-S (HIDER-SC-S) and HIDER-based scan-cell-F (HIDER-SC-F)], as well as two corresponding test procedures, are proposed to fully test HIDER latch with only one control signal. Simulation results show that the HIDER latch achieves the highest defect coverage (DC) in both single latch cell detection and scan tests among all existing hardened latch designs. In addition, the HIDER latch has much lower power and a smaller delay than STAHL.</description></item><item><title>Low-Power and High-Speed SRAM Cells With Double-Node Upset Self-Recovery for Reliable Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10704651</link><description>Transistor sizing and spacing are constantly decreasing due to the continuous advancement of CMOS technology. The charge of the sensitive nodes in the static random access memory (SRAM) cell gradually decreases, making the SRAM cell more and more sensitive to soft errors, such as single-node upsets (SNUs) and double-node upsets (DNUs). Therefore, two types of radiation-hardened SRAM cells are proposed in this article. First, a low-power DNU self-recovery S6P8N cell is proposed. This cell can realize SNU self-recovery from all sensitive nodes as well as realize partial DNUs self-recovery and has low-power consumption overhead. Second, we propose a high-speed DNU self-recovery S8P6N cell, which has a soft-error tolerance level similar to the S6P8N. Furthermore, it reduces the read access time (RAT) and write access time (WAT). Simulation results show that the proposed cells are self-recovery for all SNUs and most of DNUs. Compared with RHD12, QCCM12T, QUCCE12T, RHMD10T, SEA14T, RHM-12T, S4P8N, S8P4N, RH-14T, HRLP16T, CC18T, and RHM, the average power consumption of S6P8N is reduced by 48.78%, and the average WAT is reduced by 6.62%. While the average power consumption of S8P6N is reduced by 23.64%, and the average WAT and RAT by 9.07% and 36.84%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Research on Hardware Acceleration of Traffic Sign Recognition Based on Spiking Neural Network and FPGA Platform</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10715726</link><description>Most of the existing methods for traffic sign recognition exploited deep learning technology such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve a breakthrough in detection accuracy; however, due to the large number of CNN&#8217;s parameters, there are problems in practical applications such as high power consumption, large calculation, and slow speed. Compared with CNN, a spiking neural network (SNN) can effectively simulate the information processing mechanism of biological brain, with stronger parallel processing capability, better sparsity, and real-time performance. Thus, we design and realize a novel traffic sign recognition system [called SNN on FPGA-traffic sign recognition system (SFPGA-TSRS)] based on spiking CNN (SCNN) and FPGA platform. Specifically, to improve the recognition accuracy, a traffic sign recognition model spatial attention SCNN (SA-SCNN) is proposed by combining LIF/IF neurons based SCNN with SA mechanism; and to accelerate the model inference, a neuron module is implemented with high performance, and an input coding module is designed as the input layer of the recognition model. The experiments show that compared with existing systems, the proposed SFPGA-TSRS can efficiently support the deployment of SCNN models, with a higher recognition accuracy of 99.22%, a faster frame rate of 66.38 frames per second (FPS), and lower power consumption of 1.423 W on the GTSRB dataset.</description></item><item><title>Architectural Exploration for Waferscale Switching System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10682064</link><description>With the end of Moore&#8217;s law and Dennard scaling, waferscale systems or processors that integrate multiple pre-tested known good dies (KGDs) on a waferscale-interposer are new approaches to further improve the chiplet-based system&#8217;s performance. This article explores the network on wafer (NoW) architecture of waferscale switching system under several physical constraints. A software-based approach is proposed to redefine the topological property. A five-level butterfly fat-tree (BFT)-like logical topology with 8.96-Tb/s (896 ports  $\times 10$  Gb/s/port) switching bandwidth is achieved based on 2-D-mesh-like physical topology. We show that the proposed BFT-like topology with breadth-first-search (BFS) based traffic balanced routing algorithm reduces 55.6% hops, 41.4% transmission delay, and improves 24.2% throughput compared to 2-D-mesh-like topology under different traffic distributions. This BFT-like waferscale switching system is suitable for high-performance computing and data centers. In addition, the numerical analysis shows that the waferscale package can provide significant power efficiency and latency advantages compared to the typical single-chip package, which mainly benefits from the short-reach IO requirements. Note that the proposed waferscale switching system is compatible with high-switch-capacity dies with advanced process technology, which can further improve system performance. Finally, we present the physical implementations for the waferscale system with heterogeneous dies.</description></item><item><title>PIPECIM: Energy-Efficient Pipelined Computing-in-Memory Computation Engine With Sparsity-Aware Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10701033</link><description>Computing-in-memory (CIM) architecture has become a promising solution to improve the parallelism of the multiply-and-accumulation (MAC) operation for artificial intelligence (AI) processors. Recently, revived CIM engine partly relieves the memory wall issue by integrating computation in/with the memory. However, current CIM solutions still require large data movements with the increase of the practical neural network model and massive input data. Previous CIM works only considered computation without concern for the memory attribute, leading to a low memory computing ratio. This article presents a static-random access-memory (SRAM)-based digital CIM macro supporting pipeline mode and computation-memory-aware technique to improve the memory computing ratio. We develop a novel weight driver with fine-grained ping-pong operation, avoiding the computation stall caused by weight update. Based on our evaluation, the peak energy efficiency is 19.78 TOPS/W at the 22-nm technology node, 8-bit width, and 50% sparsity of the input feature map.</description></item><item><title>MBSNTT: A Highly Parallel Digital In-Memory Bit-Serial Number Theoretic Transform Accelerator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10695040</link><description>Conventional cryptographic systems protect the data security during communication but give third-party cloud operators complete access to compute decrypted user data. Homomorphic encryption (HE) promises to rectify this and allow computations on encrypted data to be done without actually decrypting it. However, HE encryption requires several orders of magnitude higher latency than conventional encryption schemes. Number theoretic transform (NTT), a polynomial multiplication algorithm, is the bottleneck function in HE. In traditional architectures, memory accesses and support for parallel operations limit NTT&#8217;s throughput and energy efficiency. Processing in memory (PIM) is an interesting approach that can maximize parallelism with high-energy efficiency. To enable HE on resource-constrained edge devices, this article presents MBSNTT, a digital in-memory Multi-Bit-Serial NTT accelerator, achieving high parallelism and energy efficiency for NTT with minimized area. MBSNTT features a novel multi-bit-serial modular multiplication algorithm and PIM implementation that computes all modular multiplications in an NTT in parallel. It further adopts a constant geometry NTT data flow for efficient transition between NTT stages and different cores. Our evaluation shows that MBSNTT achieves  $1.62\times $  ( $19.08\times $ ) higher throughput and  $64.9\times $  ( $2.06\times $ ) lower energy than state-of-the-art PIM NTT accelerators Crypto-PIM (MeNTT), at a polynomial order of 8 K and bit width of 128.</description></item><item><title>ReAdapt-II: Energy-Quality Optimizations for VLSI Adaptive Filters Through Automatic Reconfiguration and Built-In Iterative Dividers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10665994</link><description>Adaptive filters using least mean square (LMS) algorithms offer high precision, low complexity, and fast convergence, but choosing the correct algorithm can be difficult and time-consuming.

This brief analyzes a specific type of least significant bit (LSB) error that obstructs the recording of the prior LSB count result during continuous counting processes when performing digital correlated double sampling (DDS) and digital CMS. This error stems from the transparent characteristic of the LSB in DDR counter and causes the increase of random noise. A calibration circuit is presented to calibrate the LSB error, which achieves carry propagation and retains the remainder by recording the result of the LSB after each quantization. The random noise is reduced by 25.5% based on simulation results in different CMS iterations after calibration. A  $1280\times 1024$  prototype CIS is fabricated in a 110-nm 1P4M process. The experimental results show that at DDS mode, the CIS random noise is  $147~\mu \text { V}_{\text {rms}}$  and ADC power consumption is  $21.07~\mu $  W, whereas at CMS =2, the noise is  $118~\mu \text { V}_{\text {rms}}$  and power consumption is  $28.07~\mu $  W. In addition, the prototype CIS has a column FPN of 0.006%.</description></item><item><title>A 0.4 V, 12.2 pW Leakage, 36.5 fJ/Step Switching Efficiency Data Retention Flip-Flop in 22 nm FDSOI</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10684787</link><description>Data-retention flip-flops (DR-FFs) efficiently maintain data during sleep mode, and retain state during transitions between active and sleep mode.

A dynamic-precision near-memory-computing architecture with booth encoding is proposed to reduce iterated intermediate data movement. A customized 32T compressor and a 14T full adder are designed to reduce the power and hardware cost of the solver.

The frequency is regulated with voltage by a universal logic line oscillator (ULLO), which can protect the system from timing violations. The length of the ULLO is self-calibrated by a ULL-based time-digital converter (ULL-TDC) and an in situ half-critical path timing detector, where the ULL is designed to track the critical path delay. A fully synthesizable digital low dropout (DLDO) is designed with the ULL-TDC and a proportional differential (PD) circuit for voltage regulation. The proposed system is implemented in an ARM Cortex-M0 microcontroller in 22 nm technology. Simulation results show that the ULL can accurately track the critical path delay with a maximum variation of 3% at 0.6 V and 11.5% at 0.45 V. The UVFR system consumes 13.2&#8211;112 uW of power overhead, and eliminates the voltage margin by 22.3%&#8211;28% while reducing the power consumption by 35%&#8211;42.3%.</description></item><item><title>A 9.6-nW Wake-Up Timer With RC-Referenced Subharmonic Locking Using Dual Leakage-Based Oscillators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10704753</link><description>This brief presents a nano-watt wake-up timer implemented mainly through digital synthesis. By performing successive subharmonic frequency locks between two leakage-based digitally controlled oscillators (DCOs) and repeatedly switching their roles, the period of the timer can be locked to a scaled RC time, enabling low-frequency generation without the need for substantial RC values. The proposed frequency-lock scheme is applied to design a 360 Hz timer. The implemented timer in a 0.18- $\mu $ m CMOS process consumes 9.6 nW and shows a standard deviation of 1.36% without the need for extensive external trimming, mainly due to intra-wafer process variation. The measured supply and temperature sensitivities are 0.32%/V and 395 ppm/&#176;C, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Design of a Low-Loss 1&#8211;10 GHz Capacitive Stacking N-Path Filter/Mixer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10596264</link><description>This article presents a capacitive stacking N-path filter/mixer optimized for low losses over a wide 1&#8211;10 GHz RF range, implemented in 22-nm fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) technology. By making the baseband (BB) capacitor larger than the RF capacitor, the former will define the bandwidth (BW). As a result, the RF capacitor can be much smaller, effectively reducing the parasitic capacitance at the RF node and limiting the loss at 10 GHz to only 1.4 dB. The implications and limitations of this capacitive scaling technique are explored, and an eigenvalue-based analysis is presented to derive a transfer function (TF) and simple design equations. Using these design equations, a prototype has been implemented that achieves 20-MHz channel BW while occupying 0.05 mm2 of active area. The design consumes 3.1-mW/GHz dynamic power with negligible static power and obtains a noise figure (NF) of 4.7&#8211;7.0 dB over an RF range of 1&#8211;10 GHz. The in-band (IB) input-referred third-order intercept point (IIP3) is over 1 dBm across the RF range and across three samples, while the out-of-band IIP3 is 17&#8211;28 dBm.</description></item><item><title>A 26/28/39-GHz Reconfigurable Phased-Array Receiver Front-End With Built-In Calibration Technique for 5G New Radio</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10606487</link><description>This article presents a reconfigurable phased-array receiver (RX) front-end supporting multiple fifth-generation (5G) new radio (NR) frequency range 2 bands at 26/28/39 GHz. A reconfigurable frequency downconverter (RFDC) with two operating modes is proposed to cover both K- and Ka-bands. Distinct from conventional wideband or multi-band structures, the proposed one does not need wide/multiple local-oscillator (LO) or intermediate-frequency (IF) bands. Cooperating with an appropriate LO- and IF-frequency scheme, the reconfigurable architecture moves image interferences out of a passband of RF channels in both the modes, and thus an excellent image rejection is achieved. A compact and fast built-in calibration (BIC) circuit, which is based on an adjacent-channel envelope comparison technique, is also developed to cope with potential phase and gain errors in each RF channel. The phased-array RX is demonstrated using a 65-nm CMOS technology. Measurement results show that the RX successfully covers both 24&#8211;30-GHz and 36&#8211;40-GHz bands, while only requiring an LO range of 9.5&#8211;12.5 GHz with 5-GHz IF. The tested gains, noise figure (NF), and input 1-dB compression point are 16.2/16.9 dB, 5.9/6.2 dB, and &#8722;30.7/&#8722;31.4 dBm at 26/28 GHz when it functions in a differential mode, while the corresponding results are measured as 15.3 dB, 6.6 dB, and &#8722;32.8 dBm at 39 GHz in a common mode. Tested image-rejection ratios (IRRs) are &gt;43 dB in both the operating modes. The BIC circuits&#8217; functionality is also tested. It reduces root-mean-square (rms) gain and phase errors of the RX by 0.12&#8211;0.28 dB and 2.3&#176;&#8211;4.5&#176;, respectively. Therefore, the RX&#8217;s tested beamforming performance is greatly improved, compared with the one without calibration.</description></item><item><title>A 4-bit RFDAC-Based FMCW Modulator for Automotive Radar</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10653810</link><description>This article describes the circuit implementation and measurement results of a 4-bit radio frequency digital-to-analog converter (RFDAC)-based frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) modulator implemented in 28-nm CMOS technology.

To prove the concept, the circuit is implemented in a 22-nm fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (FD-SOI) complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. The TX consumes 11.7 mW at full speed. Furthermore, the TX supports low-power mode with as low as 700 nW of dc power. The maximum data rate is 2 Gb/s. By applying dynamic data rate to dc-power adaptivity (DDDA), the dc power can be significantly reduced as the data rates decreases. This maintains the energy-per-bit below 10 pJ/b for data rates greater than 100 kb/s with a best value of 3.9 pJ/b and allows the dc power to be greatly reduced down to 700 nW at data rates below 20 kb/s. The measured maximum transmission power is 6.5 dBm. Moreover, the TX achieves 10- dBm effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) with an on-chip 3-D antenna. The core area of the TX is only 0.19 mm2. To the best knowledge of the authors, the proposed TX is the first reported TX with DDDA and achieves the lowest dc power in comparison to similar designs that have been reported to date.</description></item><item><title>A 1-GS/s 11-b Time-Interleaved SAR ADC With Robust, Fast, and Accurate Autocorrelation-Based Background Timing-Skew Calibration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10587286</link><description>This work proposes an autocorrelation-based background timing-skew calibration method. It uses the correlations between adjacent channels to extract timing-skew errors, which relaxes the input bandwidth limitation up to the Nyquist frequency. Moreover, the proposed technique simultaneously detects all channels&#8217; timing-skew errors, guaranteeing fast and accurate convergence. This work also proposes a clock booster. It has a simple structure and can efficiently increase the voltage swing of the clock signal. Equipped with the proposed techniques, a 1-GS/s 11-bit four-channel time-interleaved (TI) SAR analog-to-digital converter (ADC) achieves 59.3-dB SNDR and 78.8-dB SFDR with all skew tones below &#8722;80 dB at the Nyquist input.

The 1.5-bit output of the coarse CT- $\Delta \Sigma $ M is filtered by an 8-tap finite impulse response (FIR) filter, and then, a current-steering DAC provides intrinsically linear outputs to the fine  $\Delta \Sigma $ M. The associated delay is mitigated by increasing the coarse sampling rate by a factor of 4. The coarse  $\Delta \Sigma $ M significantly relaxes the requirements of the fine  $\Delta \Sigma $ M, but despite the faster sampling rate, consumes negligible power, because its noise is canceled for the final output, allowing the use of a relatively large input resistor. The ADC prototype fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process occupies an area of  $0.124~{\text {mm}^{{2}}}$  and consumes only  $243~{\mu }$ W from a 1.2-V supply. It achieves 92.0-dB signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR), 92.3-dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), 97.4-dB dynamic range (DR), and 105.7-dB spurious-free DR (SFDR) over a 50-kHz bandwidth without using DAC linearization or calibration.

This work introduces a sturdy RingAmp (SRingAmp), which stabilizes the gain, gain-bandwidth product (GBW), phase margin (PM), and transient response by building up compensatory coordination, achieving significant speed and PVT-robustness advantages over prior RingAmps. Furthermore, a time-domain ADC is utilized as the sub-quantizer with two techniques, including a common-mode shifting (CMS) scheme and a partial power-down (PD) operation for the voltage-to-time converter (VTC) and the time-to-digital converter (TDC), respectively. The former allows a near mid-supply common-mode input without degrading the linearity, and the latter improves the power efficiency. With these techniques, a single-channel 12-bit pipelined ADC achieves 2 GS/s in 28-nm CMOS with measured 60.4-dB SNDR and 75.8-dB SFDR at a Nyquist input, consuming 27 mW from a 1.0-V supply and yielding a Schreier figure of merit (FoM) of 166.1 dB.</description></item><item><title>A 2-GS/s Time-Interleaved ADC With Embedded Background Calibrations and a Novel Reference Buffer for Reduced Inter-Channel Crosstalk</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10633775</link><description>Time-interleaved (TI) analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are an established architecture, but fundamental problems still exist that prevent replicating the performance of each sub-ADC to the overall TI ADC. This article presents different techniques to overcome the main challenges in implementing an interleaved converter: 1) driving the ADC with sufficient linearity and bandwidth; 2) avoiding the crosstalk through the reference voltage; and 3) mitigating the effect of inter-channel mismatches. The proposed techniques are applied to a 2-GS/s TI ADC implemented in a TSMC 28-nm bulk CMOS process consisting of eight 11-bit 250-MS/s successive approximation register (SAR) ADCs. The prototype achieves a signal-to-noise plus distortion ratio (SNDR) and a spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of 57.3 dB and  $\mathrm {70.1~dBc }$ , respectively. The SNDR degrades on average by only 1.76 dB compared with the sub-ADCs, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. With a power consumption of 118.6 mW, including input buffer, digital calibrations, and SAR ADCs, the TI ADC achieves a  $\mathrm {99~\text {d}\text {J} /\mathrm {conv-step} }$  Walden figure of merit (FoM) and a 156.6 dB Schreier FoM.</description></item><item><title>An Energy-Efficient, High-Resolution kT/C-Noise- Canceled Pipelined-SAR Capacitance-to-Digital Converter With Incomplete-Settling-Based Correlated Level Shifting in 22-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10645821</link><description>This article presents a high-resolution and energy-efficient pipelined-successive-approximation-register (SAR) capacitance-to-digital converter (CDC). The converter uses a two-stage SAR analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and a residue amplifier (RA) to effectively convert the input signal. To mitigate the impact of kT/C noise during the sampling process, an enhanced kT/C noise cancellation technique is used within a pipelined-SAR architecture. In addition, an innovative incomplete-settling-based correlated-level-shifting (ISCLS) technique is proposed to achieve an equivalent open-loop gain of over 80 dB, thereby enhancing power efficiency and amplification accuracy. Furthermore, a background calibration loop is proposed to track PVT changes and ensure high-precision amplification under PVT variations to ensure PVT stability. The proposed CDC is implemented in a 22-nm CMOS process. The prototype achieves a resolution of 37.12 aF under 384-fF input capacitance with  $4.71~\mu $ W, resulting in a Walden figure-of-merit (FoMw) of 7.9 fJ/conv.-step, which represents more than a twofold improvement compared with previous sub-fF resolution CDCs.</description></item><item><title>Mixed-Order Correlated Dual-Loop Sturdy MASH CT-&#916;&#931; Modulator With Distributed Signal Feed-In and VCO Quantizer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10605845</link><description>This article presents a new structure of multi-loop continuous-time delta-sigma modulator (CTDSM) with voltage-controlled oscillator-based quantizer (VCO-Q) featuring a robust system with design flexibility and calibration-free. A recent work called correlated dual-loop (CDL) sturdy multi-stage noise-shaping (SMASH) delta-sigma modulator (DSM) removes the explicit quantization error extraction digital-to-analog converter (DAC) needed in conventional multi-loop structures. However, the limited design flexibility and the system&#8217;s robustness compromise the application of the CDL. The proposed structure is developed based on the core of the CDL SMASH and addresses its limitations by optimizing the noise transfer function (NTF) and introducing a distributed signal feed-in approach. Furthermore, the signal distribution can also constrain the input swing of the quantizers in our proposed structure. As a result, the VCO-Q, which is limited by nonlinearity issues, can be incorporated well into this design without extra calibration circuits. Fabricated in a 65-nm process, the prototype achieves a 77.2-dB dynamic range (DR) in a 15.625-MHz bandwidth at a 500-MHz sampling rate corresponding to a power consumption of 12.5 mW. The peak Walden figure of merits (FOM) of the proposed design is 97.66 fJ/conv-step with a signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) of 74 dB.</description></item><item><title>A 12.24-GHz MDLL With a 102-Multiplication Factor Using a Power-Gating-Based Ring Oscillator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10620066</link><description>This work presents a multiplying delay-locked loop (MDLL) that can generate an ultralow jitter output signal,  $S_{\text {OUT}}$ , at a very high output frequency,  $f_{\text {OUT}}$ . Conventional MDLLs are limited in increasing  $f_{\text {OUT}}$  due to their series-switch-based multiplexer (MUX) that is used to replace a jittery edge of the ring oscillator (RO) with a clean edge of the reference clock,  $S_{\text {REF}}$ . To overcome this limitation, the proposed MDLL removes the series MUX and uses a power-gating (PG) technique that periodically turns the RO on and off synchronously to  $S_{\text {REF}}$ , thereby removing the accumulated jitter of  $S_{\text {OUT}}$ . By doing this, the PG-MDLL can achieve an ultralow jitter at  $f_{\text {OUT}}$  that is more than 12 GHz with a multiplication factor (N) larger than 100. The PG-MDLL employs a single-pulse generator (SPG) to fill in one missing pulse, while the RO is turned off. Then, to equalize the spacing of all edges in  $S_{\text {OUT}}$ , which come from either the RO or the SPG, a background calibrator was used to correct various errors by dynamically changing the calibration target. We also proposed an analog-digital-hybrid accumulator (HACC) that can provide both fine resolution and wide bandwidth. This PG-MDLL was fabricated in a 40-nm CMOS technology, and it used an area of 0.066 mm2 and consumed a power of 14.7 mW. At 12.24 GHz ( $N =102$ ), the measured rms jitter and reference spur were 122 fs and &#8722;60 dBc, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Digital-PLL-Based Quadrature Clock Generator for a Low-Power and Jitter-Filtering-Capable Clock Distribution Scheme in High-Speed DRAM Interfaces</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10620064</link><description>This article presents a low-power and jitter-filtering-capable clock distribution scheme using a digital phase-locked loop-based (DPLL-based) quadrature clock generator (QCG) for high-speed dynamic random access memory (DRAM) interfaces. The conventional clock distribution distributes four quadrature clock signals at a high frequency of  $f_{\mathrm {CLK}}$  to many DQs over long-distance channels, which consumes significant power. On the contrary, the proposed low-power scheme distributes only a single-phase clock at a much lower frequency, i.e., 1/ $8f_{\mathrm {CLK}}$ , so it can reduce the clock distribution power consumption dramatically to 1/32. Then, the proposed QCG generates the precise quadrature clocks with a 25% duty cycle (DC) at  $f_{Q\mathrm {CLK}}$  right before DQs. Since the QCG was designed based on a phase-locked loop (PLL) operating at 1/ $8f_{\mathrm {CLK}}$ , it can filter the input clock jitter while consuming less than 1-mW power. Since the proposed QCG uses a frequency-independent method to correct the quadrature error, it can extensively increase the operating range of  $f_{Q\mathrm {CLK}}$ . This work also presents the synchronous mode-switching divider (SMS-DIV), enabling an immediate transition between IDLE and ACTIVE modes. The proposed QCG was fabricated in 40-nm CMOS and consumed  $900~\mu $ W for generating 2-GHz quadrature output signals.

The high-voltage driver is adopted to enhance the output swing level with the protective cascode and current-bleeding techniques. The hybrid  $3 {+} 1$  tap feed-forward equalizer (FFE) is implemented for efficient channel equalization. Two types of high-speed multiplexers are introduced for the final 4-to-1 serialization: a single-stack and single-stage multiplexer that achieves 33.3 Gbaud/s and a two-stage multiplexer at 37.3 Gbaud/s. Two prototype test chips are fabricated in 40-nm CMOS technology to evaluate the proposed multiplexer designs. The transmitters achieve the PAM-8 data rates of 100 Gb/s (for the single-stage multiplexer) and 112 Gb/s (for the two-stage multiplexer), with worst case eye-opening values of 45 and 57 mV. Their energy efficiencies are measured to be 3.35 and 4.56 pJ/bit.</description></item><item><title>A Double Pulse Overlapping Laser Diode Driver With Minimum 100-ps Pulse for LiDAR System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10630865</link><description>Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology is widely spreading to many applications. Among the various ranging methods, direct time of flight (dToF) stands out as particularly promising for real-time and long-range applications. However, the detection resolution and range of dToF LiDAR systems depend on the minimum width and maximum power of the emitted laser pulse. This work introduces a new laser diode driver (LDD) structure for high-resolution and long-range LiDAR transmitter (TX) system. It features a double pulse overlapping (DPO) scheme to generate ultra-short laser pulses spanning from 100 ps to 2 ns, achieving output pulsewidths significantly shorter than the control signal. Furthermore, two package configurations are implemented and an interleaved bonding method is analyzed and utilized to reduce the parasitic inductance and hence to improve the peak optical power. The parasitic effect analysis and system implementation circuit techniques are also presented. Fabricated in a 180-nm high-voltage BCD process, the two implemented TX systems achieve a minimum pulsewidth of 100 ps or a maximum output current of 15 A within 1-ns pulsewidth.</description></item><item><title>A 60-Frames/s CMOS Image Sensor With Pixelwise Conversion Gain Modulation and Self-Triggered ADCs for Per-Frame Adaptive DCG-HDR Imaging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10620065</link><description>CMOS image sensors (CISs) have been evolving rapidly in recent years, offering unprecedented imaging capabilities. For high-end mobile CIS products, high dynamic range (HDR) features are favorably desired. Among various HDR techniques, dual-conversion-gain (DCG)-based HDR imaging offers several advantages due to its high image quality and single-frame basis. For DCG-based HDR applications, however, current state-of-the-art CISs suffer from frame rate reduction and higher power consumption. In this article, we present an adaptive DCG-HDR imaging based on a CIS design with per-frame pixelwise conversion gain (CG) modulation and self-triggered analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). According to the scene to be captured, each pixel adaptively adjusts to its unique CG mode. With a single readout per frame and without image fusion, a proof-of-concept prototype CIS that operates in adaptive DCG-HDR mode achieves a 90.5 dB of dynamic range and a power figure of merit (FoM) of 9.9 nJ/frame $\cdot $ pixel. Compared to DCG-HDR imaging, operating at 60 frames/s, the presented adaptive DCG-HDR imaging reduces CIS power consumption by 38% and enables single-frame pixelwise HDR imaging, which is suitable for future mobile CIS products.</description></item><item><title>A nA-Range Area-Efficient Sub-100-ppm/&#176;C Peaking Current Reference Using Forward Body Biasing in 0.11- &#956; m Bulk and 22-nm FD-SOI</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10555551</link><description>In recent years, the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has prompted the search for nA-range current references that are simultaneously constrained to a small area and robust to process, voltage and temperature variations. Yet, such references have remained elusive, as existing architectures fail to reach a low temperature coefficient (TC) while minimizing silicon area. In this work, we propose a nA-range constant-with-temperature (CWT) peaking current reference, in which a resistor is biased by the threshold voltage difference between two transistors in weak inversion. This bias voltage is lower than in conventional architectures to cut down the silicon area occupied by the resistor and is obtained by forward body biasing one of the two transistors with an ultra-low-power voltage reference so as to reduce its threshold voltage. In addition, the proposed reference includes a circuit to suppress the leakage of parasitic diodes at high temperature, and two simple trimming mechanisms for the reference current and its TC. As the proposed design relies on the body effect, it has been validated in both 0.11- $\mu $ m bulk and 22-nm fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator, to demonstrate feasibility across different technology types. In post-layout simulation, the 0.11- $\mu $ m design generates a 5-nA current with a 65-ppm/&#176;C TC and a 2.84%/V line sensitivity (LS), while in measurement, the 22-nm design achieves a 1.5-nA current with an 89-ppm/&#176;C TC and a 0.51%/V LS. As a result of the low resistor bias voltage, the proposed references occupy a silicon area of 0.00954 mm2 in  $0.11~{\mu }$ m (respectively, 0.00214 mm2 in 22 nm) at least  $1.8{\times }$  (respectively,  $8.2{\times }$ ) smaller than fabricated nA-range CWT references, but with a TC improved by  $6.1{\times }$  (respectively,  $4.4{\times }$ ).</description></item><item><title>A PNP-Based Temperature Sensor With Continuous-Time Readout and &#177;0.1&#160;&#8728;C (3&#963;) Inaccuracy From -55&#160;&#8728;C to 125&#160;&#8728;C</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10546474</link><description>This article describes a PNP-based temperature sensor that achieves both high energy efficiency and accuracy. Two resistors convert the CTAT and PTAT voltages generated by a PNP-based front-end into two currents whose ratio is then digitized by a continuous-time (CT)  $\Delta \Sigma $ -modulator. Chopping and dynamic-element-matching (DEM) are used to mitigate the effects of component mismatch and 1/f noise, while the spread in  $V_{\mathbf {BE}}$  and in the ratio of the two resistors is digitally trimmed at room temperature (RT). Fabricated in a  $0.18~{\mu }$ m CMOS process, the sensor occupies 0.12 mm2, and draws  $9.5~{\mu }$ A from a supply voltage ranging from 1.7 to 2.2 V. Measurements on 40 samples from one batch show that it achieves an inaccuracy of  ${\pm } 0.1~{^{\circ }}$ C ( $3{\sigma }$ ) from  ${-} 55~{^{\circ }}$ C to  $125~{^{\circ }}$ C, and a commensurate supply sensitivity of only  $0.01~{^{\circ }}$ C/V. Furthermore, it achieves high energy efficiency, with a resolution Figure of Merit (FoM) of 0.85 pJ $\cdot $ K2.</description></item><item><title>A 1.76 mW, 355-fps, Electrical Impedance Tomography System With a Simple Time-to-Digital Impedance Readout for Fast Neonatal Lung Imaging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10642974</link><description>Functional lung imaging for neonates using electrical impedance tomography (EIT) requires a fast frame rate to avoid under sampling the faster respiratory rate in neonates than adults. Also, the EIT system must have low power consumption to facilitate wireless operation during kangaroo care. The application of existing EIT systems primarily designed for adults is limited by the trade-off between power consumption and speed of the impedance readout. This article presents an integrated EIT system in a 65 nm CMOS node featuring a novel ultralow-power time-to-digital impedance readout method based on dc cross-point detection. To increase the resolution of the impedance readout, a dynamic comparator with multi-phase voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)-based least-common-multiple (LCM) coherent clock control is used, yielding a measured impedance error of 0.94% and a phase error of 0.81&#176; over a frequency range from 100 to 500 kHz in a  $10~\mu $ s measurement time. In addition, a novel fast-settling switch matrix allows multiplexing the single impedance readout channel, significantly decreasing power consumption without degradation in speed. The EIT system has a maximum frame rate of 355 frames per second (fps) and a total power consumption of 1.76 mW. The impedance readout and digitization consume  $172~\mu $ W, a power reduction of 83%&#8211;93% compared to prior work. The frame rate is both suitable for neonatal lung imaging and other fast EIT applications. Both in vitro and adult in vivo measurements are presented.</description></item><item><title>A VCF-Step-Reconfigurable Continuously Scalable-Conversion-Ratio Switched- Capacitor Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10576732</link><description>This article proposes a  $V_{\mathrm { CF}}$ -step-reconfigurable continuously scalable-conversion-reconfigurable CSC (RCSC). We first analyze the working principle of the conventional conversion-ratio SC (CSC) converter and why it has reduced efficiency over a wide voltage conversion ratio (VCR) range. Then, the proposed RCSC reconfigures and thus equalizes the step size of the flying capacitor  $C_{\mathrm { F}}$  voltage ( $V_{\mathrm { CF}}$ ) according to the VCR. This maximizes efficiency over a wider range of VCRs, with limited circuitry complexity. Subsequently, we propose a gate control signal generation scheme that significantly reduces the cost overhead of the reconfiguration. The proposed RCSC can be used in either step-up or step-down mode and is compatible with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) in energy harvesting systems. Implemented with a 65-nm CMOS process, the proposed RCSC reaches a 90% peak efficiency using  $34~{V_{\mathrm { CF}}}$  steps and the widest normalized VCR range with &gt;75% efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A 2.30 NEF Split-Steering Amplifier for Switched-Capacitor Circuits With &#8722;14.2-dB CM-CM Gain and 100-V/&#956;s Slew Rate</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10645970</link><description>This article presents three techniques to improve the split-steering amplifier&#8217;s (SSA) performance and robustness. At the system level, differential-mode charge neutralization (DMCN) is introduced first to reset the circuit with minimum burden. Second, a DMCN-compatible common-mode feedforward (CMFF) strategy is introduced to reduce the impact of common-mode (CM) disturbance without introducing extra noise or sacrificing the bandwidth. The above two techniques are universal and can be applied in other pseudo-differential (PD) amplifier architectures. As for circuit implementation, two ring amplifiers (RAs) with different dead zones (DZs) are paralleled with the SSA to improve the slew rate (SR) of the overall amplifier. Dynamic bias adjustment is used to increase the response speed of the RAs and ensure that they will not be activated after slewing, which is critical to keep the overall amplifier low noise. The measured results demonstrate a &#8722;14.2-dB CM-CM gain and 11.7 times SR boosting. The measured noise efficiency factor (NEF) is 2.30, and  $\overline {V_{n}^{2}} \cdot I_{\mathrm { supply}}$  is 1.49 times overperforming previous works.</description></item><item><title>PAICORE: A 1.9-Million-Neuron 5.181-TSOPS/W Digital Neuromorphic Processor With Unified SNN-ANN and On-Chip Learning Paradigm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10614635</link><description>The neuromorphic approach of fulfilling brain-like edge intelligence is confronted with three paramount challenges: 1) ever-increasing application demands versus insufficient on-chip resources; 2) diverse data sources and models versus heterogeneous computing paradigms; and 3) adaptation to real scenarios versus absence of on-chip learning. To bridge those gaps in the current research community, this article presents PAICORE, a 537.98-mm2 digital neuromorphic processor with a unified computing and learning paradigm. PAICORE is a scalable 1024-core design, integrating over 1.919 million neurons and 4.773 billion synapses on a single chip. PAICORE is implemented in globally asynchronous locally synchronous (GALS) style with a five-level fat up-down quadtree as dedicated network-on-chip (NoC) infrastructure and tiled 2-D chip array as inter-chip architecture. The distributed processing cores fuse the hybrid spiking neural network (SNN), artificial neural network (ANN), and on-chip spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning models into a unified description by modular-level reconfiguration. PAICORE achieves the peak performance of 20.74 TSOPS, 41.49 TOPS, and 115.25 GSOPS, with the best energy efficiency of 5.181 TSOPS/W, 10.372 TOPS/W, and 1.222 TSOPS/W for SNN, ANN, and on-chip learning paradigms, respectively. Benefiting from the PAIFLOW software framework, PAICORE hardware platform can be equivalently simulated and efficiently programmed in a large-scale deployment, in accordance with specific optimizing demands for its target multi-paradigm tasks.</description></item><item><title>Background Noise and Process-Variation-Tolerant Sub-Microwatt Keyword Spotting Hardware Featuring Spike-Domain Division-Based Energy Normalization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10720671</link><description>This article presents keyword spotting (KWS) hardware that uses analog signal processing (ASP) and division-based energy normalization (DN) to perform ultralow power KWS robustly across unknown background noise conditions. Most existing KWS systems employed noise-dependent training, limiting their accuracy under different noise conditions. Some other works used noise-independent training but required a larger classifier to learn more features under different noise cases. In this work, we prototyped the KWS hardware using two chips: a normalized acoustic feature extractor (NAFE) chip in a 65-nm CMOS and a spiking neural network (SNN) classifier chip in the same technology. The proposed hardware can perform an end-to-end KWS task while achieving robustness across various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and different noise types. In addition, it can mitigate the effects of the process and temperature variations of the ASP circuits, further improving accuracy. The proposed hardware is also fully event-driven, minimizing power consumption when the input activity is low. The end-to-end KWS system consumes 220 to 570 nW across 0%&#8211;100% input activities and achieves 96.5%&#8211;88.0% accuracy across 20 to &#8722;5 dB SNRs on the HeySnips dataset.</description></item><item><title>A Multiply-Less Approximate SRAM Compute-In-Memory Macro for Neural-Network Inference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10622078</link><description>Compute-in-memory (CIM) is promising in reducing data movement energy and providing large bandwidth for matrix-vector multiplies (MVMs).

However, conventional multi-port scratchpad features a low storage density and a small memory capacity, resulting in limited performance improvements. In this article, we propose a high-density and energy-efficient scratchpad with two read and two write (2R2W) ports based on customized local blocks and a hierarchical accessing approach. Specifically, different global ports can access different blocks at the same time, where local read or write operations are performed with single-port bitcells. For an optimal storage density, push-rule high-density bitcells are used with metal pitch-matched local peripheries inside the block. Besides, hierarchical wordline decoding and fishbone-like vertical signal routing are presented to mitigate the density loss due to massive global signals. To improve the energy efficiency, dual-swing signaling, hierarchical timing scheme, and cascade sensing scheme are developed with negligible area overhead. A 1-Mb 2R2W scratchpad is prototyped in a 12-nm FinFET CMOS technology, achieving a storage density of 3.73 bit/ $\mu $ m2, which is superior to the state-of-the-art (SotA). The measurements demonstrate functionality from 180 MHz at 0.45 V to 950 MHz at 0.8 V, and a peak energy efficiency of 44.1 Tbps/W, which is 72.3% higher than SotA. Thus, with area-aware design strategies and energy-efficient circuit techniques, the proposed multi-port scratchpad is beneficial for neural network applications.</description></item><item><title>CV-CIM: A Hybrid Domain Xor-Derived Similarity-Aware Computation-in-Memory Supporting Cost-Volume Construction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10589582</link><description>Cost-volume construction, a cornerstone of stereo vision processing, has been widely utilized across diverse domains such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, 3-D reconstruction, and augmented/virtual reality applications. However, this process necessitates substantial parameter sizes and continuous memory data accesses, imposing considerable demands on memory bandwidth. Computation-in-memory (CIM) emerges as a promising technology to alleviate this memory bottleneck by its ability to execute parallel computations within structured arrays. Nevertheless, the direct deployment of cost-volume construction on CIM platforms faces several challenges, including functional limitations, reduced compute margins, and structural rigidity. To overcome these obstacles, we present a novel CIM architecture, named cost-volume CIM (CV-CIM), which incorporates the following key features. First, the xor-derived logic integrates fundamental arithmetic functions and heterogeneous CIM array (CA) function together to complete requisite cost computation. Second, the pixel-wise similarity is discovered to enlarge the bit sparsity. Then, sparse-mode CIM leverages the resulting sparsity to enlarge the xor-based computing margin. Third, dual degrees of freedom peripherals collectively contribute to latency reduction through dynamic row computation skipping (row peripheral) and the overlapping of data loading and computing (column peripheral). A test chip is fabricated in 28-nm technology and operates within a voltage range of 0.6&#8211;0.9 V and a frequency range of 50&#8211;286 MHz. Notably, CV-CIM demonstrates support for L0/L1/L2 cost computations and achieves a remarkable peak energy efficiency of 1158 TOPs/W.</description></item><item><title>Exploiting Body-Driven Feedbacks in Physical Unclonable Functions for Ultra Low Voltage, Ultra Low Power Applications: A 0.3 V Weak-PUF</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10531796</link><description>This paper introduces an innovative approach to designing a mismatched current mirror with a fully unbalanced output, significantly reducing the minimum supply voltage requirements for Regulated Cascode Current Mirror (RCCM) Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). Leveraging body-driven feedback mechanisms, the proposed circuit reliably operates with supply voltages as low as 0.3V, maintaining stable power consumption through a reference bias current. The resulting PUF achieves remarkable energy efficiency, consuming only 0.3 fJ per bit, without compromising statistical performance. It exhibits a response bias of 49.42%, a reliability of 99.483%, and a uniqueness of 50.176%. Validation of this novel approach is conducted through simulations and measurements on a 130nm CMOS test-chip, considering a nominal supply voltage of 0.3V, &#177;10% supply voltage variations, and a temperature range from 0&#176;C to 75&#176;C. Rigorous experimental verification on 20 chip samples, along with detailed explanations of design methodologies, underscores the robustness and practicality of the proposed Body-PUF design. Comparative analyses against state-of-the-art literature reveal that the Body-PUF outperforms previous PUF designs in Figures of Merit (FOM), making it promising for real-world authentication scenarios. Its outstanding trade-off between performance and practicality positions it as a compelling solution for secure applications, including Internet of Things (IoT) devices and other security-critical systems.</description></item><item><title>Highly Stable PUFs Based on Stacked Voltage Divider for Near-Zero BER Native Sensitivity to Voltage Variations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10613369</link><description>This paper explores a class of highly stable static monostable physically unclonable functions (PUFs) based on stacked sub-threshold voltage dividers between two nominally identical sub-circuits as bitcell core block. More specifically, compared to our previous works where two-transistor (2T) and four-transistor (4T) voltage divider based PUFs were presented and analyzed, here we propose two novel topological variants based on six-transistor (6T) and eight-transistor (8T) solutions which arise from adopting a proper reverse gate-biasing strategy within the stack with the aim of improving the resilience to on-chip noise and voltage variations, while keeping the area overhead low. These novel solutions, along with those already proposed, were tested in 180-nm CMOS technology. Raw measurements show a nominal (at 1.8 V and 25&#176;C) bit error rate (BER) of 0.15% and 0.08% for the 6T- and 8T-based solutions, respectively, along with a BER variation of 0.016% and 0.002% per 0.1 V. With the implementation of a simple masking technique based on measurements at low supply voltage ( $V_{DD} =0.3$  V at 25 &#176;C) along with a temporal majority voting (TMV) scheme, a BER of 0.006% and lower than  $9.77\times 10^{-5}$ %, which is the minimum observable BER for the adopted statistical set, was observed for the 6T-, and 8T-core based implementations, respectively, with a corresponding masking ratio of 8.71% and 7.59%. This is achieved with an area per bit of 5, $174F^{2}$  (6T solution) and 6, $994F^{2}$  (8T solution).</description></item><item><title>A Nonlinear Stream Cipher for Encryption of Test Patterns in Streaming Scan Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654320</link><description>With the biennial doubling of the number of transistors in a given area of silicon, contemporary integrated circuits (IC) are forging more and more often and will continue to forge complex system-on-chip (SoC) designs. Their equally complex manufacturing and in-system tests are now carried out through top-level test data delivery nets that enable fast streaming of test data to, from, and throughout a chip. However, it is essential to apply restrictions mitigating risks associated with unauthorized access and usage of SoCs as well as to protect the test infrastructure against hardware security threats, and thus to prevent leakage of secret information or other sensitive assets while tests are carried out. Existing security IP cores raise concerns related to their complexity in terms of area footprint, performance, power, impact on an SoC integration flow, and testability. This paper presents simple and lightweight, yet effective and scalable, test data stream ciphers (SCs) that can be used to encrypt and decrypt test data employed in tests of SoCs and delivered via Streaming Scan Network (SSN) &#8211; a new packetized test data network. A single cipher is comprised of three Galois nonlinear feedback shift registers working in tandem to yield a large number of parallel, cryptographically secure pseudorandom keystreams. A comprehensive evaluation, including NIST statistical test suits, show high efficiency of the proposed ciphers, and is reported herein.</description></item><item><title>Side-Channel Analysis of Integrate-and-Fire Neurons Within Spiking Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10705320</link><description>Spiking neural networks gain increasing attention in constraint edge devices due to event-based low-power operation and little resource usage.

Additionally, we propose countermeasures against the introduced novel attack approach. We evaluate shuffling and masking as countermeasures to protect the implementation against our proposed attack and demonstrate their effectiveness and limitations.</description></item><item><title>Detection and Localization of Hardware-Assisted Intermittent Power Attacks in Mixed-Critical Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752417</link><description>Increasing complexity in power management (PMT) has led to a growing demand for third-party power managers (3PPMs) in Network-on-Chip based Mixed-Critical Systems (NoCMCS). However, a malicious 3PPM can exploit the interdependence of power amongst the router nodes to orchestrate well-structured, covert power attacks. Detection and localization of a malicious 3PPM is crucial to restore standard dynamic PMT and mitigating system performance degradation. We propose a novel, non-invasive, low-overhead, attack detection and localization framework for Hardware Trojan (HT)-assisted intermittent power attacks with random activation and deactivation phases in NoCMCS. In Phase-I, our framework makes use of pre-profiled thermal statistics of router nodes to detect any anomaly at runtime. In Phase-II, it leverages a self-aware methodology to locate the router nodes with malicious 3PPM. The proposed framework can detect multiple intermittent HTs in the network. Experimental evaluations on real-life benchmarks show that Phase-I of our framework is able to consolidate the search space of malicious nodes, reducing almost 90% of Phase-II&#8217;s computational workload. Phase-II localizes the malicious router nodes across various experimental scenarios with zero false positives. We also demonstrate the robustness of our framework for detecting and localizing malicious router nodes for different intermittent HTs with varying burst attacks over time.</description></item><item><title>Meta: A Memory-Efficient Tri-Stage Polynomial Multiplication Accelerator Using 2D Coupled-BFUs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10689717</link><description>Polynomial multiplication (PM) is the computational bottleneck of lattice-based cryptography, such as post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Designing dedicated hardware accelerators for polynomial multiplication is an effective solution to improve the execution speed. However, current mainstream designs ignore the impact of computing array size, resulting in poor design flexibility and low memory utilization. To address these issues, we propose Meta, a memory-efficient tri-stage PM accelerator. Our proposed tri-stage PM algorithm fuses all isolated substages into a unique stage named fused coefficient-wise multiplication (FCWM), ensuring efficient computation. Meanwhile, in different stages of the algorithm, the circuit of two-dimensional reconfigurable coupled butterfly units (2D-RCBFUs) is fine-grained reconfigured to improve resource utilization. Moreover, the low-complexity memory mapping scheme simplifies the address control logic and reduces the hardware overhead. Meta can efficiently support the PM of an arbitrary power of two, which is impossible for previous designs using a 2D computing array. Compared with the state-of-the-art designs, our Meta demonstrates the best memory utilization, achieving up to  $10.0\times $  performance improvement.</description></item><item><title>Power and Frequency Intrinsic Channels on gem5</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10623216</link><description>Recent works have highlighted the vulnerability of System-on-a-Chip (SoC) platforms against intrinsic channels attacks. In this threat model, an adversary can leverage vulnerabilities in the SoC&#8217;s firmware, the operating system, or the design tools to gain access to shared resources in the platform and transfer data covertly. Given the diversity of attack avenues and the constant evolution of heterogeneous SoCs, it is not practical to study these attacks using conventional approaches. To address this issue, we propose to employ gem5 in the study of power and frequency intrinsic channels. Our work studies heterogeneous SoCs which feature a processor system and an FPGA. We employ the full system simulation of gem5 to emulate a reference physical device. We then describe the emulation of different intrinsic channels which leverage the clock tree and power distribution network of the SoC to transfer data covertly. Our findings demonstrate that gem5 can accurately replicate the logical behavior of power and frequency intrinsic channels.</description></item><item><title>A 3.5 GS/s 1-1 MASH VCO ADC With Second-Order Noise Shaping</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10665920</link><description>In this work, a 3.5 GS/s voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) using multi-stage noise shaping (MASH) is presented.

The resolution of the DTC needs to be sufficiently fine to suppress its own QE below the intrinsic integer-N jitter and, at the same time, sufficiently coarse to limit the DTC&#8217;s hardware needs. In this manuscript, we propose optimal strategies to determine the effective dynamic range, number of bits, quantization resolution, and unity delay of the DTC to achieve these goals; the additional jitter power introduced by input-dithered quantization methods to eliminate DTC-quantization-induced spurs is also considered. DTCs parameterized following these strategies can come close to realizing the spur-free integer-N PN with minimum hardware. Behavioral simulations confirm our analysis.</description></item><item><title>A Bio-Inspired Energy- and Area-Efficient Sound Localization Neural Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10707608</link><description>This paper proposes an energy- and area-efficient sound localization neural network mimicking the auditory brainstem cognitive function. By adopting the bio-plausible Jeffress model, the proposed neural network locates the sound based on the interaural time difference (ITD) in an energy- and hardware-efficient manner. The proposed network modifies the original structure of the Jeffress model having a pair of long axon lines to provide performance gain. It can reduce power consumption and area by using a single axon line. It can further improve efficiency in terms of power and area by shortening the length of the axon line for pulse propagation. Since only the leading pulse is allowed to propagate through the shortened single axon delay line, the number of delay elements and corresponding network components are reduced. Moreover, it can accurately detect the location of the sound source thanks to the axon line composed of synchronized delay elements. A further reduction of the power consumption is achieved by eliminating redundant pulse propagation through the axon line after the output neuron fires. The proposed sound localization neural network was fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process. The performance evaluation results indicate that the proposed sound localization neural network can detect the location of a sound source with a one-degree resolution at a given robot head size of 3.0125 cm, regardless of process corners. It also indicates that the network achieves up to 86.6% and 97.2% energy and area reduction from conventional sound localization networks, operating at 0.305-V supply voltage.</description></item><item><title>A 12 ps Precision Two-Step Time-to-Digital Converter Consuming 434 &#956;W at 1 MS/s in 180 nm CMOS With a Dual-Slope Time Amplifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10680134</link><description>A two-step time-to-digital converter (TDC) is designed for the high-precision time measurement of the DIRC-like TOF (DTOF) detector at the Super Tau-Charm Facility (STCF). Extending the measurement range by Nutt&#8217;s method, the TDC clock cycle is interpolated with two voltage-controlled tapped delay lines (TDL) connected by a dual-slope time amplifier (TA). By amplifying the residue from the first-step TDL-based interpolation with the TA and measuring it with the second TDL, the TDC resolution is significantly improved to sub-gate delay. Since the residue is extracted by a new method without the need of TA duplication or delay insertion, the TDC power consumption and conversion time are effectively reduced. By adopting the improved TA circuit into the TDC with a high gain, adjustable output offsets, and good linearity, the TDC measurement precision is guaranteed. In addition, a new DLL structure is proposed to stabilize the TDL against process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations with less power consumption. Benefiting from the proposed residue extraction method and DLL structure, the TDC exhibits low power consumption. To verify the TDC design, a prototype chip with two TDC channels is fabricated in GlobalFoundries (GF) 180 nm CMOS technology for performance evaluation. With a system clock of 150 MHz, it has a resolution (LSB) of 16.5 ps and a maximum sample rate of 6 MS/s. The differential nonlinearity (DNL) error ranges from &#8722;0.98 LSB to 0.87 LSB and the integral nonlinearity error (INL) ranges from &#8722;4.21 LSB to 2.83 LSB. With a bin-by-bin calibration method, the measured TDC precision is 12.1 ps on average within the 0&#8211;20 ns time interval measurement range. In addition, the TDC has low temperature sensitivity and does not require recalibration within a 20 &#176; C temperature range. Each TDC channel consumes  $434~\mu $ W power at 1 MS/s sample rate. The test results confirm that the proposed TDC can achieve high precision with a moderate sample rate and low power consumption without highly scaled technologies, which can meet the requirements of the DTOF detector at STCF.</description></item><item><title>A 2&#8211;6 GHz Reconfigurable High Dynamic Range Receiver With Wideband Variable Gain LNA</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10690251</link><description>A wideband high dynamic range software radio receiver for sub-6-GHz applications is proposed. The receiver combines three gain variable modules and an automatic gain control module to achieve high gain dynamic range and constant output voltage. A broadband resistive feedback LNA was designed, and two novel gain switching methods were proposed for the resistive feedback LNA, which reduced the LNA gain while optimizing the input matching performance. In addition, the receiver adopts a voltage mode mixer and uses the impedance translation property to achieve blocker-tolerant performance. In analog baseband (ABB), a fourth-order Butterworth active-RC low-pass filter (LPF) is employed for the purpose of attenuating interference. Furthermore, the receiver is furnished with an automatic gain control amplifier to uphold a consistent output voltage amplitude. A 22 nm CMOS receiver prototype occupies 1.85 mm2 and consumes 51 mW from a 1 V power supply over the 2&#8211;6 GHz operating frequency range. The receiver achieves a gain dynamic range of 9.1-91.9 dB and a noise figure (NF) of 2.4-3.4 dB. When a 0 dBm blocker with a frequency offset of 80 MHz is injected into the receiver, the NF increases to 13.2 dB. The programmable bandwidth of the LPF can be adjusted from 10 to 160 MHz. Moreover, the receiver achieved an in-band third-order input-referred intercept point (IIP3) of &#8722;9.1 dBm and an out-of-band IIP3 of &#8722;2.9 dBm respectively.</description></item><item><title>Analysis of Back-Gate Bias Control on EVM Measurements of a Dual-Band Power Amplifier in 22 nm FD-SOI for 5G 28 and 39 GHz Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10765124</link><description>This paper presents a dual-band power amplifier (PA) covering the 5G n257 to n260 frequency 2 bands (24.25 to 29.5 GHz and 37 to 43.5 GHz), fabricated in the 22 nm fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FD-SOI) CMOS technology. Its design is based on a distributed balun at the output that efficiently performs a wideband load impedance transformation. The back-gate terminal of each transistor is connected to different pads for detailed back-gate bias variation analysis. Under 5G new radio (NR) modulated signal measurements, we show how the average output power and efficiency can be optimized by varying the back-gate bias, which optimal value depends on (i) the signal bandwidth, (ii) the carrier frequency and (iii) the target error-vector-magnitude (EVM) value. To the best of the authors&#8217; knowledge, the impact of back-gate bias control on the system-level EVM figure of merit is shown for the first time in this work. Overall, with 7.5 dBm and 7.3% mean output power and efficiency, respectively, at 27 GHz, 6 dBm and 5% at 40 GHz, for a 800 MHz bandwidth 5G NR signal, the presented PA shows outstanding performance among wideband/multiband FD-SOI-based PAs covering the 28 and 39 GHz bands, featuring comparable performance to best-in-class narrowband PA designs in FD-SOI technology.</description></item><item><title>Q/V-Band CMOS Beamforming ICs and Integrated Phased-Array Antennas</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10666749</link><description>This paper presents 256-element transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) phased arrays for satellite fixed communication at the Q and V bands, which integrate the phased-array antennas with eight-channel beamforming ICs.

Extensive studies have been reported on approximate computing to develop high-performance, energy-efficient hardware designs tailored to error-resilient applications. In this brief, we proposed 8-bit approximate multipliers with 15 levels of accuracy using three techniques: recursive, bit-wise, and hybrid approximation using partial bit OR (PBO). Compared to the existing multipliers, investigated designs have significantly improved the area, power, delay, Power Delay Product (PDP), and Power Area Delay Product (PADP) by 41.68%, 73.16%, 35.57%, 72.65%, and 75.42% respectively on average.

It determines plasticity polarity and synapse strength change according to the timing difference between pre- and postsynaptic spikes. The learning curves of STDP differ in temporal window size, magnitude and polarity across different synapse types and brain regions and even within a cell, in different dendritic compartments. To accelerate on-chip STDP learning, various implementations have been proposed. However, they either introduce significant latency due to costly counter-based time difference calculation and substantial area cost due to the implementation of weight change LUTs, or lose biologically-plausible timing information due to oversimplification. For low-cost and efficient on-chip learning, a high-throughput Implicit-timing STDP (ImSTDP) with optimized SR depth and a low-cost register-based Implicit-Timing Look-up (ITL) are proposed. ASIC implementation in 22 nm technology demonstrates that ImSTDP can achieve up to  $2\times $  throughput improvement and  $3.61\times $  power efficiency improvement at 27% less area cost compared to the cutting-edge counter-LUT on-chip STDP learning solution.</description></item><item><title>Low-Power High Precision Floating-Point Divider With Bidimensional Linear Approximation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10652240</link><description>In this paper we propose a novel approximate floating-point divider based on bidimensional linear approximation. In our approach, the mantissa quotient is seen as a function of the two input mantissas of the divider. The domain of this two-variable function is partitioned into  $nx \times ny$  subregions, named tiles, where  $nx, ny$  are chosen as powers of two. In each tile the quotient is approximated with a linear combination of the input mantissas. To achieve fine accuracy, an optimization problem is formulated within each tile to determine the optimal coefficients for the linear combination, which minimize the Mean Relative Error Distance (MRED) of the divider. Furthermore, to make hardware implementation more effective, the minimization problem is appropriately modified to search for optimal quantized coefficients. The hardware structure of the divider only requires a small look-up table to store the linear approximation coefficients, and a carry save adder tree. The proposed architecture is highly tunable at design-time over a wide range of accuracy, depending on the number of tiles chosen for the approximation. The obtained results demonstrate error performance and hardware features superior to the state-of-the-art. The proposed dividers define the Pareto front, considering the trade-off between power-delay-product vs. MRED and area-delay-product vs. MRED, for MRED in the range of  $4\times 10^{-3}-2\times 10^{-2}$ . Application results for JPEG compression and tone mapping further highlight the strength of our proposal, which exhibits Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) very close to 1 in all cases and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) up to 45 dB.</description></item><item><title>Offset Boosting-Oriented Construction of Multi-Scroll Attractor via a Memristor Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10680718</link><description>The static architecture of artificial neural networks has fixed synaptic weights, whose connections do not change according to new information or learning experience.

By utilizing the series LC, the tank impedance at the oscillation frequency is significantly reduced compared to the conventional parallel LC tank, which contributes to reducing the phase noise (PN). Additionally, large-size cross-coupled transistors should be utilized to maintain the oscillation due to the low tank impedance. This induces a large parasitic capacitance that limits the frequency tuning range (FTR) at high frequencies in the conventional cross-coupled oscillator. In contrast, the presented oscillator can operate above 10 GHz with a sufficient FTR, thanks to the capacitance-boosting capability of the series LC.

Called reduced clock-load flip-flop (RCLFF), the proposed flip-flop minimizes the clock load by merging clock transistors to reduce the clock power consumption regardless of input switching activity. It also provides completely redundant transition-free operation, further reducing the power consumption. Reliable operation with no floating node and contention can enable further power saving by letting the flip-flop in the near-threshold voltage (NTV) region. Performance evaluation in a 28-nm CMOS process indicates that RCLFF achieves up to 60.9% power reduction compared to conventional flip-flops at 0.1 switching activity. By reducing power consumption with moderate DQ latency, the power-delay product (PDP) of RCLFF is improved by up to 64.5%. The Monte-Carlo simulation result reveals that RCLFF can operate reliably down to a 0.3 V supply voltage regardless of process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations.</description></item><item><title>Extended ZVS Range via LC Resonance in Current-Fed Parallel Resonant Converter for AGV Wireless Power Transfer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10818512</link><description>This brief presents a novel approach to extend the zero voltage switching (ZVS) range in the current-fed parallel resonant converter for wireless power transfer in an automated guided vehicle (AGV). Unlike previous methods that focus on tuning capacitors or inductors, the proposed method is to resonate the matching capacitor with a lumped inductor to enable ZVS in the region where the ZVS condition is not met, which is an LC resonance approach. The power dissipation due to ZVS failure is analyzed, and the proposed method to guarantee ZVS operation is described in detail. The simulated and measured results verified that the proposed method extends the range of ZVS by approximately 242% and achieves an efficiency improvement of up to 10.69% under the same load conditions compared to the conventional method.</description></item><item><title>A ReRAM-Based Processing-In-Memory Architecture for Hyperdimensional Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638739</link><description>Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) is a human brain-inspired computing paradigm that processes neural activity patterns with high dimensional vectors. Existing HDC accelerators usually utilize different hardware architectures to process encoding phases and comparison phases of HDC applications separately. They are unable to adapt to dynamic workloads for various datasets, resulting in resource underutilization. In this article, we propose a resistive random access memory (ReRAM)-based HDC accelerator called ReHDC for general HDC. We abstract the computing paradigms in encoding and comparison phases, and provide uniform primitive operators to efficiently process these two phases with the same hardware architecture. In the unified processing engine, ReHDC utilizes analog crossbar arrays to accelerate accumulation operations, and digital crossbar arrays to speed up high-dimensional element-wise operations (xor). Experimental results show that ReHDC can accelerate the HDC training by  $69.4\times $  and  $1.93\times $ , and can also improve the energy efficiency by  $51.5\times $  and  $2.2\times $ , compared with NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU and the ReRAM-based HDC accelerator DUAL, respectively. Moreover, the performance speedup and energy efficiency for HDC inference are similar to that of HDC training.</description></item><item><title>Tri-HD: Energy-Efficient On-Chip Learning With In-Memory Hyperdimensional Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10614328</link><description>The Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the emergence of big data. Processing this data, specially in learning algorithms, poses a challenge for current embedded computing systems. Brain-inspired hyperdimensional (HD) computing reduces several complex learning operations to simpler bitwise and arithmetic operations. However, it requires the use of large dimensional vectors, hypervectors, further increasing the amount of data to be processed. Processing in-memory (PIM) enables in-place computation which reduces data movement, a major latency bottleneck in conventional systems. In this article, we propose Tri-HD, an in-memory HD computing architecture that performs HD classification in memory. To the best of authors&#8217; knowledge, Tri-HD is the first ReRAM PIM architecture to implement the complete HD computing-based classification pipeline, including encoding, training, retraining, and inference for nonbinary data. We also propose a novel distance metric that is PIM-friendly and provides similar application accuracy as the more complex baseline metric. Our proposed architecture is enabled in PIM by fast and energy-efficient in-memory logic operations. We exploit the voltage threshold-based memristors to enable single cycle operations. We also increase the amount of in-memory parallelism in our design by segmenting bitlines using switches. Our evaluation shows that for all applications tested using HD, Tri-HD provides on average  $434\times $  ( $2170\times $ ) speedup and consumes  $4114\times $  ( $26019\times $ ) less energy as compared to the CPU while running end-to-end HD training (inference). Tri-HD also achieves at least 2.2% higher-classification accuracy than the existing PIM-based HD designs.</description></item><item><title>Robust and Efficient RTL to C Compiler Optimized for High-Level Synthesis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10623398</link><description>Designing hardware at the register transfer level (RTL) using low-level hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog or VHDL gives designers large degrees of controllability to create hardware architectures that will meet the given cost, power budget and performance requirements. The main problem with this approach is that the manually optimized architecture is fixed, which implies that future redesigns to, e.g., target other hardware platforms like field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) or newer technologies nodes might require the redesign and reverification of the RTL description. This is error prone and time consuming. To address this, in this work, we propose an RTL to C compiler that generates C code optimized for high-level synthesis (HLS) such that the redesign and reoptimization of new hardware design can be automated. HLS has multiple significant advantages over traditional RT-level design flows like being able to design and verify the behavioral description once and then retarget it for different hardware platforms and constraints by simply using a new technology library and synthesis constraints. Moreover, HLS allows to generate multiple functional equivalent design variants with unique tradeoffs like area, performance, and power from the same behavioral description by setting synthesis options in the form or pragmas (comments) to mainly control how to synthesize arrays (RAM or registers) and loops (unroll, partially unroll, no unroll, or pipeline). In order to leverage these advantages, in this work, we introduce an RTL to C compiler framework that we call MIRROR: maximizing the reusability of RTL through RTL to C Compiler and its new improved version MIRROR++ that is able to compile back to C different types of RTL descriptions, including pipelined circuits, finite state machines, and circuits that share functional units generating arrays and loops so that these can in turn be resynthesized (HLS) with different synthesis directives. Experimental results show the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.</description></item><item><title>SimDiff: Point Cloud Acceleration by Utilizing Spatial Similarity and Differential Execution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638770</link><description>Point cloud neural networks are gaining increasing attention in emerging 3-D computer vision applications, such as autonomous driving, robotics, and virtual reality. Many customized accelerators for 3-D point clouds have been developed to pursue superior time and energy efficiencies. In this work, we reveal that spatially adjacent points in a 3-D point cloud show similar feature values and relationships, implying substantial redundant computations and memory accesses, while which have been previously ignored. To reduce such redundancies, we propose SimDiff, an algorithm-accelerator co-design framework that boosts 3-D point cloud processing by cleverly leveraging spatial similarity toward excellent speedup and energy efficiency. On the algorithm side, we design a novel similarity-aware differential point cloud neural network (dubbed SD-PCNet). Differing from the standard flow of mainstream point cloud networks, it abstracts a brand-new execution flow for point cloud processing by utilizing spatial similarity among points and dynamic differential execution. On the accelerator side, we propose SD-PCAcc, a supporting accelerator to convert algorithm-level redundancy reductions into performance enhancements. On the deployment side, we propose efficient strategies for network-to-accelerator mapping and scheduling, high-bandwidth memory (HBM) channel allocation, and core component reconfiguration, facilitating the proposed methodologies into practical implementation. Extensive evaluation results show that, with preserved accuracy, our SimDiff gains an average of  $3.2\times $  speedup and  $3.1\times $  energy efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art competitors.</description></item><item><title>Neural Network-Based Control of Forced-Convection and Thermoelectric Coolers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10623371</link><description>Thermoelectric cooling technology holds great promise as a spot-cooling solution for the VLSI circuits. Typically, it is combined with a forced convection cooler, such as a fan to achieve effective thermal management. The optimal driving current for the thermoelectric coolers and fan rotation speed play a crucial role in minimizing cooling power consumption while ensuring safe operating temperatures for the VLSI chip dies. Various software-based optimization frameworks have been proposed to calculate the near-optimal values in real time. Nonetheless, these frameworks suffer from several limitations, including slow runtime, high power consumption, costly optimization software license, and the need for a separate computer to execute the optimization software. This article presents a hardware-friendly neural network (NN)-based optimizer that can learn from the functionality of a software optimizer. In order to train the NN model, a self-supervised learning strategy is employed to generate the desired labeled data. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model successfully meets the thermal constraints across all the tested benchmarks, with an overall system cooling power consumption increase of only 3.6% compared to a software optimizer. Furthermore, the hardware implementation of the proposed model proves to be more than five orders of magnitude faster than the software-based optimizer, consuming a negligible amount of power while occupying a small die area.</description></item><item><title>ClipFormer: Key&#8211;Value Clipping of Transformers on Memristive Crossbars for Write Noise Mitigation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10614379</link><description>Transformers have revolutionized various real-world applications from natural language processing to computer vision. However, traditional von-Neumann computing paradigm faces memory and bandwidth limitations in accelerating transformers owing to their massive model sizes. To this end, in-memory computing (IMC) crossbars based on nonvolatile memories (NVMs), due to their ability to perform highly parallelized matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) with high energy efficiencies, have emerged as a promising solution for accelerating transformers. However, analog MVM operations in crossbars introduce nonidealities, such as stochastic read and write noise, which affect the inference accuracy of the deployed transformers. Specifically, we find pretrained vision transformers (ViTs) to be vulnerable on crossbars due to the impact of write noise on the dynamically generated key  $(K)$  and value  $(V)$  matrices in the attention layers, an effect not accounted for in prior studies. We, thus, propose ClipFormer, a transformation on the K and V matrices during inference, to boost the nonideal accuracies of pretrained ViT models. ClipFormer requires no additional hardware and training overhead and is amenable to transformers deployed on any memristive crossbar platform impacted by write nonidealities. Our experiments on Imagenet-1k dataset using pretrained DeiT-S transformers, subjected to standard training and variation-aware training, show &gt;10%&#8211;40% higher nonideal accuracies at the high write noise regime by applying ClipFormer.</description></item><item><title>Light-CIM: A Lightweight ADC/DAC-Fewer RRAM CIM DNN Accelerator With Fully Analog Tiles and Nonideality-Aware Algorithm for Consumer Electronics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10614392</link><description>Neuromorphic computing has emerged as a revolutionary technology in consumer electronics, with computing-in-memory (CIM) attracting considerable attention for its potential to minimize data transfer. However, most CIM accelerators necessitate numerous digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for mixed-signal data processing, resulting in substantial area and energy overheads. This study introduces a lightweight CIM accelerator, Light-CIM, which operates with fully analog tiles (FANTs) and employs a nonideality-aware algorithm. A FANT consists of one-transistor-one-resistor (1T1R) arrays based on resistive random access memory (RRAM) and customized analog peripheral circuits for data processing. The intratile data computation, transfer, and buffering are all in analog voltage, current, or RRAM resistance, thus eliminating costly DACs and ADCs for intermediate data conversions in conventional CIM accelerators. The fully analog approach significantly reduces power consumption attributed to ADCs, accounting for only 2.5% of the total power consumption. Additionally, a nonideality-aware training algorithm is employed to enhance the robustness of the hardware system. It models and incorporates nonidealities of circuits in software training, including read nonlinearities, mismatches, variations, and noises in the hardware analog data flow. Experimental results demonstrate that Light-CIM achieves accuracy close to software performance in various NN models. Light-CIM accomplishes a compute density of 3.91 TOPS/ ${\mathrm { mm}}^{2}$  and an energy efficiency of 3.08 TOPS/W, both highly competitive compared to state-of-the-art works.</description></item><item><title>RoSE-Opt: Robust and Efficient Analog Circuit Parameter Optimization With Knowledge-Infused Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10614385</link><description>Design automation of analog circuits has long been sought. However, achieving robust and efficient analog design automation remains challenging. This article proposes a learning framework, RoSE-Opt, to achieve robust and efficient analog circuit parameter optimization. RoSE-Opt has two important features. First, it incorporates key domain knowledge of analog circuit design, such as circuit topology, couplings between circuit specifications, and variations of process, supply voltage, and temperature, into the learning loop. This strategy facilitates the training of an artificial agent capable of achieving design goals by identifying device parameters that are optimal and robust. Second, it exploits a two-level optimization method, that is, integrating Bayesian optimization (BO) with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve sample efficiency. In particular, BO is used for a coarse yet quick search of an initial starting point for optimization. This sets a solid foundation to efficiently train the RL agent with fewer samples. Experimental evaluations on benchmarking circuits show promising sample efficiency, extraordinary figure-of-merit in terms of design efficiency and design success rate, and Pareto optimality in circuit performance of our framework, compared to previous methods. Furthermore, this work thoroughly studies the performance of different RL optimization algorithms, such as deep deterministic policy gradients (DDPGs) with an off-policy learning mechanism and proximal policy optimization (PPO) with an on-policy learning mechanism. This investigation provides users with guidance on choosing the appropriate RL algorithms to optimize the device parameters of analog circuits. Finally, our study also demonstrates RoSE-Opt&#8217;s promise in parasitic-aware device optimization for analog circuits. In summary, our work reports a knowledge-infused BO-RL design automation framework for reliable and efficient optimization of analog circuits&#8217; device parameters.

This, in turn, affects signal delay, power efficiency, routability, and overall cost. However, traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods for chip floorplanning often oversimplify this complex and dynamic task. They tend to overlook the cascading effects of module placements and fail to fully comprehend the intricate interdependencies that are vital for making informed decisions. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative approach that combines hypergraph graph convolutional networks (HyperGCNs) with deep recurrent Q-networks (DRQNs). This integration allows us to capture the nuanced dynamics and interconnected aspects of chip design more effectively. We enhance the traditional Markov decision process (MDP) model by incorporating a state characterization layer based on long short-term memory (LSTM) technology. Initially, HyperGCN efficiently encodes netlist information, simplifying complex graph structures into lower dimensional vectors, thereby enhancing knowledge processing. Subsequently, we treat the chip as an agent and apply the DRQN algorithm to optimize the module layout. DRQN&#8217;s LSTM utilizes a recurrent layer structure to grasp dependencies between modules, combined with the deep Q-network (DQN)&#8217;s optimization capabilities, enabling us to navigate the complexities of floorplanning. Our approach improves the state representation by encompassing a broader understanding of interconnected module characteristics. This allows our agents to make decisions that take into account the collective impact of module adjustments, rather than viewing each change in isolation. This comprehensive state representation, which includes diverse features and their evolving relationships, significantly enhances the decision-making capabilities of our agents. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional heuristic-based and other learning-based floorplanning techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of LSTM with DQN in circuit design, representing a significant advancement in the field.</description></item><item><title>COSA Plus: Enhanced Co-Operative Systolic Arrays for Attention Mechanism in Transformers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10612833</link><description>The attention mechanism is becoming a vital building block across various modern neural networks, e.g., Transformers. However, it encounters low efficiency when deployed on the general-purpose GPU/CPU platform, which motivates the dedicated accelerator design. Existing accelerators are commonly devised by exploring the potential sparsity in attention mechanism using a hardware-software codesign scheme, which suffers from complicated training, fine-tuning processes, and possible accuracy degradation. More importantly, the sparse pattern only focuses on certain datasets with less generality, and the fine-grained sparse pattern could also bring hardware inefficiency. Instead, we try to solve these issues from another perspective: by systematically analysing the inherent dataflow characteristics of the attention mechanism, we propose the co-operative systolic arrays (COSAs) with an optimized dataflow to support the general purpose attention mechanism and pursue higher computational efficiency. COSA system exploits the high parallelism from the inherent model and leverages run-time configurable hybrid dataflows, i.e., weight and output stationary (OS) for a systolic array (SA) to support the varying matrix multiplication in the attention mechanism. Regarding the cascaded matrix multiplications, COSA proposes levels of fusion methodologies to reduce the off-chip access and enhance processing element (PE) utilization, such as directly using the result of OS as the weight of weight stationary SA by deep fusion. Additionally, the COSA system also provides the solution to hide the latency and radically save the buffer size related to the softmax. Experiment results show that, across various benchmarks, COSA can achieve  $2.29-2.60\times $  throughput improvement over the traditional SA of the same MAC number, with up to 94.7% PE utilization rate and  $8.2\times $  less off-chip memory access. Compared with the general-purpose platforms,  $7.6-12.4\times $  energy efficiency over NVIDIA GeForce 3090 GPU and  $35.2-80.9\times $  energy efficiency over Intel 6226R server CPU.</description></item><item><title>Harmonia: A Unified Architecture for Efficient Deep Symbolic Regression</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10634878</link><description>Symbolic regression (SR), the process of formulating a mathematical expression based on observed data points, is a fundamental task in artificial intelligence but is often hindered by its intense computational demands. Deep-learning-based SR methods (DSR) aim to alleviate these demands by breaking down the SR process into two stages: 1) neural network (NN) inference and 2) Broyden-Fletcher&#8211;Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) optimization. Although NN accelerators can expedite the NN stage, the performance of the BFGS optimization is compromised due to its poor performance for the variety of transcendental functions. Moreover, the distinct computational characteristics of NN inference and BFGS cause not only low hardware utilization but also significant area waste. To address these issues, we propose Harmonia, a unified architecture with the neural transcendental function unit (NTFU) and the Unified Array for efficient DSR. The NTFU utilizes the radial basis function network (RBFN) as a universal approximator for various transcendental functions, which significantly reduces the heavy transcendental function computation cost. We further propose an efficient training algorithm called random nonlinear optimization (RNO) to obtain a lightweight RBFN without accuracy loss. Moreover, Harmonia supports configurable dataflow which integrates the two computing stages into the Unified Array. Experimental results show that Harmonia achieves hardware utilization of 83.83%, on average. Compared to the GPU baseline, Harmonia achieves  $4.8\times $  speedup and  $47.6\times $  energy saving, alongside considerable low area cost.</description></item></channel></rss>
