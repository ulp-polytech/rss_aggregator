However, this approach does not address the internal stress distribution within the individual two-stage submodules. In this article, a method to balance the internal stress by redistributing the second harmonic current between the dc-link capacitors and the devices in dc/dc stage is presented. This method introduces an adjustable ripple to the basic phase-shift modulation, directing a portion of the second harmonic current to the rear-end dc/dc stage in accordance with the lifetime differences within submodules. It requires minimal control effort and provides sufficient thermal balance capability within the submodule. Notably, it focuses exclusively on the second harmonic current, with negligible impact on the output power. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving thermal regulation and lifetime balance within the submodules.</description></item><item><title>A Setting-Less and Boundary-Element-Independent Directional Pilot Protection for Multiterminal HVDC Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11126880</link><description>The application scenarios of high-voltage direct current systems are becoming increasingly diverse, featuring complex and variable topologies as well as boundary conditions. Existing single-ended protection methods for dc lines cannot ensure selectivity of operation in the absence of line boundaries. The pilot protection can identify faults without relying on line boundaries, but it generally depends heavily on precise system parameters or requires a cumbersome threshold value selection process. This study analyzes the transient impedance phase-frequency characteristics of dc systems after faults under three typical scenarios, i.e., no boundary, dc reactor boundary, and dc filter boundary. Based on the polarity characteristic of high-frequency transient power during forward and backward faults, a novel directional pilot protection for dc lines is proposed. Compared to existing methods, this approach does not depend on system parameters or boundary elements, and eliminates the need for threshold setting, significantly reducing the complexity of engineering implementation and maintenance. Finally, a prototype of the fast directional pilot protection device is developed based on the proposed method, and extensive hardware-in-loop testing is conducted on the real time digital simulator platform to validate its operation performance.</description></item><item><title>A Simultaneous Diagnosis Method for Multiple Faults of Modular Multilevel Converters Based on Residual Trajectories</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11127123</link><description>Since the residual amplitude contains limited information, traditional model-based diagnosis methods have the problem of multifault confusion caused by the coupling of fault characteristics. Therefore, this article proposes a simultaneous diagnosis method for multiple faults of modular multilevel converters based on residual trajectories. First, the residual mathematical model under different faults is established, and the variation law of time-domain characteristics and statistical characteristics of residual signals is revealed. Then, by combining the Pauta criterion and continuous outlier verification, a highly robust fault detection criterion is designed. Furthermore, a fault classification method based on the residual standard deviation-expectation trajectory is proposed, which can effectively identify IGBT open-circuit faults, current sensor faults, and arm inductor short-circuit faults. In addition, to locate multiple IGBT open-circuit faults, a fault location method based on the contribution rate of residual outliers is proposed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified through simulations and experiments.</description></item><item><title>Influence of Moisture Absorption on Power Cycling Capability of IGBT Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11130366</link><description>Power cycling test (PCT) is one of the most important tests to evaluate the packaging reliability of power electronics, which is much closer to the actual working condition when coupled with moisture stress. With Si-IGBT modules packaged in EasyPACK, it was observed that devices under test (DUTs) reached a saturation state of moisture absorption approximately 60 h after the start of temperature/humidity storage in 85 &#176;C/85% relative humidity (RH) environment by monitoring the DUTs&#8217; weight gain. Then, three groups of experiments (Group 1: DUTs without preaging; Group 2 and Group 3: DUTs were preaged with storage in 85 &#176;C/85% RH environment for 256 and 500 h, respectively) were designed to investigate how the power cycling capability of devices would be affected by continued storage after saturation. Experimental results show that the power cycling lifetime of devices decreases significantly after 85 &#176;C/85%RH storage, but it does not decrease further after the saturation is reached. Further analysis of the failure mechanism of the devices shows that the solder layer aging is almost not affected by continued storage after saturation, but bond wire degradation is deepened, resulting in an increase in the on-voltage drop of devices at the early stage of the PCT.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Multifault Diagnosis Method for SRM Drives in Electrified Powertrains</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11147140</link><description>Switched reluctance motors (SRMs) are recognized as a promising technology for electrified transportation due to their fault-tolerant and rare-earth free features. In transportation applications, particularly in powertrains of the railways and aircraft, the reliability of every component in the motor drive system is of paramount importance. Existing state-of-the-art diagnostic approaches address faults in each component separately, leading to increased system complexity. Therefore, a single algorithm for real-time diagnosis of multiple component faults becomes an attractive solution. This article presents a simple yet comprehensive technique for detecting and locating nearly all potential electrical faults and current sensor faults in SRM drives at their earliest stages. The proposed diagnostic scheme can effectively identify ten failure cases, including open-circuit and short-circuit faults in power switches, power diodes, phase winding open-circuit faults, and zero-output current sensor faults. Fundamental current and modified dc-bus currents are used for developing fault features, thereby avoiding additional costs and complexity. Digital logic judgments are developed based on the measured currents for fault localization. Simulation studies and rigorous experiments are conducted on a three-phase 12/8 SRM drive system to validate the feasibility and superior performance of the diagnostic scheme.</description></item><item><title>Degradation Detection of a DC/DC Buck Converter Based on Feature Extraction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11153983</link><description>DC/DC converters play a crucial role in electronic systems by providing the necessary power support and ensuring the proper operation of devices. During operation, the converter is exposed to environmental factors, such as temperature and humidity, leading to component degradation and subsequently posing a threat to system reliability and functionality.

When the voltage conversion ratio is mismatched, the conventional symmetric phase shift modulation method has a narrow zero voltage switching (ZVS) range, low light-load efficiency, and uncontrollable inductor current oscillations caused by abrupt changes in variables during mode switching. In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, an extended dual side asymmetric phase shift modulation (EDAPSM) and smooth mode transition method is proposed in this article. Analytical solutions over the entire power range are derived based on the proposed approximation method. The inherent cause of variable discontinuities during mode transitions is identified, and a novel approach to achieve smooth mode switching is presented, thereby improving the efficiency of the DAB converter over a wide voltage range, particularly under light-load conditions. A 1-kW DAB prototype is constructed, and the modulation method can achieve a maximal efficiency of 98.03%.

However, under light-load conditions, traditional pulse-frequency modulation (PFM) fails to regulate the output voltage properly, leading to high switching frequency and low efficiency. Though several new modulation strategies have been proposed to improve light-load efficiency, challenges such as narrow voltage regulation range and increased hardware complexity still exist. To overcome these issues, this article proposes a novel optimized dual duty-cycle modulation (DDCM) for the 3ph-LLC. By separately controlling the duty cycle of primary and secondary switches, the converter has two degrees of freedom. Time-domain analysis of DDCM proves that the 3ph-LLC can achieve a wide voltage gain range under light-load conditions due to the load-independent characteristics. Furthermore, based on theoretical analysis, a closed-form optimization strategy is introduced to enhance light-load efficiency. The strategy maintains zero-voltage switching and minimizes the circulating current. Finally, a 4.5-kW experimental setup was built to verify the effectiveness of DDCM. The results show that DDCM improves efficiency over the entire load range compared with PFM. At 10% load, DDCM maintains high efficiency over a wide voltage range, reaching up to 93%. In addition, detailed loss analysis and performance comparison are conducted to verify the superiority of DDCM.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Variable-Level ANPC Inverter With Capacitor Voltage Reconfiguration Method for 2 kV Photovoltaic Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11123155</link><description>The 2-kV photovoltaic (PV) system is widely regarded as the next evolution for megawatt-scale PV systems, enabling higher rated power.

In addition, to maximize overall efficiency across the full maximum power point tracking voltage range of PV arrays, a capacitor voltage reconfiguration strategy and a unified adaptive-level PWM method are proposed. These approaches optimize the switching voltage stress distribution between 1200- and 1700-V devices, significantly enhancing the efficiency of the proposed VL ANPC inverter. Simulation and experimental results validate that the proposed inverter, along with its modulation and control methods, offers a competitive and viable solution for 2-kV PV applications.</description></item><item><title>A Dual-DC-Port Dual-Output Converter for PV-Battery Hybrid System and Its Flexible Power Management Strategy Based on Virtual SVPWM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11134833</link><description>The dual-dc-port dual-output converter for photovoltaic (PV)-battery hybrid system is proposed in this article.

First, the operating modes of PV and battery for the dual-dc-port dual-output converter are analyzed, and the effective switching states of two sets of outputs are analyzed. Then, to achieve the flexible power management between PV, battery and two sets of ac loads, the virtual space vector pulsewidth modulation is proposed. In order to reduce the voltage vector arrangement combinations between two sets of outputs, the idea of topological decoupling and switch driving signal splicing is proposed, which can greatly reduce computational complexity and program programming. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified through experimental results.</description></item><item><title>A Three-Level Hierarchical Power Smoothing Control Strategy for Pavement Photovoltaics Under Vehicle Shadow Disturbance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11141728</link><description>In this article, a three-level hierarchical power smoothing control strategy is proposed for optimizing the pavement photovoltaic (PV) power fluctuation under vehicle shadowing disturbance.

However, existing control schemes are always executed under mixed reference frames, where the grid-forming control on the ac side is implemented in the rotating frame, and the power allocation control on the dc side is implemented in the stationary frame. This coupled feature, operating under the mixed reference frame, leads to excessive port power ripple and poor dynamic performance. Given this, this article proposes a dual synchronous rotating frame (DSRF)-based power allocation control strategy that achieves low port power ripple and fast dynamic response, where the control objectives on both the ac side and dc side are realized on the rotating frame. In the proposed DSRF-based strategy, the SSMPI is decoupled into dual subinverters, with each subinverter managed independently in a synchronous rotating frame. The sum of the $d$-axis and $q$-axis components for the subinverters is used for grid-forming control on the ac side, and the magnitude of $d$-axis and $q$-axis components of the subinverter is employed for power allocation control on the dc side. The range for power allocation capability of the SSMPI with the proposed DSRF-based strategy is also analyzed. Experimental results show that the port power ripple can be reduced by approximately 11.69%, and the dynamic response is significantly improved with the proposed DSRF-based strategy.</description></item><item><title>Harmonic Current Suppression of the Semicontrolled OW-PMSG Systems by Eliminating the Current Zero-Crossing Duration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142770</link><description>In this article, a modified semicontrolled open-winding permanent magnet synchronous generator (OW-PMSG) system is established by combining fully-controlled converter and semicontrolled rectifier, and a novel two-mode control strategy is proposed to suppress the harmonic current caused by the current zero-crossing duration.

This article presents a new modulation method for single-stage DAB microinverters, allowing for substantial reductions in both the required decoupling capacitance and the input current ripple without hardware modifications. This is achieved by repurposing the inherent primary-side dc-blocking capacitor as an active decoupling capacitor. The operating principles of the proposed modulation scheme are comprehensively analyzed, and an automatic decoupling control system based on large-signal modelling is designed. A 500 W experimental prototype is built for validation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed modulation method reduces the decoupling capacitor volume by 75% and decreases the double-line frequency pulsation in the input current by 96%, thereby improving the circuit&#8217;s power density and MPPT accuracy.</description></item><item><title>A Graph-Based Methodology for the Programmable Construction of ZVT Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11151198</link><description>Zero voltage transition (ZVT) is a soft switching technology renowned for its superior performance.

While prior studies focus on steady-state output dependence on coil positions, they overlook transient dynamics under multicoupling changes. This article bridges this gap by developing a transient model using the extended describing function method to capture multi-coupling effects, extracting dominant poles and mode frequencies. By decomposing nonlinear coupling coefficient variations into sinusoidal inputs linked to motion speed, the model reveals that the dominant mode frequency significantly exceeds the coupling variation frequency, suggesting a response closely aligned with steady-state behavior. This enables a detailed parametric study of motion speed, output filter capacitance, start-up acceleration, input voltage, and load resistance, precisely quantifying their impacts on inverter current fluctuations and output voltage stability across diverse operating conditions. Experimental results obtained under various values of these parameters on a DWPT test platform demonstrate strong agreement with the model predictions. These findings confirm the model&#8217;s accuracy and practical value for guiding system design and improving overall performance.</description></item><item><title>Experimental Investigation-Based Practical Design Guideline of 50 kW Three-Phase AC/DC Converter for Fast Charger Power Module</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11122415</link><description>The demand for high-power dc fast chargers has increased to reduce electric vehicle charging time, driving the active adoption of power modules to enhance charger power capacity. As the power capacity per module increases and the number of parallel modules decreases, the overall system volume and cost are reduced.

The full-bridge totem-pole dual-active-bridge topology offers promising prospects due to its compact integration and simplified control. However, conventional phase-shift modulation schemes fail to fully harness its potential and overlook the impact of initial inductor current coupling on grid current quality, control accuracy, and overall efficiency. This article proposes an optimized asymmetric extended phase-shift modulation scheme, which constrains the initial inductor current under traditional open-loop natural power factor correction requirements. The proposed scheme decouples initial inductor currents across adjacent switching cycles while minimizing peak-to-peak current through a multiobjective optimization approach. As a result, both converter efficiency and grid current quality are significantly improved. Experimental validation on an 800 W prototype confirms the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed scheme. Under 350 V dc voltage and full-load condition, the proposed scheme notably enhances grid current performance and achieves peak efficiency improvements of 5.38%, 1.85%, and 0.78% in forward operation, and 5.57%, 1.89%, and 0.77% in reverse operation, compared to conventional SPS, EPS, and TPS schemes, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Design of a Condensed Buck&#8211;Boost Converter Utilizing Monolithic Bidirectional GaN Switches</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11146626</link><description>Many next-generation power converters require wide-range operation, capable of bidirectional power flow combined with buck and boost mode operation; thereby, supporting integration of renewable energy sources and storage on the grid and within electric drivetrains.

The superiority of the proposed system is that the direct ac&#8211;ac converter cell is deeply integrated with the multiwindings line frequency transformer, which not only effectively diminishes the switches quantities, but also avoids the use of additional isolated transformers when it is applied to distribution network. The proposed B-HVO inherits the strengths of converters fast response and line frequency transformers long-life. The B-HVO has much system reliability because the direct ac&#8211;ac converter cell has no shoot-through and commutation problems. In addition, the converter uses four switches and only two switches are switched at high frequency during each half-cycle of input voltage, which evidently reduces the total switching losses.

By eliminating the need for large capacitors, this design facilitates a more compact physical layout. However, the complexity inherent in modulation strategies frequently gives rise to substantial three-phase current harmonics, which adversely affect system performance.

Finally, the validation of this strategy was conducted on a three-phase 800 W prototype. Experimental outcomes demonstrated a Total Harmonic Distortion below 2% using a single DSP controller, corroborating theoretical model which predicted a reduction in current stress to 84% of its initial level, and the peak value of low-frequency fluctuation is reduced to 72&#8211;78%.</description></item><item><title>Synchronous Switching and Control of WPT Systems With an Active Rectifier Based on Recursive Current Tracking</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11113404</link><description>The control of wireless power transfer systems with an active rectifier can be implemented on the secondary side, which avoids the need for real-time wireless communication between the primary and secondary sides to construct the feedback loop, thus facilitating the control design. However, in secondary control we encounter the challenge of synchronous switching. In this article, a data-based approach is proposed to address this challenge, which first applies a recursive algorithm to estimate in real time the amplitude and phase of the input current of the active rectifier from sampled data, then generates the driving signals based on the estimated phase for the active rectifier to control the relative phase angle between the input voltage and current of the active rectifier, and finally performs secondary phase-shift control to regulate the load power. The recursive algorithm for current tracking has the merits of relying on data only, so it requires less peripheral circuit components, and shows high accuracy in current phase detection and synchronous switching because the current parameters are optimized in a minimal prediction error sense. Moreover, it also shows good tracking ability under conditions, such as system detuning, harmonic distortion, primary&#8211;secondary frequency mismatch, etc. At the same time, it has a moderate computational burden, each recursion consuming about 416 clock periods when implemented on the 200-MHz digital signal processor TMS320F28377D. To facilitate control design, a low-order model is identified from sampled data to characterize the dominant dynamic behavior of the system and, then, used to tune the proportional&#8211;integral&#8211;derivative control parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is validated on a 1.5-kW level prototype.</description></item><item><title>Reconfigurable Topology Design for WPT Systems With Constant Power Output Characteristics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119066</link><description>In special operating conditions such as oil and gas wells and seawater environments, wireless power transfer (WPT) technology offers distinct advantages over wired systems due to its freedom from cable constraints. However, the complex external conditions and dynamic usage scenarios can lead to vibrations and displacements of the coupling mechanism, resulting in fluctuations in output power that impact the performance and safety of the WPT system. To address the harsh underground environment, this article aims to enhance the WPT system&#8217;s displacement resistance and achieve constant power output. We model the T-type and &#960;-type topologies using equivalent circuit concepts, establishing the relationship between output power, compensation topology branch parameters, coupling coefficients, and load, providing a design framework for stable power output. Subsequently, we design a three-layer helical coil structure to stabilize the coupling coefficient under axial displacement. Additionally, we propose a reconfigurable topology WPT system on the secondary side, which maintains constant output power despite significant variations in coupling coefficients. Finally, we construct an experimental prototype with a constant power output of 70 W to examine the dynamic power output characteristics in the axial direction. The experimental results indicate that the WPT system, with a coupling coil offset of 15 mm, exhibits an output power fluctuation of less than 8%, consistently remaining within the set &#177;10% range. Compared to the system using a single topology, the output power fluctuation is reduced by 11.5%, and the system achieves a maximum efficiency of 91.2%. This demonstrates the effective stabilization of the output power. Additionally, the switching process is sufficiently stable to meet the operational requirements.</description></item><item><title>Comprehensive Analysis and Wide Range Operation of ZVS and Quasi-ZPA in Wireless Power Transfer System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11123176</link><description>To reduce switching loss and minimize backflow power, zero voltage switching (ZVS) and zero phase angle (ZPA) technology are normally implemented in wireless power transfer (WPT) systems. However, traditional concepts of ZPA and ZVS are usually independent and misleading, lacking clear and strict theoretical explanations. More importantly, the design of ZPA circuit parameters is usually based on fundamental harmonic analysis in the frequency domain. To tackle this problem, first, comprehensive analysis of the relationships among ZVS, ZPA, and quasi-ZPA (time-domain) are discussed in detail. Second, an impedance factor $\delta$ based on multiharmonic analysis is proposed to evaluate the input current characteristics of WPT systems under different topologies and load conditions. Third, $\delta$ is associated with quasi-ZPA, and the boundary value $\delta _{\mathrm{th}}$ required to achieve quasi-ZPA is defined. Finally, an experimental prototype with $1 \,\mathrm{\text{kW}}/85 \,\mathrm{\text{kHz}}$ is built to verify the analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that the impedance factor $\delta$ proposed is consistent with the theoretical analysis regarding its influence on the input current waveform characteristics of the WPT system. In addition, phase shift control enables constant power output and ZVS across a wide load range.</description></item><item><title>Constant Current, Constant Voltage, and Constant Power Control for Wireless Power Transfer Systems in PT-Symmetric and PT-Broken State</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11124309</link><description>The parity time (PT) symmetric magnetic coupling wireless power transfer (MC-WPT) system has received great attention due to its high position robustness and high transfer efficiency. However, it cannot achieve constant output under load disturbances and the transfer range is limited by critical coupling. To address these problems, a novel constant current (CC), constant voltage (CV), and constant power (CP) control method for MC-WPT systems is proposed, which is applicable to arbitrary PT-symmetric state. First, the impedance and energy efficiency characteristic of the system in both PT-symmetric and PT-broken states are analyzed. And then front-end parameter identification methods are proposed for each state. Based on this, control strategies for CC, CV, and CP are developed. Simulation and experiments confirmed the following: First, the proposed method takes into account both mutual inductance and load disturbances; second, it is applicable to both PT-symmetric and PT-broken state, without being restricted by critical coupling; third, it can achieve CC, CV, or CP output as needed, without the need to switch system topologies or alter control algorithms; fourth, it maintains high efficiency output, unaffected by factors, such as frequency splitting; and finally, the control is simple and does not require any secondary-side information.</description></item><item><title>Self-Oscillating Wireless Battery Charging Systems With Locking Equilibrium Points</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11127127</link><description>This article presents a self-oscillating control method with locking equilibrium points for series-series compensated wireless power transfer (WPT) systems designed for battery charging. Previous studies indicate that frequency bifurcation in the WPT system reveals three zero-phase angle (ZPA) frequency points, which act as equilibrium points in self-oscillating systems. This phenomenon can cause the system to switch between different ZPA points, potentially leading to fluctuations in output power, current oscillation, or instability. The analysis in this article focuses on the frequency characteristics of the WPT system under battery/voltage loads, highlighting significant differences compared to systems with resistance loads. Notably, multiple equilibrium points exist only within a narrow range of input impedance angles. A self-oscillating control strategy is proposed to lock the WPT system at a specified equilibrium point by comparing the designed sending side current to generate pulsewidth modulation signals. The locked equilibrium point is positioned close to the highest ZPA frequency point, ensuring robust misalignment tolerance and near-maximum power output. Moreover, the approach enables zero-voltage switching across the entire operational range. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through both simulation and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Maximum Power Point Tracking for Subway Rail Potential-Based Energy Harvester Using the Open Circuit Voltage Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11130630</link><description>Sensors are used in the dc metro system for monitoring. Still, there is a problem of high costs using cable and battery power supply, while achieving self-powered technology through ambient energy harvesting is difficult on underground tracks. To address this issue, considering that the rail in the subway dc power supply system has a certain potential relative to the ground, this work proposes a subway rail potential-based energy harvester (RPEH). An energy harvesting equivalent circuit is constructed to analyze the output characteristic of the rail potential. To achieve maximum energy harvesting, the open-circuit voltage method is applied. However, the open-circuit voltage method requires disconnecting the energy harvesting device to obtain the open-circuit voltage. To significantly shorten the open-circuit monitoring time, this work designs an energy harvesting device based on a two-stage mosfet structure. In addition, the energy harvesting circuit fully utilizes low-power analog discrete components without relying on programmable controllers, thereby reducing system complexity and power consumption. The experimental results show that the RPEH can quickly track the optimal energy point under varying voltage levels and reduce the open-circuit detection time to less than 2 ms. It demonstrates that the proposed method can achieve maximum power point tracking, rapid response, and low power consumption, meeting the power supply needs of underground track sensors.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Optimization of Wireless Power and Information Dual Transfer in Multicoil System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11134808</link><description>In magnetically coupled resonant (MCR) wireless power transfer systems, intermediate coils are used to extend power transfer distance.

The energy transfer structure of the system is an integrated magnetic-electric coupler, which consists of double-D coils and C-shaped plates. The concave ferrite is attached to the backside to enhance magnetic coupling strength and reduce eddy current loss induced by leakage flux within the plate. To facilitate constant current/constant voltage (CC/CV) mode switching for underwater equipment batteries, the S/LCL-S compensation network is designed, enabling simple switching control. Both CC and CV modes exhibit constant power output characteristics with high misalignment tolerance. The operating principle of the proposed UHWPT system is analyzed in detail, and the power fluctuation factor &#945; considering mutual inductance and mutual capacitance as well as the zero-phase angle condition of the system are derived using the fundamental harmonic approximation. A system design method with high misalignment tolerance based on parameter &#945; is proposed and validated through a field-circuit coupling model. Finally, an experimental prototype is developed, and the results demonstrate that the system achieves load-independent constant current and constant voltage outputs, with a maximum dc&#8211;dc efficiency of 88.2% when the input power is 255 W. And the output power variations in both CC and CV modes remain within 15% under 50% horizontal misalignment.</description></item><item><title>Theoretical Modeling of Magnetic Spring-Based Electromagnetic Energy Harvesters for Electrified Transportation Sensors: Analysis, Optimization, and Experimental Verification</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11139122</link><description>Traditional electromagnetic vibration energy harvesters (EMVEHs) typically exhibit a low output power and operate at a single frequency. As a result, they are only capable of harvesting energy at a specific frequency from the environment, which hinders further application of EMVEHs in practice. To address this vital problem, this article proposes an enhanced magnetic spring-based EMVEH, which uses the multimagnet structure with repelling magnetic poles to significantly improve the output power of the harvester. Complete theoretical models of the designed EMVEH are developed, which can accurately characterize the magnetic force and coil magnetic flux. In addition, magnetic field characteristics and kinematic properties of multimagnet structures are fully analyzed. The magnets and coils are optimized based on the developed model and analysis. Meanwhile, the optimal configuration of magnets and coils is obtained by theoretical results in different cases. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the theoretical model and the optimization method. The results show that the electromotive force (EMF) and output power have improved by 2.4 times and 5 times after optimization in case I. The EMF and output power of the optimal configuration of magnets and coils in case II have increased by 1.3 times and 2.07 times, respectively. The model developed in this article serves as a guideline to design and optimize the EMVEH with a multimagnet structure of any volume.</description></item><item><title>A Cost-Effective Simultaneous Wireless Power and Data Transfer System With High-Rate Half-Duplex Communication</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11143898</link><description>In simultaneous wireless power and data transfer (SWPDT) systems, which adopt coupling coils with taps, the selection of the tap position to obtain good performance of communication is a major problem. To solve the problem, this article proposes a novel SWPDT system based on tapped coils with ferrite cores. The proposed system is cost-effective while achieving high-rate half-duplex communication and improving power transfer efficiency (PTE). In the proposed system, additional wave trappers and coupling coils are not needed, reducing the costs and size of the system. A double-sided LLCC compensation topology is employed to filter most of the high-order harmonics generated by the H-bridge inverter and rectifier, while suppressing common-mode (CM) current.

Accurate localization is essential for selecting the optimal transmitting coils and enhancing overall power transfer efficiency. This study proposes a location identification method for ABWPT systems that utilizes passive beacon coils to improve the system's efficiency. First, a complete circuit model of the system is presented, encompassing both the location identification and power transfer models. Subsequently, the study introduces a detailed location identification method based on bidirectional wireless power transfer technology and a corresponding control strategy for the transmitting coil array to improve system efficiency. To validate the proposed methods, the system was tested under various misalignment conditions, including lateral, and longitudinal offsets of the receiving coil. The experimental results show that the load position can be precisely identified. When the receiving coil is not misaligned, the system efficiency is as high as 90.02%, and the charging voltage is 52.85 V. And when a maximum lateral misalignment of 75 mm occurs, the system efficiency increases from 0.4% (ABWPT system without control) to 14.63% (ABWPT system with control), a 14.23% efficiency improvement is achieved. With a maximum longitudinal misalignment of 65 mm, the system efficiency increases by 47.16% from 0.1% (ABWPT system without control) to 47.26% (ABWPT system with control).</description></item><item><title>Fixed-Frequency Parity-Time Symmetric Operation Using a Dual-Side Active Tuning Method for Wireless Power Transfer Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11146464</link><description>In conventional parity-time (PT)-symmetric wireless power transfer systems, capacitance drift, an unavoidable factor in practical applications, can induce detuning between the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx), thereby degrading system performance. In addition, significant frequency variations arising from the frequency-dependent nonlinear saturation gain can lead to regulatory noncompliance and complicate filter design. This article proposes a simple dual-side active tuning method to achieve fixed-frequency PT-symmetric operation. Synchronous series compensators are introduced to ensure balanced energy distribution between the Tx and Rx. Active matching adjustment is required only on the Rx-side compensator, whereas the Tx-side compensator self-adjusts automatically. Theoretical analysis indicates that both the output voltage and transfer efficiency remain robust against variations in compensation capacitance, self-inductance, coupling coefficient, and load. Moreover, a parallel inductor at the inverter output achieves zero-voltage switching across the entire operating range. Experimental results demonstrate that the system maintains a constant output voltage across a wide coupling coefficient range (0.109&#8211;0.518), even with over 14% variation in compensation capacitance and 10.68% variation in self-inductance.</description></item><item><title>A General Interface-Free Delayed Real-Time Simulation Method with A-Stability for Power Electronic Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10990197</link><description>The complex topologies, numerous nonlinear switching devices and the high-frequency characteristics inherent in power electronic converters cause significant challenges in real-time simulation.

However, the subsequent circulating currents generated by the common-dc-link and asynchronous carriers can lead to excessive harmonic distortion and power losses. To solve this issue, a multiobjective optimization based pulse-width modulation (MOOPWM) scheme is proposed in this article. First, a multiconstraint vector preselection criterion is developed to reconcile the targets such as eliminating circulating currents, diminishing common-mode voltage (CMV) amplitude, and executing the nearest equilateral/isosceles vector synthesis. On this basis, the optimal vector set is determined. Then, a novel carrier-based implementation strategy is developed to synthesize the above optimal vectors set of MOOPWM. The implementation strategy incorporates smooth segmented compensation to the reference signal alongside a nonclamping phase carrier exchange algorithm, which conducts the modulation with lower computational cost. Compared with existing modulation schemes, a simultaneous reduction of circulating currents, CMV and switching loss can be achieved with the proposed MOOPWM. Finally, comparative simulations and experiments on a 300-kW PITI fed FESS motor are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Predictive Control With Linear Power Distribution of Single-Stage Multiport Inverters for Hybrid Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10994407</link><description>Model predictive control (MPC) is a promising candidate for single-stage multiport inverters (SSMPI) control due to its capability to handle multiple control objectives of power distribution and stator current control under time-varying dc link. However, conventional MPC, which obtains the optimal control input by evaluating all the discrete switching states, experiences excessive port power ripples and a complex weighting factor tuning process. To this end, this article proposes a hybrid predictive control (HPC) with linear power distribution for the SSMPI to reduce power ripples of dc ports and eliminate weighting factors. In the proposed HPC, the stator current regulation of the motor is realized through tracking error minimization by considering the SSMPI as a single-source inverter, where the iteration time of the MPC can be sharply reduced. Besides, the power distribution of the dc sources is achieved by precisely splitting the predicted optimal voltage vector in the subinverters of SSMPI, and the dc port power distribution ripples can be significantly reduced through linear comparison of the predicted boundary powers. Moreover, the complex weighting factor tuning process is also eliminated due to the decoupled control structure in HPC. Extensive experimental results are presented to validate the advantages of the proposed HPC.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Stability Analysis of Single-Phase Grid-Connected Power Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988511</link><description>This article presents a comprehensive modeling approach for grid-connected bidirectional single-phase power converters controlled in stationary frame.

Triangular current mode (TCM) control enables the realization of zero-voltage switching. However, due to the considerable current ripple and variable switching frequency under TCM modulation, it is quite difficult to accurately detect, sample and control the inductor current. In this article, based on a buck APD circuit under TCM modulation, a voltage closed-loop control strategy combined with time prediction method is proposed, which eliminates the need to sample the dc bus current and the decoupling inductor current. The approach achieves effective harmonic suppression and full-range soft switching with easy control. In addition, the effect of turning off the APD circuit for a short period of time on switching frequency and harmonic suppression is explored. The proposed strategy is validated on a 600 W experimental prototype.</description></item><item><title>Large Signal Stabilization at System Level Using Port-Hamiltonian System Theory for Modular Islanded DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10989546</link><description>Modularity and unknown transmission line impedances in dc microgrids contribute to increased uncertainty, complicating system-level large-signal stability analysis. Passivity theory is recognized as a promising solution to this challenge, as it simplifies the large-signal stability analysis of dc microgrids by decomposing it into the passivity analysis of individual converters. The interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (IDA-PBC) approach, widely adopted based on the port-controlled hamiltonian (PCH) model, ensures that converters exhibit passivity in a closed-loop configuration. However, existing IDA-PBC methods fail to achieve input&#8211;output port passivity, preventing system-level large-signal stability due to unmodeled electrical interconnections and subsystem interactions. Additionally, these methods introduce singularities at equilibrium points because the PCH model structure is altered when deriving the unique mathematical expression for the duty cycle. This article proposes an IDA-PBC approach based on reference modification to address these issues. This controller accounts for electrical input variations within the closed-loop PCH model to achieve input-to-output port passivity. Furthermore, the reference for the converters is reconstructed to derive a unique duty cycle expression without altering the closed-loop PCH model, thereby avoiding singularities at equilibrium points. Finally, the system-level large-signal stability of the proposed control is validated through experiments.</description></item><item><title>3-D Negative-Sequence Current Reconstruction Method for DC Bus Voltage Ripple Suppression</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11003273</link><description>The negative-sequence components in the unbalanced grid will lead to the dc bus voltage ripple, as well as the grid current harmonics. Existing methods rely on the grid voltage, inductance, and rectifier voltage to calculate the compensation current or power to suppress the voltage ripple. Once the parameters are not accurately obtained, the performance of these methods will be affected. In this article, a 3-D cone model is established to describe the relationship between the negative-sequence active, reactive currents, and the dc bus voltage ripple amplitude. Based on this model, a 3-D negative-sequence current reconstruction method is proposed to suppress the dc bus voltage ripple. By detecting the point coordinates on the 3-D cone model, the positions of the cone vertices can be reconstructed, which means the negative-sequence currents that eliminate the dc bus voltage ripple can be found. Finally, the accuracy of the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed method are verified experimentally, and more than 94% fluctuating voltage can be effectively suppressed.</description></item><item><title>Partial Power Processing Converter Design With 99% Energy Utilization Efficiency for Sodium-Ion Batteries</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10989524</link><description>The wide output voltage range (e.g., 1.5&#8211;3.95 V) of sodium-ion batteries presents a challenge for converter design in terms of efficiency.

Through optimized parameter design, the proposed method achieves an energy utilization efficiency of up to 99.03%.</description></item><item><title>Predictive Hybrid Model for Enhanced Remaining Useful Life Estimation of PEM Fuel Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10994535</link><description>Fuel cell systems are emerging as a strong alternative to traditional power sources due to their high energy efficiency, greater energy density, and zero emissions. However, their relatively short lifespan has limited their widespread commercial use. Predictive methods for estimating the state of health (SOH) and remaining useful life (RUL) have been effective in extending fuel cell life. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, require system shutdowns, disrupting operations. To solve this problem, a nonintrusive hybrid machine learning model combining extreme gradient boosting (XGB) and random forest (RF) is proposed.

The novelty lies in combining the strengths of both algorithms, achieving better prediction accuracy and reducing errors compared to single-model methods. It provides continuous and scalable SOH and RUL predictions, helping improve fuel cell durability without interrupting operations. The model is tested on a fuel cell aging dataset, which includes data from static and dynamic conditions, and is validated by yielding root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of 0.00026 and 0.00127 for SOH and RUL predictions, respectively. Compared to standalone XGB and RF models, the hybrid approach demonstrates superior prognostic performance.</description></item><item><title>A Real-Time Updatable Gray-Box Energy Consumption Model for Underwater Gliders Considering Steady-State Dynamics Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981867</link><description>The energy consumption model of the underwater glider (UG), which depends on its gliding parameters, serves as a crucial foundation for motion planning and energy management. Developing a model that aligns with real-world application scenarios and offers high estimation accuracy is of great importance. In this article, we challenge the assumption of uniform oil bladder mass distribution, building upon the baseline energy consumption model. We separately analyze the kinetic energy of the piston and the cavity to quantify the coupled relationship between net buoyancy, movable mass displacement, and pitch angle. Using the kriging modeling method, we then train a single-profile gray-box model (GBM) for UG energy consumption. The GBM is not only structurally simple but also capable of online updating based on real-time gliding data using the recursive least squares algorithm to compensate for the effects of unmodeled factors. Data from hardware-in-the-loop simulation, high-fidelity dynamic model, and sea trials are used to validate the model&#8217;s estimation accuracy and online updating capability. The cosimulation results show that the GBM has good estimation accuracy and effective online updating, which is a significant advantage over the energy consumption model derived from conventional dynamics.</description></item><item><title>Capacitor RMS Current Reduction for Back-to-Back Three-Level Converters Based on Zero-Sequence Voltage Injection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10990119</link><description>Thermal stresses induced by high root-mean-square (rms) currents in dc-link capacitors significantly affect their lifetimes and compromise the overall reliability of converter systems.

The data-driven control strategy eschews the need for system dynamics, instead leveraging the experimental data to get efficient and relevant solutions. More specifically, the three-phase ac&#8211;dc power converter in this article is conceptualized as a class of discrete-time switched affine systems with time-varying affine terms. This methodology guarantees the convergence of the system state to a limit cycle, which is determined according to criteria of interest related to the steady-state behavior of the system trajectories, for instance, the angular frequency of the three-phase alternating current, the sampling period and the desired output voltage. Based on a switching multi-hifted-point-dependent Lyapunov function, sufficient conditions of experimental data dependence are derived to guarantee the state trajectories converge to a desired limit cycle.

This article proposes a fault detection and localization (FDL) method that utilizes a neural network based on SeparableConv2D with a dataset generated from three-phase circulating currents and SM capacitor voltages. Considering the crucial role of controllers in MMCs and their influence on signal behavior during normal and fault conditions, a comprehensive control framework is employed in two operational modes: grid-connected and RL load-connected. This also ensures that the FDL method remains independent of the modulation scheme. This article considers faults even when the faulty switch is outside the arm&#8217;s current path. Preprocessing techniques, such as K-nearest neighbors (KNNs) imputation, quantile transformation, and sliding time window (STW), are used to prepare the data for optimal neural network input. Model optimization uses the AdamW algorithm, with learning rates dynamically adjusted via the ReduceLROnPlateau method. This approach minimizes computational complexity by requiring only one training session while leveraging optimized network architecture and preprocessing techniques to enhance FDL speed and accuracy. Finally, simulation and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>An RL-Based Strategy for Optimal Power and Gas Flow Calculation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10945737</link><description>Operating the integrated power and gas systems necessitates solving optimal power and gas flow (OPGF) problem, which is notably challenging due to the inherent nonlinearity and complexity of both systems. This study introduces a novel approach to address the OPGF problem by integrating problem decomposition with reinforcement learning (RL)-based cutting plane techniques. The proposed strategy divides the original OPGF problem into a simplified OPGF (SOPGF) sub-problem and a power and gas flow (PGF) calculation sub-problem. In the constraint set of the SOPGF sub-problem, linear inequality constraints (i.e., cutting planes or cuts) are introduced, bounding the feasible region of the SOPGF sub-problem and thereby obtaining the optimal solution to the original OPGF problem. The cuts are determined using an RL algorithm, and the RL agent is trained to maximize the rewards estimated by the PGF calculation. To enhance the efficiency of the agent training, action selection method is utilized in the RL-based cutting plane approach. Case studies are performed to assess the proposed strategy in comparison to conventional methods across diverse test conditions, verifying that the new approach surpasses conventional approaches in both computational efficiency and feasibility.</description></item><item><title>Modelling of AC-DC Voltage Control Coupling and Adaptive Fault Ride-Through Method for VSC-HVDC Integrated Wind Farms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948156</link><description>During grid fault, the voltage source converter-based high voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) integrated wind farms should effectively support the grid voltage while ensuring the integrated system security. Existing studies have neglected the AC-DC voltage control coupling caused by the sudden change in the grid's complex impedance due to the fault transition impedance, which may lead to transient DC overvoltage, poor elevation of grid voltage, or active power loss of wind farms. A faulted grid equivalent model based on the virtual fault is established, and the mechanism of AC-DC voltage control coupling of the integrated system caused by the complex impedance of the faulted grid is found. A coupling model of the grid-connection bus voltage of the integrated system, maximum DC voltage deviation, and active power of the wind-end converter is established, and the quantification method for the maximum grid voltage support capability of the integrated system is proposed. Finally, the adaptive symmetrical fault ride-through method balancing between AC-DC voltage control is proposed. Through simulation verification, the proposed method can maximize the grid voltage elevation and minimize the active power loss of wind farms while avoiding DC overvoltage and the steady-state AC overcurrent of grid-end converter under the premise.</description></item><item><title>Performance-Aware Control of Modular Batteries for Fast Frequency Response</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947730</link><description>Modular batteries can be aggregated to deliver frequency regulation services for power grids. Although utilizing the idle capacity of battery modules is financially attractive, it remains challenging to consider the heterogeneous module-level characteristics such as dynamic operational efficiencies and battery degradation. In addition, real-time decision making within seconds is required to enable fast frequency response. In order to address these issues, this paper proposes a performance-aware scheduling approach for battery modules to deliver fast frequency response (FFR) support. In particular, the conduction loss and switching loss of battery packs as well as converters are captured within a mix-integer quadratic constrained program (MIQCP). The cycle-based aging model identifies the aging cost of battery modules during frequent cycling by introducing the aging subgradient calculation and linearization. Case studies based on real-world battery data show that the proposed scheduling approach can effectively reduce power loss cost by nearly 28%&#8211;57% and battery aging cost by 4%-15% compared to conventional methods, which can also enhance the SoC balance.</description></item><item><title>Meta Reinforcement Learning Based Adaptive and Interpretable Energy Storage Control Meets Dynamic Scenarios</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948374</link><description>As renewable energy becomes more widespread, energy storage systems (ESSs) play an important role in managing energy distribution and economic arbitrage. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL)-based scheduling methods face performance degradation or failure in highly dynamic environments due to their limited generalization capability, especially amid increasing fluctuations in renewable energy output, electricity prices, and load demands. This paper proposes a novel ESSs control framework based on Meta-Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL), comprising offline training and online adaptation phases. The offline training phase features a dual-loop update framework, acquiring a model with highly generalizable initial parameters through a multi-task learning approach. In the online adaptation phase, the model can make adaptive adjustments rapidly in response to environmental changes. Lastly, a Shapley Value-based Meta-RL (SMRL) method is proposed to perform an in-depth analysis of decision-making outcomes. Multiple dynamic microgrid (MG) scenarios were simulated using real data with added fluctuation factors for model training and testing. The proposed Meta-RL based model exhibits significantly better adaptability in various scenarios, achieving approximately 20% to 50% performance improvement compared to the traditional RL model. A detailed analysis of the contribution of features behind scheduling decisions shows alignment with human intuition.</description></item><item><title>Periodic-Enhanced Informer Model for Short-Term Wind Power Forecasting Using SCADA Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10955286</link><description>Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems can collect abundant information about wind farm operation and environment. To better make use of SCADA data, a periodic-enhanced informer model for short-term wind power forecasting using scada data is proposed. Firstly, to effectively filter out noise in SCADA data, a v-p curve-based method is adopted by incorporating a quartile approach to remove sparse outliers; a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is then employed to eliminate stacked outliers from the power curve. Secondly, a multi-feature input set selection method based on Maximization Information Coefficient is introduced to make better use of the SCADA system data by reducing the number of features. Thirdly, a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) is designed to extract the scalar projection of the input set, followed by fusing the local time stamp and global time stamp to build the periodic information enhanced prediction model embedding layer. Subsequently, the enhanced input set is fed into an informer model to predict future wind power. Finally, considering the multiple temporal scales structure characteristics present in the dataset, a multi-scale deep fusion module is established in the informer model to deeply integrate the features of different scales. It can simultaneously avoid the resource waste and overfitting problems caused by increasing the network depth. The experimental results, which are obtained from several deep learning methods on real SCADA data, demonstrate that the suggested approach has good predictive capability.</description></item><item><title>Computationally Efficient Model Predictive Control for Enhanced Primary-Level Management of Standalone Microgrids With Hybrid Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10955859</link><description>This paper proposes a highly efficient model predictive control (MPC) technique for primary-level control of a hybrid storage system (HSS) in a microgrid with renewables. Generally, active set (AS)-based MPCs are used to control HSS-based microgrid systems, which are computationally complex. The high-complexity prevents making control decisions within the sampling time, which negatively affects the robustness of the control system. Moreover, high complexity necessitates powerful controllers, which increase the system's overall cost and energy consumption. On the other hand, less complex controls, such as supervisory control, reduce the storage system's stability, reliability, and lifetime. The proposed method is a closed-form AS-based MPC that shares the mutual advantages of both AS-based MPC and supervisory controllers with additional robustness. It thus significantly reduces the computational complexity while being stable and reliable, improving storage lifetime, and having higher robustness compared to MPC and supervisory controllers. The proposed method is compared to modified AS based MPC, Hildreth quadratic programming (HQP), and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) based MPC recently employed for an HSS microgrid application. The analysis showed that the proposed method could significantly outperform the conventional MPC methods in computational complexity and robustness, as well as the supervisory controller in terms of reliability, stability, enhanced battery lifetime, and robustness.</description></item><item><title>Analysis of a Disturbance Event With Inverter-Based Resources Using EMT Simulations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964428</link><description>Increasing penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) necessitates newer methods of planning and analysis of disturbances. The existing phasor-domain transient stability (TS) analysis may not capture the dynamics of IBRs during fault events. In this paper, electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations using high-fidelity detailed model of power grid and one of the affected photovoltaic (PV) plants during the Angeles Forest disturbance in 2018 are performed. In these simulations, the processes to develop EMT models of power grid from traditional phasor-domain TS data and PV plant from collected data are described. Thereafter, using these simulations, the response of the PV plant during the fault event in 2018 is replicated and a sensitivity analysis is performed. The sensitivity analysis consists of making changes to the components within the PV plant and in the power grid to evaluate the impact they have on the response observed by the PV plant during the fault event. This analysis provides an understanding of the components that impact the operation of a PV plant during fault events and provide guidance to system planners on the studies that need to be performed to maintain a reliable power grid as new IBR plants are integrated.</description></item><item><title>Categorical Spatial Interpolation of Solar Irradiance for Regional Distributed Photovoltaic Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964342</link><description>High-spatial-resolution (HSR) solar irradiance forecast data is important for regional distributed photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting. Distributed PV sites are widely geographically distributed and the cost of obtaining HSR irradiance forecast data with full regional coverage is very high. Improving spatial resolution through interpolation based on limited sparse irradiance forecast reference points is a low-cost and feasible approach. However, existing irradiance spatial interpolation methods would produce large errors under variable weather conditions (e.g., cloudy) with limited reference points, because local abrupt changes in irradiance usually occur under such weather conditions due to cloud movement. This paper proposes a categorical spatial interpolation method to improve the accuracy of distributed PV power forecasting with limited sparse irradiance forecast data. The method first converts satellite-derived shortwave radiation images into binary irradiance maps through adaptive thresholding, then trains a 3D U-net model to predict future irradiance category probabilities for each grid. These probability maps dynamically govern two parallel interpolation processes: one using reference stations in predicted clear-sky regions, another utilizing stations in cloudy zones, with final irradiance values determined by probability-weighted fusion. Case studies on a real dataset verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Centralized Control for Paralleled VSCs With Grid-Forming and Oscillation Suppression Capability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10965541</link><description>Paralleled multiple voltage source converters (VSCs) are adopted in photovoltaic (PV) or energy storage systems, and may suffer from oscillation and fault disturbance issues under various grid conditions. In this paper, a centralized control frame is proposed to suppress the active power oscillation and support the grid voltage/frequency via grid-forming (GFM) control. A virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control is applied as the centralized controller, which communicates with local controllers. The mutual damping and power angle feedback are adopted in the local controller to achieve an accurate active power sharing. The influence of key parameters such as the communication delay and mutual damping are analyzed. Finally, the proposed control is verified though the simulation and hierarchical controller-hardware-in-loop (CHIL) experiments.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Pseudo-Decentralized Control of Wave Energy Arrays</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10965503</link><description>In control of wave energy converter (WEC) arrays, since the dynamics of different devices are coupled by radiation effects, there has always been a dilemma between using centralized control, with optimal energy production but usually overwhelming computation, or decentralized control, with acceptable computation but performance degradation. This paper proposes a pseudo-decentralized control strategy that is effective in energy production but efficient in computation. In this method, a centralized estimation-forecasting scheme is applied to provide global information on the wave excitation force (WEF) experienced by each device. Then, the optimal unconstrained array motion is calculated from the WEF information, to serve as an initial guess of the optimal constrained motion. Finally, the constrained control moves of each WEC are optimized decentralizedly using model predictive control (MPC). However, in contrast to conventional decentralized control, each local controller not only maximizes its own energy production, but also takes into account the energy it contributes, through radiation, to other WECs, given their anticipated motion. In this way, the proposed controller enjoys the same computational simplicity as decentralized control, but is demonstrated, through comprehensive testing, to be capable of achieving performance close to the ideal centralized control across a wide range of sea states.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Energy Storage Configuration for Primary Frequency Regulation Performance Considering State of Charge Partitioning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10965852</link><description>The proportion of renewable energy in the power system continues to rise, and its intermittent and uncertain output has had a certain impact on the frequency stability of the grid. Therefore, a multi-type energy storage (ES) configuration method considering State of Charge (SOC) partitioning and frequency regulation performance matching is proposed for primary frequency regulation. Firstly, the Automatic Generation Control (AGC) signal is decomposed and reconstructed using the variational mode decomposition (VMD) method. Specifically, by combining the charge and discharge characteristics of Li-ion battery and flywheel energy storage (FES), component signals of different frequencies are allocated to different ES systems. Secondly, a multi-type ES capacity allocation optimization model considering SOC partitioning is developed, with the objective function being the minimization of the whole life-cycle planning cost of ES. Finally, based on actual data from a region in North China, the proposed method is verified by analyzing case studies under different scenarios. The results demonstrate that the method can effectively reduce computation time, optimize ES operating conditions, and thus lower the whole life-cycle planning cost of ES.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Grid-Interactive Power Performance Enhancement Method for D-PMSG-Based Virtual Synchronous Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10966203</link><description>Virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control is widely applied in grid-interactive inverters due to its similarity to synchronous generators. The VSG frequency variation is delayed by the synchronous swing equation to provide additional inertia support, which also leads to a slower power response. When applied to wind turbines (WTs), VSG reduces their power tracking ability, compromises the wind power capture efficiency, and affects the dispatch commands execution. The response to external frequency causes more power changes in WTs, making it difficult for wind power capture to keep up due to the mass of the rotor and blades, bring extra operational risks for WTs. To address these issues, this paper proposes a hierarchical grid-interactive power performance enhancement method for D-PMSG-based virtual synchronous wind turbines (VSWTs). The power performance is enhanced by coordinating the synchronous swing equation and voltage excitation equation parameters. The grid-forming power flow and electromechanical status of the VSWT are integrated to extend the kinetic energy (KE) utilization limits to ensure the efficiency and safety of the VSWT during the KE utilization-based wind power capture regulation. The proposed method comprehensively improves the grid-interactive power performance of VSWTs, and the effectiveness has been validated through comparative simulations.</description></item><item><title>Novel Voltage Support Strategies for DGs in Hybrid AC/DC Distribution Networks Under Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10970419</link><description>According to the grid codes, the higher the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC), the longer duration that the voltage-source converters (VSC) can stay connected to the grid. In hybrid AC/DC distribution networks (HADNs), owing to the low capacity, VSC-based distributed generator (DG) closest to the fault point may fail to significantly support the voltage at the PCC through current injection. Therefore, other large-capacity converters such as flexible AC/DC converters (FACs) should also inject currents to help it. However, in resistive-inductive HADNs, the voltage support effect is related to the current phases of converters, and the fault conditions. In this paper, circumstances under two fault position categories (upstream and downstream fault positions of DG) for double line-to-ground fault and three-phase short-circuit fault are analyzed. The interconnected sequence networks of HADNs under these two fault positions are proposed. Based on the proposed networks, the optimal current phase angles of DG and FAC for maximumly supporting voltages at the PCC of the DG are proposed. Moreover, the line sequence impedance calculation method is proposed. The simulation results verify the proposed strategy. The proposed strategy is suitable for low-capacity DGs in resistive-inductive HADNs to achieve voltage support and fault ride-through.</description></item><item><title>Learning-Accelerated ADMM for Stochastic Power System Scheduling With Numerous Scenarios</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10971244</link><description>The increasing share of uncertain renewable energy sources (RES) in power systems necessitates new efficient approaches for the two-stage stochastic multi-period AC optimal power flow (St-MP-OPF) optimization. The computational complexity of St-MP-OPF, particularly with AC constraints, grows exponentially with the number of uncertainty scenarios and the time horizon. This complexity poses significant challenges for large-scale transmission systems that require numerous scenarios to capture RES stochasticities. This paper introduces a scenario-based decomposition of theSt-MP-OPF based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Additionally, this paper proposes a machine learning-accelerated ADMM approach (ADMM-ML), facilitating rapid and parallel computations of numerous scenarios with extended time horizons. Within this approach, a recurrent neural network approximates the ADMM sub-problem optimization and predicts wait-and-see decisions for uncertainty scenarios, while a master optimization determines here-and-now decisions. Additionally, we develop a hybrid approach that uses ML predictions to warm-start the ADMM algorithm, combining the computational efficiency of ML with the feasibility and optimality guarantees of optimization methods. The numerical results on the 118-bus and 1354-bus system show that the proposed ADMM-ML approach solves the St-MP-OPF with 3-4 orders of magnitude speed-ups, while the hybrid approach provides a balance between speed-ups and optimality.</description></item><item><title>Finite-Time Stabilization of Floating Offshore Wind Turbines Under Wind and Wave Disturbances by Adaptive Barrier-Function Fractional-Order Sliding Mode Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10972122</link><description>Floating offshore wind turbines harness more vigorous and more stable winds, making them a promising solution for clean energy. However, their stability is compromised by sea waves and sudden winds, reducing power extraction. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a finite-time fractional-order adaptive SMC for tension-leg platform wind turbines to enhance stability and efficiency. A fractional-order model ensures accurate system representation, while a barrier-function-based adaptive control strategy guarantees rapid, finite-time convergence, mitigates chattering, and suppresses external disturbances through real-time estimation. The proposed controller effectively stabilizes the system, helping to maximize power extraction. Simulation results in the MATLAB-Simulink environment demonstrate superior performance compared to conventional methods in terms of disturbance rejection and convergence speed. Furthermore, hardware-in-the-loop validation using a Speedgoat platform confirms the method's real-time feasibility and robustness under realistic operational conditions. The proposed approach offers a significant advancement in floating offshore wind turbines stability and control, ensuring efficient energy harvesting even under severe environmental disturbances. These findings contribute to the development of more reliable and resilient floating wind energy systems, supporting the transition toward sustainable offshore wind power.</description></item><item><title>A Distributed Dispatch of Bi-Directional Power and Hydrogen Systems for Enhancing the Renewable Energy Integration in Grid-Connected Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10977964</link><description>The accelerating transition to renewable-based power grids is critical for carbon neutrality. Centralized renewable energy deployment usually forms grid-connected microgrids with limited power exchange with the main grid for stability concerns, which results in inadequate utilization of renewable energy. With hydrogen becoming an indispensable energy component, power-to-hydrogen (P2H) technology has become increasingly prevalent for mitigating renewable energy curtailments. In this paper, we present a coordinated dispatch model for bi-directional power-hydrogen system (BDPHS) that considers the electrolyzer dynamics for hydrogen storage and hydrogen fuel cell systems. We propose an improved alternating direction method of multipliers (I-ADMM) method that uses MILP for coordinated dispatch of renewable and hydrogen systems in a distributed manner.

However, most existing methods face challenges in dealing with data scarcity and random fluctuations. This paper proposes an ultra-short-term distributed PV power forecasting method based on Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). Firstly, virtual distributed PV power data is generated with different spatial resolutions. Next, the generated data is used to pre-train a Transformer-based model for predicting PV power from 15 minutes to 4 hours. Finally, the model is fine-tuned on real PV stations with a small data volume. The attention mechanism can learn correlations from lots of historical power data by pre-training. Fine-tuning can realize lightweight deployment and accurate prediction on newly built PV stations, effectively dealing with data scarcity. Models with 12.63M and 103M parameters are pre-trained using virtual data, respectively. The experimental results on datasets from 3 locations show that when there is 1 mo real data, the average RMSE decreases by 37.22%, 32.92% and 10.87% compared with the LSTM, linear model, and Transformer-based model, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Allocation and Two-Level Control of Reactive Power for Balancing Voltage and Power Factor of Renewable Energy Stations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10980477</link><description>Renewable energy stations(RES) must satisfy voltage security and power factor requirements for safe and efficient operation. However, these requirements often conflict, posing challenges in practical applications. This paper first analyzes the constraints and identifies the boundary of RES voltage regulation capability under power factor constraints. Building on the analysis, an optimal allocation and two-level control (TLC) of reactive power is proposed. It integrates the optimization of reactive power compensator (RPC) with the coordinated control of reactive resources, thereby balancing voltage regulation and power factor. From the allocation perspective, an RPC optimization method is proposed to maximize the feasible voltage range of RES under varying active power conditions of RES. From the control perspective, a TLC scheme is proposed, combining station and unit control. At the station level, the controller features a mode-switching function and calculates the overall reactive power reference value. At the unit level, the controller coordinates the converter-interfaced generations (CIGs) and RPC. Case studies are conducted on a real RES project in Bazhou, Xinjiang, China. Matlab/Simulink and Opal-RT real-time simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method enhances both voltage security and economic efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Autonomous Voltage Regulation for Smart Distribution Network With High-Proportion PVs:A Graph Meta-Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10982124</link><description>Smart distribution grids with a high percentage of distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems often face severe voltage quality problems. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) presents great potentials in achieving optimal voltage level control in distribution grids with the advantage of learning without explicit modeling. However, when DRL is applied to active voltage regulation in distribution grids with a high proportion of distributed photovoltaic (PV) power generation, it encounters several challenges, such as uneven learning among controllable devices and environmental instability, which impede the convergence of DRL. In addition, traditional reinforcement learning represents the distribution network with vectors and ignores topology information. In this paper, we transform the voltage control problem into a partially observable Markov decision process, and propose a multi-agent meta-reinforcement learning algorithm based on graph convolutional networks to improve voltage quality by combining DRL with meta-learning (ML). By integrating ML, our approach allows agents to better predict the actions of other agents, thus mitigating the instability of the environment. To address the problem of uneven learning among agents, we incorporate a self-concern mechanism and a value decomposition method into the critique network. The proposed algorithm is validated through experiments on IEEE 33-bus, 141-bus, and 322-bus systems and compared with five other multi-agent DRL methods and model-based model predictive control algorithms.</description></item><item><title>FDCA-DSTGCN: A Wind Farm Cluster Power Day-Ahead Prediction Model Based on Frequency Domain Information Gain and Dynamic Trend Sensing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10982214</link><description>Accurate wind farm cluster power prediction (WFCPP) is of vital significance for new power systems with large-scale wind power integration. The current WFCPP modeling method ignores the important role of wind direction and frequency domain information, resulting in insufficient use of spatial information and difficult to improve the prediction accuracy. In order to solve the above problems, a day-ahead power prediction model for wind farm cluster power is proposed based on information gain in frequency domain and dynamic trend sensing. Firstly, a cluster division method based on graph theory and progressive fusion of multiple information is proposed, and a virtual information node is set up.

Finally, the proposed method is applied to a wind farm cluster in Inner Mongolia of China. Compared with the existing and traditional prediction methods, the normalized root mean square error of the proposed method is reduced by 1.13%&#8211;2.15%, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Assessing the Impact and Quantifying the Value of Flexibility in Transactive Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10989551</link><description>Distributed Flexibility (DF) is seen as a key tool in managing future distribution networks, but there are no comprehensive methods to quantify its value to stakeholders and impact on the network. Consequently, the potential costs and benefits of DF are uncertain, delaying the rollout of the concept onto real networks. This paper proposes a method to address that gap: a network-aware framework for modelling the interaction of DF with local and whole system markets to analyse the system performance in detail. The paper provides a set of mathematical models and algorithms to derive realistic supply and demand curves for flexibility in a distribution system, find the global equilibrium of multiple markets and services, model their impacts on networks, and perform cost-benefit analysis for stakeholders. The framework has been applied to a case study comprising a real network in England, forecast data of flexible demand and distributed generation, and the prices expected in the electricity system. The numerical study showed that DF can bring real value to all stakeholders when procured through markets; however, to maintain positive and consistent benefits to networks and stakeholders, appropriate price signals (i.e., tariffs and charges) must be designed for each network individually.</description></item><item><title>Coordinated Control of Grid-Forming Wind Turbines and Grid-Forming Energy Storage Systems for Power System Restoration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002600</link><description>Grid-forming wind turbines (GFM-WTs) provide a promising solution for the restoration of wind-integrated power systems owing to their fast restart and grid support capabilities. However, individual GFM-WTs rely on external GFM sources for self-start, and their GFM support capability may be hindered by wind power shortages, potentially causing restoration failures. To address these challenges, this paper combines GFM-WTs and GFM energy storage systems (ESSs) to construct a black-start source for power system restoration. The GFM-ESS can provide self-start conditions for the GFM-WT while also improving its GFM support capability to withstand wind power shortages and load restoration transients. To ensure the stability of the restored system, a coordinated control strategy is proposed. First, a pre-synchronization control is designed to enable the GFM-WT to seamlessly connect with the GFM-ESS. Second, a power system stabilizer is developed to mitigate the power oscillation between the parallel GFM-WT and GFM-ESS. Third, to coordinate their power outputs during the load restoration, a model predictive secondary frequency control considering the stability of the WT rotor speed and system frequency is presented. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can improve the stability and security of the system restoration process under wind power shortages.</description></item><item><title>Rotor Thrust Control for Large-Scale Wind Turbine in Near-Rated Wind Speed Region</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11003805</link><description>To limit the maximum rotor thrust in the near-rated wind speed region, this paper proposes a novel rotor thrust control scheme for large-scale wind turbines operating. It contains a rotor thrust identificator, a rotor thrust control loop, and a feedforward blade pitch controller. A simplified blade model is first proposed to achieve rotor thrust identification. Based on blade element momentum theory, the rotor thrust can be identified by the blade root out-of-plane bending moments. The rotor thrust control loop is then designed with the identified rotor thrust. Then, a feedforward blade pitch saturator is designed, called Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion based minimum Pitch Saturator (NDI-PS). It is realized by nonlinear dynamic inversion of the thrust coefficient curve. The simulation results exhibit outstanding performance of the proposed control scheme. Compared with existing controllers of NREL and Goldwind, power output is increased by 1% to 1.5%, while blade root and tower bottom loads are mitigated by about 4% .</description></item><item><title>Feature-Driven Microgrid Economic Dispatch via Solar-Induced Contingent Balancing Satisficing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11005474</link><description>For the multiple energy microgrid (MEMG), this paper builds an adaptive Wasserstein distance-based ambiguity set instead of characterizing its size for solving the economic dispatch (ED) problem considering uncertain solar outputs. With the ambiguity set, an electrothermal balancing satisficing (EBS) framework is proposed by defining a solar-induced contingent electrothermal balancing risk measure (SCEB-RM) to interpret the risk level for maintaining electrothermal balance under solar uncertainty. For comprehensive contingent cost targets, a multi-objective EBS is extended to refine the solar impact on electric and thermal energy resources, respectively, and provide the corresponding out-of-sample cost bounds. Using the realized solar data, a feature-driven EBS model is formulated by incorporating soft dynamic time warping-based k-means clustering into the ambiguity. A tractable counterpart is obtained by developing a solution approach on bilateral responsive affine resource adaptation, where satisfactory targets are specified by comparing with sample robust optimization as the baseline, serving as an instance. Using real-world datasets, combinations of IEEE test systems and thermal networks validate that EBS eliminates the risky condition of uncertainty while revealing the connection between targets and solutions. It is shown that cluster-wise information makes EBS withstand greater uncertainty as effectively as the state-of-the-art in most cases and sometimes better.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Mean-Corrected Recursive Estimation-Based Optimal DER Dispatch for Distribution System Voltage Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11004617</link><description>Recent advances in smart inverters offer opportunities to mitigate adverse grid impacts caused by high penetrations of distributed photovoltaics (PV) in distribution grids, such as voltage violations. This paper proposes a novel measurement-driven optimal power flow (OPF)-based distributed energy resource management system (DERMS) voltage regulation via recursive sensitivity estimation informed coordinated control of distributed PV inverters. The proposed approach leverages available grid and controllable DER measurements, eliminating reliance on system model information while being adaptive and robust to volatile operating conditions. A mean-corrected recursive ridge regression (MCRRR) algorithm is proposed for sensitivity estimation, continuously refining the sensitivity model through a closed-form solution. It effectively manages varying grid operating conditions, such as changes in power injections and topology reconfiguration, to facilitate a time-varying update of the Load Sensitivity Factors (LSF). The proposed approach is formulated as a linear programming (LP) problem and is thus scalable to larger-scale distribution systems.

Imposing stability constraints in scheduling models is crucial to maintaining secure operations. This paper develops a novel voltage and frequency stability constrained unit commitment (UC) model for power systems with heterogeneous regulation resources, including synchronous generators (SGs), synchronous condensers, condenser retrofitted SGs, and wind power generators with grid-following or grid-forming converters. The frequency stability constraints encompass critical metrics across the entire frequency response process, effectively capturing the unique dynamics of diverse resources. The voltage stability constraints prioritize the long-term stability of buses with low stability margins, particularly those heavily penetrated by RESs. Furthermore, the proposed model captures the inherent coupling between frequency and voltage stability, offering extensibility for broader applications. To ensure computational efficiency, nonlinear terms in the constraints are linearized using a piecewise linearization algorithm. The proposed two-stage UC model optimizes operational costs while maintaining system stability. Case studies on the modified IEEE 9-bus system and the IEEE RTS-79 system validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Damping Evaluation Method of the Power Systems Integrated With Wind Farms During the Sub-Synchronous Control Interaction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11005697</link><description>This paper proposes a distributed damping evaluation method (DDEM) to assess the damping distribution0 in doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind farms during sub-synchronous control interactions (SSCI). The proposed DDEM identifies sensitive control parameters of the DFIG wind turbines at oscillatory frequencies through the explicit expression of the system's damping loss factor (DLF). It also evaluates the damping contribution by calculating the distributed damping loss factor (DDLF) for each element or subsystem in real-time. Initially, this paper presents the DLF concept for basic vibration systems and extends it to oscillatory power systems. Subsequently, an analytical expression of the DLF in DFIG-based wind farms is derived by calculating the dissipated energy and the maximum transient energy at the sub-synchronous frequencies. The DLF is then decomposed into DDLFs according to the physical structure of the oscillatory system, facilitating the development of the DDEM to evaluate the damping contributions. The efficacy of the DDEM is demonstrated through two case studies: the modified IEEE first benchmark model on sub-synchronous resonance (SSR) and the Guyuan wind power system model in North China.</description></item><item><title>A Secure Distributed Computation of Combined Heat and Power Dispatch Based on Transformation Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11008674</link><description>The widespread utilization of combined heat and power (CHP) units creates a tight couple between the power transmission system (PTS) and district heating systems (DHS). Since PTS and DHS are always managed by different operators with information security concerns, there has been a growing interest in implementing distributed solutions for combined heat and power dispatch (CHPD). However, existing distributed algorithms require an exchange of information, such as CHP output and dual multipliers, between PTS and DHS, posing a potential risk of information leakage. To address this issue, we introduce a transformation-based method to mask the CHPD model, thereby masking the real economic and physical coefficients using random nonsingular matrices. We discuss the selection principle for encryption matrices to diminish the additional computational burden caused by transformation. Then, we develop an improved Benders decomposition method by introducing valid inequalities and strengthening Benders cut to efficiently solve the masked CHPD problem in a distributed manner. The proposed secure analysis proves that the proposed method can resist two common threat models in information security, including semi-honest adversaries and external eavesdroppers. Numerical simulations are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Capacity Planning of Hybrid Renewable Energy - CCHP System Considering Inter Seasonal Borehole Thermal Energy Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11008841</link><description>Combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) systems are recognized for their high energy efficiency, with utilization rates exceeding 80%. However, traditional CCHP systems often rely on microgas turbines, contributing to carbon emissions. In this paper, we design a hybrid renewable energy - CCHP system, where the electric load is provided by photovoltaic and wind power, and the heating/cooling loads are supplied by converting power to heat by heat pumps. Considering the seasonal variability of renewable energy generation, we introduce borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) into the CCHP system, transforming the ground into a thermal storage that stores excess energy during summer for use in winter. We formulate the problem as a two-stage robust model with decision-dependent uncertainty. Then, we develop a customized algorithm based on Benders decomposition to effectively solve this model and discuss the algorithm improvement techniques. Our approach is validated through a case study of an actual system in Ordos, China, where the effects of BTES integration, uncertainty budget value, and varying ratios of renewable energy are analyzed.</description></item><item><title>A Quantum Annealing-Based Three-Stage Scheduling Strategy for Multi-Stack Fuel Cell Hybrid Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11014234</link><description>Fuel cell hybrid power systems (FCHPS) face significant challenges due to the non-convex nature of their optimization problems, especially in high-power applications with multi-stack configurations that involve numerous start-stop decisions, introducing a high number of binary variables. To address these issues, this paper presents a quantum annealing (QA)-based three-stage scheduling strategy for multi-stack solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)-based fuel cell hybrid power systems (FCHPS). The proposed method decouples the decision-making process across different timescales&#8212;day-ahead, intra-day, and real-time&#8212;tailoring decisions to the dynamics of various power sources within the FCHPS. In the day-ahead stage, global predictions inform the startup and shutdown of SOFCs; in the intra-day stage, short-term predictions refine power outputs; and in the real-time stage, adjustments are made to respond to immediate operational conditions. Quantum annealing is introduced to expedite the solution of the large-scale, binary optimization problems inherent in multi-stack configurations. A OPAL-RT-based experimental platform is used to validate the proposed strategy. In addition, a comparison between the proposed method and conventional methods is conducted, indicating that the proposed QA-based approach significantly speeds up the computation process&#8212;being 49.89 times faster than the dual model (DMPC) predictive control method and 22.25 times faster than the Gurobi-based method. It also optimizes the overall operational cost, achieving a reduction in the total objective function value by approximately 10.62% compared to the Gurobi-based method, and by 14.66% compared to the DMPC method.</description></item><item><title>Statistically Feasible Joint Chance-Constrained Scheduling of Integrated Distribution Network and District Heating System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11021270</link><description>This paper proposes a statistically feasible joint chance-constrained scheduling framework for integrated power distribution networks (PDN) and district heating systems (DHS). The proposed method constructs data-driven uncertainty sets directly from samples, eliminating the need for prior distribution assumptions.

Additionally, we introduce a novel constraint-specific uncertainty set reconstruction technique. This technique refines the uncertainty set by incorporating optimization-relevant information. It significantly reduces conservatism while ensuring system violation probability requirements. Comparative studies with state-of-the-art uncertainty optimization methods demonstrate the advantages of our approach. The proposed method improves computational efficiency by two orders of magnitude. It also achieves more cost-effective solutions than the best-performing benchmark method.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Short-Term Solar Power Prediction Using Sky Image Sequences by a Residual Vision Reformer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11021656</link><description>The unpredictable nature of solar power generation, largely influenced by fluctuating cloud cover, poses a challenge to the stability of renewable energy systems. Considering this, accurate forecasting of solar power can lead to better grid management and operation. With the advent of deep learning models, various models have been suggested to enhance the ultra-short-term solar power forecasting performance. Given that cloud images offer more direct and comprehensive information about cloud patterns compared to the numerical weather prediction data, analyzing cloud images allows for more precise and efficient cloud change predictions, leading to a more accurate ultra-short-term solar power forecasting. In this way, aiming to enhance the forecasting performance, in this paper, we introduce a deep learning-based model, including three main blocks. In the first block, a Multi-Stream Video Vision Transformer (MS-ViViT) model is proposed for extracting different types of spatio-temporal features from the input image sequences. The output features from the first block are input to the second block, Fused Improved Reformer (Fused I-Reformer), including three Improved Reformer (I-Reformer) models equipped with a Fused Encoder as well as a new loss function for sequence learning. Finally, an Attentive Residual Fully Connected (ARFC) model is proposed for solar power value prediction. The comparison results with 36 comparative models on six real-world datasets using seven evaluation metrics confirm the effectiveness of the proposed ultra-short-term solar power forecasting model.</description></item><item><title>Dual Agent Framework for Scheduling Networked Microgrids Using DRL to Improve Resilience</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11021619</link><description>The widely reported increase in the frequency of high impact, low probability extreme weather events pose significant challenges to the resilient operation of electric power systems. This paper explores strategies to enhance operational resilience that addresses the distribution network&#8217;s ability to adapt to changing operating conditions. We introduce a novel Dual Agent-Based framework for optimizing the scheduling of distributed energy resources (DERs) within a networked microgrid (N-MG) using the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) paradigm. This framework focuses on minimizing operational and environmental costs during normal operations while enhancing critical load supply indices (CSI) under emergency conditions. Additionally, we introduce a multi-temporal dynamic reward shaping structure along with the incorporation of an error coefficient to enhance the learning process of the agents. To appropriately manage loads during emergencies, we propose a load flexibility classification system that categorizes loads based on its criticality index. The scalability of the proposed approach is demonstrated through running multiple case-studies on a modified IEEE 123-node benchmark distribution network. Furthermore, validation of the method is provided by means of comparisons with two metaheuristic algorithms namely particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA).</description></item><item><title>Sample-Wise Graph-Based Multivariate Short-Term PV Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11024230</link><description>Reliable short-term photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting is of crucial significance for the rational dispatching of power sources and the effective control of operating costs for the power grid. However, temporal misalignment and regression accuracy imbalance of PV power data pose significant challenges to the reliability of forecast results. In this study, multivariate PV power forecasting is investigated from the perspective of forecast model samples. Firstly, the extent of misalignment of a sample is parameterized by a time-delay vector. Subsequently, the sample-wise graph is defined to relate the time-delay vector with PV power data. Then, the time-delay vector is estimated by minimizing the smoothness metric of the sample-wise graph. Finally, a sample-wise graph-based sample weighting strategy is introduced to address the issue of regression accuracy imbalance. The efficiency of the proposed PV power forecasting scheme is validated through extensive experiments on real-world datasets. Comparison experiments suggest that the proposed scheme can achieve remarkably improved short-term PV power forecasting.</description></item><item><title>Error-Based Active Disturbance Rejection Power Control for Large-Scale Wind Turbines Under Pitch Actuator Performance Degradation Failure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11027442</link><description>This study addresses the critical challenge of constant power control for large-scale wind energy conversion system under the combined effects of pitch actuator degradation and multiple disturbances. In the paper, a novel fault-tolerant control strategy based on error-based active rejection control (E-ADRC) is proposed. The approach incorporates a composite control architecture, comprising a disturbance rejection tracking loop and a fault-tolerant compensation loop. Within the tracking loop, an enhanced E-ADRC algorithm is suggested which not only retains the robustness and ease of implementation of traditional E-ADRC but also significantly improves the attenuation of low-frequency wind disturbances&#8212;the turbine&#8217;s primary disruption. The fault-tolerant compensation loop applies independent control signals, derived from pitch angle residuals, to each faulty actuator, mitigating the extra fault disturbances in rotor speed tracking dynamics. This dual-loop structure enables the turbine to restore high-stability power output after a fault. Furthermore, the fault-tolerant compensation mechanism ensures that, even in cases of part of the three actuators failure, the previously misaligned pitch angles are synchronized, effectively suppressing the detrimental aerodynamic imbalance and reducing adverse loads. The superiority of this approach in enhancing power output stability and reducing structure fatigue damage have been validated through a refined hardware-in-the-loop test.</description></item><item><title>Grid-Forming IBRs Under Unbalanced Grid Conditions: Challenges, Solutions, and Prospects</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11027640</link><description>The penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) into the grid is experiencing significant growth. Their control behavior during unbalanced grid conditions can impact system stability and protection. This paper evaluates the performance of prevalent grid-forming control-based IBRs (GFM-IBRs) under unbalanced grid conditions and proposes novel insights in a novel framework. First, we investigate the potential impacts of grid-forming control-based IBRs (GFM-IBRs) on system dynamics, protection, and fault ride-through (FRT) capability under unbalanced grid conditions based on extensive literature review and through EMT simulations in benchmark systems with IBRs. To discover these impacts and accommodate unbalanced grid conditions, we implement a generic control structure for full converter-based GFM-IBRs under FRT mode, then perform a comparative analysis of existing solutions that include sequence decomposition methods, positive sequence current-limiting methods, negative sequence controls, and current coordination methods, to identify their capabilities and limitations through literature review and EMT simulations in a large-scale power system. Finally, key challenges and solutions are discussed, highlighting prospects for future research.</description></item><item><title>Probability Density Function Control of Frequency Fluctuations in Renewable-Rich Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029151</link><description>The stochastic nature of renewable energy sources (RESs) necessitates treating power system frequency response as a random process with a nonstationary probability density function (PDF). Based upon the stochastic distribution control theory originated by the second author, this paper proposes a novel stochastic controller to improve the frequency PDF in power grids when integrating a large amount of RESs, thereby minimizing the effects of uncertainties and enhancing overall system stability. The key idea is to manipulate the controllable power generation resources so that the frequency PDF is make to follow a target PDF by using the stochastic distribution control theory originated by the second author. The proposed method can easily be plugged into existing automatic generation controls for multi-area transmission grids. The proposed method is validated via a modified Kundar&#8217;s two area system and 240-bus Western Electricity Coordinating Council systems. The simulation results show that the proposed control shapes the frequency PDF narrower and sharper, leading to a notable improvement toward minimizing the effects of randomness and uncertainty during grid operation.</description></item><item><title>Collaborative Operation of Renewable Energy Hydrogen Production Systems Considering Balanced Utilization and Extended Lifespan of Multi-Electrolyzers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029129</link><description>To address the challenges of low efficiency, poor economic performance, and limited adaptability in renewable energy&#8211;coupled alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) systems, this study proposes a power&#8211;state rolling optimization strategy (PSROS) based on a two-stage optimization framework. First, the large-scale AWE system is divided into multiple modules to reduce the variable dimension of the optimization problem. Then, a simplified module-level optimal efficiency model is developed based on the efficiency characteristics of AWE units. Subsequently, multi-objective optimization models are constructed at the module and unit levels, comprehensively considering hydrogen production volume, lifespan degradation, and utilization balancing. Finally, a finite-horizon rolling optimization mechanism is introduced to solve the two-stage optimization problem, improving the continuity and rationality of scheduling decisions at the end of each optimization horizon. Annual case study results demonstrate that, under the non-battery scenario, PSROS improves system efficiency by 9.92%, 11.12%, and 3.81%, and reduces the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) by 4.14, 5.43, and 2.35 CNY/kg compared with the simple start-stop strategy (SSSS), array rotation strategy (ARS), and rolling optimization strategy (ROS), respectively. With battery integration, the system efficiency is further improved by 0.77%, and the LCOH is further reduced by 0.49 CNY/kg.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Scheduling of Integrated Electric-Hydrogen-Thermal Systems Considering Hydroelectric Power Plant Peaking for Hydrogen Vessel Navigation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11030854</link><description>Transporting hydrogen by vessels may be more cost-effective than hydrogen trailers and hydrogen tankers, but it is also more sensitive to environmental factors (e.g., river levels). In order to capitalize on the advantages of based-vessel waterway hydrogen chains, a new short-term scheduling strategy of integrated electric-hydrogen-Thermal systems considering the hydroelectric power plant peaking for hydrogen vessel (HV) navigation is proposed in this paper. First, a temporal-spatial operational model of waterway hydrogen chains is developed. In this model, the relationship between the electrolysis temperature, hydrogen production efficiency, and maximum available operational power of the reversible solid oxide fuel cell (RSOC) is modelled. The impact of the hydroelectric power plant underflow on HV transfer is also evaluated. On this basis, a flexible multi-day collaborative scheduling strategy of the electric-hydrogen integrated system is designed, where the main power source, i.e., thermoelectric plant (TEP), is allowed to operate in pure power generation mode or cogeneration mode to release the operation flexibility. This scheduling model is first linearized as a mixed-integer second-order conic programming (MISOCP) problem and then solved efficiently through a two-layer method. Finally, case studies on a modified IEEE 118-node power system verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Region of Attraction Estimation for Power Systems With Multiple Integrated DFIG-Based Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11031118</link><description>The lack of suitable modeling methods for power systems with multiple doubly-fed induction generator-based wind turbines (DFIGWTs) integrated has left the analytical description of the boundary of the region of attraction (ROA) of such systems largely unexplored. To address this gap, this paper derives an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model for a power system with multiple DFIGWTs integrated. The proposed electromechanical model is validated in a single-machine-infinite-bus (SMIB) power system and a modified 3 machine 9 bus power system with root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of less than 9.5% for trajectory comparisons with the full model, demonstrating that it accurately captures the low-frequency dynamics of the full DFIGWT model. Subsequently, the ODE model is transformed into a polynomial differential-algebraic equation (DAE) model using a nonlinear coordinate transformation. To estimate the ROA, an enhanced expanding interior algorithm (EIA) based on sum of squares (SOS) programming is applied. The feasibility of the proposed model, along with the appropriate conservativeness of the improved EIA, is validated using two test systems that include multiple DFIGWTs and synchronous generators (SGs). By comparison, it is found that the time cost of the improved EIA is reduced by around 17% while maintaining the accuracy. These results demonstrate that the proposed approach has significant practical implications for the integration of wind farms into power systems, and offers an efficient tool for transient stability analysis.</description></item><item><title>Extreme Probabilistic Solar Power Prediction via Localized Sample Structure Recognition and Generalized Error Estimation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11033220</link><description>The fluctuations and uncertainty of solar power constantly threaten the secure operation and economic dispatch of power systems. Existing end-to-end point or probabilistic solar power prediction methods mostly lack effective integration of the two approaches, and the latent error caused by machine learning (ML) techniques is rarely taken into consideration. Hence in this paper, a combined extreme probabilistic solar power prediction (EPSPP) scheme is proposed, by integrating point forecasting with extreme error estimation. Firstly, the localized sample structure recognition (LSSR) is conducted to determine the neighborhood of meteorological conditions, where feature weights of Euclidean distance measurement are allocated with respect to the valid mutual information (MI) derived by two-dimensional diffusion kernel density estimation (2D-DKDE). Secondly, with the neighborhood generated by LSSR, an improved localized generalization error estimation (ILGEE) algorithm is put forward to infer the real-time maximal second-order origin moment of solar power point forecasting error corresponding to designated confidence levels. Finally, the solar power at each temporal moment is deduced as distinct Gaussian distributions, by modifying the mean value and variance according to statistical principles. For the sake of the so-called &#8220;extreme&#8221;, the proposed scheme could maintain reliability even under circumstances of the worst ML model precision. Cases from a real-world solar power station in Oregon, USA, are used to validate its effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>A Mechanism-Based Convex Model of Fuel Cell Systems Considering the Effect of Auxiliary System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10976439</link><description>Fuel cell systems (FCS) are recognized as promising electric sources of power systems. However, existing FCS models are either nonconvex or inaccurate when the FCS is under heavy load. This letter proposes a mechanism-based FCS feasible operational area (FCSFOA) model, taking into account the decline in fuel cell efficiency and the dynamic power consumption of the auxiliary system. Therefore, the FCSFOA model is accurate both under light load and heavy load, and the average error is only 5.4% compared with the actual data. In contrast, the FCS linear model, the most commonly used in the dispatch of power systems, has an average error of 24.4% . Besides, the FCSFOA model is also convex, which is favorable for the dispatch of power systems.</description></item><item><title>Mutual Information-Enhanced NARX-NN Digital Twins for Power Electronics in Smart Grid Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11131160</link><description>This paper presents a systematic and innovative data&#8211;driven framework for constructing Mutual Information&#8211;enhanced NARX&#8211;NN Digital Twins (DTs) of power electronic converters, demonstrated on a DC&#8211;DC boost converter in continuous conduction mode under closed&#8211;loop voltage control. A Digital Twin Instance (DTI) of the inductance current is built via time&#8211;delay embedding of hidden dynamic attractors. Sampling frequency is optimized using self&#8211;Mutual Average Information (sMAI) to capture intra&#8211;cycle Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) dynamics. Input preselection uses correlation analysis and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), followed by delay assignment via sMAI and cross-MAI (cMAI). The False Nearest Neighbours (FNN) criterion determines the minimal embedding dimension. Two NARX&#8211;NN configurations (4D and 5D) are trained on a high&#8211;fidelity MATLAB&#8211;SIMULINK model including parasitics, filtering, and non&#8211;idealities. Although thermal and voltage variations are excluded to isolate modelling effects, the 5D model outperforms the 4D under both nominal and perturbed loads. In the frequency domain (up to 50 kHz), it improves amplitude tracking. Experimental validation via offline transfer learning reduces steady&#8211;state error to approximately  $\pm \,1\%$  and transient errors to a few percent, peaking at -13% in unseen saturation case. The resulting DTIs are lightweight (&lt;1 GFLOPS), delay-aware, and interpretable, enabling scalable real&#8211;time integration into converter&#8211;centric smart grid digital twin architectures without solving differential equations.</description></item><item><title>RoCoF and Nadir of Frequency Optimization Control for Cluster-Oriented Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142799</link><description>The cluster-oriented microgrids can better manage large-scale renewable energy integration systems compared to individual microgrids, the operation control of microgrid clusters (MGCs) under disturbances still face numerous challenges. Apart from the mainstream steady-state requirements, the transient performances of nadir of frequency (NoF) and the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) exhibit more practical significance. To this end, this paper proposes a multi-index optimization approach to provide an optimal control-design solution for MGCs, enhancing the system robustness and security. Firstly, steady-state stability conditions directly related to two-layer cooperative (TLC) control parameters are derived using a quasi-invariance property. Secondly, the control parameter related sufficient conditions to guarantee the NoF and RoCoF transient performance indexes are analyzed and formulated through a matrix inequality. Lastly, a multi-index objective function is designed to integrate all these conditions, yielding optimal control parameters that make all constraints hold. Real-time simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Secondary Control for DC Microgrids With Near-Infinite Constant Power Load Accommodation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11151627</link><description>In DC microgrids, constant power loads (CPLs) inherently exhibit negative impedance characteristics, which are widely believed to degrade system stability as their penetration level increases. Consequently, extensive research has aimed to establish safe upper bounds for CPL penetration. However, these upper bounds are typically derived as sufficient conditions, making them overly conservative. Moreover, when multiple DC sources are connected in parallel to a common DC bus, the simultaneous need for current sharing and DC bus voltage regulation further complicates system control. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel distributed secondary control method based on the dynamic averaging of virtual voltage drops (VVDs). The proposed method offers two key advantages: 1) It ensures both precise current sharing and voltage regulation in single-bus DC microgrids, even in the presence of mixed ZIP loads, i.e., constant resistive loads (Z), constant current loads (I), and constant power loads (P). 2) Unlike existing approaches that impose conservative limits on CPL penetration, the proposed method theoretically demonstrates that the safe upper bound for CPLs can be arbitrarily large, enabling the DC microgrid to accommodate an almost infinite number of CPLs without compromising stability. Both Simulation and experiment studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Safety-Guaranteed Voltage Regulation of Distribution Networks Using a Learning-Assisted Switching Tube Model Predictive Control Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11124582</link><description>This article proposes a learning-assisted switching tube model predictive control (S-TMPC) approach to achieve absolutely safety-guaranteed voltage regulation in distribution networks (DNs). In order to model time-varying operation modes, the switching dynamics have been introduced based on respective equilibrium points in DNs. Then, to quantify the safe operation region of each mode, an active learning algorithm with a reliable oracle is developed to estimate the safety-guaranteed reachable set, which simplifies the conventionally linear-matrix-inequalities-based (LMI-based) computation. Next, considering power disturbances of renewable energy generation, a tube model predictive control approach for safe voltage regulation is introduced, and its exponential stability condition is given. Once the voltage deviation exceeds the boundary of the operation mode, a learning-assisted switching mechanism, of which the switching action is enabled by admissible minimum dwell-time analysis of switches among safe reachable sets (i.e., pre-learned tubes) is developed to absolutely ensure a safe voltage regulation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed voltage regulation method is verified by representative simulations and experiment tests.</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid Imitation&#8211;Reinforcement Learning Framework for Optimal Operation of Soft Open Points in Unbalanced Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11131604</link><description>This paper proposes a hybrid actor-critic framework for the optimal operation of a phase-changing soft open point (PCSOP) in an unbalanced distribution network.

Finally, three real-life cases in China are studied to verify the effectiveness of both the model and solution method. This work highlights the importance of sizing optimization in enhancing the economic feasibility and production potential of large-scale ISDSE systems.</description></item><item><title>Weather Routing-Based Multi-Energy Ship Microgrid Operation Under Diverse Uncertainties: A Risk-Averse Stochastic Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11145936</link><description>The voyage environment, such as weather conditions, directly influences the propulsion load of a ship and even poses challenges to its safe journey. In this context, this article proposes a novel weather routing based operation approach for a multi-energy ship microgrid (MESM), which not only coordinates the heterogeneous onboard energy flows (e.g., electricity, thermal energy, green hydrogen, and freshwater) while also optimizing voyage route and speed based on dynamic weather conditions. In particular, a detailed weather-based route selection model and a weather-dependent propulsion load model are formulated, accounting for key environmental factors such as wind, waves, and drifting ice. To mitigate the risk against the uncertainties in environmental factors and cold ironing prices, a risk-averse two-stage stochastic programming integrated with a rolling horizon method is employed. In model solving, a tailored progressive hedging (TPH) algorithm is developed to enhance computational efficiency. Case studies based on a real cruise voyage in a Nordic country validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and the efficiency of the developed solution methods.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Reduction Method for Available Time Intervals of Large-Scale Demand-Side Resources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11121918</link><description>Incorporating demand-side resources (DRs) via virtual power plants into power system dispatch has become increasingly prevalent to increase power balancing flexibility. Nonetheless, diverse available time intervals for DRs impose substantial computational burdens for aggregation and may lead to infeasible dispatch after disaggregation. This work proposes an efficient reduction method for aggregating DRs with diverse time intervals and demand requirements while ensuring feasible dispatch. The method determines how to reduce the time interval ranges of all DRs to alleviate dispatch complexity. We reformulate an equivalent ILP problem with an available time interval matrix to reduce the problem scale. To further alleviate the computational burden, a fast approximation algorithm that combines interval clustering and weight selection is designed for large-scale DR aggregation. Numerical tests show that the proposed method maintains larger aggregated feasible regions to provide more flexibility than other inner-approximation methods, while maintaining feasible dispatch. Overall, the reformulated problem and fast approximation algorithm effectively reduce the computational time with a limited reduction in dispatch optimality.</description></item><item><title>Learning-Enabled Adaptive Power Capping Scheme for Cloud Data Centers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11123584</link><description>The rapid growth of the digital economy and artificial intelligence has transformed cloud data centers into essential infrastructure with substantial energy consumption and carbon emission, necessitating effective energy management. However, existing methods face challenges such as incomplete information, uncertain parameters, and dynamic environments, which hinder their real-world implementation. This paper proposes an adaptive power capping framework tailored to cloud data centers. By dynamically setting the energy consumption upper bound, the power load of data centers can be reshaped to align with the electricity price or other market signals. To this end, we formulate the power capping problem as a partially observable Markov decision process. Subsequently, we develop an uncertainty-aware model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) method to perceive the cloud data center operational environment and optimize power-capping decisions. By incorporating a two-stage uncertainty-aware optimization algorithm into the MBRL, we improve its adaptability to the ever-changing environment. Additionally, we derive the optimality gap of the proposed scheme under finite iterations, ensuring effective decisions under complex and uncertain scenarios. The numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method using a cloud data center operational environment simulator built on real-world production traces from Alibaba, which demonstrates its potential as an efficient energy management solution for cloud data centers.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Preserving Economic Dispatch in Microgrids via Robust Gradient-Tracking Over Directed Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11126159</link><description>Existing differentially private optimization algorithms for the distributed economic dispatch problem (EDP) often involve a trade-off between privacy performance and optimization accuracy. This paper presents a robust gradient-tracking based differentially private distributed algorithm to enhance both privacy performance and optimization accuracy for EDP. In particular, we employ solely row stochastic weight matrices to enable each agent to locally allocate weights to received messages. Moreover, unlike most existing approaches that rely on decaying noise, our algorithm integrates persistent noise into the exchanged information to enhance privacy performance. To mitigate the impact of persistent noise, we incorporate robust gradient-tracking techniques and introduce noise attenuation factors. By carefully selecting the step size and noise attenuation factors, we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves almost sure convergence while simultaneously ensuring  $\epsilon $ -differential privacy. Finally, simulation experiments conducted on the modified IEEE 14-bus microgrid system and IEEE 118-bus power system validate the effectiveness of our algorithm in terms of both convergence and privacy performance.</description></item><item><title>End-to-End Stochastic Predict-Then-Optimize for Cost-Efficient Water-Energy Resource Scheduling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142824</link><description>Compared to other energy-intensive industries, urban water supply systems are unique due to the strong temporal coupling with the power grid, which intensifies grid stress during peak hours. This paper addresses the water-energy nexus by developing a water-energy resource scheduling model for whole-process water supply that incorporates electricity cost prediction uncertainties. Meanwhile, to minimize the scheduling cost in an end-to-end approach, we propose the Stochastic Predict-then-Optimize (SPTO), which aligns prediction distribution with the optimality gap by integrating probabilistic forecasting with stochastic optimization. Unlike traditional two-stage approaches, SPTO establishes a closed-loop feedback between forecasting and optimization, reducing cumulative errors and improving real-time adaptability. To enable end-to-end training, we derive the SPTO+, a differentiable convex upper-bound surrogate function based on Lagrangian duality, which provides surrogate gradient computation for end-to-end training. Experiments on real-world systems demonstrate that SPTO significantly reduces operational cost and decision regret, effectively coordinating water operations with dynamic grid conditions to support cost-efficient and grid-responsive scheduling.</description></item><item><title>Disaggregating Distributed PV Power From Aggregate Measurements in Transmission Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11135456</link><description>The growing integration of Photovoltaic (PV) systems into distribution networks has limited visibility for system operators, as the power output of low-power PV systems is not typically monitored. The study presented in this paper introduces a novel approach for disaggregating PV generation from net-load measurements recorded at the transmission system level. The proposed technique is applied to actual data from an existing transmission line feeder to identify PV generation from net demand measurements. The developed methodology incorporates Geographical Information Systems (GIS) for detecting PV panels based on an algorithm that provides an accurate estimate of solar PV capacity. These estimations are validated against actual data from a local utility, showing a close match between the two. This information is then utilized in reliable software tools to simulate PV power generation in the studied region, which is then used to estimate and disaggregate the generated power from net-load data by applying multiple Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. The results demonstrate that, with the proposed approach, it is feasible to adequately disaggregate PV power generation from transmission feeder net-load measurements with minimal or no additional sensor infrastructure.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Objective Energy Management Strategy for Distribution Network With Distributed Renewable Based on Learning-Driven Model Predictive Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11130449</link><description>This paper investigates the energy management of distribution network with distributed renewable.

A battery energy storage system (BESS) is commonly used to manage these demand charges. Economic model predictive control (EMPC) with a reference trajectory can be used to dispatch the BESS to optimize the microgrid operating cost. Since demand charges are incurred monthly, EMPC requires a full-month reference trajectory for asymptotic stability guarantees that result in optimal operating costs. However, a full-month reference trajectory is unrealistic from a renewable generation forecast perspective. Therefore, to construct a practical EMPC with a reference trajectory, an EMPC formulation considering both non-coincident demand and on-peak demand charges is designed in this work for 24 to 48 h prediction horizons. The corresponding reference trajectory is computed at each EMPC step by solving an optimal control problem over 24 to 48 h reference (trajectory) horizon. Furthermore, BESS state of charge regulation constraints are incorporated to guarantee the BESS energy level in the long term. Multiple reference and prediction horizon lengths are compared for both shrinking and rolling horizons with real-world data. The proposed EMPC with 48 hour rolling reference and prediction horizons outperforms the traditional EMPC benchmark with a 2% reduction in the annual cost, proving its economic benefits.</description></item><item><title>Two-Tier Aggregation of Distributed Energy Storage Units Considering Network Access Purchase</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11131318</link><description>The number of distributed energy storage units (ESUs) within a distribution network is expected to increase because of the rapid deployment of 5G base stations, and they can be aggregated and formulated into a bid model of polytopic shape, which is consistent with market rules. However, it is challenging to design such a polytope that best captures their aggregate flexibility and satisfies distribution network constraints. This paper proposes a two-tier inner approximation aggregation model that aggregates the flexibility of ESUs first to the corresponding network buses and then to the substation. The uncertain power load of the 5G base station affects the minimum reserved energy of its backup battery. Therefore, with the aid of distributionally robust chance-constrained programming, a customized affine transformation-based method for inner approximation of the flexibility set is proposed to capture the charge/discharge logic and to handle uncertainty. In addition, the acquisition of network access limits is integrated into the optimal flexibility design of the aggregator by deriving the approximate form of the cost function in an auction framework. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of economy and uncertainty handling.</description></item><item><title>Cybersecurity by Design for Resilient Voltage Regulation in Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11131258</link><description>The transition to smart grids is advancing through the integration of grid-connected devices such as distributed energy resource (DER) inverters, distribution static synchronous compensators (D-STATCOMs), and electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, all of which play a vital role in voltage regulation within active distribution networks (DNs). Yet, these devices face growing exposure to cyber threats. This paper proposes a cybersecurity framework embedded directly within their control systems to address these risks by design. Drawing on the widespread deployment of distribution phasor measurement units (D-PMUs) for voltage monitoring, the framework incorporates a digital twin for real-time assessment, supported by data fidelity tests. This approach enables the timely detection and mitigation of false-data injection (FDI) and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, preserving voltage stability without requiring hardware modifications. Simulations on the IEEE 33-node test feeder confirm the framework&#8217;s effectiveness in strengthening the resilience and security of grid-connected systems, representing a meaningful step forward in the protection of smart grids.</description></item><item><title>Reliability Analysis of Virtual Power Plants for Peak-Regulation Service Using Phased Mission System Framework</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11133693</link><description>This paper proposes a reliability analysis method of virtual power plants (VPPs) for peak-regulation service by adopting the phased mission system (PMS) framework. Firstly, the PMS framework of VPP for peak regulation service is established by modeling it as a multi-phased mission, decomposed into several tasks including receiving, assigning, and executing the peak-regulation instructions. Besides, the single-phased binary decision diagram (BDD) model is proposed to evaluate the VPP&#8217;s performance of single-phased mission with the consideration of prime and auxiliary approaches for different tasks. Moreover, the whole-phased BDD model is proposed to analyze the VPP&#8217;s reliability for peak-regulation service by integrating the single-phased BDD model. Next, two reliability indices of VPP towards peak-regulation services are novelly proposed to represent the success rate and the insufficiency of peak-regulation service. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through extensive numerical tests on a verified IEEE test system.</description></item><item><title>Quantum Optimization for Optimal Power Flow: CVQLS-Augmented Interior Point Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11137411</link><description>This paper presents a quantum-enhanced optimization approach for solving optimal power flow (OPF) by integrating the interior point method (IPM) with a coherent variational quantum linear solver (CVQLS). The objective is to explore the applicability of quantum computing to power systems optimization and address the associated challenges. A comparative analysis of state-of-the-art quantum linear solvers&#8212;Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL), variational quantum linear solver (VQLS), and CVQLS&#8212;revealed that CVQLS is most suitable for OPF due to its stability with ill-conditioned matrices, such as the Hessian in IPM. To ensure high-quality solutions, prevent suboptimal convergence, and avoid the barren plateau problem, we propose a quantum circuit parameter initialization technique along with a method to guide the IPM along the central path. Moreover, we design an ansatz tailored for OPF, optimizing the expressibility and trainability of the quantum circuit to ensure efficient convergence and robustness in solving quantum OPF. Various optimizers are also tested for quantum circuit parameter optimization to select the best one. We evaluate our approaches on multiple systems to show their effectiveness in providing reliable OPF solutions. Simulations for the 2-bus system are conducted on a commercial IBMQ quantum device, while simulations for the other larger cases are performed using the IBM quantum simulator. While promising, CVQLS is limited by current quantum hardware, especially for larger systems. We use a quantum noise simulator to test scalability.</description></item><item><title>Aggregation of Heterogeneous DERs by the Subgradient Vertex Search Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11141502</link><description>The exploitation of distributed energy resources (DERs) is essential for the advancement of smart grids. However, the heterogeneity and scale of DERs pose major challenges to their aggregation, which is necessary to maximize their potential. This study adopts a linearized model that integrates a diverse array of DERs including power generation, energy storage, and flexible loads with varying dissipation rates. We used the model to analyze the compact form and mathematical implications of aggregation, for which we propose the subgradient vertex search method to solve. This method efficiently identifies vertices of the aggregate feasible region, which are used to construct its convex hull. Unlike traditional hyperplane-based methods, this method not only provides an inner approximation efficiently but also can converge to the exact solution. Numerical simulations validated its accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an energy flowchart to visualize high-dimensional space of energy change processes and provide a case study involving two vehicle-to-grid (V2G) charging piles to explain the mechanism of feasible region scaling, demonstrating the practical significance of precise aggregation.</description></item><item><title>Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning for Resilient Self-Proactive Distribution Grids Against Wildfires</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142361</link><description>With the growing risks and frequency of wildfires, power distribution systems (PDS) face significant challenges in maintaining reliability and security. Existing literature primarily focuses on post-event service restoration using stochastic optimization methods. Nevertheless, such approaches fall short in managing the dynamic and uncertain nature of wildfires, particularly when it comes to taking proactive measures to mitigate power outages. To address this problem, this paper introduces a wildfire smart resilience controller (WF-SRC) that utilizes a model-assisted safe Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) mechanism to reduce the impacts of wildfire-induced disruptions. The WF-SRC continuously monitors and analyzes both the status of the PDS and the spatiotemporal dynamics of wildfires, then executes preemptive actions to prevent wildfires from compromising distribution lines. These actions include optimally dispatching stationary and mobile distributed energy resources (DERs) that operate under a master-slave control scheme. While recent works assume full observability and formulate the PDS resilience problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), this approach leads to an impractically large state space and limited realism. In contrast, our approach models the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). This explicitly captures real-world sensing limitations, such as noisy measurements that arise during extreme events. The POMDP is tackled using an LSTM-TD3 DRL agent, enabling effective sequential decision-making in environments with incomplete information. Using real-world data from Alberta wildfires, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution in reducing wildfire impact, optimizing energy distribution, and enhancing robustness to uncertainties, ultimately contributing to a more resilient and proactive power grid.</description></item><item><title>Synergising Hierarchical Data Centers and Power Networks: A Privacy-Preserving Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142335</link><description>In the era of digitization, data centers have emerged as integral contributors sustaining our interlinked world, bearing responsibility for an increasing proportion of the world&#8217;s energy consumption. To facilitate the their fast rollout while progressing towards net-zero energy systems, the synergy of hierarchical data centers (cloud-fog-edge) and power networks can play a pivotal role. However, existing centralized co-dispatch manners encroach on the privacy of different agents within the integrated systems, meanwhile suffering from the combinatorial explosion. In this research, we propose a near-optimal distributed privacy-preserving approach to solve the non-convex synergy (day-ahead co-dispatch) problem. The synergy problem is formulated as a mixed integer quadratically constrained quadratic programming considering both communication and energy conservation, where Lyapunov optimization is introduced to balance operating costs and uncertain communication delays. To mitigate impacts of the highly non-convex nature, the normalized multi-parametric disaggregation technique is leveraged to reformulate the problem into a mixed integer non-linear programming. To further overcome non-smoothness of the reformulated problem, the customized  $\ell _{1}-$ surrogate Lagrangian relaxation method with convergence guarantees is proposed to solve the problem in a distributed privacy-preserving manner. The effectiveness, optimality, and scalability of the proposed methodologies for the synergy problem are validated via numerical simulations. The results also indicate that computing tasks can be migrated within the hierarchical data centers, demonstrating the flexible resource allocation capabilities of the hierarchical architecture, further facilitating peak load balancing in the power network.</description></item><item><title>Performance-Integrated Virtual Power Plant Management in the Frequency Regulation Market</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11146637</link><description>Renewable integration in power systems causes a surge of frequency fluctuations, primarily due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy. To address this challenge, distributed energy resources (DERs) pave one promising way for frequency regulation by their aggregation as a virtual power plant (VPP). For a VPP participating in the frequency regulation market, its regulation performance is critical for interaction with the system operator. This paper explores a performance-integrated management scheme for a VPP to optimize the utilization of heterogeneous DERs in the frequency regulation market. The relationship between the regulation performance and the DER reserve portfolio is first revealed through a data-driven method, which has rarely been studied in current work. This facilitates the integration of the mapped frequency regulation performance into the aggregation and disaggregation processes in the VPP management. Furthermore, in the aggregation process, the VPP&#8217;s feasible operation region associated with the high-dimensional variables and constraints is characterized through a cluster-based aggregation method. Given the massive heterogeneous DERs, this proposed method ensures satisfactory accuracy within the reduced computation time by efficiently capturing the representative DER characteristics. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified using real-world DER data from the Dataport database.</description></item><item><title>Assessment, Cause Localization, and Mitigation for Small-Signal Stability Risks in Multi-Parallel Grid-Forming Converter Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11151621</link><description>This article addresses small-signal stability issues for multi-parallel grid-forming converter systems based on a newly developed extended passivity theory.

The objective is to unify and simplify the tasks for (i) clustering visualisation, (ii) outlier detection and (iii) generative profile modelling under one concept. The lower dimensional projection of standardised MV load profiles unveils a latent distribution in a three-dimensional sphere. This spherical structure allows us to detect outliers by fitting probability distribution models in the spherical coordinate system, identifying measurements that deviate from the spherical shape. The same latent distribution exhibits an arc shape, suggesting an underlying order among load profiles. We develop a principal curve technique to uncover this order based on similarity, offering new advantages over conventional clustering techniques. This finding reveals that energy consumption in a wide region can be seen as a continuously changing process. Furthermore, we combined the principal curve with a von Mises-Fisher distribution to create a model capable of generating profiles with continuous mixtures between clusters. The presence of the spherical distribution is validated with data from four municipalities in the Netherlands. The uncovered spherical structure implies the possibility of employing new mathematical tools from directional statistics and differential geometry for load profile modelling.</description></item><item><title>Power-SAM: An Advanced Abnormality Change Detection Algorithm for Intelligent Monitoring in Power Equipment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11126170</link><description>Timely detection and management of abnormalities are critical to ensuring the safe and stable operation of the smart grid. To address this, a novel abnormal change detection (ACD) model, termed Power-SAM, is proposed for smart grids based on Artificial Intelligence. Firstly, integrate the strong generalization capabilities and efficient image segmentation performance of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) while employing fine-tuning strategies to enhance its applicability for processing images in power scenarios. Secondly, the Time Difference Feature Generator (TDFG) was designed to generate feature vectors suitable for ACD, allowing SAM to adapt to power ACD tasks. Thirdly, a feature fusion network, which combined feature aggregation with differential computation, was adopted, enhancing the model&#8217;s ability to detect subtle changes in power scenes. Lastly, CBAM-FPN by integrating Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and lightweight Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) was introduced to Power-SAM, improving ACD performance for multiscale targets. An image dataset for substation change detection was constructed from real-world power scenarios and ACD requirements. This dataset was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed Power-SAM model. The results demonstrate that the algorithm achieves precision, recall, F1-score, and IoU metrics of 95.25%, 93.35%, 94.41%, and 89.41%, respectively, outperforming current state-of-the-art artificial intelligence models.</description></item><item><title>Prediction of Charging Station Load Uncertainty Based on Multi-Dimensional Quantile Spatial-Temporal Traffic Flow Forecast</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119652</link><description>The uncertainty prediction of electric vehicle charging station load plays a crucial role in ensuring the stable operation of power grids. In this paper, a charging station load uncertainty prediction method based on multi-dimensional quantile spatial-temporal traffic flow forecast is proposed. First, considering the complex spatial-temporal correlation characteristics of traffic flow, a traffic flow forecast model based on multi-dimensional spatial-temporal graph convolutional network is designed. The model can deeply explore spatial-temporal correlation characteristics and effectively capture both the static spatial correlations with fixed topological structures and the dynamic spatial correlations of real-time traffic flow. Second, taking into account the importance of prediction results under different confidence levels, this paper combines the forecast model with a weighted quantile regression model and introduces a novel weighted loss function, which can achieve traffic flow uncertainty prediction without the need to predefine the uncertainty probability density distribution and meet the differentiated requirements for uncertainty prediction in grid operation and business decision-making. Furthermore, considering the influence of factors such as road congestion and electricity prices on charging load, a charging station load uncertainty prediction model based on an enhanced queuing model is proposed, which can more accurately convert traffic flow uncertainty into load uncertainty, and thus more accurately simulate the charging station loads. Finally, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Learning-Accelerated Distributed Economic Dispatch in Vehicle-to-Grid Integrated Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119663</link><description>Next-generation smart grids require decentralized optimization frameworks to coordinate diverse energy assets, including renewables, dispatchable generators, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G)-enabled electric vehicles (EVs). A critical challenge lies in reducing the overall communication overhead and computational burden for distributed economic dispatch through learning-accelerated optimization, while addressing uncertainties in EV charging patterns, time-varying communication networks, and battery longevity constraints. This paper proposes a learning-accelerated distributed optimization framework for V2G-integrated microgrids. A novel alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) enhanced by deep neural networks, termed learning-accelerated ADMM (LA-ADMM), is developed to predict optimal dual variables, with theoretical convergence under dynamic network conditions rigorously proved. For handling EV uncertainties, the framework incorporates model predictive control (MPC) architecture with dispatch package strategies that minimize computational overhead through adaptive reuse of historical solutions during steady-state operations. Battery lifespan preservation is achieved through tight coupling of operational constraints with a universal constant current-constant voltage (CC-CV) charging protocol. Validation via IEEE 39-bus simulations and Raspberry Pi-based hardware experiments demonstrates 70.9% iteration reduction compared to ADMM-MPC baselines, effective peak shaving/valley filling, and &lt;2% deviation between simulated and physical power profiles.</description></item><item><title>Inertia-Emulation-Based Fast Frequency Response From EVs: A Multi-Level Framework With Game-Theoretic Incentives and DRL</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142805</link><description>As the modern power grids increasingly integrate intermittent renewable energy sources, the reduction in system inertia creates challenges for frequency stability. Electric vehicles (EVs), with their rapid response capabilities and growing penetration, offer promising potential for providing virtual inertia services. In this paper, a novel fast frequency response framework with virtual inertia of EVs is proposed in a coupled power-transportation network. The proposed framework addresses the complex coordination required across multiple stakeholders through a hierarchical approach encompassing grid operators, charging stations (CSs), and EV users. At the grid level, the optimal inertia scheduling is developed to reduce system costs, considering the spatial-temporal characteristics of EVs and power fluctuations. For coordination between CSs, a game-theoretic incentive mechanism is designed to maximize collective benefits while encouraging EV participation in inertia services. In each CS, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based inertia control strategy can achieve the optimal inertia distribution, considering both EV battery conditions and user requirements. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. This approach provides a feasible operation solution for providing EV-based inertia in modern low-inertia grids.</description></item><item><title>Risk-Averse Decision-Dependent Distributionally Robust Optimization for the Resilient Cyber-Physical Distribution System Against Contingencies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11126174</link><description>The cyber-physical deep coupling brings the distribution system the possibility of superposition vulnerability on cyber and physical spaces, which will potentially raise the unobservability and uncontrollability issues of the system, readily causing power outages during contingencies. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a resilience-oriented design for the cyber-physical distribution system based on a risk-averse decision-dependent distributionally robust optimization (DD-DRO) model. Firstly, observable and controllable intentional islands, as a promising way, are formed against contingencies by remote-controlled switch deployment, wireless communication configuration, and local controller activation. To this end, the cyber-physical coupling mechanism is investigated by hybrid wired/wireless communication modeling and fault propagation modeling, ensuring the cyber system&#8217;s observation and control. Secondly, reinforcement measures are adopted to mitigate the risk of uncertain contingencies, however, triggering decision-dependent uncertainty. To handle this uncertainty, the adaptive moment information method is developed to construct an N-k decision-dependent ambiguity set. Therefore, the proposed DD-DRO model is formulated and then recast to a mixed-integer linear programming problem by linearization techniques, which is solved by a customized nested column-and-constraint generation algorithm. Finally, numerical results on the modified IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 69-bus test systems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and method.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Sensing, Transmission and Control for QKD-IoT Empowered Power-Communication Coupling Smart Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11126162</link><description>Quantum-classical hybrid encryption has elevated security levels of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled distributed power control. However, the decoupled design of communication and power systems introduces substantial technical challenges. Outdated or tampered state data propagating from communication to power domains trigger cascading control failures, as demonstrated in the 2015 Ukraine grid cyberattack. This motivates us to investigate the fundamental question of how to achieve power-communication collaborative control optimization by proposing a cross-domain gap driven optimization framework of integrated sensing, transmission and control. Our novel framework addresses these limitations through three synergistic innovations: (i) accurate false data injection (FDI) attack sensing based on temporal correlation, (ii) secure data transmission based on hierarchical cooperative learning, and (iii) trust and delay-weighted consensus control. Its superiority is validated through simulations across diverse attack scenarios, grid topologies, and network scales. It exhibits strong scalability and robustness in large-scale complex grids. Key finding revels that blocking propagation paths of outdated and tampered consensus variables effectively mitigates control deviations and oscillations.</description></item><item><title>Self-Organizing Post-Contingency Distribution Network via Drone-Assisted Resilience-Oriented Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142358</link><description>Distribution networks with inverter-based distributed energy resources may increasingly face extreme events. While localized and islanded energy supply can enhance grid resilience, post-contingency distribution networks may struggle with efficient communication capabilities and energy sources owing to inevitably tight cyber-physical interdependence. Currently, post-contingency distribution networks do not comprehensively integrate cyber-physical self-organization capabilities using mobile resources. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a drone-assisted distribution network self-organization framework to enable operational data collection and control implementation, further maximizing the system resilience margin. Specifically, post-contingency communication services, i.e., data collection and control actuation, are scheduled via a multi-drone flight trajectory optimization considering drone recharging needs. Due to recharging periods with no emergency communication services, a resilience-oriented optimization is developed to co-optimize power injections and generator parameters for both static optimality and dynamic stability. This involves a compromised objective function that balances long-term energy consumption with short-term tolerant power imbalance. Finally, the proposed communication-control service provision framework is demonstrated through comprehensive case studies.</description></item><item><title>Exploring Smart Grid Vulnerability Against Intelligent Inverter Parameter Tampering Attack</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11159533</link><description>The integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) with inverter-based resources (IBRs) significantly improves remote management and monitoring capabilities of power electronic devices in modern power systems. Nevertheless, this integration presents significant security vulnerabilities, rendering smart inverters susceptible to various cyber threats. To this end, this paper develops a novel vulnerability exploration method for smart grids against IBR parameter tampering attacks. In particular, a zero-knowledge Destabilising Attack based on Fuzzing-Assisted Reinforcement Learning, named DAFARL, is proposed with the following steps. First, search engines are employed to explore vulnerable IBRs accessible via the Internet. Subsequently, smart grid stability sensitivity to parameter alterations in inverters is evaluated through the proposed fuzzing-assisted reinforcement learning approach, enabling the identification of critical parameters without prior knowledge of the system model. On this basis, an optimal attack strategy is then formulated, considering attack difficulty, risk, and computational efficiency to achieve the cost-benefit trade-off. Furthermore, the corresponding active and passive defense mechanisms are designed to mitigate the negative impact of attacks. In addition, electromagnetic transient simulations conducted on a modified IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate that inverter-level parameter manipulations can lead to severe system-wide stability degradation. These results substantiate both the effectiveness of our proposed sensitivity analysis methodology and the stealth characteristics of DAFARL.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Agent Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning for HVAC Control With Flexible DERs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11123597</link><description>As electricity consumption in commercial and residential buildings continues to rise, reducing energy costs presents an increasing challenge. Heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, which typically account for 40%&#8211;50% of a building&#8217;s energy use, are prime targets for energy savings. Intelligent control of HVAC temperature through the exploitation of HVAC load flexibility brings significant potential to reduce energy consumption and electricity expenses. The nonlinear models of HVAC systems challenge traditional control methods, while the uncertainty introduced by HVAC load flexibility complicates distributed energy resource (DER) management using conventional optimal dispatch techniques. In response to these challenges, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach. The lower-level agents focus on balancing comfort and energy conservation, while the upper-level DRL agents optimize the use of DERs to reduce peak demand based on the control outcomes of the HVAC by the lower-level agents. In the upper-level agents, we incorporate a multi-agent structure based on ensemble learning, which acts based on historical and current data without relying on precise load forecasting to address the delayed rewarding issue in DRL. This allows for the effective reduction of energy costs. The proposed method is tested using a real-world microgrid comprising 413 buildings in Southern California, and the results demonstrate that our approach can significantly reduce overall electricity bills while ensuring the comfort of consumers and residents.</description></item><item><title>EdgeHEM: Sparse Federated Reinforcement Learning for Home Energy Management at the Edge</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11126167</link><description>With the growth of energy demand and the popularization of distributed energy resources, home energy management (HEM) has emerged as a crucial technology to improve energy efficiency and reduce electricity costs.

Network partitioning method can reduce such complexity by dividing the MGC into self-adequate partitions. However, existing dynamic network partitioning methods normally update the network partitioning results at fixed time intervals, which limits the ability to adapt to spatiotemporal variations in output of renewable energy sources (RESs), load demand, and grid topology. To address this, a dynamic network partitioning method based on an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) combined with depth-first search (DFS) is proposed. IGA is employed to optimize the partitioning index, and DFS is subsequently applied to obtain the network partitioning result. Furthermore, a dynamic update mechanism is designed to adaptively update the partitioning results according to spatiotemporal variations in system conditions. Simulation results on the modified IEEE 123-bus system show that the proposed method achieves better partitioning quality than the genetic algorithm (GA), spectral clustering, and Louvain algorithms while maintaining computational efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Tuning Friendly Deep Reinforcement Learning Method for Inverter-Based Volt/Var Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119650</link><description>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have been applied to power system problems in active distribution networks, including the inverter-based volt/var control (VVC). However, existing DRL-based VVC methods require hyperparameter fine-tuning, tailored algorithm selection and domain expert knowledge, depending on various power system characteristics.

The proposed method is applied to deep deterministic policy gradient and soft actor-critic, two widely used DRL algorithms. The advantages of tuning-friendly training, i.e., insensitiveness to hyperparameter tuning, are validated by numerical experiments.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Ship-to-Grid Dispatch Considering Battery Thermal and Voltage Electrochemical-Thermal-Coupled Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119670</link><description>This letter proposes an optimal ship-to-grid (S2G) dispatch model of electric ships (ESs) coupling onshore and/or offshore wind energy conversion systems (WECS) with shore-to-ship and/or offshore floating charging stations so that the shipboard battery energy storage system (BESS) can help to smooth out variable WECS output.

Applications such as aerial surveillance, search and rescue, and operations beyond the line of sight rely on the autonomous navigation capabilities of multi-AAVs. This paper introduces a novel framework, Adaptive Rapid Recurrent Stochastic Valued Gradient (ARReSVG), empowered by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to address navigational challenges faced by AAVs in partially observable spaces. The proposed ARReSVG framework incorporates an adaptive learning approach to address issues related to partial observability-based autonomous navigation effectively. Compared with traditional obstacle avoidance techniques, the proposed navigation framework utilizes a distributed Multi-AAV Consensus Path Planning (MUCP2) mechanism to perform collaborative path planning for multiple AAVs to ensure collision avoidance trajectories. Additionally, the learned value-action policy implemented in the AAV alleviates the computational demands of real-time map-building. The ARReSVG framework leverages a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to reduce computing complexity and accurately approximate the action-value function. The simulation results show that the ARReSVG framework achieves an impressive 94% success rate, enabling AAVs to navigate independently in unknown and complex environments.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Multi-Ensemble Learning-Based Power Prediction for Energy Management of Dual-Source Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11012916</link><description>Electric vehicles (EVs) rely on batteries as their main energy source, so it is important to take steps to reduce their stress to extend their life and maintain their performance. Combining supercapacitors with batteries can be a promising way to reduce battery stress, while also improving global EV performance. This paper proposes a novel multi-ensemble learning (MEL)-based method for designing energy management strategies (called MEL-EMSs) for dual-source EVs (DSEVs), i.e., EVs using a battery and a supercapacitor. A designed MEL-EMS determines in real-time a performant power distribution. Such power distribution is determined solely based on the history of the speed and traction power, without requiring any prior knowledge of the complete driving cycle. MEL-EMS is evaluated at two levels, to assess power distribution and energy consumption respectively. The real-time simulation is carried out under unknown driving cycles based on a validated numerical EV model. Our results demonstrate that MEL-EMS outperforms state-of-the-art methods by enhancing energy efficiency, reducing battery stress with a 4.8% reduction in battery root-mean-square current and a 41.7% decrease in standard deviation of battery current, while ensuring accurate and low-cost real-time power distribution.</description></item><item><title>Performance Analysis of Interference Isolation in Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Assisted Networks With Directional Antenna</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11048704</link><description>Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) could significantly improve the signal power strength, while also accumulate the co-channel interference due to passive scattering. Focusing the energy radiated to the user by directional antenna will significantly decrease co-channel interference, which hasn't been analyzed in existing IRS-assisted networks. This paper proposes a tractable directional antenna model for IRS-assisted networks where base station (BS) will generate two narrow beams toward IRS and user equipment (UE) for interference isolation, and power allocation parameter $\omega$ is designed for direct link and IRS-assisted cascade link. Specifically, realistic and mathematically tractable directional antenna pattern ${G_{M,m,\theta }}(\phi)$ is adopted that radiation gain is modeled by main lobe directivity gain, the back lobe gain, and the beamwidth of the main lobe, and the total interference with IRS random scattering is revised. In addition, the signal and interference power distribution is achieved using Gamma function and the optimal $\omega$ can be found, where the different gain of IRS perfect reflecting and random scattering is taken into account, and the tradeoff between power allocation parameter $\omega$ and channel condition can be exploited. Analytical results demonstrate that system coverage probability is maximized when $\omega=0.52$ and IRSs deployment density $\lambda _{I}=5000/{km}^{2}$ and reflecting elements $N=3000$.</description></item><item><title>Joint Trajectory and Beamforming Optimization for UAV-RIS-Empowered Multiuser Communication Networks: A Double Deep Q-Network Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11008723</link><description>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication technology offers adaptable reflected beams and dynamic parameter adjustments, proving vital for managing the highly dynamic communication environments expected in wireless communications. However, a key challenge lies in addressing the dynamic and nonlinear problem of RIS phase shift design and UAV trajectory prediction. To ensure long-term fairness and enhance system performance, we propose an approach based on the double deep Q-network (DDQN), aiming to maximize the weighted sum rate across multiple users. Specifically, we employ an initial phase shift and predefined codebook to optimize the RIS phase shift at the current UAV position using DDQN. Further refinement is achieved through an extremum seeking algorithm. Then, under constraints encompassing RIS phase shift, allowable regions for UAV node, base station (BS) transmit power, and minimum user rate, we adopt DDQN to obtain predefined reward parameters jointly designed by fairness and throughput through interaction with dynamic and variable channel environment, and continuously update UAV position parameters to maximize rewards. The simulation results verify the efficacy of our joint optimization strategy, demonstrating optimal UAV location selection for UAV-RIS-empowered multiuser networks in a 2D plane.</description></item><item><title>On the Design of Capacity-Achieving Distributions for Discrete-Time Poisson Channel With Low-Precision ADCs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11008707</link><description>This paper investigates the design of the capacity-achieving input distribution for the discrete-time Poisson channel (DTPC) under dark current effects with low-precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). An efficient algorithm integrating the Newton-Raphson and Blahut-Arimoto (BA) methods is proposed to jointly optimize the input distribution and amplitude levels under both peak and average power constraints. Additionally, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are established to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of the obtained capacity-achieving distribution. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed algorithm attains 72% and 83% of the theoretical capacity at 5 dB for 1-bit and 2-bit quantized DTPC, respectively. Furthermore, for a DTPC with finite-precision quantization (i.e., ${\log _{2}}K$ bits), the capacity can be achieved by a non-uniform discrete input distribution with support for $K$ mass points, under the given power constraints.</description></item><item><title>A DRL-Framework for Full-Duplex WPCN Enabled Mobile Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11012917</link><description>As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to expand in both daily life and industrial production, the data generated by IoT devices is increasing rapidly. To address the challenges of limited battery life and computational capacity in these devices, two promising solutions have emerged: wireless power transfer (WPT) and mobile edge computing (MEC). By receiving radio frequency (RF) energy from a hybrid access point (HAP), wireless devices (WDs) can either offload data to the HAP or process it locally. In this paper, we explore the full-duplex WPT-MEC scenario and maximize the sum computation rate (SCR) by optimizing the offloading decision and resource allocation of WDs in different access modes and energy harvest models. This problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. To address this, we decompose the problem into two sub-problems: one focuses on optimizing offloading decisions, and the other focuses on energy power and bandwidth allocation under given the offloading decisions. We propose a deep reinforcement learning approach based on policy gradients to make offloading decisions, and we design an optimization algorithm for efficient bandwidth and energy resource allocation. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm achieves approximately 96$\%$ of the maximum possible computation rate while maintaining low computational complexity.</description></item><item><title>Advancing Ultra-Reliable 6G: Transformer and Semantic Localization Empowered Robust Beamforming in Millimeter-Wave Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11018220</link><description>Advancements in 6G wireless technology have elevated the importance of beamforming, especially for attaining ultra-high data rates via millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency deployment. Although promising, mmWave bands require substantial beam training to achieve precise beamforming. While initial deep learning models that use RGB camera images demonstrated promise in reducing beam training overhead, their performance suffers due to sensitivity to lighting and environmental variations. Due to this sensitivity, Quality of Service (QoS) fluctuates, eventually affecting the stability and dependability of networks in dynamic environments. This emphasizes a critical need for robust solutions. This paper proposes a robust beamforming technique to ensure consistent QoS under varying environmental conditions. An optimization problem has been formulated to maximize users' data rates. To solve the formulated NP-hard optimization problem, we decompose it into two subproblems: the semantic localization problem and the optimal beam selection problem. To solve the semantic localization problem, we propose a novel method that leverages the K-means clustering and YOLOv8 model. To solve the beam selection problem, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid architecture that combines a lightweight transformer with a CNN architecture through a weighted entropy mechanism. This hybrid architecture utilizes multimodal data sources to dynamically predict the optimal beams. For maintaining QoS, rapid and accurate beam predictions are needed. To quantify this, a novel metric, Accuracy-Complexity Efficiency (ACE), which combines both the model complexity and accuracy, has been proposed. Six testing scenarios have been developed to evaluate the robustness of the proposed model. Finally, the simulation result demonstrates that the proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines regarding beam prediction accuracy, received power, and ACE in the developed test scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Recognition on Overlapping Spectrum Signals in UAV-Assisted Radio Monitoring Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11010918</link><description>Due to the convergence of new wireless technologies progress and integration with the existing radio spectrum, overlapping spectrum signals (OSS) appearing simultaneously is more frequently and randomly in time and space position. That brings more challenges for radio monitoring system on multi-parameter signal recognition and flexible target tracking. With the advantage of flexibility and mobility, uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted monitoring system is rapid advancing. In this paper, we propose a new framework for multi-parameter integrated recognition on OSS, including category and number of signals identification, position and transmitted power estimation, through UAV-assisted radio monitoring systems. Cooperative multi-layer Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) recognition (CMNR) is firstly designed to solve the problem of OSS multi-parameters integrated recognition. To further reduce the computational complexity and time identically, joint multi-layer NMF recognition (JMNR) is then developed by fully using the data correlation among different monitoring nodes and significantly improve the integrated recognition accuracy based on joint matrix optimization. The flexibility and mobility of UAV monitoring nodes inspire the design of the centroid-seeking flying strategy (CSFS) for JMNR applications. In the simulation, the signal category recognition accuracy of JMNR and CMNR both achieve at least 27.1% higher than traditional blind signal separation (BSS) methods. In the large monitoring area, the position accuracy of JMNR even obtain 11.9% higher than that using CMNR. CSFS also exhibits 20.9% and 25.3% improvement on respective position and power estimation accuracy under large monitoring area and low height of UAVs conditions.</description></item><item><title>Secure and Efficient Data Sharing for Internet of Vehicles: A Hierarchical Blockchain Enabled Asynchronous Federated Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11015654</link><description>With the rapid development of technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), vehicles could share their local data through the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) for better intelligent driving services. By sharing model knowledge rather than raw data, federated learning (FL) could effectively protect user data privacy. The combination of blockchain technology and FL provides a more secure sharing solution. However, the current blockchain enabled FL systems still face security threats, and have limited efficiency and scalability. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical blockchain enabled multi-region asynchronous swarm learning (HB-MASL) framework to achieve secure and efficient data sharing for IoVs. The HB-MASL divides the edge network into multiple regions to collaborate and parallelize FL-based knowledge sharing tasks to improve scalability while ensuring user privacy and data security. Empowered by the two-layer blockchain, the HB-MASL could achieve safe intra-regional and cross-regional knowledge sharing. Moreover, model compression technology and blockchain pruning technology are introduced to alleviate the communication and storage pressure of the system. In addition, we analyze the instantaneous communication rate based on vehicle mobility and derive the consensus confirmation latency of the blockchain. Based on this, a mathematical optimization problem for the total shared latency of the system is formulated, and a locally perceptual based two-step asynchronous sharing (LPTAS) algorithm is proposed to minimize the system latency. Finally, comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms could achieve better performance in terms of model accuracy, convergence rates, security and efficiency compared with existing algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Performance Analysis of User-Centric Interference Cooperation in Multi-Antenna UAV Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11048700</link><description>Multi-antenna unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks can improve throughput by spatial multiplexing and UAVs dominant line-of-sight (LOS) connections, which will intensify interference and exacerbate user fluctuation. This paper proposes user-centric interference cooperation in multi-antenna UAV networks, where multi-antenna beamforming and joint transmission are performed among cooperative UAVs, and derives a semi-closed expression of the ergodic rate using stochastic geometry. Specifically, a dynamic UAV group with adjustable radius ${R}$ is organized for each user that forms a 3D conical region to guarantee seamless service, which provides spatial multiplexing freedom via cooperative multi-antenna beamforming to achieve interference mitigation. In addition, both signal power and inter-cluster interference power are approximated by Gamma distributions with appropriate parameters experiencing generic Nakagami-$m$ fading in air-to-ground (AtG) channel. Furthermore, zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming is adopted with equal power allocation among beams, which is across the distributed set of UAVs within the cluster and considering different antenna loading. Numerical results show that the average ergodic rate can achieve 86.01% gain compared to the uncoordinated single-cell multi-antenna UAV network when UAV density is ${100\mathrm{/km^{2}}}$ and UAV group radius ${R}$ is ${20\;\mathrm{m}}$. The optimal network parameters are investigated to maximize ergodic rate, thus providing guidelines for practical network configuration. For instance, when UAV density is $50\mathrm{/km^{2}}$ and loading factor is $K/M=2/16$, the optimal deployment altitude for UAVs is $ h=20\;{\rm m}$, which can achieve a rate gain of 144% compared to the case of $h=0\;\mathrm{m}$.</description></item><item><title>Deep Point Reinforcement Learning Approach for Sustainable Communications Using and Moving Interaction Station</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11010909</link><description>Autonomous aerial vehicles (AAV) have emerged as a critical component in the smart city, which can significantly enhance integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) performance. This paper mainly investigates the AAV-to-Vehicle (A2V) communication scenarios, where vehicles are represented as rigid shapes in the radar point cloud (RPC). The moving interaction station (MIS) is proposed to provide the sensing-assisted and wireless charging service for the AAV. The radio knowledge map (RKM) is introduced to improve the communication and energy efficiency of the AAV-ISAC system. Then, a joint optimization problem is formulated to complete the data collection and upload task by adjusting the AAV trajectory and vehicle access. To address this problem, a deep point reinforcement learning (DPRL) algorithm is proposed, which contains an RPC network, an RKM network, and a decision-making module. Herein, the RPC and RKM networks are designed to merge and map the vehicle RPC and RKM into the action spaces. The decision-making module selects actions from the action spaces to optimize the AAV trajectory and vehicle access. Simulation results show that the proposed DPRL algorithm outperforms the benchmarks, achieving approximately a 10.87% increase in channel capacity and a 24.08% enhancement in residual energy.</description></item><item><title>Compressive Spectrum Sensing With 1-Bit ADCs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11011926</link><description>Efficient wideband spectrum sensing (WSS) is essential for managing spectrum scarcity in wireless communications. However, existing compressed sensing (CS)-based WSS methods require high sampling rates and power consumption, particularly with high-precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Although 1-bit CS with low-precision ADCs can mitigate these demands, most approaches still depend on multi-user cooperation and prior sparsity information, which are often unavailable in WSS scenarios. This paper introduces a non-cooperative WSS method using multicoset sampling with 1-bit ADCs to achieve sub-Nyquist sampling. We analyze the impact of 1-bit quantization on multiband signals, then apply eigenvalue decomposition to isolate the signal subspace from noise, enabling spectrum support estimation without signal reconstruction. The proposed method can efficiently estimate the support of the occupied spectrum without the prior information on sparsity order.</description></item><item><title>Movable-Antenna Enabled Cell-Free Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11018493</link><description>In this paper, we investigate the utilization of movable antennas (MAs) in cell-free networks to reduce transmit power consumption. Different from conventional networks with fixed-position antennas (FPAs), the proposed MA-enabled cell-free network flexibly adjusts the antenna positions in a given finite area. As such, the channels between multiple access points (APs) and user equipments (UEs) can be reconfigured to create more favorable channel conditions. To minimize the maximum transmit power of APs in the considered network, a non-convex problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and MA positions. Then, we propose a dynamic neighborhood pruning particle swarm optimization (DNPPSO) algorithm to solve this problem efficiently. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme with MAs can significantly reduce the transmit power consumption in cell-free networks compared to benchmarks with FPAs by exploiting the degrees of freedom (DoFs) in antenna position optimization.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Hybrid Beamforming for Downlink Multi-User Space-MIMO Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11008916</link><description>In this correspondence, we propose a graph-based distributed hybrid beamforming scheme for downlink multi-user communications in low earth orbit (LEO) multi-satellite networks. Firstly, we model a reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS)-empowered downlink multi-user satellite-terrestrial communication system, where multiple LEO satellites are collectively integrated into a space multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmitter to coherently transmit data streams to multiple terrestrial user terminals (UTs). Secondly, we formulate a weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem, subject to individual transmit power constraints. To address it, a graph-based scheme is developed for the joint optimization of analog and digital beamforming in a distributed manner. Finally, the proposed scheme is extended to support phased array systems. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms conventional methods such as minimum mean square error (MMSE), zero forcing (ZF), and maximum ratio transmission (MRT), with the phased array configuration achieving a higher WSR than the RHS.</description></item><item><title>The Challenges of Accurate J0e Determination on Modern Solar Cells: A Sensitivity Study of Input Parameter Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11131132</link><description>Carrier recombination lifetime parameters, including effective lifetime (&#964;eff), emitter saturation current density (J0e), and bulk lifetime (&#964;bulk) on silicon photovoltaic cells, are essential quality metrics for sample characterization and enable power loss analyses that drive process optimization decisions.

Due to its intermittent nature, accurate PV power forecasting is essential for the efficient management and monitoring of PV systems. In this context, the accuracy of meteorological data is critical. However, it is not always possible to obtain such data on a local basis, and often some information, such as irradiance, is obtained from models whose characteristics are not known in detail. To overcome this limitation, this study evaluates five synthetic features that combine clear-sky global horizontal irradiance and cloudiness data to estimate total irradiance in the absence of direct measurements. A light gradient boosting model is used to evaluate the predictive performance of a model using these synthetic features compared to a model based on conventional meteorological inputs, including irradiance. The results, evaluated over a reference week, show that the feature labeled $\chi _{5}$ slightly improves model accuracy (passing from an RMSE of 84.013 to 87.232 W/kWp and $R^{2}$ from 0.888 to 0.875). These results show that synthetic features can achieve comparable results and in some cases even improve prediction performance.</description></item><item><title>Study of Photovoltaic Parameters of Efficient Bulk-Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells for Indoor Applications Under Varied Intensities and Indoor LED Lighting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11123166</link><description>Bulk-heterojunction devices with D18 and Y12 as active material were fabricated with an inverted ITO/zinc oxide/active material/molybdenum (III) oxide/Ag structure. Donor D18 and acceptor Y12 have complementary absorption spectra covering the visible range (300&#8211;800 nm). Furthermore, the energy layer alignment of these materials also makes it easier for charge generation and transport. All these factors lead to exploiting the possibility of using these organic solar cells (OSCs) for indoor photovoltaic (IPV) applications. The devices prepared previously were soaked in light (AM1.5 G) and illuminated under three types of white LED: warm white, standard white, and cool white. The intensities of the lights were varied, and the photovoltaic parameters of the cells were recorded. The variation of photovoltaic parameters with the intensity and color-correlated temperature (CCT) of different lights was thoroughly studied in this work. The external quantum efficiency of devices was also recorded. Here, we obtained cells with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.88% in AM1.5 G, which went up to 27.58% in indoor lighting. All the devices were prepared without the nitrogen glovebox and were characterized in ambient conditions, which is the first step toward commercializing and integrating the cells in the Internet of Things (IoTs). IPV, being an emerging field, the study of photovoltaic parameters under varied intensity of light and different lights reveals a lot of information about the behavior of cells. Such a study has never been performed before, and the correlation between intensity and CCT of light with photovoltaic parameters and PCE unveils invaluable information about indoor OSCs. The results of this study could potentially aid in optimizing and developing OSC for self-sustaining IoTs in the near future.</description></item><item><title>Uncovering Structure&#8211;Performance Relationships in Organic Photovoltaics: Interpretable Machine Learning Model for Predicting the Power Conversion Efficiency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11123139</link><description>Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) represent a promising photovoltaic technology, but the design of candidate molecules has traditionally followed a trial-and-error approach, which is inefficient. However, machine learning provides a data-informed strategy by learning from large OPV material datasets, supporting the accelerated discovery and optimization of high-performance OPV materials. In this study, we use an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model to predict the density functional theory-calculated power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OPV donor materials using structural features extracted from the Harvard Photovoltaic Dataset (HOPV15) dataset.

Enhancing their appearance through color modifications can promote broader adoption, particularly for building integrated applications. Optimizing the performance of colored Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) cells requires a thorough understanding of how layer thickness influences both color hue and efficiency. We analyze colored CIGS solar cells using a self-consistent electro-optical simulation approach. Unlike previous studies that focus solely on optical properties, our approach integrates both optical and electrical modeling to provide a more accurate assessment of device performance. By accounting for light behavior, charge generation, recombination processes, and electrical transport, we analyze how variations in layer thickness influence both color and efficiency. In addition, we examine the effects of installation angle and lighting conditions on color perception and power output. This study offers deeper insights into the mechanisms governing colored CIGS solar cells, contributing to a more precise assessment of their practical implementation across different applications. A color&#8211;geometry&#8211;performance map is developed to evaluate whether the manufactured colored CIGS solar cells meet both aesthetic and performance criteria as well as to explain the observed behavior.</description></item><item><title>Postannealing in Metal&#8211;Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition Reactor: A Scalable Method for Improving InGaAsP Solar-Cell Efficiency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11173713</link><description>InGaAsP solar cells with a bandgap of approximately 1.05 eV, which are lattice matched to InP substrates, generally exhibit relatively lower crystal quality and energy conversion efficiency compared with other III&#8211;V compound semiconductor solar cells, such as the GaAs solar cell. This is mainly owing to the challenges in achieving a uniform chemical composition and reducing nonradiative recombination defects during the growth process. In this study, we effectively addressed this challenge by directly performing postannealing within the metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition system. Following annealing, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current density (JSC) of the solar cells were improved by 38 mV and 3.84 mA/cm2, respectively. The analysis of voltage losses, along with time-resolved photoluminescence results, revealed that the improvements in VOC and JSC were attributed to the reduction of nonradiative recombination defects and enhancement of carrier lifetime, respectively. X-ray diffraction analysis showed a reduction in the full width at half maximum of the peak in annealed InGaAsP samples, indicating that annealing significantly enhanced the compositional uniformity of the material, which was likely driven by the redistribution of group-III atoms (In and Ga in InGaAsP) during the thermal annealing process. In addition, low-temperature photoluminescence results confirmed a reduction in nonradiative recombination defects, further corroborating the findings from the voltage-loss analysis. Postannealing treatments have significantly enhanced the crystal quality of InGaAsP, leading to a notable 32% improvement in the efficiency of InGaAsP solar cells in the best cases. Thus, this study highlighted annealing as an effective and scalable approach to optimizing the growth process for InGaAsP-based solar cells.</description></item><item><title>New Model for Estimating the Temperature and Solar Irradiance of Photovoltaic Panels Based on Maximum Power Point Tracking Measurements</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11165153</link><description>This article proposes a new method for estimating the temperature and irradiance of a photovoltaic module using current and voltage measurements within a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control system. Unlike traditional methods that depend on external data, such as those provided by complex irradiance and wind speed sensors and equipment, this approach relies solely on panel-specific I&#8211;V measurements needed for MPPT, enabling accurate estimations through a simpler and real-time method. A comparative evaluation of various panel temperature estimation techniques confirms that the proposed method outperforms existing ones, resulting in mean absolute estimation errors below 1 &#176;C for temperature and 4 W/m2 for irradiance. The method effectively addresses temperature variations, particularly under low irradiance conditions, where the proportional relationship between current and irradiance becomes less reliable. Results indicate that incorporating the estimated panel temperature significantly enhances irradiance predictions, especially in real-world operating conditions. Furthermore, the method remains valid even as the panel ages, making it a valuable tool for optimizing photovoltaic system performance. Given its simplicity and its low cost, this technique is well suited for real-time monitoring and optimization of solar energy installations.</description></item><item><title>Experimental Investigations on Performance and Safety of c-Si PV Modules Installed in Hot Semiarid Climatic Conditions in India</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11153737</link><description>In this study, field testing of multicrystalline-Si photovoltaic (PV) modules was carried out in a 760-kWp grid-interactive solar PV (SPV) power plant at Manesar, Haryana.

The results indicate that out of 125 tested PV modules, 83 (66.4%) failed in the wet leakage current test, 122 (97.6%) had hotspot issues, and all the modules exhibited visual defects, such as delamination, ingression of water, moisture and dust particles, snail trail, edge sealant degradation, corrosion of PV cell metallic contacts, visible cell cracks, and burn marks, in PV cells. For the PV modules tested, an average annual power degradation of 2.46% was observed with maximum and minimum degradation of 6.15% and 1.25% per year, respectively. The failure mode and effects analysis outcomes suggest that the maximum risk level for PV modules under investigation is edge seal degradation and delamination with the highest risk priority numbers (RPNs) (RPN = 360 and 350, respectively).

However, in-flight icing presents significant challenges, impacting both aerodynamic performance and the operational reliability of UAV-integrated photovoltaic (PV) systems. Ice accumulation on wings degrades mechanical properties, while icing on PV modules obstructs sunlight, adversely affecting their parameters. Partial shading from ice is more harmful than uniform shading, complicating PV module behavior analysis. This study presents a novel approach to model the behavior of UAV-integrated PV modules incorporating the impact of nonuniform in-flight icing into irradiance calculations. By analyzing how ice formation acts as an obstacle and considering its effect on the PV module governing equations, this research develops a computational framework alongside with segmenting the PV module's operational curve into two zones: ice-covered and normal. The parameters for these zones are determined using advanced computational intelligence methods. The proposed method enables predictions of PV module performance using trained machine learning models, enhanced by the minimum redundancy maximum relevance technique, under dynamic and adverse conditions such as movement-induced sunlight variations and partial shading. The trained models&#8217; performance is validated through experimental tests, demonstrating the reliability and effectiveness of the approach.</description></item><item><title>Wireless Sensor Network-Based Fault Detection and Localization for Solar Stations: An Experimental Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11107362</link><description>This article introduces a wireless sensor network (WSN) system that enhances photovoltaic (PV) performance during shading through real-time fault detection and adaptive optimisation.

In this context, this article proposes a new three-stage optimization-based framework for the grid-connected sizing of a PV power plant. In Stage 1, the $k$-means clustering algorithm is utilized to determine the placement and dimensions of the inverters, as well as the number of strings and the arrangement of PV modules in strings. During Stage 2, the DC wiring is sized to facilitate the connection between the PV strings and the inverters. Finally, in Stage 3, the AC wiring is sized to connect the inverters to the power substation. Stages 2 and 3 are formulated as mixed-integer linear programming problems to minimize investment costs and reduce AC power losses. The framework is implemented using different tools and libraries, including Quantum Geographic Information System for geospatial panel placement, Python libraries such as scikit-learn for clustering, and Pyomo for modeling the optimization problem of Stages 2 and 3 with the Gurobi solver. A real-world case study of a PV power plant located in Brazil, which covers an area of 13 000 m$^{2}$ and a nominal power of 1.2 MW, is used to validate the proposed framework. The results demonstrate the robustness, feasibility, and scalability of the proposed methodology.</description></item><item><title>Smarter PV Single Axis Tracking: A Study on Diffused Light Capture</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11141479</link><description>Solar trackers are advantageous for photovoltaic (PV) systems, typically generating more energy than those mounted on fixed racks. However, this is not always the case, when the sun is obscured by clouds, it is often more efficient to position the PV panel in a fixed horizontal position toward the zenith in order to collect the most diffuse irradiance. This study introduces a hybrid single-axis tracking (SAT) algorithm, named Sundelay, which utilizes sky images to determine the optimal moments for switching between sun tracking and a fixed horizontal position. Sundelay is evaluated through simulations conducted in two distinct locations: Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Eugene, Oregon. The simulations leverage a novel dataset comprising minutely recorded $180^{\circ }$ direct irradiance measurements obtained from a multiplanar irradiance sensor (MPI) and images captured by an all-sky camera. Our findings indicate energy gains of up to 4.3% with a 61% reduction in the movement of the SAT system over a month, while maintaining minimal impact on irradiance and movement during clear sky conditions.</description></item><item><title>An Interpretable Deep Learning Model for Solar Power Generation Forecasting in a Grid-Connected Hybrid Solar System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11214301</link><description>Solar energy adoption is rapidly growing as a sustainable option, with solar panels used on residential buildings, commercial properties, and large-scale farms. However, the unpredictable nature of solar power can lead to suboptimal energy generation from photovoltaic (PV) panels. Despite the high effectiveness of deep learning (DL) models in forecasting PV power, they often struggle with the perception of being &#8220;closed boxes&#8221; that lack clear explanations for their prediction results, which fail to highlight the key features for PV prediction. To address the critical issue of full transparency, this study explores a well-known DL model named lightweight deep neural network (LWDNN) in PV power forecasting, along with the application of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) tools like Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). Real-time data collected from a grid-connected solar PV system located in Dhaka were utilized to perform the prediction. By enabling XAI model interpretation, we identified feature contributions and explained individual predictions, reducing training computational demands without compromising accuracy. The reliability of the LWDNN model is assessed using both complete and reduced feature sets through performance metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2). The test results show that the proposed LWDNN model based on SHAP analysis outperforms conventional schemes by achieving RMSE = 6.180 kW, MAE = 1.939 kW, and R2 = 0.988. Finally, the model was implemented on a Raspberry Pi for low-power solar forecasting, demonstrating the feasibility of edge deployment.</description></item><item><title>Impact of Wind Speed and Direction on Cooling of a Pontoon-Based Floating Photovoltaic System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11196060</link><description>Floating photovoltaics (FPVs) are gaining traction as a land-saving alternative to ground-mounted photovoltaics (GPV). A commonly cited advantage of FPVs is their potential for lower operating temperatures due to the cooling effect of water. However, existing literature shows that the thermal performance of FPV systems may not consistently exceed that of GPV systems, as it is influenced by technology and location. Consequently, studying the thermal properties of a range of FPV systems is crucial to optimize power output and enable accurate energy yield modeling for new sites. This work investigates the thermal properties and calculated heat loss coefficients, or U-values, associated with the Faiman model for an FPV system using Ciel &amp; Terre's Hydrelio Air floats, located in a pond in South Africa. A dependence of U-values on wind direction was observed, with improved cooling when the wind approaches from the rear side of the system. The estimated U-value components were U0 = 21.6 W/m2&#183;K and U1 = 3.60 W&#183;s/m3&#183;K for wind from the front and U0 = 19.4 W/m2&#183;K and U1 = 7.10 W&#183;s/m3&#183;K for wind from the rear side. The impact of the observed cooling variation due to wind direction on system performance was also evaluated, revealing a 1.7% increase in median performance ratio when the wind originates from the rear side.</description></item><item><title>An Anomaly Detection Method for the Output Power of Photovoltaic Arrays Based on TKAN</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11137363</link><description>One of the greatest challenges facing photovoltaic (PV) power generation systems today is maintaining their operation at the desired power generation efficiency. To achieve this goal, the anomaly detection of the output power of PV arrays is crucial for ensuring reliability and safety. This article proposes an anomaly detection for the output power of PV arrays based on temporal Kolmogorov&#8211;Arnold networks (TKANs). First, a dataset of PV array parameters is constructed by selecting the time series of output power, ambient temperature, component temperature, and irradiance of the PV array as input features. Second, the PV array parameter dataset undergoes feature normalization by obtaining the boundary values of environmental information and operating parameters, and scaling them to the range of 0&#8211;1. Then, the processed dataset is trained using the TKAN neural network to obtain the anomaly detection model of the output power of the PV array. Finally, the proposed method is compared and analyzed with three other methods, such as Isolation Forest, $K$-means, and long short-term memory, verifying its reliability and superiority. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in a self-built PV power plant.</description></item><item><title>Is the Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) a Sufficient Indicator to Describe the Efficiency of Agrivoltaic System?</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11192315</link><description>The land equivalent ratio (LER) is a widely used coefficient by researchers in studies related to agrivoltaic systems.

However, the linear challenge-response mapping of the arbiter PUF (APUF) and variants render these structures more susceptible to modeling attacks due to their delayed linear structure. In this article, we propose a nonlinearized demultiplexer time-to-digital converter (DEMUX-TDC) PUF. This PUF uses a quantized delay difference technique to alter the traditional response generation mechanism, demonstrating robust resistance against modeling attacks. First, the proposed PUF employs a segmented APUF variant structure configured in both front and back segmented modes to generate a source of delay difference entropy. Additionally, the scheme incorporates a multilayer differential tapped TDC circuit to quantize the delay differences into digital codes, followed by a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) to obfuscate the final output response. We further propose a highly secure mutual authentication protocol based on reconfigurable PUF, by leveraging the characteristics of front and back segments of the PUF&#8217;s challenge. Evaluation of the proposed scheme on the implementation of Xilinx Virtex-7 and Spartan-6 field-programmable gate array (FPGA) demonstrates that the uniqueness and uniformity can reach ideal value, in the condition of prediction accuracy across six modeling attacks remaining around 50%.</description></item><item><title>A 4.447 mW at 100 MHz and 49.62% Uniqueness XNOR&#8211;XOR RO PUF ASIC Using 180-nm CMOS Process for IoT Security Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988905</link><description>Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are increasingly recognized as a key technology for enhancing hardware and the Internet of Things (IoT) security.

Based on behavioral-level simulations and prototype chip testing, ultralow-power operation and significant chip area reduction are achieved. This novel switching scheme employs voltage level shifting instead of charge redistribution for the two most significant bit (MSB) decisions, thus eliminating switching power consumption. For the remaining bit decision, the technique minimizes reference voltage transitions while involving only a single capacitor in each switching. By employing the proposed switching scheme, the capacitance spread of capacitive digital-to-analog converter (CDAC) is reduced from conventional  $2^{n-1}$  to  $2^{n-3}$ , which reduces the CDAC area, relaxes capacitor matching requirements, and improves matching linearity.

Regarding circuit-level error correction, we introduce an error-correcting flip-flop (ECFF), leveraging time-borrowing for zero-cycle response latency without requiring pipeline refresh. The custom-optimized ECFF adds only six transistors, increasing delay, dynamic power, and static power by 15%, 11%, and 14%, respectively, compared with a standard flip-flop, ensuring efficient error correction with minimal cost. A system-level voltage tuning strategy is further developed to handle continuous timing errors, ensuring robust adaptive voltage scaling (AVS) operation. Implemented on a neural network (NN) accelerator in the 28-nm CMOS, the system operates across a wide voltage range from 0.54 to 0.9 V. It achieves up to 52% power gain or 123% frequency gain at the near-threshold region, with negligible area and power overhead compared with the margined baseline.</description></item><item><title>TUTPFL: Triple Node Upset-Tolerant and Single-Event Transient-Filtered Low-Power Latch With HSPICE and FPGA-Based Verifications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11021686</link><description>In nanoscale CMOS technology, harsh radiations in the environment can now easily cause soft errors, e.g., single-event transients (SETs) and triple node upsets (TNUs), severely affecting the reliability of space applications. In this article, TNUs tolerant and SET-pulses filtered latch (TUTPFL) with low power is proposed, which comprises from four input-stage C-elements (CEs), four inverters, and three output-stage CEs. The CEs&#8217; delay differential enables the TUTPFL latch to effectively filter SET-pulse, while the CEs&#8217; multilevel error-interception property enables the TUTPFL latch to tolerate any possible TNU. The results of HSPICE-based simulations and FPGA-based emulations demonstrate the TNU tolerance and SET filterability of the TUTPFL latch. Meanwhile, compared to the alternative radiation-hardened latches, the TUTPFL latch reduces power dissipation by roughly 20.43% on average.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Approximate Multipliers With Merits Balance for Digital Processing and Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11086519</link><description>In this article, hybrid approximate multiplier (HAMs) designs based on the combination of logarithmic multiplication and piecewise linear (PWL) fitting are proposed. After extracting the exponent and mantissa of the input operands, two new variables are introduced to perform spatial mixed linear fitting on the 3-D surface of the mantissa product in different regions. Limited power-of-2 elements in line slopes make the multivariable mixed PWL computational simple and friendly to logic circuit complexity. With iterative adjustment of the slopes and bias of the lines in the PWL calculation, the relative error distance (RED) distribution is well balanced and zero concentrated. In addition, we detail the logic architecture to implement approximate hybrid accumulation and error-tolerant complement conversions. In the 45-nm library-based performance comparison, the proposed multipliers&#8212;mainly 16-, 8-, and 32-bit floating-point multipliers&#8212;exhibit &gt;55% power, &gt;23% delay, and &gt;43% area reductions compared with the exact multiplier. In addition, they outperform other state-of-the-art designs in terms of delay, power, area, and error, as evaluated by the joint delay&#8211;power&#8211;area product (PPA) and mean RED (MRED). In case experiments, the proposed multipliers perform nearly equivalently to the exact multiplier in error-tolerant digital processing and neural network computations.</description></item><item><title>Efficiency Optimization of Voltage-Mode CMOS Digital Doherty Power Amplifiers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11073819</link><description>This article analyzes the behavior of a single supply asymmetric Doherty power amplifier, made of two switched-capacitor power amplifiers (SCPAs) and a power combining network. The proposed analysis shows that there is an optimal power partition between the two SCPAs that maximizes the efficiency at each output power level. The optimal control of the PA leads to two power back-off (PBO) efficiency peaks, whose magnitude depends on the size of the switches of each SCPA and on the matching network design. The optimization of both switch sizing and output network design is carried out analytically. The achieved theoretical results are then verified by transistor-level simulations. They have also been validated by measurements performed on a prototype, fully integrated in a commercial 22-nm CMOS technology, at an operation frequency of 2.3 GHz.</description></item><item><title>A 0.97 nJ/Conversion BJT-Based Temperature Sensor With a Low-Power Two-Stage Dynamic Comparator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11096720</link><description>This article presents a low-power fully CMOS temperature sensor in a 65 nm process, suitable for monitoring the battery-powered application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designs. The circuit converts a proportional-to-absolute-temperature (PTAT) current to a complementary-to-absolute-temperature (CTAT) binary code using a low-power time-to-digital converter to-digital converter (TDC). To enhance conversion efficiency, we introduce a two-stage dynamic comparator that consumes 40% less power than conventional designs by enabling the preamplifier only when precise detection of the integration stop time is required. The 0.16  $\text{mm}^{2}$  prototype consumes only 0.97 nJ/conversion, achieving a resolution figure of merit (FoM) of 0.018 nJ  $\cdot $   $\text{K}^{2}$ .

Current works mainly focus on prior off-chip or intuitive/heuristic access optimization and lack a theoretically holistic analysis. Therefore, this article proposes an overall on- and off-chip communication-minimized CNN acceleration framework. First, we derive the layer-wise off-chip communication analytic expressions (AEs) based on different data reuse strategies and give their lower bound (LB), reaching 6%&#8211;18% lower than that proposed in work CLB. For practical off-chip access, we achieve 22%&#8211;35% reduction compared with the adaptive access strategy of work Sense and 11% with the dataflow selection approach of work Versa. Second, on-chip communication AEs and LB are derived within the tile range, and overall on- and off-chip access analysis is conducted to obtain the unified energy LB (ELB). Guided by our theoretical model, we design window-primitive (WP) dataflow and an energy-efficient systolic-cross-line (SCL) CNN accelerator. Finally, a holistic framework, Comma, is proposed to streamline the workflow of model-architecture co-design. SCL is implemented in 65-nm technology and achieves  $4.2\times $  pJ/Multiply and ACcumulation (MAC) energy reduction at  $1.4\times $  less on-chip memory area compared with Eyeriss, and 1.4~ $1.9\times $  reduction at 3~ $4\times $  less area compared with work CLB; as for systolic architecture, Sense, it achieves 29%&#8211;44% energy reduction with 4% area overhead. For the near memory processing (NMP) situation, we reduce around  $2\times $  access energy compared with the systolic NMP architecture.</description></item><item><title>ASiM: Modeling and Analyzing Inference Accuracy of SRAM-Based Analog CiM Circuits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11152313</link><description>Static random-access memory (SRAM)-based analog compute-in-memory (ACiM) demonstrates promising energy efficiency for deep neural network (DNN) processing. Nevertheless, efforts to optimize efficiency frequently compromise accuracy, and this trade-off remains insufficiently studied due to the difficulty of performing full-system validation. Specifically, existing simulation tools rarely target SRAM-based ACiM and exhibit inconsistent accuracy predictions, highlighting the need for a standardized, SRAM compute-in-memory (CiM) circuit-aware evaluation methodology. This article presents ASiM, a simulation framework for evaluating inference accuracy in SRAM-based ACiM systems. ASiM captures critical effects in SRAM-based analog compute in memory systems, such as analog-to-digital converter (ADC) quantization, bit-parallel encoding, and analog noise, which must be modeled with high fidelity due to their distinct behavior in charge-domain architectures compared to other memory technologies. ASiM supports a wide range of modern DNN workloads, including CNN and Transformer-based models such as ViT, and scales to large-scale tasks like ImageNet classification. Our results indicate that bit-parallel encoding can improve energy efficiency with only modest accuracy degradation; however, even 1 LSB of analog noise can significantly impair inference performance, particularly in complex tasks such as ImageNet. To address this, we explore hybrid analog-digital execution and majority voting schemes, both of which enhance robustness without negating energy savings. ASiM bridges the gap between hardware design and inference performance, offering actionable insights for energy-efficient, high-accuracy ACiM deployment.

For rapid prototyping of these types of application-specific processors, designers leverage hardware (HW)/software (SW) co-design to create hardware implementations and retarget the compiler using a high-level description of the instruction set extension. Ideally, the architecture description should be flexible enough to support both hardware generation and compiler retargeting from the same description format. The challenge with these methods lies in coupling hardware extensions with the processor core, because using microarchitecture-specific interfaces leads to low design reuse and increased verification effort. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce a HW/SW co-design toolset capable of adapting to a user-defined architecture description that captures the instruction set extension semantics. Based on the architecture description, the toolset can both retarget the compiler and generate co-processors interfacing with the Core-V eXtension interface (CV-X-IF) and Rocket custom co-processor interface (RoCC) protocols that are widely used standard interfaces for RISC-V processors. To demonstrate our methods, we integrate the co-processors with two different variations of CVA6 and Rocket core. The resulting execution time reduction is up to 40% on average, with an area overhead of 8% for the CVA6. For the Rocket core, the execution time reduction is 27% with a 6% area overhead.</description></item><item><title>A Secure-by-Design Hardware/Operating System as a Substrate for Trustworthy Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11068203</link><description>Nowadays, digital devices like sensors, cell phones, and home servers are deeply embedded in our world to make our daily lives easier. Since we heavily rely on these systems, it is crucial to guarantee their correct functionality and to ensure security and privacy properties. As systems become increasingly complex, it is difficult to maintain security since it necessitates a thorough understanding of all functionalities in hardware and software. Complexity may lead to vulnerabilities that malicious components can exploit. These components can compromise security features provided by the processing cores and the operating system (OS), jeopardizing the overall trustworthiness of the system. In this article, we provide a secure-by-default hardware/OS co-design to build a substrate for trustworthy computing in digital devices. The design is based on a tiled architecture that can integrate untrusted hardware components. Instead of relying on isolation mechanisms of potentially malicious components, isolation is achieved by dedicated and independent hardware components called trusted communication units (TCUs). By keeping the attack surface small and isolating all components by default, malicious hardware and software are restricted in access permissions and, hence, cannot easily break the system&#8217;s security. We implemented a TCU-based multiprocessor architecture in a silicon research chip, called Masur23, and ran transfer workloads and selected portions of the microkernel-based OS M3. Our measurements demonstrate the feasibility of such a hardware/OS co-design for trustworthy computing. Compared to the entire chip implementation, security features require minimal latency, area, and power consumption overhead.</description></item><item><title>FASE: An FPGA-Based Accelerator for Lightweight Sample Entropy With Monte Carlo Sampling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11115970</link><description>Sample entropy (SampEn) is an algorithm within information entropy that enables effective analysis of biological signals. Due to the need for extensive similarity matching operations, the SampEn calculation process is time-consuming. Although a series of fast SampEn algorithms have been proposed, they remain time-intensive when processing large data volumes. Additionally, previous field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based hardware accelerators designed for SampEn suffer from architectural design limitations, consuming substantial on-chip memory resources and operating at low frequencies. In this article, we propose FASE, an FPGA-based accelerator for lightweight sample entropy (LW-SampEn) with Monte Carlo (MC) sampling. The FASE design comprises two main parts: algorithm and hardware optimizations. On the algorithmic side, we introduce MC sampling into the merge-sort-based LW-SampEn algorithm, named MCLW-SampEn. MCLW-SampEn effectively reduces the computation load for large data volumes while maintaining algorithmic accuracy. For hardware, we first design efficient sorting and allocation modules to address boundary localization and load imbalance issues in previous accelerator designs. Then, we replicate the computation across the main phases to enable parallel processing. Finally, we deploy the design on the Pynq-Z2 board for validation. Experimental results show that the proposed MCLW-SampEn algorithm achieves an average speed up of  $3\times $  over the LW-SampEn algorithm, with accuracy losses kept within 0.5%. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) designs, FASE achieves an average speed up of  $12.8\times $  while reducing power consumption by 89.3%. Ablation studies indicate that, for the same algorithm, FASE offers a  $7.4\times $  speedup over related FPGA designs.</description></item><item><title>A 3-bit/Unit Time-Domain Compute-In-Memory Macro With Adjustable Unit Delay</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11074771</link><description>With the increasing demand for high-energy efficiency in multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations within deep learning accelerators, computing-in-memory (CIM) has gained significant attention. Time-domain (TD) CIM eliminates the need for analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), but single-bit delay units suffer from low computational efficiency. To address these issues, this work presents a TD multibit-per-unit CIM macro that leverages a precision-configurable time-to-digital converter (TDC) to enable accuracy configurability. Experimental results show that the proposed design achieves a 3-bit delay unit as a multibit CIM unit and an overall of 3-byte weight precision and 8-bit input precision. Compared to using three 1-bit/unit CIM delay units with an adder, it achieves a linearity with linear offset less than 3%. Besides, bias voltage adjusts the frequency and precision of the circuit (from 600 to 900 mV), enabling a minimum delay step of 0.11 ns. This system achieves a maximum energy efficiency of 268 TOPS/W under different VDD, making it a promising solution for always-on edge AI applications.</description></item><item><title>A Fully Integrated 4:1 DC&#8211;DC Converter With Series Transmission and Parallel Reception Through Electromagnetically Coupled Class-D LC Oscillators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002629</link><description>This article presents a fully integrated 4:1 dc-dc converter based on electromagnetically coupled Class-D LC (EMLC) oscillators. A series-transmission and parallel-reception (STPR) topology is proposed to achieve a scalable conversion ratio without significant efficiency degradation. Three power-transmitting oscillators (PTOs) and one merged power-receiving oscillator (PRO) are coupled at once via an on-chip quad-stacked transformer, resulting in a compact layout that reduces the required area and complexity. A prototype IC implemented in a 28-nm CMOS process achieves a high conversion ratio of 4:1 with a peak efficiency of 74.5% and supports input voltage up to 3.6 V. It achieves a peak power density of 0.78 W/mm2 while maintaining efficiency above 67% at peak power density. The converter also supports 1:4 step-up and 4:3 step-down conversions, delivering peak efficiencies of 74.3% and 90.3%, with peak power densities of 0.68 and 3.27 W/mm2, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Compact Low-Power 16 b SAR ADC Using Reservoir-Charge-Redistributed DAC and Configurable FIA-Based Comparator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045282</link><description>This article presents a reservoir-charge-redistributed (RCR) successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that facilitates a high linearity and compact area in low power. Conventional on-chip passive charge sharing (PCS) mitigates the bondwire influence on the off-chip reference voltage for the capacitive digital-to-analog converter (DAC) ( $C_{\text {DAC}}$ ). It, however, suffers from a considerable reservoir capacitor ( $C_{\text {REF}}$ ), poor linearity, and dynamic range (DR) loss. Unlike prior PCS schemes, the proposed RCR offers an individual  $C_{\text {REF}}$  to each bit trial, and each  $C_{\text {REF}}$  only performs charge redistribution once, which is enabled by the subranging architecture. These unique characteristics significantly decouple the compromise between linearity and DR loss and area. Furthermore, a configurable sequentially charged floating inverter amplifier (SC-FIA)-based comparator is also presented to improve energy efficiency further. Incorporated these techniques in a 16-bit SAR ADC, the prototype in 65-nm CMOS process achieves an 80.9-dB signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) and 100.3-dB spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) at Nyquist input, consuming  $291.7~\mu $ W power from a single supply at 1 MS/s, and yielding a 32.1-fJ/conv.-step Walden figure of merit (FoMW) and 173.3-dB Schreier FoM (FoMS).</description></item><item><title>A 320-MHz NS TD-ADC-Assisted C/DT Hybrid Pipelined ADC With Single OTA Second-Order RAF</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11072697</link><description>This article presents a noise-shaping time-domain analog-to-digital converter (NS TD-ADC)-assisted continuous/discrete time (C/DT) hybrid pipelined ADC architecture in conjunction with a single operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) second-order residue amplifying filter (RAF), facilitating high power efficiency at wideband target. Besides, using a high-speed NS TD-ADC as the 1st-stage sub-quantizer (QTZ) effectively suppresses the tonal behavior due to the low-resolution residue. The RAF exploits the single-amplifier biquad (SAB)-based structure to realize a single OTA second-order filtering, thus simplifying the design and preserving high energy efficiency. The backend DT QTZ is with  $2{\times }$  time-interleaved (TI), which eases the compromise between speed and power efficiency in the CT pipelined (CT Pipe) ADC design. Fabricated in a 28-nm process, the design obtains 65.4-dB signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) with 320-MHz bandwidth while consuming 56.17 mW from 1.4- to 0.95-V power supplies. The prototype exhibits a dynamic range of 68 dB with a Schreier figure of merit (FoM) of 163 dB, demonstrating a high power efficiency under 2.4-GHz sampling frequency.</description></item><item><title>An LTPS-TFT-Based Large-Area PPG Readout Circuits With Improved Linearity and Robustness for Flexible Healthcare Ring</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11104841</link><description>Thin-film transistor (TFT) can be fabricated on flexible substrates, offering potential for seamless, long-term wearable health monitoring. However, the limited performance, process variation, and motion artifacts hinder the widespread adoption of flexible wearable devices. This article presents a TFT-based photoplethysmography (PPG) acquisition circuit for flexible healthcare rings, integrating a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) based analog front-end (AFE) to overcome the performance limitations caused by the low mobility of TFT devices. Meanwhile, a dead-zone free (DZ-Free) phase-frequency detector (PFD) was proposed and integrated into the VCO transimpedance amplifier (TIA) to enhance the linearity. Additionally, a 0-1 MASH VCO-analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) structure was adopted to improve the quantization dynamic range (DR). The system is implemented using  $\text {3-}$  $\mu $ m low-temperature poly-silicon (LTPS) TFT (LTPS-TFT) process of TIANMA Microelectronics. The measurement results show that DZ-Free PFD improves the linearity and the proposed VCO-TIA achieves a 61.5-dB DR. The proposed ADC demonstrates a 72-dB spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR), a 65.8-dB SNDR and an 80-dB DR. Under temperature sweeping from  ${-40}~{\mathrm {~^{\circ}C}}$  to  $80~{\mathrm {~^{\circ}C}}$  and supply voltage variations of  $10~{\pm }~2$  V, the ADC maintains performance variations within 3%, while the TIA stably sustains a gain of 110 dB $\Omega $ . Finally, PPG and blood oxygen saturation ( $\text {SpO}_{{2}}$ ) measurements were demonstrated, including ambient light compensation. This work provides a feasibility demonstration for TFT-based fully integrated flexible electronics in bio-signal monitoring applications.</description></item><item><title>A Wireless Battery-Free Cerebral-Oxygen-Monitoring Micro-System Featuring 0.21-mmHg Sensing Resolution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11039219</link><description>Cerebral oxygen reflects the oxidative metabolism in neurons, which can be monitored by detecting the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) in brain, to evaluate various brain diseases such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) as well as study the brain activities in response to transient oxygenation changes. To continuously detect the cerebral oxygen of freely moving subjects, cerebral oxygen monitoring (COM) devices are required to be wireless, high resolution, and long lifetime. In conventional wireless PO2 sensors, the optical devices present a short lifetime due to the power-hungry LED driver, whereas the existing electrochemical sensors suffer from both a bulky battery and a low resolution. In this work, we propose two techniques to address the issues in conventional PO2 sensors: 1) a sensing-current-reuse technique is proposed to cut down the power of current-detection circuit, which eliminates the power-hungry trans-impedance amplifier (TIA) and current-mirror amplifier in conventional potentiostats and 2) a bipolar residual zoom-in (BRZ) technique is proposed to improve the current-sensing resolution with low power dissipation. The proposed wireless COM chip is fabricated in a 55-nm CMOS process, which is integrated with a self-designed electrochemical PO2 sensor. The measured results show that an in vitro sensing resolution of 0.21 mmHg in oxygen value is achieved by the proposed BRZ technique. In addition, the 25- $\mu $ W low power enables 2-m range battery-free telemetry based on wireless power transfer (WPT) and backscatter communication.</description></item><item><title>A Rail-to-Rail Input NS-Pipelined-SAR ADC With Self-Boosted Input Impedance and Reused Residue Amplifier for Biosignal Acquisition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11098881</link><description>This article presents an energy-efficient 3rd-order noise-shaping (NS) pipelined-SAR ADC (NSP-ADC) with rail-to-rail input range and high input impedance over-the-bandwidth for biosignal acquisition. The two-stage pipelined-SAR architecture provides high resolution with low oversampling ratio (OSR) and inherent wide linear input range. In the proposed self-boosted input impedance technique, the previous sampled charge is exactly recovered without additional charging circuits, significantly improving the input impedance with high energy and hardware efficiency. Besides, to fit in the NS-pipelined-SAR architecture, the charge-sharing-based sampling noise cancellation (SNC) is presented. It boosts the input impedance further by reducing sampling capacitance and improves linear input range by nonlinearity cancellation. In addition, benefiting from the compact charge-sharing-based NS, the interstage residue amplifier (RA) of the pipelined-SAR ADC is reused by the SNC and NS circuits of both stages to further save power. Fabricated in 180-nm 1P6M standard CMOS, the proposed NSP-ADC shows an input impedance of &gt;150 M $\Omega $  over 1 kHz. With a low OSR of 10, it achieves the SNDR and SFDR of 87.3 and 95.2 dB, respectively, with a 1.96-Vpp differential input, while only consuming  $7~{\mu }$ W at a sampling rate of 20 kS/s.</description></item><item><title>A Compact D-Band Phase Shifter With 0.1-Degree Phase Resolution and Ultra-Low Phase Error in 65-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11039215</link><description>This article introduces a compact D-band phase shifter, which achieves high-resolution phase steps and ultra-low phase error, designed for the sixth-generation (6G) mobile network. The proposed design integrates two novel circuit architectures: a feedback fine-tuning phase shifter (FFPS) provides precise phase control with fine 0.1&#176; steps over a 22.5&#176; range by using a feedback transmission line (TL) to enhance gain and tuning range. The second architecture is a two-mode non-uniform propagation delay phase shifter (2-mode NU-PDPS), which enables coarse phase tuning with 22.5&#176; steps, covering a full 360&#176; phase range. It employs non-uniform MOSFET sizing to realize ideal TL operation. In addition, two modes are introduced in the quarter-wave TL to increase phase resolution without increasing area and thus achieves a core area of 0.06 $\text {mm}^{2}$ . The proposed phase shifter operates with 0.1&#176; steps over a 360&#176; fine-tuning range within the frequency range of 150&#8211;160 GHz. It achieves an rms phase error of 0.68&#176;, the lowest among reported phase shifters in this frequency range.

The proposed TX implemented in 65-nm CMOS achieves a high system efficiency of 25.1% at 0-dBm output with closed-loop modulation. The reference spur level is reduced by more than 18 dB in both PLL and BLE spectrum. The TX exhibits second-harmonic distortion (HD2) and HD3 values of &#8722;50.1 and &#8722;52.1 dBm, respectively.

In the proposed time-modulated architecture, phase-shifted beam signals are sequentially fed into dedicated power amplifiers (PAs) at different time slots, contrasting with the conventional voltage-domain beam combination. Thus, the linearity and efficiency problems in conventional architecture are avoided, while maintaining comparable effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) performance. On the other hand, as each beam is transmitted in turn through different PAs, the phase compensation provided by phase shifters (PSs) deteriorates outside the main lobe region, providing the desired physical layer security. The proposed TX is fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, where a canceling-based time modulator and a synchronous clock distribution network are implemented to support the time modulation. A measured 20.9-dBm saturation output power (Psat) and 9.37% power-added efficiency (PAE) at 6-dB power back off (PBO) from Psat are achieved. A two-beam, four-element TX system is implemented for over-the-air (OTA) measurements. The dual-beam measurement reveals the expected PAPR reduction, with an output power improvement of 1.1 dBm in 16-QAM for the 5% EVM and a 1.5-dBm improvement for 256-QAM at 4% EVM. Furthermore, the time-domain combination also suppresses the inter-beam power contention, resulting in constant performance regardless of the power of the other beam. When PA is saturated by beam 1 signal, the EVM of beam 2 is improved by 5.2%. The desired physical layer security is proved in single beam measurement, where the EVM of the eavesdropper increases from 4.8% to 18% at a 30&#176; angle.</description></item><item><title>A 14-to-32-Gb/s Deadzone-Free Referenceless CDR With Autocovariance-Based Seamless Frequency Detector in 40-nm CMOS Technology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029275</link><description>This article proposes a deadzone-free clock and data recovery (CDR) without an external reference clock. To extract a frequency difference, the proposed referenceless CDR adopts a stochastic frequency detector, which utilizes consecutive data and edge samples. Although the probability-based frequency detection (FD) technique is promising, a deadzone should be carefully considered to prevent false locking. Therefore, by analyzing the stochastic FD thoroughly, this work proposes an autocovariance-based stochastic FD (ASFD) to resolve the deadzone issue and provide a more robust CDR operation. Since the autocovariance function is easily implemented in the digital domain, the proposed digital CDR with the ASFD improves the frequency tracking ability with minimal hardware overhead. Fabricated in 40-nm CMOS technology, the prototype CDR occupies an active area of 0.032 mm2. The CDR achieves a seamless frequency locking with a capture range from 14 to 32 Gb/s and frequency acquisition time within  $7~{\mu }$ s. At 32 Gb/s, the CDR achieves a bit error rate (BER) of less than  $10{^{-12}}$  and an energy efficiency of 1.15 pJ/b at a supply voltage of 1.0 V.</description></item><item><title>A Monolithically Integrated DWDM Si-Photonics Transceiver for Chiplet Optical I/O</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11080352</link><description>A monolithically integrated dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) silicon photonics (SiPh) transceiver is presented.

However, fine-tuning RRAM-based SoCs remains challenging due to the inherent limitations of non-volatile memory (NVM) characteristics. This work proposes an NVM-endurance/latency-aware collaborative RRAM/static random access memory (SRAM) compute-in-memory (CIM) accelerator that addresses the difficulties associated with RRAM write operations during fine-tuning tasks for both CNN and transformer models. The major contributions are: 1) RRAM-most significant bit (MSB)&#8211;SRAM-least significant bit (LSB) (RMSL)-based collaborative CIM macros, mitigating RRAM cell flipping times and alleviating the endurance concern; 2) an RRAM-sparse-SRAM-dense (RSSD) weight updating engine, minimizing the long reading and writing latency associated with RRAM access; and 3) a row-wise pipeline weight gradient (WG) computing data flow with low-hardware overhead. With a maximum bit update of ten times per fine-tuning (20 epochs, from start to convergence), the system achieves an energy efficiency of 76.25 TOPS/W for the CIM macro and 22.07 TOPS/W for the overall system. Thanks to the bit-level collaborative CIM, the RRAM CIM macro achieves the same hardware utilization during fine-tuning and inference processes to support RRAM&#8217;s energy-efficient computing. The proposed CIM accelerator, fabricated using 28-nm CMOS technology, achieves up to  $143{\times }$  RRAM endurance improvement,  $117{\times }$  and  $144{\times }$  reduction in RRAM write power and latency.</description></item><item><title>A 28 nm 128-kb Exponent- and Mantissa-Computation-In-Memory Dual-Macro for Floating-Point and INT CNNs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10966029</link><description>Floating-point computing-in-memory (FP-CIM) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance the energy efficiency of cloud and edge artificial intelligence (AI) devices.

Previous 3-D PNN processors solely focused on the acceleration of algorithm structure [e.g., nearest neighbor searching, shared multi-layer perceptron (MLP), etc.] required due to the unordered and unstructured characteristics of point-cloud with the assumption that the entire point-cloud data are stored in external memory. However, they were impractical for real-time PNN in outdoor environments with LiDAR, because the LiDAR takes ~100 ms of sensing latency to obtain the 360&#176; fully scanned LiDAR points, causing a waste of system latency and additional delays due to external memory accesses. Moreover, their Cartesian-based bin partitioning method exacerbates workload imbalance in outdoor applications due to spatial sparsity as the point distribution becomes increasingly sparse with distance from the sensor, causing severe performance degradation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient 3-D PNN processor with LiDAR&#8211;PNN processor pipelined structure that eliminates the external memory between LiDAR and processor and hides sensing latency behind processing time by utilizing the mechanical characteristic of LiDAR with the following hardware features: 1) cylindrical partitioning core with novel cylindrical bin partitioning method as well as halo indexing to process with the partially scanned ( $2{\theta }$ ) data and mitigate the PNN accuracy loss; 2) pseudo-random number generator-based sampling unit and k-nearest neighbor searching cores with unified neighbor searching algorithm to reduce the computation cost; and 3) linked-list memory management unit and predicted memory allocator to efficiently manage the point-cloud and support the parallel processing of neighbor searching and shared MLP. As a result, the proposed PNN processor achieves 2.18 M point/s of peak performance and  $0.40~{\mu }$ J/point of energy with 108 K points.</description></item><item><title>A High-Resolution Solid-State LiDAR Sensor With Reconfigurable Histogramming Time-to-Digital Converter and Filter for Depth Refinement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11021650</link><description>An area-efficient, high-resolution CMOS light detection and ranging (LiDAR) capable of generating  $400 \times 112$  depth images is proposed. This sensor employs a rolling-scan architecture that is compatible with a row-addressable solid-state LiDAR system. To achieve high resolution, a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) analog front-end (AFE) circuit was implemented using only five nMOS transistors. A reconfigurable-resolution (RR) hTDC, capable of converting one-/two-channel signals with variable time resolutions of 1, 2, or 4 ns, is further proposed to implement a 400-channel histogramming time-to-digital converter (hTDC) with low memory overhead. The sensor leverages RR-hTDC to support two image resolution modes: macro and quadruple resolution (QR). In the macro mode,  $200 \times 56$  depth images can be acquired with a 1-ns time resolution. In the QR mode, the sensor can achieve  $400 \times 112$  high-resolution depth images with a 2-ns time resolution. In the range-enhanced (RE) mode, the time resolution is halved for distances beyond 100 m, enabling the detection range to be extended up to 200 m. A laser profile-based depth refining (DR) filter was used to compensate for the reduction in time resolution and ensure sub-centimeter time resolution, improving depth precision by 40% compared with the conventional QR mode. The prototype LiDAR sensor was fabricated as a 90-nm CMOS image sensor (CIS) process. In outdoor conditions under 135-klx sunlight, the worst case depth precision and accuracy for distances of 15&#8211;60 m were measured as 10 and 17 cm, respectively. Moreover, a relative precision of less than 0.18% was achieved over a 60&#8211;130-m range under 90-klx sunlight. The total power consumption of the sensor was measured to be 572 mW when operating at 20 frames/s under 70-klx sunlight.</description></item><item><title>A 50-MHz Pulse-Width Modulator Embodying Low-Loss Quasi-Dynamic Comparators for Very High-Frequency DC&#8211;DC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988788</link><description>In the next-generation Internet of Things (NG-IoT) applications with sub-50-mA loads, the state-of-the-art very high switching frequencies (VHFs, e.g., 50 MHz) dc-dc converters are typically power-inefficient at light loads, e.g., 60%. This is largely due to the high power losses of high-speed static comparators employed in the pulse-width modulator of the VHF converter, e.g., ~40% of the overall power losses. Dynamic comparators may mitigate the high loss, but they are impractical to pulse-width-modulation-based converters due to the high-speed clock generator requirement. To mitigate the power losses, we present a pulse-width-modulator converter embodying a proposed quasi-dynamic (QD) comparator (and its hysteretic variant). The innovation is the first-ever comparator that features a clock-free regenerative latch (CFRL), thereby enabling the comparator to simultaneously feature the high-speed and low-loss advantages of dynamic comparators, yet clockless operation of static comparators. Our 50-MHz pulse-modulator converter, realized in 65-nm CMOS and embodying the proposed QD comparators, features a high ~82% power efficiency at 10 mA (20% of max load)&#8212; ${\ge }20$ % higher power efficiency than the state-of-the-art VHF converters. The proposed QD comparator therein dissipates ~145- $\mu $ W power and features 2.9-ns propagation delay&#8212; ${\ge }40$ % lesser power-delay product than the state-of-the-art static comparators. The proposed QD comparator can be advantageously applied to replace static comparators in a myriad of applications, potentially improving their power efficiency without compromising high-speed operation.</description></item><item><title>A Dynamic Voltage-, Frequency-, and Resolution-Scalable (DVFRS) 8&#8211;10 b 12.5-to-734 MS/s Non-Interleaved SAR ADC With 0.8-to-5.9 fJ/conv-Step in 22-nm FDSOI</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10936988</link><description>High-efficiency analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are designed to operate over narrow supply, resolution, and frequency ranges. This work focuses on a scalable ADC architecture and design that can accommodate a wide range of wireless and wireline standards through variable sampling rate, precision, and supply voltage while maintaining high efficiency. The proposed ADC uses a fully dynamic flexible successive-approximation register (SAR) architecture with a wide range of supply adaptation to acclimate across a wide range of sampling rates. Furthermore, it also incorporates resolution-scalable DAC, comparator, and SAR logic to attain efficient conversion at multiple resolutions. A prototype is fabricated in 22-nm fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) technology, with the dynamic voltage-, frequency-, and resolution-scalable (DVFRS) ADC core occupying an active area of  $40\times 70~{\mu }$  m. All the measured chips operate at sampling rates from 12.5 to 734 MS/s at 8&#8211;10-bit nominal resolution, achieving 46&#8211;57.7-dB signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) and 56&#8211;74-dB spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR). A state-of-the-art record Walden and Schreier figure of merit FoMs of 0.84&#8211;5.87 fJ/conv-step and 175.4&#8211;163.7 dB, respectively, are attained across the operating sampling rates and resolutions.</description></item><item><title>A 71.5-dB SNDR 475-MS/s Ringamp-Based Pipelined SAR ADC With On-Chip Bit-Weight Calibration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10938680</link><description>This article presents a single-channel 13-bit pipelined successive-approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC). To achieve energy-efficient residue amplification, a ring amplifier (ringamp) with optimized biasing and common-mode feedback (CMFB) is utilized. The inter-stage gain and digital-to-analog converter (DAC) mismatch are calibrated by leveraging the proposed auxiliary-latch-based comparison-threshold dithering (CTD) and separate-averaging algorithm. This calibration achieves fast convergence, requiring only 4096 dither-injected samples for background gain-error correction. Fabricated in a 22-nm CMOS process, the ADC consumes 9.93 mW at 475 MS/s and achieves a peak signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) of 71.5 dB, yielding a Schreier figure of merit (FoMS) of 175.3 dB and a Walden figure of merit (FoMW) of 6.8 fJ/conversion-step.</description></item><item><title>dAJC: A 2.02-mW 50-Mb/s Direct Analog to MJPEG Converter for Video Sensor Nodes Using Switched Capacitor MAC-Quantizer With Process Calibration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11090156</link><description>With the advancement in the field of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Bodies (IoB), video camera applications utilizing video sensor nodes (VSNs) have become increasingly significant. These applications are pivotal in areas such as autonomous driving, health monitoring, machine vision, and security. Notable examples include their use in uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), body-worn cameras, and surveillance systems. However, these applications often face challenges related to power consumption, primarily due to the large data volumes generated by analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) during the transmission of digitized high-resolution video signals. This data deluge introduces additional processing and storage overheads, exacerbating the problem of resource-constrained sensor nodes having limited battery capacity. To address this challenge, we propose a low-power solution that performs video compression directly at the sensor while shifting computation from the digital domain to the energy-efficient analog domain (suitable for peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values below 40&#8211;50 dB). Unlike conventional architectures, which rely on digital signal processing (DSP) blocks for computation and compression after the ADC stage, our approach eliminates the need for these power-intensive digital blocks at the sensor. Instead, we employ a switched capacitor (SC)-based computation unit operating in the analog domain, significantly reducing overall power consumption. Additionally, we utilize a dynamically activated ADC that activates only for significant samples, which constitute a small fraction ( ${\le }5$ %) of the total captured analog video samples. This approach enables us to achieve approximately  ${\sim } 20{\times }$  lower analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion energy. By combining analog computation with the dynamically activated ADC, our proposed solution achieves at least  ${\gt } 2{\times }$  reduction in power consumption compared to a digital implementation, with only a ~5-dB degradation in PSNR&#8212;an imperceptible difference to the human eye. We also propose a calibration scheme to mitigate the impact of variations introduced by analog computation, thereby enhancing the PSNR of the decoded video or image.</description></item><item><title>RAC-NAF: A Reconfigurable Analog Circuitry for Nonlinear Activation Function Computation in Computing-in-Memory</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988857</link><description>The emerging computing-in-memory (CIM) architecture shows promise in efficiently processing deep neural networks (DNNs) by minimizing the data movement through analog in-memory computing. Unfortunately, the energy efficiency of CIM is still limited since it struggles to efficiently process the massive nonlinear activation functions (AFs) widely used in DNNs. In the current solutions, AFs require to be fulfilled in the digital domain with co-processors or lookup table (LUT). Therefore, a significant amount of data requires a round-trip conversion between the analog and digital domains at each AF process. The unavoidable analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog (AD/DA) conversions dominate the system&#8217;s power consumption and reduce the overall energy efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a reconfigurable analog circuitry for nonlinear AF computation, named RAC-NAF. It is a pure analog circuitry that utilizes Taylor approximation (TA) to fit the arbitrary AFs, thereby reducing AD/DA conversions. To enhance the accuracy, RAC-NAF adopts a segmentation calculation method (SCM) based on the characteristics of nonlinear AFs. Moreover, the RAC-NAF provides the capability for reconfiguration to support various AFs and can be easily integrated with the existing CIM accelerators. The experimental results show that the proposed RAC-NAF significantly improves the performance of the CIM accelerators and reduces the energy consumption. When performing inference on various CIM accelerators, the energy consumption of AD/DA conversions can be reduced up to  $12.31{\times }$ , while the overall energy efficiency can be increased by  $2.34{\times }$ &#8211; $5.20{\times }$ , and the accuracy loss is below 1%.</description></item><item><title>A 65-nm Digital Stochastic Compute-in-Memory CNN Processor With 8-bit Precision</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10949867</link><description>Compute-in-memory (CIM) is an emerging solution that embeds compute logic inside the memory array to achieve high energy efficiency and reduce memory access cost. However, current CIM solutions require bulky analog-to-digital converter (ADC)/digital-to-analog converters (DACs) that make the accelerator power hungry and unable to scale in the more advanced process with a low power supply. Stochastic computing (SC) is an attractive alternative digital compute scheme that uses tiny bit-serial logic, e.g., AND and OR, to perform the basic MAC operations on stochastic sequences. In this work, we propose a stochastic CIM (SCIM) approach that combines the benefits of SC and CIM accelerators. It eliminates the DACs/ADCs in CIM and adds CIM&#8217;s benefits to SC. We demonstrate a highly programmable convolutional neural network (CNN) accelerator that achieves up to 7.96-TOPS/W peak energy efficiency in 65 nm and inference accuracy comparable to 8-b fixed point.</description></item><item><title>A High-Accuracy and Ultra-Energy-Efficient Cardiac Arrhythmia Classification Processor for Wearable Intelligent ECG Monitoring</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10967238</link><description>Wearable intelligent electrocardiography (ECG) sensors with integrated cardiac arrhythmia classification processors have been used to detect and classify arrhythmia, alerting users to potential cardiac diseases. While state-of-the-art arrhythmia classification processors employ neural networks (NNs), the high computational complexity of NNs results in significant energy consumption, limiting the model size and classification performance of NNs. Additionally, inter-patient variation in ECG can lead to accuracy degradation when applying a trained NN to patients whose ECG features differ from those in the training dataset. In this work, we propose an ultra-energy-efficient cardiac arrhythmia classification processor incorporating three key technologies: 1) heartbeat difference-based classification to improve accuracy under inter-patient variation and reduce energy consumption; 2) event-driven NN computation with shared feature extraction to reduce energy consumption; and 3) an adaptive NN wake-up technique to reduce energy consumption while maintaining accuracy. The design was fabricated using 55-nm CMOS process technology and evaluated using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset. For arrhythmia classification, it demonstrates an energy consumption of  $0.09~{\mu }$ J per classification with 98.7%/96.6% accuracy for intra-patient and inter-patient testing, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A 28-nm 239-bp/&#956;J Agile Pangenome Analysis Accelerator for Multi-Scheme Read Mapping</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10955400</link><description>Recent advancements in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing have brought about a significant paradigm shift in genome analysis, moving from linear approaches to pangenome graphs.

To enhance performance without compromising accuracy, we introduce a neural architecture search (NAS) method to develop layer-wise mixed-precision and mixed-sparsity DNNs. However, the optimization cannot be directly applied to existing DNN accelerators due to the specific data requirements of layer-wise mixed precision and mixed sparsity. To address this issue, this research proposes separate mixed-precision and mixed-sparsity accelerators. Both accelerators demonstrate cutting-edge results. The mixed-precision accelerator utilizes a split-and-combination vector (SCV) to re-use variable precision units (1/2/4/8 bit) at each layer with a further vector systolic array (VSA) implementation. By optimizing NAS for mixed-precision VGG-16, the VSA achieves mixed energy efficiency reached 29.12 TOPS/W, which is equivalent to 2 bit and equivalent accuracy at 4 bit. The mixed-sparsity accelerator introduces a log-scale structured sparse encoding strategy, combined with MAC and group VSA (G-VSA) optimization, to enhance system performance. It achieves an average energy efficiency of up to 21.7 TOPS/W at 0.7 V and 400 MHz using 28-nm CMOS. The measured results show that the mixed-precision chip exhibits better energy efficiency and accuracy than the mixed-sparsity chip.</description></item><item><title>C-Transformer: An Energy-Efficient Homogeneous DNN-Transformer/SNN-Transformer Processor for Large Language Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964134</link><description>In this article, we propose a new language model processor named the C-Transformer to address the external memory bottleneck of language models.

Based on a simplified large-signal transistor model, we study the frequency-doubling mechanism of THz PPFDs and reveal that the input second harmonic, tuned by the common-mode (CM) source impedance, makes a profound impact on circuit performances, especially the bandwidth. Hence, to enable broadband THz PPFDs, we develop a source-tuning-based design scheme. In the scheme, a mode-decoupling harmonic source/load-pull strategy is used to identify the broadband optimal CM source and second harmonic load impedances, and a slotline-based second harmonic source-tuning technique then helps to realize the source impedance and simultaneously implements the broadband input matching. As a proof-of-concept, the proposed design scheme is applied in a full H-band amplifier-doubler chain in 0.13- $\mu $ m SiGe BiCMOS.

Compared with VSLAM frontend, VSLAM backend plays a more important role as it is employed to improve the localization accuracy. However, the VSLAM backend usually uses Bundle Adjustment (BA) as its core optimization method which is well-known for its large scale of problem construction, high computational complexity and high serialization of data processing, making it difficult to achieve high performance and energy efficiency on platforms such as CPUs or GPUs. Although there are some VSLAM backend accelerators proposed recently for addressing the above issues, they did not well exploit the data regularity and computational characteristics, resulting in limited performance/energy efficiency improvements or degraded accuracy. In this work, we propose VSLAM-BA which is a high performance and energy-efficient VSLAM backend accelerator with algorithm-hardware co-design. On the algorithm level, a keyframe-split-based Schur elimination scheme is proposed to reduce latency, power consumption and memory storage while maintaining accuracy. On the hardware level, a column-folding-based computing architecture is proposed to boost performance and energy efficiency. A loading-sensitive matrix-computing technique with an adaptive task scheduler is proposed to reduce the latency and energy consumption. Further, a recyclable computing technique with point-aware solver is proposed to reduce the memory and energy consumption. The experimental results show that the proposed VSLAM-BA achieves the highest performance (380 fps) and the highest energy efficiency (0.51 mJ per frame) with high accuracy and low memory storage, compared with the SOTA designs. The proposed accelerator can work with different VSLAM frontend for backend optimization of localization accuracy.</description></item><item><title>A Reference Oversampling PLL With a FoMREF of &#8722;240.1 dB Enabled By a Capacitive Parasitic-Proof Ring Oscillator and a Time-Multiplexed Gm Stage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11024020</link><description>This paper presents a compact ring-oscillator (RO)-based phase-locked loop (PLL) implemented upon the principle that reference oversampling essentially boosts the reference frequency and thus extends the achievable bandwidth to such an extent that an area-efficient RO can be used without significantly sacrificing the phase noise (PN) and jitter performance when compared to conventional LC-based PLLs.

However, this iterative approach is time- and energy-consuming which is not suitable for resource- and power-constrained edge-devices. In this paper, we propose PRADO, an energy-efficient 6DoF pose refinement accelerator for edge applications. Several domain-specific explorations aimed at reducing processing latency and energy-consumption while maintaining high accuracy have been proposed, including an adaptive sparse correspondences sampling (ASCS) architecture to reduce redundant correspondences process, a hybrid static &amp; dynamic pruning (HSDP) technique with co-designed hardware architecture to reduce computational complexity, and a cosine similarity-based adaptive early exit (CSAE2) technique to eliminate unnecessary iterations. Implemented and evaluated on the ZCU102 FPGA board, PRADO achieves the lowest processing latency of 61.2ms and energy consumption of 198.6mJ, and highest accuracy of 0.7112, outperforming state-of-the-art designs. Implemented with 28nm CMOS technology, PRADO achieves an even lower processing latency of 18.1ms and energy consumption of 12.6mJ.</description></item><item><title>An Ultrasound Transducer Analog Front-End With dB-Linear Time-Gain Compensation Using Translinear Loop Principle</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11077396</link><description>This article presents an ultrasound analog front-end (AFE) circuit featuring continuous time-gain compensation (TGC) based on a variable-gain current amplifier (VGCA).

It first reveals the mechanism by which the voltage-resistance characteristics of the pseudo-resistor used to improve the integration level influence the common-mode voltage, and emphasizes the necessity of stabilizing the input common-mode voltage with the continuous-time CSA in gyroscope systems. Based on this theory, a fully integrated CSA based on input common-mode feedback is proposed. The CSA achieves comprehensive optimization of noise and power consumption by reusing the input common-mode feedback circuit and differential-mode detection circuit. Furthermore, the CSA employs a novel differential pseudo-resistor structure, which reduces the noise, area, and power consumption of this part of the circuit by reusing the pseudo-resistor bias circuits.

The sensor utilizes a proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT) current source embedding an auto-zeroing amplifier to bias the BJT core while effectively reducing offset errors. Additionally, this work achieves the combination of the temperature-sensing BJT core and the  $\Sigma \Delta $  modulator, utilizing dynamic element matching (DEM) technique to accurately generate three different ratios (1:9, 9:1, 5:5) of BJT bias currents to cooperate with the modulator for modulation.

The small-signal characteristics and design criteria of the proposed technique are derived based on describing functions. The current-balancing accuracy of the proposed technique depends merely on the ratio between the sensing FETs and the corresponding power switches ( $\alpha $ ), while the requirement on absolute equivalent sensing-resistances ( $R_{\mathrm {i}}$ ) and the matching of sensing circuits among phases are relaxed. Meanwhile, both the proposed current-balancing behavior and the adjustment of phase number will not affect the stability and the transient behavior of the multi-phase system. Furthermore, as a crucial block of the COFT control scheme, the proposed self-tuning PLLs of clock synchronization loop can remain fixed bandwidth under different I/O voltages, which further enhance the system stability. Therefore, in principle, the phase-interleaving with fixed switching frequency can be realized without the limit of duty cycle. As a result, the proposed CB technique can alleviate the stringent matching requirement of layout in conventional multi-phase systems, as well as the loop compensation difficulty. It is verified by an integrated dual-phase regulator fabricated in a  $0.18\mu $ m BCD process. Experimental results show that the regulator can provide 0.9-1.8V output from a 2.3-5.5V input at both steady state and load-transient state with significantly higher performance by the proposed CB technique, ensuring current-imbalance ratio within &#177;1.3%.</description></item><item><title>A Two-Step Down Converter Based on Pseudo 4-Phase Mutual Operation for 48-to-1 Conversion</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11010105</link><description>This paper proposes a two-step down converter based on Pseudo 4-Phase Mutual Operation (P4MO) that uses inductors and coupled inductors to regulate output voltage ( ${\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm {OUT}}$ ).

However, its substantial computational complexity hinders practical applications. In this paper, we introduce an advanced hybrid OSD algorithm that fully utilizes the hard-decision algebraic decoding results to selectively activate soft-decision OSD operations, significantly mitigating computational complexity. Through a rigorous analysis of error-correction characteristics, we derive a theoretical condition under which the hybrid OSD algorithm guarantees superior error-correction performance over the baseline OSD.

Despite their exceptional performance, ViTs incur substantial computational overhead characterized by high memory footprint, long inference latency, and elevated energy consumption. Current acceleration strategies for ViTs primarily focus on pruning operations or leveraging the inherent sparsity, requiring complex address control logic or position encoding. Alternatively, some software-based approaches attempt to pre-compute and separate dense and sparse matrix position encoding, while hardware solutions typically spend additional time and resources to obtain position encoding, decomposing matrix multiplications into structured forms. Through an analysis of ViTs&#8217; parameters, we found that approximately 91.03% of the most significant bits (MSBs) are either 111s or 000s, and nearly 45% of 3 adjacent bits are identical. To leverage this characteristic of ViTs, we propose the Booth-Serial Skipping algorithm, which transforms the computation of consecutive 111 or 000 sequences into skip steps that require no additional computation time. Furthermore, the 4th to 6th bits of ViT weights can undergo aggressive scaling, enhancing the likelihood of Booth-skip operations with minimal impact on accuracy. The key innovation of this paper lies in exploiting the high proportion of naturally consecutive 0s or 1s in 8-bit weights during ViT inference and further expanding the skippable range through the Tunable Scaling strategy. At the hardware level, we develop a specialized accelerator to coordinate the proposed acceleration strategies. The processing element array in the accelerator is optimized for general matrix multiplication, it not only significantly improves the computation of multi-head self-attention but also enables resource reuse for linear transformations, ultimately optimizing end-to-end inference.

However, the channel expansion-reduction process in BB imposes substantial activation memory overhead, a challenge that has not been adequately addressed in prior studies on LWNN accelerators incorporating BB. To overcome this limitation, we propose a fully-pipelined bottleneck architecture (FPB) optimized for the efficient hardware deployment of BB. FPB eliminates the need for intermediate off-chip memory access, effectively addressing deployment challenges associated with BB and enabling an end-to-end accelerator architecture. To enhance hardware efficiency, each FPB core utilizes 2-LUT DSP, Fused-ReLU6, and Q-Residual, optimizing computational performance while minimizing resource consumption. Furthermore, we introduce a batching technique that maximizes the benefits of FPB by ensuring high hardware utilization across FPB cores while enabling the concurrent processing of multiple images.

The wide output swing and high gain requirement of the amplifier makes it infeasible to design an energy-efficient high-resolution EC IADC based on DA. Conventional gain-boosting methods, such as multi-stage and cascoding, suffer from the stability issue and limited output swing respectively. To solve this problem, a foreground gain calibration method is proposed for reducing the gain requirement by compensating the quantization error caused by the limited gain of DA. Additionally, a two-stage DA is proposed to achieve wide output swing and high energy-efficiency, which combines the floating-inverter-based amplifier (FIA) and the switched-inverter-based amplifier (SIA). SIA works as the 2nd stage, providing wide output swing while FIA as the 1st stage maintains the gain &gt;50 dB. A prototype of 1st-order EC IADC based on the proposed DA with gain calibration is fabricated in 180-nm CMOS technology. Operating under 1.8-V power supply, the EC IADC achieves a SNDR/DR of 94.6 dB/ 98.1 dB and  $20\mu $ W power consumption at 921 kHz of  ${f} _{\mathbf {s}}$ , leading to a Schreier figure-of-merit ( ${\mathrm {FOM}}_{\mathbf {SNDR}}$ ) of 174.1 dB.</description></item><item><title>A 0.88 e&#8254;rms 8-Mpixel 3D-Stacked Low Temporal-Noise CMOS Image Sensor With Auto-Zero Single-Slope ADC, Fast Correlated Multi-Sampling, Row-Wise Noise Reduction, and Dark Current Non-Uniformity Calibration Techniques</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11007582</link><description>This paper presents a low temporal noise, low-power, 8-Mpixel, rolling-shutter (RS)-type, back-illuminated CMOS image sensor (CIS) employing through silicon via (TSV) 3D-stack technology. To achieve temporal noise less than  $1~\mathrm {e}_{rms}^{-}$ , we explored auto-zero (AZ) column single-slope (SS) ADC and fast correlated multi-sampling (CMS) techniques. The pixel signal was sampled two times by the readout circuits using a 9-bits ADC, resulting in a 10-bits digital output. To enhance image quality in low light conditions, we adopted a parity column counter (PCC) for power supply stabilization and H-banding elimination, and employed row-wise noise reduction (RWNR) and dark-current non-uniformity calibration (DCNUC) techniques for reducing row-wise noise and improving image uniformity. Our CIS chip was fabricated using a 55nm 1P4M (pixel substrate) and a 55nm 1P5M (logic substrate) CIS 3D stacked process. The die area is  $\sim 3.99^{\ast } 3.45$  mm2 with 1.008- $\mu $ m pixel pitch and the total energy consumption is 170mW under a 2.8V analog-VDD and a 1.2V digital-VDD.

Here, we present the first circularity-driven fabrication flow for sustainable wireless circuits based on recyclable liquid metals and degradable dielectrics. The proposed recyclable radio frequency (RF) circuits consist of 3D-printed substrates with fluidic channels, e.g. using polylactic acid (PLA), filled with Galinstan interconnects. At their end-of-life, the ICs and liquid metal interconnects are recovered and re-used in functional circuits, over multiple iterations. The printed dielectrics are degraded, with under 2% by weight waste produced. Various RF circuits are demonstrated, up to 4 GHz, including transmission lines based on Coplanar Waveguides (CPWs), with high-performance DC/RF control and filtering, and broadband high-efficiency radiation in a CPW antenna. Active microwave systems are then demonstrated including a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), and a multi-layered design for a broadband power amplifier (PA). The circuits maintain a stable performance across over 9 metal and 3 IC re-use cycles. The reliability of the circuits is verified by continuously operating months-old circuits for over 30 hours as well as under-water storage, demonstrating their reliability. Our results pave the way for multi-function, green wireless circuits, reducing waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) and allowing component circularity.</description></item><item><title>DrlGoFPGA: FPGA Global Placement Considering Input-Output Buffer Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning and Gradient Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11015632</link><description>The placement of the input-output buffer (IOBUF) can impact the performance and power consumption of the FPGA. The existing global placement (GP) methods lack consideration for IOBUF, resulting in a decrease in placement and routing quality. To address this issue, we propose a GP framework, DrlGoFPGA, which combines IOBUF placement based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with other instances placement based on gradient optimization (GO). A policy network structure with multi-action sampling is designed to accelerate the running speed of DRL, and a parallelizable reward function is designed to optimize each IOBUF placement action and avoid sparse reward problems. Then, an IOBUF line-network relationship (ILNR) graph creation method is designed to improve the agent&#8217;s ability to explore optimal solutions, and the graph features of ILNR by capturing them through a graph neural network embedded in the convolutional neural network. Finally, an IOBUF placement legalization method is designed to ensure that the IOBUF position meets the FPGA architecture. The experimental results show that compared with the state-of-the-art placement tools based on GO, DrlGoFPGA can improve GP speed by 13.2%- $7\times $ , half-perimeter wirelength by 0.2%-2.6%, and wirelength by 0.2%-1.5% and the IOBUF placement model has good generalization.</description></item><item><title>TWINN: Training-Free Weight-Input Flipping for Mitigating Crossbar Non-Idealities in Binary Neural Network Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11008637</link><description>Compute-in-memory (CiM)-based binary neural network (CiM-BNN) accelerators marry the benefits of CiM and ultra-low precision quantization, making them highly suitable for edge computing. However, CiM-enabled crossbar (Xbar) arrays are plagued with hardware non-idealities like parasitic resistances and device non-linearities that impair inference accuracy, especially in scaled technologies. In this work, we first analyze the impact of Xbar non-idealities on the inference accuracy of various CiM-BNNs, establishing that the unique properties of CiM-BNNs make them more prone to hardware non-idealities compared to higher precision deep neural networks (DNNs). To address this issue, we propose TWINN, a training-free technique that mitigates non-idealities in CiM-BNNs. TWINN utilizes the distinct attributes of BNNs to reduce the average current generated during the CiM operations in Xbar arrays. This is achieved by statically and dynamically flipping the BNN weights and activations, respectively. This minimizes the IR drops across the parasitic resistances, drastically mitigating their impact on inference accuracy. To evaluate our technique, we conduct experiments on ResNet-18 and VGG-small CiM-BNNs designed at the 7nm technology node using 8T-SRAM and 1T-1ReRAM. Our results show that TWINN is highly effective in alleviating the impact of non-idealities, recouping the inference accuracy to near-ideal (software) levels in some cases and providing accuracy boost of up to 77.25%. These benefits are accompanied by energy reduction, albeit at the cost of mild latency/area increase.</description></item><item><title>Small-Signal Stability Region Analysis of Multi-Time Delay Wind Power System Considering Degenerate Hopf Bifurcation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11007544</link><description>From the perspective of nonlinear dynamics and bifurcation theory, this paper analyzes the impact of time delay on small-signal stability region of doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) grid-connected power system. Firstly, the differential-algebraic equation model of the system is established. It is theoretically demonstrated that time delay will affect the bifurcation behavior of the system, especially the degenerate Hopf bifurcation (DHB) under a specific time delay. Then, the time delay, the injected DFIG mechanical power, and the load reactive power are chosen as the bifurcation variables. The bifurcation diagram is obtained through bifurcation analysis, which can determine the multi-parameter small-signal stability boundary of the system. Finally, the impact of single and multiple time delays on the stability region is analyzed through the stability boundary. It is found that the DHB due to the time delay variation induces a hole effect in the system stability region. Moreover, increasing the time delay may also improve the system stability margin. The findings of this study have significant guiding implications for multi-time delay system parameter adjustment.</description></item><item><title>Generalized Multilevel Code-Shifted Differential Chaos Shift Keying Modulation System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11016925</link><description>To achieve a high data rate while maintaining a low peak to average power ratio (PAPR), a novel generalized multi-level code-shifted differential chaos shift keying modulation system is proposed. In this system, both the reference and multiple data-bearing signals transmit data bits through code index modulations performed on the same set of Walsh codes, leading to enhanced utilization of indices and increased data rate. In addition, each data-bearing signal transmits one extra bit using differential chaos shift keying modulation. To mitigate high PAPR, discrete cosine spreading codes are employed to distinguish between the reference and data-carrying signals. Two receiver configurations are designed to balance low complexity and improved bit error rate performance. Bit error rate performances are analyzed and simulated under the additive white Gaussian noise and multipath Rayleigh fading channels. Finally, comparisons are made between the proposed and other CS-DCSK-based systems, which illustrates that our system can offer an increased data rate and superior bit error rate performance, along with a reduced PAPR.</description></item><item><title>A 3.4-GS/s 12-Bit Time-Interleaved Pipelined SAR ADC With Non-Foster Ring Amplifier-Based High-Linearity Track-and-Hold Amplifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11111691</link><description>This brief presents a 3.4-GS/s 12-bit time-interleaved pipelined SAR ADC fabricated in 28-nm CMOS, incorporating a high-linearity track-and-hold amplifier (THA) based on the proposed non-Foster ring amplifier (NFRA).

The gated-ring oscillator (GRO) TDC is usually used in the pixel, but it suffers from timing error in the stabilization time and high power consumption. A three-segment TDC with a half-cycle single-stage Vernier ring is presented in this brief. The ring delay line has no stabilization time. The time resolution of Vernier-ring TDC is not directly related to the oscillation frequency, thus enabling lower power consumption. There is only one stage delay unit in this ring delay line, and its compact area makes it suitable for pixels. A half-cycle Vernier judgment circuit is proposed, which shortens the operating time of the Vernier TDC and reduces its power consumption. An  $8\times 8$  SPAD readout integrated circuit (ROIC) was fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS technology. The test results show that the power consumption of the TDC is less than  $20~\mu $ W at a time resolution of 40 ps, a range of  $1~\mu $ s, and a frame rate of 10 kHz.</description></item><item><title>A Wideband Frequency-Independent IQ Calibration Scheme With 3-GHz-UGB Amplifiers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11082372</link><description>This brief presents a wideband in-phase and quadrature-phase (IQ) calibration scheme, which can be embedded into variable gain amplifiers (VGA) or active filter in receivers (RXs).

To address this challenge, this work proposes a timestep-parallel 4D neuromorphic computing array of size  $N_{T}\times N_{Z}\times N_{X}\times N_{Y}$ , simultaneously enabling parallel computing in temporal and spatial dimensions. The  $N_{T}$  dimension supports timestep-parallel computing, the  $N_{Z}$  dimension supports neuron-parallel computing, and the  $N_{X}$  and  $N_{Y}$  dimensions are used for synapse-parallel computing. The architecture facilitates flexible data reuse across different dimensions (with weights reuse along different timesteps and spikes reuse along different neurons), significantly reducing storage access. Meanwhile, it treats the membrane potential as a short-term computational variable that can be stored in a small buffer, thereby eliminating large-scale membrane potential storage overhead and access. The reduction in data access and storage costs is beneficial for lowering system power consumption and enhancing synaptic energy efficiency. Ultimately, the architecture is evaluated using a 28 nm process library and demonstrates a high computing power density of 1160 GSOP/s/mm2 and a high synaptic energy efficiency of 0.36 pJ/SOP, surpassing related state-of-the-art works.

However, the transient response of the traditional digital low-dropout regulators (DLDOs) is limited by the closed-loop response, which makes it difficult to meet the speed requirements of the PWM power output. This brief presents a State-Switching DLDO (SS-DLDO), specially optimized for PWM thermo-optic tuning. Two state selectors, controlled by a PWM signal, are inserted into the SS-DLDO structure to control the connections and operational states of the DLDO asynchronously.

The traditional single variable regulation techniques are effective for OBO range extension only at single frequency points. First, one phase dispersion (PD factor) is introduced to characterize the OBO range versus frequency. Second, multiparameters optimization of PD factor, complex combining load (CCL), and out-phased current combining (OCC) is used to alleviate the conflict of bandwidth and OBO range. Dynamically optimizing frequency-dependent CCL and OCC parameters to counteract the dispersion effect of the matching network thus enable the wideband OBO extension and expanding design flexibility of symmetric DPA. For demonstration, a symmetric DPA with 9-dB OBO range is proposed with a fractional operation bandwidth of 36% within 1.8&#8211;2.6 GHz.

To reduce on-chip buffers for large-size output feature maps, a streaming VSR accelerator may employ an output stationary dataflow, leading to a large energy consumption caused by frequent filter switching. To mitigate this, we introduce a new filter-dedicated multiplier design for real-time VSR acceleration. We replace costly multipliers with adders, shifters, and multiplexers (MUXes), referred to as unified multiple constant multiplications (UMCM). The conventional UMCM, however, may incur considerable area/power overhead due to the unified topology constraint among different filter sets. To address this problem, we propose a new approximated MCM (AMCM) problem to relax the constraint and an approximate compatible graph synthesis (A-CGS) framework to efficiently solve AMCM by jointly searching for approximated filters and constructing a unified graph. Additionally, we suggest a lightweight fine-tuning method by freezing approximated filters and only fine-tuning biases, which can recover the original model&#8217;s accuracy within a few epochs. Experimental results with synthetic data demonstrate that AMCM reduces the area by up to 49.8%, 44.8%, and 40.3% when considering constant sets of 2, 4, and 8, respectively. Our designs with SR application achieve up to a 73.3% reduction in energy consumption. Experiments with the Set5 and Set14 datasets show that our model with bias correction achieves similar restoration performance compared to the eight-bit models.</description></item><item><title>Personalized Federated Learning With State-Adaptive IoT Device Scheduling in Mobile-Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10963894</link><description>Federated learning (FL) is envisioned as a pioneering framework for the distributed training of artificial intelligence models in mobile-edge computing (MEC) environments. Traditional MEC-empowered FL approaches commonly neglect the inherent competition for computation resources between uncertain user-own tasks and FL training activities on individual Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Meanwhile, these approaches fail to address the personalized reward perception that dominates the active participation of IoT devices in FL training. As a result, both the resource utilization on IoT devices and the overall performance of FL models are significantly degraded in practical MEC systems. To address these challenges, this article investigates the personalized FL with state-adaptive IoT device scheduling in MEC scenarios. We first develop a collaborative device-state estimation method to effectively capture the uncertainty in future states of FL candidates. Subsequently, we design a user-personality inspired degree-of-satisfaction (DoS) prediction scheme to quantify the impact of computation resource competition on the satisfaction levels of personalized FL participants. Building on these efforts, we propose a state-adaptive IoT device scheduling technique to optimize the accuracy of FL models at the offline stage. An FL runtime management policy is also designed to deal with the timing failures of unsuccessful return of local training results at the online stage. Evaluations show that our approach enhances the accuracy of WideResNet FL model by up to 35.96% on CIFAR-10 and EuroSAT datasets.

However, ViT&#8217;s increasing parameters and computation overhead limit its deployment on hardware. Previous ViT accelerators focus on optimizing the core attention mechanism of ViTs due to the high overheads of language transformer-based neural networks. Nevertheless, linear layers are the actual bottleneck of ViT inference, accounting for larger than 90% FLOPs on numerous ViTs because of the short and fixed token length of ViTs. To this end, we propose P $\text {F}^{2}$ A-ViT, an algorithm and accelerator co-design framework, comprehensively accelerating both core attention and linear layers. At the algorithm level, a parameter-free and feature-aware dynamic token pruning (PF2ATP) strategy is proposed to reduce the dimension of feature maps and dynamically adjust the pruning ratio according to the complexity of the feature without complex execution of subnetworks. Meanwhile, a mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) strategy combines Hessian trace and parameter-aware signal-to-quantization-noise ratio to boost the deployment efficiency of PF2ATP. In addition, a cluster-regroup-based weight encoding strategy is proposed to compensate for the bit-wise redundant information of the quantization strategy. At the hardware level, a token pruning module based on bitonic sorters is designed to fully leverage PF2ATP. Simultaneously, a 3-D PE array with reconfigurable 4/8-bit processing elements (PEs) is designed to implement the MPQ strategy and equipped with greedy bit-wise compensation decoders to exploit the encoding strategy. Extensive experiments on multiple ViTs demonstrate the achievements of P $\text {F}^{2}$ A-ViT: 1) maximally realize  $3.89\times $  speedup,  $5.54\times $  energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art ViT accelerators and 2) occupying a 2.25-mm2 area and consuming 76-mW power in 28-nm technology.</description></item><item><title>A RISC-V Extended Infrastructure for CNNs Through Pipelined Computing and Data Dependence Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10980005</link><description>With the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely applied in fields like computer vision and recommendation systems. This growth has intensified the demand for hardware acceleration of CNNs. Existing accelerators are either designed as co-processors or improve performance through extended instructions. While these methods can significantly improve performance, they often result in limited programming and execution flexibility. In this article, we design custom RISC-V instructions specifically for CNNs to maximize data reuse and exploit parallelism. Then, to efficiently execute CNNs instructions, we extend a pipelined vector computing unit (PPVCU). Finally, we incorporate pattern detection logic (PDL) to identify common data dependence patterns in CNNs, enabling the data dependence computing unit (DDCU) to process instructions within each pattern in parallel. Experimental results show that our approach achieves, on average,  $9.54\times $  performance improvement and  $6.7\times $  energy efficiency improvement compared to our baseline,  $8.34\times $  performance improvement, and  $3.1\times $  energy efficiency improvement compared to state-of-the-art designs.</description></item><item><title>LPCR: Information-Theory-Based Low-Power Code Reordering for Serial Links in Network-on-Chip</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10963908</link><description>Manycore platforms have emerged as a promising candidate to meet the increasing computation demand in high-performance computing (HPC). Networks-on-chip (NoC) have proposed appropriate on-chip communication solutions for manycore platforms. However, the increase in the number of cores and the size of cache in a single chip raises the power dissipation of NoC, potentially impacting data communication performance. The primary source of power dissipation in NoC is the switching activity of data bits transmitted through data links. In this study, we introduce an analytical method, based on information theory, to assess data representation or coding methods from the perspectives of the switching activity of data bits and the length of codewords used for data symbols. Subsequently, we propose a lightweight yet efficient low-power code reordering (LPCR) technique, that can be integrated into existing coding methods to decrease power consumption. The comprehensive evaluations presented in this article demonstrate that our LPCR method, reduces link power consumption through reducing the switching activity of data bits up to 13.2%, on average 8.8%, while increases the number of data bits by less than 4.9%, this decreases link energy consumption by 9.9% when applied to the coding methods which aim to minimize the number of data bits (e.g., Huffman coding). However, LPCR does not change the number of data bits when implemented on the Binary coding and, decreases the number of bits up to 12% when implemented on the most frequent least power (MFLP) method. LPCR imposes very low time and memory overhead at runtime. It needs a data array ranging from 256 B for Binary to 32 KB for MFLP methods and executes one extra command to read codewords from the array.</description></item><item><title>GRIPT: Graph Attention-Assisted Inductive Methodology for Fast and Accurate Average Power Estimation From RTL Simulation Skipping Gate-Level Simulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10973294</link><description>This article proposes GRIPT, a novel graph attention-based inductive methodology that enables a fast and accurate average power estimation of synthesized ASIC design from RTL simulation, bypassing gate-level simulation. The proposed GRIPT methodology with features-aided attention mechanism-based inductive graph neural network (GNN) model propagates the input wires&#8217; toggle rates acquired from the RTL SAIF file through the circuit. We examine the proposed GRIPT methodology&#8217;s versatility by testing circuits across technology nodes and foundries like TSMC 65 nm, 40 nm, 90 nm, and 130 nm, and GF 40 nm while training exclusively on the TSMC 65-nm technology node. We introduce unseen and untrained logic cells to test the transferability of the proposed GRIPT model in toggle rate prediction across technology nodes. We evaluate the scalability of the proposed GRIPT by testing circuits of considerable size, like circuit trigonometry from OpenCores, and circuits arbiter, multiplier, div, log2, sin, square, and sqrt from the EPFL benchmark suite, without training them. The proposed GRIPT surpasses the state-of-the-art GRANNITE model in predicting the unseen and untrained logic cell&#8217;s toggle rates to justify the proposed GRIPT&#8217;s transferability for designs across technology nodes to achieve an average improvement of 6.74%, 5.53%, 8.93%, 6.88%, and 7.22%, respectively. To demonstrate versatility and scalability, the proposed GRIPT methodology outperforms the commercial RTL power estimation tool and GRANNITE in estimating the average power of circuits spanning TSMC 65, 40, 90, and 130 nm, and GF 40-nm technology nodes, with a mean improvement of 23.42%, 16.59%, 16.35%, 27.16%, and 28.87%; 2.01%, 0.97%, 0.98%, 1.6%, and 2.72%, respectively. The proposed GRIPT is  $12.57\times $  and  $1.1\times $  faster, with an average inference throughput (number of cycles inferred per second) of 1384.6 Hz compared to the commercial gate-level power estimation tool and GRANNITE, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Heterogeneous CNN Compilation Framework for RISC-V CPU and NPU Integration Based on ONNX-MLIR</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10977050</link><description>With the continuous advancement of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), many neural network processing units (NPUs) have emerged in recent years. NPUs offer advantages, such as improved energy efficiency and low latency compared to traditional processors. However, NPUs often struggle to keep pace with the growing complexity of algorithmic models, which limits the implementation of certain AI applications. Central processing units (CPUs) are known for their versatility, but are computationally inefficient. Combining the strengths of both architectures could present a viable solution to these challenges. Despite this potential, there is currently insufficient academic focus on CPU/NPU co-computing, and few architectures or toolchains have been developed to support such integration. In this article, we propose a RISC-V CPU/NPU co-computing-based compilation framework to solve the problem of mapping from algorithms to heterogeneous architectures. To bridge the computational gap between heterogeneous platforms, within ONNX-MLIR, we developed three phases to support operator packing, algorithm adaption, and data coordination. To integrate heterogeneous compilation platforms, we introduce four additional functions to handle task scheduling, weight quantization, weight rearrangement, and memory management. In particular: 1) to optimize the transition overhead, an operator packing technique is introduced by extending the ONNX-MLIR framework with custom operators, which enhances NPU efficiency by reducing the number of transitions between operations; 2) at the aspect of task scheduling, a three-mode task scheduler is developed to allow users to customize task distribution for correctness verification, performance optimization, or detailed analysis on heterogeneous platforms, which demonstrates the versatility of our framework; and 3) In terms of memory management, an optimized scheme for CPU/NPU architectures is proposed to ensure accurate data access. This memory management employs a dual-end approach with self-checks and a release-after-use mechanism to further improve efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework effectively generates instructions for various CNNs, significantly enhancing the efficiency and performance of heterogeneous architectures. It achieves up to a  $7.06\times $  reduction in code density and up to a  $5.58\times $  improvement in memory usage, narrowing the computational gap between CPUs and NPUs.</description></item><item><title>Flex-SFU: Activation Function Acceleration With Nonuniform Piecewise Approximation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10949646</link><description>Modern deep neural networks (DNN) increasingly use activation functions with computationally complex operations. This creates a challenge for current hardware accelerators, which are primarily optimized for convolutions and matrix-matrix multiplications. This work introduces Flex-SFU, a lightweight hardware accelerator for activation functions that uses nonuniform piecewise interpolation and supports multiple data formats, including both linear and quadratic function segments. We optimize the parameters of these function approximations offline to provide drop-in replacements for existing activation functions. Flex-SFU incorporates an address decoding unit based on a hardware binary-tree search, enabling nonuniform interpolation and floating-point support. This approach achieves, on average, a  $22.3\times $  improvement in mean squared error compared to previous piecewise linear interpolation methods. Our evaluations, conducted on more than 600 state-of-the-art neural networks and 100 vision transformers, demonstrate that Flex-SFU can, on average, enhance the end-to-end performance of AI hardware accelerators by 35.7%, achieving up to a  $3.3\times $  speedup with negligible impact on model accuracy. This improvement comes with an area and power overhead of only 5.9% and 0.8%, respectively, relative to the baseline vector processing unit. Additionally, we demonstrate that Flex-SFU can accelerate training by up to 15.8% through the interpolation of derivatives for common activation functions during backpropagation, achieving this improvement without impacting either convergence speed or final accuracy.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Bit-Sparse DNN Accelerator Exploiting Adaptive Bit-Serial Computations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964211</link><description>Bit sparsity, an intrinsic attribute of binary representation, has been widely utilized in deep neural network (DNN) inference acceleration. Despite the advantages in performance and energy efficiency demonstrated by existing bit-serial-based bit-sparse accelerators, they still face two notable limitations: 1) at the low-level bit-serial multiplier level, existing methods either statically select weight or activation as the serialized object during the design phase, or simply serialize both without considering the distribution of nonzero bits in different operands, thereby failing to achieve optimal performance and 2) at the high-level dataflow level, existing approaches do not eliminate zero values in data movement and computation, leading to considerable energy and latency overhead, as well as suboptimal PE utilization. In this work, we propose AdaS-Pro accelerator for fast and energy-efficient DNN inference. At the multiplier level, AdaS-Pro employs an adaptive bit-serial computation scheme, which dynamically serializes the input operand with fewer nonzero bits at runtime, thereby minimizing compute cycles. To further enhance performance, AdaS-Pro introduces an improved Booth encoding method to reduce the number of nonzero bits in each operand. At the dataflow level, AdaS-Pro employs a compressed format to eliminate zero values and proposes a bi-directional inner-join unit coupled with a ring-shaped scheduler to achieve efficient nonzero workload extraction and balancing. Experimental results show that AdaS-Pro outperforms existing state-of-the-art bit-sparse accelerators, such as BitLet, BitX, and Laconic, with performance improvements of  $4.03\times $ ,  $6.78\times $ , and  $1.43\times $ , respectively.</description></item><item><title>Gemini+: Enhancing Real-Time Video Analytics With Dual-Image FPGAs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10950385</link><description>Real-time video analytics demand intensive computing resources, often exceeding device capabilities. Heterogeneous computing resources like CPU and GPU, usually work collaboratively to ensure real-time performance. GPU manages data-intensive computing, while CPU handles instruction-intensive tasks. However, analytics accuracy can degrade because of the imbalance between CPU-GPU workloads and resources, and static resources in most systems limit adaptability to dynamic workloads. In addition to CPU-GPU resource control, accuracy is highly dependent on video analytics configuration, including resolution, frame rate, and model selection. In this article, we propose Gemini+, a hardware-accelerated video analytics pipeline empowered by dual-image FPGAs. It enables flexible CPU-GPU resource adaptation by providing near-instantaneous switching between two preconfigured images. We investigate CPU-GPU resource control and video analytics configuration adaptation in a dual-image FPGA-based video analytics pipeline. We study and formulate two problems of practical importance, a single-camera and multicamera dual computing resource control problem, i.e., SC-DCRC and MC-DCRC. We analyze the problem complexity and develop optimal and suboptimal algorithms. We evaluate our algorithms through simulation and build a prototype for verification. The results show that Gemini+ can improve analytic accuracy by 25% compared to fixed CPU-GPU resource systems and 88% compared to GPU-dominant systems.</description></item><item><title>MemMIMO: A Simulation Framework for Memristor-Based Massive MIMO Acceleration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10979919</link><description>Memristor-based crossbar architectures have proven highly effective for matrix vector multiplication (MVM) operations, making them a promising solution for accelerating the MVMs widely used in precoding algorithms for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems. However, real-world implementation of memristor-based computing systems face challenges due to common nonidealities in both the devices and the peripheral circuits. To facilitate a rapid design flow and investigate the impact of nonidealities, an integrated open-source simulation framework MemMIMO is developed. The simulation framework estimates the accuracy and hardware performance of the computing system, offering a variety of flexible design options. MemMIMO integrates a behavioral model of the mix-signal architecture with a digital front-end. There are three major building blocks in MemMIMO: 1) the device fitting block; 2) the mapping block; and 3) the performance estimation block. These blocks work together to map the complex MVMs in precoding algorithms for MIMO systems to crossbar-based architectures that incorporate memristor models characterized by physical device behavior. Using two typical use cases targeting six-generation (6G) massive MIMO communication as case studies, MemMIMO is used to model different memristor devices, explore the impact of nonidealities on system accuracy, and benchmark circuit-level performance metrics, including area, speed, and power.</description></item><item><title>Shared-PIM: Enabling Concurrent Computation and Data Flow for Faster Processing-in-DRAM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10979967</link><description>Processing-in-memory (PIM) enhances memory with computational capabilities, potentially solving energy and latency issues associated with data transfer between memory and processors. However, managing concurrent computation and data flow within the PIM architecture incurs significant latency and energy penalty for applications. This article introduces Shared-PIM, an architecture for in-dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) PIM that strategically allocates rows in memory banks, bolstered by memory peripherals, for concurrent processing and data movement. Shared-PIM enables simultaneous computation and data transfer within a memory bank. When compared to LISA, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) architecture that facilitates data transfers for in-DRAM PIM, Shared-PIM reduces data movement latency and energy by  $5\times $  and  $1.2\times $ , respectively. Furthermore, when integrated to a SOTA in-DRAM PIM architecture (pLUTo), Shared-PIM achieves  $1.4\times $  faster addition and multiplication, and thereby improves the performance of matrix multiplication (MM) tasks by 40%, polynomial multiplication (PMM) by 44%, and numeric number transfer (NTT) tasks by 31%. Moreover, for graph processing tasks like breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS), Shared-PIM achieves a 29% improvement in speed, all with an area overhead of just 7.16% compared to the baseline pLUTo.</description></item><item><title>Reinforcement-Learning-Based Test Point Insertion for Power-Safe Testing in Monolithic 3-D ICs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10972002</link><description>Monolithic 3-D (M3D) integration for integrated circuits (ICs) offers the promise of higher performance and lower power consumption over stacked-3D ICs. However, M3D suffers from large power supply noise (PSN) in the power distribution network due to high current demand and long conduction paths from voltage sources to local receivers. Excessive switching activities during the capture cycles in at-speed delay testing exacerbate the PSN-induced voltage droop problem. Therefore, PSN reduction is necessary for M3D ICs during testing to prevent the failure of good chips on the tester (i.e., yield loss). In this article, we first develop an analysis flow for M3D designs to compute the PSN-induced voltage droop. Based on the analysis results, we extract the test patterns that are likely to cause yield loss. Next, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework to insert test points and generate low-switching patterns that help in mitigating PSN without degrading the test coverage. Simulation results for benchmark M3D designs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed power-safe testing approach, compared to baseline cases that utilize commercial tools.</description></item></channel></rss>
