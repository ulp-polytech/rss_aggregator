However, the loss of eddy current is still a primary concern in nanocrystalline material. This letter investigates two crushing patterns, namely, square-crushing and dot-crushing, for a nanocrystalline flake ribbon (NFR) to mitigate the eddy current loss in IPT applications. In the experiment, a 1-kW IPT prototype with a curved coupler for autonomous underwater vehicles is built to verify the loss performance. As a result, the coil with NFRs in the square-crushing pattern (S-pattern) has a higher quality factor than those with the NFRs in the dot-crushing pattern (D-pattern). Furthermore, the IPT system with the S-pattern NFR exhibits an ac&#8211;ac transmission efficiency of 93.51%, possessing 0.89% higher than that of the D-pattern NFR case. The utilization of the S-pattern NFR offers multiple benefits, including minimizing core loss and facilitating the advancement of IPT systems with increased power density and enhanced installation flexibility.</description></item><item><title>Transient Stability Analysis of Microgrid Considering Impact of Grid-Following Converter's Current Controller</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10517466</link><description>The dynamics of current controller is usually neglected for simplification when assessing microgrid transient stability. Utilizing the Takagi&#8211;Sugeno method, this letter thoroughly examines the effects of current controller on transient stability estimations and reveals that completely ignoring the dynamics of current controller can cause overestimation on transient stability. The findings highlight a significant overestimation on lower boundary of angle about 29.2% even if current controller performs fast dynamics with bandwidth more than 28 times the fundamental frequency. Recognizing the impracticality of including current controller dynamics in microgrids with multiple converters, this letter proposes a stability-enhanced method through phase compensation in the current controller, which can improve the accuracy of transient stability assessments while still omitting current controller dynamics. In addition, a guideline for parameter design of phase compensation is provided. Theoretical findings are verified by hardware-in-loop experimental results based on OPAL-RT platform.</description></item><item><title>A Constant Current Output Method for Low-Voltage and High-Current DWPT Systems Based on Inverse Coupled Current Doubler Rectifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10526443</link><description>Dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) technique has promising potential in charging automatic guided vehicles (AGVs) used in intelligent warehousing. To ensure charging safety and reduce charging time, constant and high-current output is necessary for the batteries of the in-motion AGVs. However, it is a challenge to achieve the desired constant and high-current output with frequent power pulsation phenomenon and high equivalent series resistances (ESRs) loss. To address these issues, a dual-receiver DWPT system with the inverse coupled current doubler rectifier (ICCDR) is proposed in this work. Based on the dual-receiver, the AGVs can be charged by two power transfer channels, and the ESRs loss can be reduced. Meanwhile, the ICCDR can automatically switch between full-bridge and current doubler modes according to the mutual inductance variations in the adjacent area. Therefore, constant and high-current output can be achieved without additional control strategies. An experimental prototype with 48 A&#8211;24 V output is constructed. Experimental results show that the output current pulsation is limited within &#177;5%, and the efficiency remains above 85% during motion.</description></item><item><title>Minimizing Output Capacitance Loss in GaN Power HEMT</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10528889</link><description>Output capacitance (COSS) loss (EDISS) is produced when the COSS of a power device undergoes a cycle of charging and discharging, which ideally should be a lossless process. This nonideal phenomenon has been recently revealed to be a critical loss for wide-bandgap devices in high-frequency, soft-switching applications. Despite many studies on its characterizations and physical origins, the reduction of EDISS, particularly through an approach applicable to circuit application instead of relying on physical device design, has seldom been reported. In this article, we found that the EDISS of GaN-on-Si high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) can be significantly reduced by tuning the bias of Si substrate (VSub) in dynamic switching. By connecting the substrate to the source or drain via the selected capacitance, VSub can be modulated to dynamically follow either the drain-to-source bias (VDS) or a particular portion of VDS in switching. Characterizations of a 650 V GaN HEMT with different substrate connections reveal that its EDISS maximizes at VSub = VDS and minimizes at VSub = 0.5VDS. Compared to the conventional substrate-to-source shorted connection, the EDISS at VSub = 0.5VDS is reduced by up to 86%, and the ratio between EDISS and the stored energy in COSS can be reduced from 14.6% to 2.2%. These results unveil a new, easy-to-implement approach to minimize the inherent COSS loss of GaN HEMTs in practical applications.</description></item><item><title>Analysis of Oscillation Between Transformer Leakage Inductance and Schottky Diode Capacitance in DC&#8211;DC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10530396</link><description>This letter presents an analysis of the transient voltage ringing across the Schottky diodes of the output stage of isolated dc&#8211;dc converters due to the interaction between the leakage inductance of the high-frequency transformer and the nonlinear and voltage-dependent capacitance of the diodes. The study addresses only the converters with output LC filters, such as the phase-shifted ZVS-PWM converter, excluding LLC and series resonant converter (SRC) resonant converters with capacitive filters. An explicit solution for the pair of nonlinear differential equations describing the equivalent circuit behavior is presented, enabling determination of both voltage overshoot across the diodes and the resonant frequency of the oscillation. The theoretical analysis findings were validated through laboratory experiments.</description></item><item><title>A Low Distortion Collaborative Modulation for Zero-Crossing Distortion Pseudo DC Link Single-Stage Isolated Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10533856</link><description>Zero-crossing distortion (ZCD) is an inherent defect that exists in pseudo dc link single-stage isolated inverters (PDL-SII) based on unidirectional dc&#8211;dc converter, leading to reduced output current quality. Despite its significance, the topic has received limited attention in the literature. The ZCD mechanism of PDL-SII is quantitatively analyzed in this letter. In addition, a novel low distortion collaborative modulation is proposed to suppress the PDL-SII ZCD issue by operating the rear-stage unfolder in high frequency during zero-crossing and thus enabling a conduction path for the reverse current. Both simulation and experimental results fully confirm the theoretical analysis.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Design of Multiple Regulatable Output Rectifier-Integrated Buck Converter for Wireless Power Transfer Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10533868</link><description>In recent years, the application of wireless power transfer (WPT) has drawn vast attention with the advantage of canceling electrical wires. Some electronic devices require various voltage levels for driving and control systems concurrently. Therefore, in this letter, a new multiple regulatable output rectifier is proposed for the WPT application to meet the charging demands. The proposed rectifier integrates the buck converters, and then, 4+n semiconductor devices and n inductors are utilized to achieve 1+n output channels, which share a common ground. Besides, the inductor current ripples of the proposed rectifier are lower compared to those of the traditional buck converters. A 300-W prototype with 48, 18, and 12 V output voltages is built. The experimental results verify that the outputs are independently regulatable, and the overall efficiency is higher than 90.08%.</description></item><item><title>Current-Cancellation-Based Heterogeneous Integration of LLC-DCX With Ultralow-Voltage High-Current Output for Data Centers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10535166</link><description>The efficiency and power density of ultralow-voltage (&lt;1 V) high-current output dc transformers (DCXs) are limited by the losses and footprint area of the high-current windings. High-frequency current cancellation and power switches and high-current winding heterogeneous integration methods are proposed to reduce the length, area, and losses of high-current windings. With the proposed current-cancellation-based heterogeneous integration method, most of the high-current printed circuit board (PCB) windings of the transformer are replaced by power switches and capacitors, and almost zero PCB winding is achieved for the high-current secondary windings of the DCX. As a result, both power density and efficiency are improved significantly. A 36-V-to-0.75-V/150-A output DCX with a 48:1 turns-ratio transformer is designed and implemented with the four-layer PCB. A peak efficiency of 94.1% is achieved, while the power density of the high-frequency transformer in the DCX is 0.66 A/mm2.</description></item><item><title>Passivity-Based Nonsingular Terminal Sliding-Mode Control for LC-Filtered Current Source Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10510503</link><description>It is a big challenge for current source converter (CSC) to ensure the desired tracking performance, robustness, and immunity simultaneously in the presence of resonance caused by the grid-side LC filter and slowly time-varying filter parameters or load disturbances. Aiming at this problem, combining the advantages of passivity-based control (PBC) and nonsingular terminal sliding mode control (NTSMC), a hybrid PBC-NTSMC method is proposed. Based on virtual damping injection and energy dissipation theory, the PBC is first designed for the inner loop followed by the construction of the Euler&#8211;Lagrange model. In this way, the resonance suppression is realized and the CSC system is proved to be passive. Furthermore, the NTSMC is combined with PBC to improve the dynamic response, reduce the chattering problem of traditional sliding mode control, and enhance the robustness of the system while maintaining passivity. In addition, the power references are modified to enable system to flexibly configure the control target depending on actual application requirements under nonideal grid. To further enhance the immunity, an ultralocal model predictive controller based on extended state observer disturbance estimation is designed for the outer loop. Finally, the simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Synchronous Rectifier On-Time Control Within Dead-Time for Improving Light-Load Performance of LLC Resonant Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10517457</link><description>LLC resonant converter exhibits nonmonotonic voltage gain at light-load, which could lead to the malfunction of traditional pulse frequency modulation strategy and degraded efficiency due to excessive increase in switching frequency. To address this issue, an adaptive synchronous rectifier (SR) on-time control within dead-time is proposed for LLC resonant converters to normalize the voltage gain and enhance the light-load efficiency. First, the root cause of nonmonotonic voltage gain is analyzed and revealed as the energy accumulated in resonant inductor due to mismatched output capacitor discharge between primary and secondary side switches within dead-time. To suppress the energy accumulation, an adaptive SR on-time control within dead-time is developed to synchronize the output capacitor discharge processes of primary and secondary side switches, which is characterized as: 1) SR is turned on within dead-time to accelerate its output capacitor discharge; 2) the turn-on rate of SR is controlled by designing its gate resistor to match the output capacitor discharge rate of primary side switches; 3) the turn-on instant of SR is adaptively tuned according to the switching frequency. With the proposed SR control, the energy accumulation of resonant inductor during output capacitor discharge of switches is fully suppressed, resulting in a monotonic voltage gain at light-load, which facilitates voltage regulation and improves light-load efficiency. A 360&#8211;440-V input, 50-V/1-kW output LLC prototype is built to verify the effectiveness of proposed SR control.</description></item><item><title>iTCM-Operated Three-Phase Three-Wire Voltage-Source Converter System Featuring Capacitor-Split Virtual Ground Connection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10517435</link><description>High efficiency can be achieved in grid-connected converters by implementing a zero-voltage switching mechanism, such as the integrated triangular current mode (iTCM) modulation, which reduces the switching losses in the semiconductors. The iTCM can be readily adapted to a three-phase three-wire voltage-source converter (VSC) with the help of virtual ground (VG), which decouples the operation of three-phase switching cells. However, conventional methods of VG have all the zero-sequence currents flowing through the dc-link capacitors, resulting in an increase in the rms current, hence, extra loss for those passive components. This article, thus, introduces a capacitor-split VG topology that can relieve this issue by excluding the dc-link capacitors from the circulating path of the main zero-sequence currents, helping to reduce current stress for the dc-link capacitors. This topology is characterized by its filter capacitors being split into two halves and connected to the top and the bottom dc rails, respectively. Herein, the working principles of the proposed iTCM-operated three-phase three-wire VSC are comprehensively explained, and a detailed design guideline for the LC branch and LCL filter is offered. Analytical models for component stresses and the reverse current waveform have been developed and corroborated through PLECS simulations. A 3-kW, heatsink-less VSC system was constructed and tested, confirming both the system's effective functionality and the enhanced power efficiency of the proposed capacitor-split VG connection. Therein, the studied system demonstrated a significant efficiency improvement, ranging from 0.51% to 2% across the entire operating power spectrum, as compared to the conventional VG connection in iTCM-operated VSCs.</description></item><item><title>A Trapezoidal Current Mode to Reduce Peak Current in Near-CRM for Three-Level DC&#8211;DC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10528910</link><description>Triangular current mode (TCM) and near-critical conduction mode (near-CRM) are popularly used in dc&#8211;dc converters to achieve zero-voltage switching (ZVS). However, they encounter a huge peak current problem, more than twice the average current. To solve this problem, this article proposes a novel trapezoidal current mode (TZCM) for three-level dc&#8211;dc converters, aiming to reduce the inductor peak current and realize ZVS simultaneously. A trapezoidal modulation with 2-1-0 level sequences and duty cycle swapping is developed to generate the trapezoidal inductor current. To take advantage of the TZCM, a variable switching frequency control is proposed to realize ZVS for all switches in the full operating range. Compared with TCM, the proposed TZCM and its modulation not only reduce the conduction and turn-off losses of the power switches by lowering the peak and rms currents but also realize ZVS at D = 0.5, where ZVS cannot be realized in the traditional modulation because the inductor current ripple is equal to zero. The proposed TZCM and variable switching frequency control are validated using a 2-kW prototype with 99.06% efficiency.</description></item><item><title>High Precision Model Predictive Power Control Method for Battery Energy-Stored Quasi Z-Source Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10531677</link><description>The battery energy-stored quasi Z-source inverter (BES-qZSI) is widely used for photovoltaic power generation system to suppress the fluctuation in photovoltaic power. With the model predictive control, the photovoltaic power generation system obtains a good performance in dynamic response. However, the control accuracy is affected by the sampling frequency because of one voltage vector applied very control cycle. In this article, a high precision model predictive power control method is proposed for the BES-qZSI to reduce the power fluctuation from the perspective of reforming the quality of dc-side inductor current and output current. The deadbeat control is modified to control the inductor current, so that the inductor current can track its reference command precisely with lower ripple. The dual-vector model predictive control is applied by expanding the voltage vector combination. The voltage vector inverter with higher phase freedom degree is applied to inverter, improving the control accuracy of the output current. The experimental results verify the validity and the advantages of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Robust Sequential Model-Free Predictive Control of a Three-Level T-Type Shunt Active Power Filter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10535746</link><description>Three-level T-type shunt active power filter (3LT2SAPF) has been widely used to improve the power quality of power grid under nonlinear load, and their harmonic compensation performance and reliability have been widely noticed. Model predictive control (MPC) offers the advantage of convenient multiobjective optimization, quick response and a simple principle. However, once the parameter mismatch occurs due to some reasons (e.g., temperature change, noise from the sensors, etc.), the output performance of MPC system will be seriously deteriorated, sometimes may even endanger the system stability. Moreover, for cases when the circuit relation is unknown, the prediction model of the control object could not be established, rendering the traditional model-based MPC (TMPC) inapplicable. To address these challenges and enhance the robustness of the 3LT2C SAPF system, a linearly fitting sequential model free predictive control method is proposed. First, the principle of linear fitting method for current prediction is briefly analyzed. Second, a current difference matrix for each switch sequence has been established, which is utilized for harmonic current tracking. Finally, the cost functions for neutral-point voltage and dc-bus voltage are designed. Numerous experimental results under different scenarios verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Novel High-Efficient and Miniaturized Operating Method for Ultra-Fast Vacuum Switch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10538066</link><description>As one of the most important component in mechanical and hybrid dc breaker (MCB and HCB), operating time of ultrafast vacuum switch (VS) determines the breaking speed of MCB and HCB. However, limited by the high capacitive storage energy requirement of Thomason-coil actuator (TCA), the low-efficiency and large-volume of operating mechanism are main restrictions for wide application of ultrafast VS. This article proposes a high-efficient and miniaturized operating method for ultrafast VS by recycling the residual energy in capacitor banks for sequential open- and close-operations (O-C). Mathematical model of ultrafast VS during the sequential O-C operation process is established, and the prototype with rated parameters of 3.6&#8201;kV/2.5&#8201;kA/1ms is developed for experimental verification. The research shows that by using the proposed method, the total required capacitive storage capacity for sequential O-C operation is decreased by 50%, from 2038 to 1019&#8201;J, resulting in the doubled operating efficiency. In addition, the cost and volume of the operating mechanism for ultrafast VS are decreased significantly.</description></item><item><title>A 400 V Dual-Phase Series-Capacitor Buck Converter GaN IC With Integrated Closed-Loop Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10510653</link><description>Gallium nitride (GaN) high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) offer a 13&#215; better $R_{\text{DS,on}}Q_{g}$ figure-of-merit than silicon laterally-diffused metal-oxide semiconductor (LDMOS) devices for power converters operating above 100 V.

Seamless integration of DCCBs into medium voltage direct current (MVdc) networks is challenging due to the diverse voltage and power levels. Furthermore, the limited current and voltage capability of semiconductor devices limits the full integration of solid-state DCCBs for MVdc applications. Series and parallel-connected insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) arrays can be employed to match the current and voltage levels required. However, with passive gate drives, devices may fail due to non-homogeneous current and voltage distribution across IGBTs. Closed-loop active gate drives (AGDs) provide a solution to overcome this. In the proposed standardized-active switching module (ASM) scheme, IGBTs are equipped with AGDs with status feedback. This control method enables the IGBTs to follow a defined current/voltage trajectory during the switching rather than being guided by the inherent characteristics of the device. Hence, with the ability to control dynamic current and voltage, an additional degree of freedom is enabled to connect several ASMs in series and parallel. DCCB architecture based on Standardized-ASMs is proposed as a flexible protection solution for MVdc networks. This paper describes the developed AGD scheme and behavioral analysis of the AGD-based ASMs. Experimental results show the dynamic voltage and current slope control capability of the proposed standardized ASMs. Finally, this paper assesses the ASM-based DCCB architecture for MVdc networks. An ASM-based DCCB prototype was developed and tested to verify the voltage and current sharing capability of modular ASMs in the proposed DCCB architecture.</description></item><item><title>Substrate Embedded Power Electronics Packaging for Silicon Carbide mosfets</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10520830</link><description>This article proposes a new power electronic packaging for discrete dies, namely, a standard cell, which consists of a step-etched active metal brazing (AMB) substrate and a flexible printed circuit board (flex-PCB).

To overcome such challenges, dc circuit breakers (DCCB) will be required to protect the system, and current flow controllers (CFCs) will be required to control lines' currents. A DCCB and CFC can be combined into a single integrated device with multiple functionalities. To this aim, this article presents an integrated device with current flow control and fault current interruption capability. Furthermore, by implementing a minor modification to the proposed topology, the provided CFC-DCCB showcases not only the capacity to interrupt current flowing from the converter to the dc bus during a dc bus fault but also the capability to interrupt a faulty line, even in the event of an ultrafast disconnector failure. The operational principle of the integrated device is described, and its performance is examined in PSCAD/EMTDC using a modified meshed version of the CIGRE B4 grid. Moreover, a scaled-down three-terminal VSC grid was built to verify the proposed integrated device's CFC experimentally.</description></item><item><title>Common-Leg Coupled Inductor Configuration in a Three-Level Interleaved DC&#8211;DC Medium Voltage SiC-Based Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10517613</link><description>The article proposes and investigates an alternative coupled inductor configuration in a three-level interleaved dc&#8211;dc converter. The new common-leg coupled inductor structure is introduced, and possible modulation methods are studied and theoretically analyzed, focusing on the impact on current ripples, power losses, and common-mode noise. The concept is validated using an MV-rated, SiC-based bidirectional converter dedicated to battery storage application in a bipolar EV charging station, tested up to 1 kV and 10 kW. Furthermore, the comparative study shows that the suggested method exhibits a smaller volume when compared to the conventional approach with several single inductors, comparable performance but with a more straightforward inductor design than the tapped inductor solution, and full section current controllability, unlike the single-inductor option. Finally, using the proposed technique, common-mode noise can be entirely limited, allowing the minimization of excess filtering. Overall, the proposed inductor configuration can be effectively and competitively used in modern SiC-based three-level dc&#8211;dc converters.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Dual-Active-Bridge Converter for Wide Voltage Range by Switching Operating Modes With Different Transformer Equivalent Turns Ratios</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10521860</link><description>This article proposes a variable transformer equivalent turns ratio dual-active-bridge (VTDAB) dc&#8211;dc converter, which aims to increase the efficiency of the conventional dual-active-bridge (CDAB) dc&#8211;dc converter over a wide voltage range. By changing the driving logic of the secondary-side three bridge legs, the VTDAB controls the voltages across the dual transformers with two different turns ratios, resulting in three operating modes with different equivalent turns ratios that do not require any extra components. First, the principle, mathematical model, and zero-voltage switching (ZVS) conditions of VTDAB are introduced. Second, the turns ratios of the dual transformers are designed, the boundaries between the different operating modes are determined, and a complete control strategy is proposed with the aim of lowering the inductor root mean square (rms) current. Finally, a 1-kW prototype with a voltage gain range of 0.4&#8211;2.5 is built. Comparisons are made between the maximum attainable transmitted power, the inductor rms current, and the ZVS range of VTDAB and CDAB. According to the experimental results, the VTDAB maintains an efficiency of 92%&#8211;98.3% across the whole operating range while having a lower inductor rms current and higher efficiency over a wide voltage range.</description></item><item><title>In-Chip Microfluidic Cooling Integrated on GaN Power IC Reaching High Power Density of 78 kW/l</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10522909</link><description>The lateral structure of gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors enables monolithic integration of logic and power devices, which offers promise to miniaturize bulky converters into a compact package. However, the concentrated heat that arises from this dense integration can locally exceed 1 kW/cm2, which surpasses the limit of current thermal management technologies. In this article, we demonstrate the potential of integrating in-chip microfluidic cooling directly on GaN power integrated circuits (ICs), together with additively manufactured packaging, to provide efficient thermal management, and achieve ultrahigh-power densities.

The challenges associated with designing high-power and high-frequency transformers are considerable. The electronic-embedded transformer (EET) concept, proposed in Cao et al. (2023), is a response to these challenges, integrating semiconductor electronics into the transformer windings. In light of this concept, this article presents two significant modifications. First, it replaces the complete full bridge with a low-voltage bidirectional ac switch. Second, it introduces a resonant commutation (RC) to realize a quasi-trapezoidal transformer current with a smaller rms value. Compared to the triangular current produced by the original EET-DCX in Cao et al. (2023), the rms current can be decreased by 15%. In addition to streamlining the circuit, the proposed RC EET-DCX retains all the advantages of the original EET-DCX, including simple open-loop control and natural current sharing. By incorporating only one embedded bidirectional ac switch, the impedance of the high-frequency transformer leakage inductance is fully neutralized. As a result, the rated power of the proposed RC EET-DCX can be readily scaled up through transformer-level parallelism. Furthermore, the RC EET-DCX maintains the benefits of typical LLC/CLLC-DCX, including load-independent voltage gain, full load range zero voltage switching, and low circulating current. To verify aforementioned benefits, a 12-kW RC EET-DCX with four planar RC EET units was built and tested.</description></item><item><title>Active Power Decoupling for Full-Bridge Submodules of a Modular Multilevel Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10531038</link><description>The modular multilevel converter (MMC) topology has been widely used in medium/high voltage high-power transmission and distribution and motor drive fields. The full-bridge submodule (FB-SM) MMC topology with fault-handling capability is currently receiving increasing attention and application. However, in order to suppress the SM capacitor voltage ripple, the usage of SM capacitors with larger capacitance significantly increases the hardware cost and volume of the system. In this article, a modified FB-SM with an active power decoupling circuit (APD-SM) is introduced, in which the APD circuit is integrated by sharing two power-switching devices with traditional FB-SM. By switching the power device switching mode when the FB-SM outputs zero voltage, the APD circuit operates in Buck or Boost mode to achieve the transfer of ripple powers from the FB-SM capacitor to the APD circuit, thereby achieving significant suppression of FB-SM capacitor voltage ripple or reducing the FB-SM capacitance. Its topology, operating modes, and voltage ripple are introduced in detail. In addition, the parameter design and control method of the APD circuit are presented. Finally, the simulation and experimental platform of MMC with APD-SM and FB-SM (abbreviated as APD-MMC and FB-MMC, respectively) are built. Simulations and experimental results verify the validity of the APD-MMC topology and control strategy.</description></item><item><title>Parallel Capacitive-Link Universal Converters With Low Current Stress and High Efficiency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10535229</link><description>Series capacitive-link universal converters are a relatively new class of single-stage power converters that offer numerous advantages including high reliability, high power density, and high efficiency. However, one of the limitations of these converters is high current stress of the switches, which lowers their efficiency especially in high current applications. In this article, a new class of soft-/hard-switched parallel capacitive-link converters is introduced to address this limitation of the series capacitive-link universal converter while keeping its advantages. Apart from providing bidirectional power transfer, the proposed ac&#8211;ac converter can implement voltage stepping up/down as well as frequency transformation. A small film capacitor, which is placed in parallel with the input and output switch bridges, is responsible for transferring the power from input towards output. A small inductor can be placed in series with the link capacitor to realize zero-current-switching for all the switches under any load conditions, which lowers the switching losses and reduces electromagnetic interference (EMI). The proposed parallel capacitive-link converter is expected to offer an enhanced efficiency and reduced current stress compared to the series capacitive-link universal converters. In this article, principles of the operation of the proposed converter are presented, and its performance and advantages are verified by simulation and experiment.</description></item><item><title>Ripple Voltage Compensation Method-Based High Peak-to-Average-Ratio Pulsed Power Suppression With Partial Power Conversion Characteristics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10534849</link><description>The periodic power fluctuation of low-frequency pulsed power load leads to disturbance to the power supply system. Pulsed power suppression circuit is necessary to balance the input and output power, and maintain an unpulsed input power of the power system. In this article, a pulsed power suppression circuit, which is inserted between the input dc bus and the energy storage capacitors, is proposed based on ripple voltage compensation method. The input and output power are decoupled by the energy storage capacitors and the suppression circuit. Thus, constant input power/current is achieved. The voltage difference between the fluctuating capacitor voltage and the dc bus voltage is compensated by the suppression circuit. Instantaneous power of the pulsed load is directly supplied by the energy storage capacitors, while the dc bus provides average power to the load. Only a small ratio of the average load power is processed by the suppression circuit. Therefore, the power rating and loss of the suppression circuit are reduced significantly in comparison with the state of the art. The implementation circuit and control scheme of the proposed pulse power suppression method are presented. Design guidelines and examples are conducted as well. Experimental results and comparative study are provided to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed solutions.</description></item><item><title>Three-Leg Active Bridge-Based Bidirectional Resonant Converter Using Hybrid Si/SiC Switches</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10520923</link><description>This article proposes a bidirectional resonant converter that uses a three-leg active bridge and hybrid Si/SiC switches. The use of a three-leg active bridge on the secondary side of the transformer transfers twice as much power compared with the use of a single active bridge; one of the three legs is shared, which reduces the number of active power devices in the development process. The phase-shift modulation has been adopted for both power flow directions, which enables zero-voltage switching turn-on for all the switches. On the secondary side, the shared leg only requires the use of two SiC mosfets, because these particular switches undergo high conduction loss and high turn-off loss during both forward and backward operations. This trait reduces the implementation cost of the circuit further. The primary-side windings of the transformer are connected in series and each secondary-side winding has wound in the opposite direction. The resulting symmetric architecture of the dual transformer connected to a three-leg active bridge and the corresponding pulsewidth modulation (PWM) naturally balance the currents flowing through the middle leg and right leg on the secondary side. A 1-kW rated prototype that converts 150&#8211;200 V input to a 400 V output is designed and tested to validate the concept for cost-effective battery charging and discharging.</description></item><item><title>A Current-Efficient Pseudo-3D Regulated Dickson Charge Pump</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10521745</link><description>A pseudo-3D regulated dc&#8211;dc boost converter, based on a modified Dickson charge pump (DCP) topology, is presented as an effective solution to achieve optimized current conversion efficiency. In this solution, currents of the clock generator are directly conveyed to the DCP, with the result of reducing the power wasted by drivers and oscillator. The whole converter implements two concurrent feedback loops: the external one, constituted by the output voltage divider and the error amplifier, serving to set the output voltage; the internal one, included in the DCP core, automatically tunes the clock frequency and makes the system efficient in terms of current conversion. A prototype of the design was implemented in a standard 130-nm CMOS process and its operation was tested and compared to the previous arts.</description></item><item><title>An Inductorless Triple Boost 13-Level Switched Capacitor Inverter With Reduced Ripple Current</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10521801</link><description>Switched capacitor (SC) multilevel inverter (SCMLI) is a promising alternative to traditional voltage source inverters for industrial and renewable energy applications. In SCMLI, capacitors are used in a specific sequence during charging and discharging either in parallel or series with the source for level generation. During the charging period of the capacitor, a large ripple current is generated. This ripple may cause an increase in the peak current and ripple voltage of the capacitors. The reliability and life expectancy of the inverter can be severely affected by this ripple current of the capacitor. This article proposes an inductorless self-balance single-phase 13-level inverter with triple boosting capability. It aims to reduce the ripple current in both the source and capacitors by arranging the switching sequence in a particular fashion to implement a partial charging technique in the capacitors. Furthermore, it results in better efficiency and reduced current stress without the need for any source inductance or a complicated control algorithm. The performance of the proposed inverter is verified through its laboratory prototype under dynamic load conditions and varying modulation indexes.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Single-Stage AC/DC Converter With Integrated Low-Voltage-Stress Active Decoupling Circuit and Reduced Buffer Capacitance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10522606</link><description>The escalating power demands mandated by the USB PD standard present challenges for existing ac&#8211;dc adapters in terms of size, efficiency, and cost. The conventional two-stage solutions cannot meet the requirements due to the necessity of bulky buffer capacitor and high-voltage-stress components. This article proposed a novel single-stage flyback power factor correction (PFC) converter integrated a low-voltage-stress active decoupling cell with reduced buffer capacitance. And a passive and lossless clamp structure is adopted to suppress the voltage spikes in the power switches along with recovering the leakage energy to enhance the efficiency. A novel active power decoupling control algorithm based on volt&#8211;second balance is also proposed to achieve precise output regulation and PFC simultaneously under both DCM and CCM operations. A 100-W experimental prototype is built, which achieves a peak efficiency of 93.6%, and reduces 72% volume of the buffer capacitor and reduces 61.5% voltage rating of two active switches compared to the conventional two-stage solution. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the performance of the proposed solution in terms of low cost, high conversion efficiency and power density.</description></item><item><title>Automatic Current Limit Strategy for LLC DC-DC Converter for Overload Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10521805</link><description>LLC dc&#8211;dc converter is widely used, but its current suppression under overload operation is a concerned issue.

The proposed converter can produce highly efficient and symmetric in-phase and antiphase buck and boost modes of operation with much lower component voltage and current stresses. This reduces the operation and design complexity, and helps to achieve a high-efficiency operation. The high-frequency modulating switches of the proposed converter are implemented with coupled-inductor-based dual-buck phase leg, producing three-level input and output voltages, and providing inherent protection from voltage-source short-circuit issue during switch transitions. The other salient features of the proposed converter are no-commutation issue, no need for RC snubbers or dedicated safe-commutation algorithms, provision of high-quality and continuous input/output currents, and support for nonresistive loads. An in-depth circuit analysis of the proposed converter is provided based on the proposed switch modulation strategies. The guidelines for component design/selection are discussed, followed by the comparisons with state-of-the-art three-level ac&#8211;ac converters.

The current fractional-winding transformers all adopt a completely symmetrical structure, which is too strict for the transformer structure and makes it difficult to use the space flexibly. In addition, it is unclear the impact of structural asymmetry on the operation of the converters. This article mainly focuses on the structural analysis of the fractional-winding transformer and proposes flexible asymmetric structures. The requirements for the structural design of fractional winding transformers are clarified. The results show that the structural constraints of the transformer can be greatly relaxed, and a flexible asymmetrical structure can also work. The influence of key structural parameters on the circuit is also analyzed. An LLC converter based on a 1/3-turn asymmetric structure transformer was built, which worked well and validated the analysis.</description></item><item><title>System-Level Energy Management Optimization of Power-Split Hybrid Electric Vehicle Based on Nested Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10361592</link><description>The power-split hybrid electric vehicle (PS-HEV) is a complex and high-dimensional system that only through overall system-level optimization, considering the synergies and complementation between different components and subsystems, can achieve the best overall performance and benefits, which has been a technology challenge in the study.

In order to improve the vehicle antirollover performance and stability, a steering/braking-by-wire-integrated antirollover control strategy is proposed. The strategy mainly consists of a mode selection layer and an integrated control layer. In the mode selection layer, a multiple coupled degrees of freedom energy method combined with a nonlinear vehicle prediction model is designed to accurately evaluate rollover risk, and determine the control mode. In the integrated control layer, a novel time-varying nonlinear model prediction control is adopted to solve the desired tire forces and front wheel steering angle to inhibit load transfer and prevent rollover. Besides, the actuator constraints changing with the tires&#8217; vertical forces dynamically are considered. The proposed strategy is evaluated with a Trucksim-MATLAB simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiment. The results show that the proposed strategy can accurately assess the rollover risk and improve the yaw stability and antirollover performance significantly.</description></item><item><title>A Bistable Four-Working-States Electromagnetic Mini Valve Based on Flexible Magnets for Pneumatic Soft Actuators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10352943</link><description>Electromagnetic mini valves have attracted widespread interest recently. However, traditional ones usually have two working states and necessitate continuous energy input. To solve these issues, we developed a bistable electromagnetic compact valve (R9&#215;44 mm) with four working states based on three-dimensional-printed moving magnets. For obtaining four working states, each moving magnet with a fixed-beam structure is actuated independently. To keep working without requiring energy, we present a magnetic-force-based bistable mechanism involving iron cores, moving magnets, and fixed magnets. Since the valve's closing and opening are kept by an intrinsic magnetic force between magnets, it requires an instantaneous current (0.008 s) to switch working modes. Furthermore, we added a 1 mm thick magnet to the moving magnet to enhance the valve's performance. Consequently, its pressure and flow rate dramatically rose from 1.0 to 30.0 kPa and 0.18 to 11.2 L/min, respectively. Its energy consumption and response time are 0.16 J and 0.008 s. Due to its four working states and bistable function, this research is demonstrated to reduce the number of valves and energy required in pneumatic systems. In the future, we will focus on its applications in invasive surgery equipment and bionic devices.</description></item><item><title>Cross-Regulation Generation Principle in Nonideal Single-Inductor Double-Output Boost Converter With Voltage Mode Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10380209</link><description>Cross regulation of single-inductor multiple-output dc&#8211;dc converters deteriorates the dynamic and static performance, reduces the energy transfer efficiency, and even destabilizes the converter. To explore the deep reason for cross regulation in the single-inductor dual-output (SIDO) boost converter, the generation principle of the cross regulation in a nonideal SIDO boost converter with voltage mode control is analyzed. The nonlinear mathematical model and small-signal model of the converter are established, and the cross-regulation characteristics with parasitic parameters of circuit components are discussed. The dc voltage gain and transfer functions such as control-to-coupling, control-to-output, and cross-regulation impedance are derived. Furthermore, the characteristics of closed-loop cross regulation based on the voltage-mode control are analyzed by the Bode diagram. Both simulation results and experimental results verify that the cross regulation can be reduced by 14.3% when the parasitic resistor of the inductor increased by 0.1 &#937;, and reduced by 14.5% and 14% when the parasitic resistor of the capacitor at output-a increased by 0.1 &#937; and the output-b decreases by 0.1 &#937;, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Single-Phase Double Fundamental Frequency PLL Based on the Multiplication Stage under DQ-Axis Dual Closed-Loop Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10376370</link><description>With the increasing popularity of single-phase grid connection, single-phase phase-locked loops have become one of the hot research topics in the field of phase-locking. In three-phase systems, phase-locked loops using the double fundamental frequency (DFF) concept have already achieved promising results. In this article, for the first time, the DFF concept is introduced into single-phase systems. A quadrature signal generator (QSG) based on the multiplication stage is proposed, which directly generates two-phase orthogonal DFF ac omponents from the single-phase power grid. Based on the proposed multiplication stage, a single-phase DFF phase-locked loop (DFF-PLL) is introduced. To further enhance the system performance, a dual-closed-loop control method based on the dq-axis is introduced. The method of the DFF-PLL with added dq-axis dual closed-loop control not only enhances system robustness but also capitalizes on the advantages of DFF to improve system speed. Finally, the experimental results are given to demonstrate and verify the effectiveness of the proposed DFF-PLL in terms of dynamic response.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Common-Mode Voltage for Grid-Tied Photovoltaic Cascaded H-Bridge Inverters Under Severe Power Imbalances</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10361579</link><description>This article deals with the control problem of injecting balanced grid currents from a grid-tied photovoltaic cascaded H-bridge (CHB) inverter under severe interphase power imbalances. Existing solutions are hindered by the additional harmonic content required at the inverter output voltages. Therefore, a mathematical formulation for which the solution has minimal harmonic content is proposed. The proposed solution, optimal common-mode voltage (OCMV), has an analytical form that allows deducing and analyzing the CHB operating area. The real-time implementation of the OCMV requires solving a nonlinear two-variables system; thus, an iterative and distributed algorithm is designed. By doing so, the proposed OCMV can be fully formulated and implemented using a real-time control platform. The experimental validation was carried out in a scale-down 3 kW grid-tied seven-level CHB inverter governed by phase-shifted model predictive control. The laboratory results show that the proposed OCMV allows obtaining symmetrical grid currents while maintaining low-distorted inverter output voltages.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive-Observer-Based Control of a Real-World Grid-Forming Converter-Interfaced Shaft Generator in a Shipboard Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10361590</link><description>This article proposes a new strategy for integrating a new type of distributed generation (DG) into a shipboard microgrid (MG).

Several semiconductor chips are connected in parallel inside the module. Due to the complex coupling of electrical, thermal, and mechanical fields within the device, the imbalance in pressure distribution and heat dissipation capacity may lead to uneven current distribution and potential overloading of certain chips. Chip-level online current sensing is an effective approach to provide current monitoring and fault diagnosis. However, it is difficult to accomplish high-accuracy chip-level current sensing considering the bandwidth and size of sensors. In this article, a compact hybrid sensor consisting of anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) and Rogowski coil for chip-level online sensing is proposed. Rogowski coil possesses the advantage to measure the high-frequency current and AMR sensor is used to expand the dc and low-frequency bandwidth of the coil. The principle and the design of Rogowski coil and AMR sensor are analyzed. The magnetic fields generated by multiple chips tend to couple with each other. To enhance the accuracy of AMR, a decoupling matrix is calculated to decouple the crosstalk of magnetic fields. The implementation of the hybrid sensor is proposed. The hybrid sensor is used to measure the chip-level current of a press-pack insulate gate bipolar transistorv (IGBT) in a buck converter whose frequency is 40 kHz. The output of hybrid sensor is verified by the commercial current transducer. The result shows that the hybrid sensor achieves chip-level current sensing for press-pack power module, with a measurement bandwidth ranging from dc to 30 MHz, an accuracy of 2% and excellent linearity.</description></item><item><title>A Self-Sensing Synchronous Switch Circuit for Bidirectional Piezoelectric Energy Conversion</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10373994</link><description>Piezoelectric materials are versatile and widely used in many industrial applications. As a compact electromechanical transducer, a piezoelectric device not only transforms energy in either electrical-to-mechanical or mechanical-to-electrical directions but also conveys the deformation information into a measurable electrical signal. In most of the existing engineering designs, only one of the energy transformations or information-sensing functions is utilized. The interface circuit is the major obstacle against the integration of all these functions into a multifunctional application. This article explores the possibility of encapsulating all the sensing and bidirectional energy transformation functions in a single piezoelectric device by introducing a switched-mode synchronous switch interface circuit. Such a multifunctional design is realized with a multibranch modified buck&#8211;boost converter working under strong discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). The three functions operate in a time-sharing way; therefore, the information acquisition and energy transformation processes can be decoupled. In the experiment, we implement a prototyped self-sensing synchronous switch bidirectional energy conversion circuit (BECC) for energy harvesting and vibration excitation purposes. It samples the piezoelectric voltage at a rate of 500 Hz and successfully carries out the energy transformation tasks according to the software instructions. The switched-mode self-sensing BECC (SS-BECC) provides unprecedented convenience for the design of future multifunctional and miniaturized piezoelectric devices.</description></item><item><title>A High-Quality Ratio-Metric Measurement Method Based on Analog-to-Digital Converter for Precision Sensors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10374443</link><description>In this article, we propose a high-quality ratio-metric measurement (HQRM) method based on an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for high-precision sensors, which shows significant improvement in resolution and stability as well as the sensor's ability to adapt to rapidly changing experimental environments. The traditional ratio-metric measurement (TRM) method based on ADC is introduced in detail for comparison. Circuits of the two ratio-metric measurement methods are designed and tested, and the experimental results show that the HQRM has much better suppression capability to the output noise and drift caused by the excitation source compared with the TRM. A precision capacitive displacement sensor with two ratio-metric methods is tested as an example, and it is found that the sensor's output noise and drift caused by the excitation source are significantly better suppressed with the HQRM in the full bandwidth range and the full-scale range, so the resolution of the sensor is improved from 3.79 nm(rms) to 1.51 nm(rms), and the temperature drift is reduced from 0.75 nm/&#176;C to nearly zero even with drastic temperature changes. Furthermore, this method is expected to function efficiently for other amplitude-modulated types of high-precision sensors.</description></item><item><title>A Multiphase LCC-S Compensated Wireless Power Transfer System Based on Integrated Inversely Coupled Inductors and Parallel Resonance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10360161</link><description>In this letter, a novel passive current balancing method is proposed, which combines the usage of inversely coupled inductors (ICIs) and parallel resonance, to achieve current balancing of multiple phases.

However, DPWM will increase common voltage at the neutral point of the filter capacitors and may deteriorate the safe operation of the inverter. To reduce the common voltage, some applications connect the neutral point of the filter capacitors and midpoint of dc voltage. Nevertheless, there may be zero-sequence LC-resonant current in the filter inductor, leading to a larger current ripple and further increasing the power loss. This letter demonstrates the inherent mechanism how DPWM generates the zero-sequence resonance current. On the basis, this letter unveils the straightforward ideas for problem solving, regardless of the DPWM method, and then proposes an easy-implementing solution to reduce it from the perspective of control method, which is different from the state-of-the-art works by modifying modulation method, yet can reserve the efficiency improvement brought from DPWM. Finally, experimental results based on a 3.6-KVA 3&#934; GCI prototype are provided to verify the analysis and effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Calculating Probabilistic Carbon Emission Flow: An Adaptive Regression-Based Framework</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10414125</link><description>Carbon intensities are beginning to be used as incentives for consumer-driven carbon reduction. Guided by time-varying carbon intensities, consumers can schedule loads in priority order to use more electricity during low-carbon periods. However, carbon intensities cannot be perfectly forecasted in advance due to the fluctuation of loads and renewable energy. The probabilistic distribution of carbon intensities can be calculated by the grid operator and used as a reference for power consumers. This paper presents a probabilistic carbon emission flow model to calculate the distribution of carbon intensities for consumers. An adaptive regression-based calculation framework combined with a carbon pattern dictionary technique is proposed to handle the high calculation complexity caused by the nonlinearity of the carbon emission flow model. The simulation results from the case studies demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Quantum Grover Search-Inspired Global Maximum Power Point Tracking for Photovoltaic Systems Under Partial Shading Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10418984</link><description>Tracking the global maximum power point (GMPP) of photovoltaic (PV) arrays under partial shading conditions (PSCs) is a critical research area.

The dispatch policy is designed to account for both calendrical and cyclical aging effects on BESS, explicitly modeling the impacts of ambient temperature on BESS lifespan. The proposed ADP employs an adaptive critic method and enhanced off-policy deterministic policy gradient (DPG) strategy, addressing the limitations of the on-policy gradient-based ADP approaches, including inadequate exploration, low data usage, and computational complexity. In particular, a customized policy is proposed to guide the algorithm to explore some promising decisions and thereby improve exploration capability and learning efficiency compared to conventional DPG-based learning approaches, which may struggle to find a global optimum due to random noisy action-based exploration or require expert demonstration with extra effort. The proposed method is illustrated using the IEEE 123-node system and compared with the existing ADP methods to prove solution accuracy and demonstrate the effects of incorporating degradation models into control design. Case studies showed that the proposed ADP effectively coordinates DERs with a 10 times smaller optimization gap compared to existing methods, and the incorporation of the BESS life loss model into the proposed control ensures the expected lifespan and results in significant cost savings.</description></item><item><title>Higher Order Sliding Mode Observer Based Fast Composite Backstepping Control for HESS in DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10432969</link><description>Hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is effective to compensate for fluctuation power in renewables and fast fluctuation loads in DC microgrids. To regulate DC bus voltage, a power management strategy is an essential issue. In the meantime, the increasing integration of constant power loads (CPLs) in DC microgrids brings great challenges to stable operation due to their negative incremental impedance. In this paper, a fast composite backstepping control (FBC) method is proposed for the HESS to achieve faster dynamics, smaller voltage variations, and large-signal stabilization. In the FBC method, a higher order sliding mode observer (HOSMO) is adopted to estimate the coupled disturbances. Furthermore, the FBC method is integrated with the droop control; so that the FBC-based decentralized power allocation (FBC-DPA) strategy for HESS in DC microgrids is developed. The proposed FBC method is designed based on the Lyapunov function to ensure its stability. Moreover, the design guidelines are provided to facilitate the application of the proposed method. Both simulation and experimental studies under different operating scenarios show that the proposed method achieves faster voltage recovery and smaller voltage variations than the conventional backstepping control method.</description></item><item><title>Rotor Speed Control in Above-Rated Wind Speed Region for Floating Offshore Wind Turbine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433765</link><description>Large oscillations of the rotor speed are often observed in floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) operating in above-rated wind speed region. This phenomenon drastically increases the mechanical fatigue loads and even causes damage to the generator. To address this problem, this article first establishes a Reduced-Order Speed-Control-Oriented Model (ROSCOM), which demonstrates the nonlinear coupling of the platform pitch motion and the turbine rotor rotation. The oscillation mechanism is then revealed that the platform pitch motion acts as the zero dynamics of ROSCOM, which can produce limit cycles and result in large oscillations of rotor speed. Based on the Bendixson criterion and Hopf bifurcation theorem, limit cycles and Hopf bifurcation in the platform pitch motion are identified and proved. Additionally, a nonlinear generator torque compensation strategy, named Non-Minimum Phase Platform Pitch Compensation (NMP$^{3}$C), is designed to eliminate the limit cycles in the FOWT system. The rotor speed control performance is thus greatly improved. Electromagnetic power variation, platform pitch variation and tower base fore-aft fatigue loads are also mitigated. Digital simulations based on OpenFAST verify the analysis results and the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Cluster-Based Distributed Secondary Control of Large-Scale DC Microgrid Cluster System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433685</link><description>With the high integration of distributed renewable energies, microgrid (MG) cluster system, consisting of complex physical structures and complicated networked control structure, has emerged as a growing trend. Currently, several secondary control strategies including centralized, decentralized and distributed control have been proposed to solve the secondary voltage restoration and power sharing problem in single DC MG systems. However, few efforts have been made on the secondary control of MG cluster system. In this paper, a first attempt on designing a decentralized cluster-based distributed secondary control strategy is made towards the goal of accurate voltage restoration and power sharing in the DC MG cluster system. Specifically, for the DGs within the same cluster, a distributed finite-time control approach is proposed, while no information exchange is involved among different clusters. As a consequence, all the distributed controllers of different clusters are totally decentralized. If each cluster has only one DG, our proposed control strategy reduces to the existing decentralized ones, while the case of one cluster boils down to distributed control. Rigorous theoretical analysis is provided for such control strategy. Compared to existing methods, our proposed strategy has better transient and steady-state performance than purely decentralized and better robustness than distributed ones. The proposed method is validated in an experimental test system built in OPAL-RT.</description></item><item><title>Synchronverters With Fault Ride-Through Capabilities for Reliable Microgrid Protection During Balanced and Unbalanced Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433740</link><description>Synchronverters are inverters that provide damping and inertia, similar to synchronous generators. Like traditional inverters, synchronverters are adaptable to the microgrid's operation modes. However, synchronverters may generate oscillatory active and reactive powers during faults and produce phase currents with excessive magnitudes. Therefore, this paper develops two fault ride-through (FRT) strategies for synchronverters: average power control and enhanced power control. Both strategies aim to reduce power oscillations, limit current generation, and ensure compliance with grid codes during faults, regardless of the fault conditions and the grid's operation mode. Additionally, synchronverters with the proposed FRT strategies are incorporated into an optimal protection coordination (OPC) program for microgrid protection. The OPC program obtains the settings of time-current-voltage overcurrent relays (TIV-OCRs) and demonstrates the effect of the proposed FRT strategies on microgrid protection. The obtained settings are suitable for both the microgrid's grid-connected and islanded modes during balanced and unbalanced faults. Evaluation results demonstrate the capability of the proposed strategies to reduce power oscillations, limit current generation, and comply with grid codes. Furthermore, the OPC results reveal the most appropriate strategy to minimize TIV-OCRs' operating times in a coordinated manner, regardless of the fault type and microgrid operating mode.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Dimensional Holomorphic Embedding Method for Probabilistic Energy Flow Calculation in Integrated Distribution Power and Heating System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10438069</link><description>A fast probabilistic energy flow (PEF) analysis method is proposed for integrated distribution power and heating system (IPHS) operations. The proposed solution will overcome the low efficiency of the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method for calculating the probabilistic energy flows (PEFs) iteratively, which will require an exhaustive set of energy flow calculations for a large number of samples. First, we use the multi-dimensional holomorphic embedding method (MDHEM) to derive the analytical energy flow expressions, so that the solutions for massive scenarios can be obtained by merely substituting the boundary conditions into expressions. Second, a PEF analysis model is established based on the analytical method for evaluating the impact of uncertainties on IPHSs, and accelerating the efficiency of traditional MCS methods significantly. Case studies presented in the paper show the effectiveness of the proposed method for calculating the PEFs in IPHS operations.</description></item><item><title>Modeling of Dynamic Control Error and Emergency Frequency Control for Direct-Drive PMSG-Based Wind Turbine Under Grid Fault</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10444068</link><description>The utilization of direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous generator-based wind turbine (DPMWT) is prevalent in mitigating unbalanced power during fault process. However, sudden variations in the magnitude and phase angle of grid voltage during grid faults may result in the phase-locked loop transient response (PLTR) of DPMWT. The PLTR changes the output characteristics of DPMWT through converter control loop. This alteration incorporates dynamic control errors and presents potential hazards to the transient frequency of power system. Therefore, the dynamic control error resulting from PLTR under the three-phase fault is found, and an emergency frequency control method for DPMWT under the three-phase fault is proposed. The quantification method for PLTR under the three-phase fault is proposed, and the conduction paths of PLTR within the converter control loop are analyzed. The mechanism of dynamic control error of DPMWT under the three-phase fault is analyzed, and the calculation method for dynamic control error is further proposed. Moreover, the transient frequency characteristics of the power system when affected by dynamic control error are analyzed, and the emergency frequency control method for DPMWT based on the compensation of dynamic control error is put forward. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by case studies.</description></item><item><title>Grid-Forming Control for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells in an Islanded Microgrid Using Maximum Power Point Estimation Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10449436</link><description>Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are promising distributed generation technologies for their controllability and efficiency. Traditional SOFCs are controlled as a current source to deliver predefined power to the grid. Since a microgrid can operate in both grid-connected mode and islanded mode, grid-forming control ability is required for SOFCs to achieve voltage/ frequency regulation. However, when subjected to load transients, nonlinear output characteristics of SOFCs would probably lead to the collapse of dc-link voltage and unintentional disconnection of SOFCs. To deal with this issue, grid-forming control for SOFCs is presented considering nonlinear characteristics between output current and voltage. The maximum power point (MPP) of SOFCs is tracked using proposed incremental impedance (INI) method and dc-link voltage difference is delivered to adjust output frequency of ac side. In this condition, stable operation and load sharing can be achieved simultaneously during load transients. Simulation results based on PSCAD/EMTDC are provided to validate the effectiveness of proposed grid-forming control.</description></item><item><title>Carbon-Embedded Nodal Energy Price in Hydrogen-Blended Integrated Electricity and Gas Systems With Heterogeneous Gas Compositions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10458410</link><description>Blending green hydrogen from renewable generations into the natural gas infrastructure can effectively mitigate carbon emissions of energy consumers. However, distributed hydrogen blending could lead to heterogeneous gas compositions across the network. The traditional nodal energy price scheme is designed for uniform gas composition, which cannot reflect the impacts of heterogeneous nodal gas composition and carbon emission mitigation. This paper proposes a novel nodal energy price scheme in hydrogen-blended integrated electricity and gas systems (H-IEGS). First, we propose a joint market-clearing model for H-IEGS, where the nonlinear physical properties of gas mixtures caused by heterogeneous gas compositions are characterized. The impacts of hydrogen blending on the carbon emission cost are also quantified. To retrieve the nodal energy price from this highly nonlinear and nonconvex optimization problem, a successive second-order cone programming (SSOCP) method is tailored to get the dual variables tractably. Considering the continuous market clearing process, a warm-start technique is proposed to provide initial reference points for the SSOCP to improve computation efficiency. Finally, an H-IEGS test case in Belgium and a large-scale practical case in Northwest China are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Sea-State-Dependent Control Strategy for Wave Energy Converters: Power Limiting in Large Wave Conditions and Energy Maximising in Moderate Wave Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10460174</link><description>Conventional control strategies for wave energy converters (WECs) maximise power capture of the WEC by amplifying its responses, but this exacerbates hardware constraint violations not generally taken into account, causing undesirable shutdown of electrical systems in adverse wave conditions. When WECs operate close to power take-off (PTO) capacity, the primary control objective is to limit peak power for hardware protection purposes, enabling longer continuous electricity generation time. In this paper, we propose a sea-state-dependent control strategy based on model predictive control to maximise the annual energy production of a WEC with a realistic PTO: in small to moderate sea states it adopts a conventional energy-maximising objective function to increase output power, while in higher sea states a speed-limiting objective function may be utilised to enable longer generating time before shutdown becomes necessary. While this control strategy applies to a wide range of WECs, here we carry out the case study on an attenuator WEC called M4, with gearbox transmission and a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) as its PTO, which is being designed for a 1/4 scale ocean test in Albany, Australia. Simulation results show that compared with a benchmark passive damping controller, a 66% increase in annual energy production can be expected at the targeted site.</description></item><item><title>Addressing Wind Power Forecast Errors in Day-Ahead Pricing With Energy Storage Systems: A Distributionally Robust Joint Chance-Constrained Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10461088</link><description>The rapid integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) has imposed substantial uncertainty and variability on the operation of power markets, which calls for unprecedentedly flexible generation resources such as batteries. In this paper, we develop a novel pricing mechanism for day-ahead electricity markets to adeptly accommodate the uncertainties stemming from RESs. First, a distributionally robust joint chance-constrained (DRJCC) economic dispatch model that incorporates energy storage systems is presented, ensuring that the DRJCCs are satisfied across a moment-based ambiguity set enriched with unimodality-skewness characteristics. Second, by applying the Bonferroni approximation method to tackle the DRJCCs, we show that the proposed model can be transformed into a second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem. Building on the SOCP reformulation, we then precisely derive the electricity prices, including the energy, reserve, and uncertainty prices. Furthermore, we prove that the obtained pricing mechanism supports a robust competitive equilibrium under specific premises. Finally, a PJM 5-bus test system and the IEEE 118-bus test system are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the suggested approach, underscoring its potential contributions to modern power market operations.</description></item><item><title>Two-Critic Deep Reinforcement Learning for Inverter-Based Volt-Var Control in Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10470443</link><description>A two-critic deep reinforcement learning (TC-DRL) approach for inverter-based volt-var control (IB-VVC) in active distribution networks is proposed in this paper. Considering two objectives of VVC, minimizing power loss and eliminating voltage violations, have different mathematical properties, we utilize two critics to approximate two objectives separately, which reduces the learning difficulties of each critic. The TC-DRL approach cooperates well with many actor-critic DRL algorithms for the centralized IB-VVC problems, and two centralized DRL algorithms were designed as examples. For decentralized IB-VVC, we extend the approach to a multi-agent TC-DRL approach and further simplify the multi-agent DRL approach with all agents sharing the same centralized two-critic. Extensive simulation experiments show that the proposed two centralized TC-DRL algorithms require fewer iteration times and return better results than the recent DRL algorithms, and the multi-agent TC-DRL algorithms work well for decentralized IB-VVC problems with different limited real-time measurement conditions.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Joint Distributionally Robust Chance-Constrained Operation for Multiple Integrated Electricity and Heating Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475580</link><description>Integrating heating and electricity networks offers extra flexibility to the energy system operation while improving energy utilization efficiency. This paper proposes a data-driven joint distributionally robust chance-constrained (DRCC) operation model for multiple integrated electricity and heating systems (IEHSs). Flexible reserve resources in IEHS are exploited to mitigate the uncertainty of renewable energy. A distributed and parallel joint DRCC operation framework is developed to preserve the decision-making independence of multiple IEHSs, where the optimized CVaR approximation (OCA) approach is developed to transform the local joint DRCC model into a tractable model. An alternating minimization algorithm is presented to improve the tightness of OCA for joint chance constraints by iteratively tuning the OCA. Case studies on the IEEE 33-bus system with four IEHSs and the IEEE 141-bus system with eight IEHSs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Stability Enhancement of Power Synchronisation Control Based Grid-Forming Inverter Under Varying Network Characteristics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10476727</link><description>Power synchronisation control (PSC) is commonly used in voltage source inverters due to its grid-forming capability and superior performance under weak grid conditions as compared to other grid-forming inverter (GFMI) strategies. However, there is a notable gap in understanding the application and performance of PSC under various practical operating scenarios, particularly in different network types. This paper addresses this critical shortcoming by conducting an in-depth analysis of PSC-based GFMIs under different network types, utilising a comprehensive mathematical and dynamic simulation models. The analysis reveals that the PSC-based GFMI system encounters instability in predominantly resistive networks. To address this issue, two decoupling strategies, namely virtual power (VP)-based and virtual impedance (VI)-based, are proposed to improve power-sharing accuracy and enhance system stability. Furthermore, the improved performance of these proposed strategies is verified in real-time using the IEEE-39 bus network on the OPAL-RT platform. The validation results reaffirm the suitability of PSC-based GFMI in all practical networks.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive Approach for Probabilistic Wind Power Forecasting Based on Meta-Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10476768</link><description>This paper studies an adaptive approach for probabilistic wind power forecasting (WPF) including offline and online learning procedures. In the offline learning stage, a base forecast model is trained via inner and outer loop updates of meta-learning, which endows the base forecast model with excellent adaptability to different forecast tasks, i.e., probabilistic WPF with different lead times or locations. In the online learning stage, the base forecast model is applied to online forecasting combined with incremental learning techniques. On this basis, the online forecast takes full advantage of recent information and the adaptability of the base forecast model. Two applications are developed based on our proposed approach concerning forecasting with different lead times (temporal adaptation) and forecasting for newly established wind farms (spatial adaptation), respectively. Numerical tests were conducted on real-world wind power data sets. Simulation results validate the advantages in adaptivity of the proposed methods compared with existing alternatives.</description></item><item><title>MADRL-Based DSO-Customer Coordinated Bi-Level Volt/VAR Optimization Method for Power Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478208</link><description>The high penetration of customer-side variable PVs could change power distribution networks (PDNs) operations and lead to frequent nodal voltage violations. The grid-side static var compensators (SVCs), controlled by distribution system operators (DSO), and customer-side PV inverters are usually used as fast devices to mitigate voltage problems caused by PVs. To effectively coordinate these two types of VAR resources with different ownerships, this paper proposes the multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) approach, which uses the asymmetric Markov game (ASMG) method to implement a cooperative bi-level Volt/VAR optimization (VVO) framework. In this framework, DSO is the leader, which makes decisions at the upper level to minimize the PDNs energy losses by regulating SVCs, and customers are the followers, which make decisions at the lower level by regulating PV inverters to mitigate nodal voltage deviations. Furthermore, a model-free Bi-level Actor-Critic (Bi-AC) algorithm is proposed to solve the ASMG problem, which defines the agents&#8217; decision priorities so that the follower agents can always execute the best response policy. The effectiveness of the proposed Bi-AC method is verified by utilizing improved IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 118-bus case with practical grid operation data.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Dynamic Power Sharing Control for Frequency Regulation Using Hybrid Hydrogen Electrolyzer Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478586</link><description>Hydrogen electrolyzers are promising tools for frequency regulation of future power systems with high penetration of renewable energies and low inertia. This is due to both the increasing demand for hydrogen and their flexibility as controllable load. The two main electrolyzer technologies are Alkaline Electrolyzers (AELs) and Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolyzers (PEMELs). However, they have trade-offs: dynamic response speed for AELs, and cost for PEMELs. This paper proposes the combination of both technologies into a Hybrid Hydrogen Electrolyzer System (HHES) to obtain a fast response for frequency regulation with reduced costs. A decentralized dynamic power sharing control strategy is proposed where PEMELs respond to the fast component of the frequency deviation, and AELs respond to the slow component, without the requirement of communication. The proposed decentralized approach facilitates a high reliability and scalability of the system, what is essential for expansion of hydrogen production. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated in simulations and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Aggregate Model of District Heating Network for Integrated Energy Dispatch: A Physically Informed Data-Driven Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10485435</link><description>The district heating network (DHN) is essential in enhancing the operational flexibility of integrated energy systems (IES). Yet, it is hard to obtain an accurate and concise DHN model for the operation owing to complicated network features and imperfect measurements. Considering this, this paper proposes a physically informed data-driven aggregate model (AGM) for the DHN, providing a concise description of the source-load relationship of DHN without exposing network details. First, we derive the analytical relationship between the state variables of the source and load nodes of the DHN, offering a physical fundament for the AGM. Second, we propose a physics-informed estimator for the AGM that is robust to low-quality measurements, in which the physical constraints associated with the parameter normalization and sparsity are embedded to improve the accuracy and robustness. Finally, we propose a physics-enhanced algorithm to solve the nonlinear estimator with non-closed constraints efficiently. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Modeling the Coupling of Rotor Speed, primary Frequency Reserve and Virtual Inertia of Wind Turbines in Frequency Constrained Look-Ahead Dispatch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10496871</link><description>With the increasing penetration of wind power, wind turbines (WTs) are required to provide primary frequency reserve (PFR) and virtual inertia support to the grid to ensure frequency security. However, in existing frequency-constrained scheduling research, the coupling of WTs' rotor speed, PFR and virtual inertia has been overlooked. This paper accurately models the PFR capacity and virtual inertia of WTs based on WT's rotor speed control and frequency control. Besides, a frequency-constrained stochastic look-ahead economic dispatch (FCS-LAED) model, which co-optimizes the PFR, virtual inertia and rotor speed of WTs is proposed. In this model, WTs' operation constraints are considered more comprehensively compared with existing research. A combination of convex hull relaxation and McCormick envelope is employed to convexify the proposed FCS-LAED model. To further tighten the relaxation, a modified sequential bound tightening method is proposed. Case studies on the modified IEEE 6-bus system and IEEE 118-bus system verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and methods.</description></item><item><title>Stability Constrained Optimal Operation of Inverter-Dominant Microgrids: A Two Stage Robust Optimization Framework</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10497873</link><description>To mitigate the stability issues in the droop-controlled isolated microgrids brought by aleatory renewable energy sources (RESs), which can be added at any given time, this paper proposes a two-stage robust coordination strategy to optimize the operation of multiple flexible resources. In the first stage, a day-ahead unit commitment (UC) schedule of microturbines(MTs) is formulated considering the uncertainty of RESs and loads. In the second stage, an hourly power dispatch and droop gains adjustment scheme for the energy storage devices are developed to minimize the operation cost and ensure the small signal stability. An adaptive column and constraint generation (C&amp;amp;CG) algorithm is developed to solve the stability-constrained two-stage robust optimization problem. Simulation results on a 33-bus microgrid system reveal that compared to benchmarking approaches, the proposed coordination strategy is able to guarantee the small-signal stability with lower cost. And a sensitivity analysis validates the robustness of the methodology against the uncertainties of RESs.</description></item><item><title>A Decision-Dependent Hydrogen Supply Infrastructure Planning Approach Considering Causality Between Vehicles and Stations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10497898</link><description>In the early commercialization stage of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs), reasonable hydrogen supply infrastructure (HSI) planning is a premise for promoting the popularization of HFCVs. However, there is a strong causality between HFCVs and hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs): the planning decisions of HRSs could affect the hydrogen refueling demand of HFCVs, and the growth of demand would in turn stimulate the further investment in HRSs, which is prompted by the chicken-egg conundrum. Meanwhile, there is a cost contradiction between energy planning and hydrogen refueling convenience of HFCVs caused by HRSs siting planning. To this end, this work establishes a multi-network HSI planning model coordinating hydrogen, power, and transportation networks. Then, to reflect the causal relation between HFCVs and HRSs effectively in the early stage of hydrogen infrastructure investment planning without sufficient historical data, hydrogen demand decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) and a distributionally robust optimization framework are developed. The uncertainty of hydrogen demand is modeled as a Wasserstein ambiguity set with a decision-dependent empirical probability distribution. Subsequently, to reduce the computational complexity caused by the introduction of a large number of scenarios and high-dimensional nonlinear constraints, we developed an improved distribution shaping method and techniques of scenario and variable reduction to derive the solvable form with less computing burden. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that this method can reduce costs by at least 7.7% compared with traditional methods and will be more effective in large-scale HSI planning issues. Further, we put forward effective suggestions for the policymakers and investors.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Optimal Scheduling With Heterogeneous Uncertainty Information: A Framework for Hydrogen Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10499851</link><description>Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) has emerged as a favored methodology for addressing the uncertainties stemming from renewable energy sources. However, existing DRO frameworks primarily focus on single types of uncertainty characteristics, such as moments. Exploring novel ambiguity sets that encompass heterogeneous uncertainty information to mitigate decision conservatism is thus an essential and strategic move. This paper introduces a day-ahead optimal scheduling model tailored for electricity-hydrogen systems under renewable uncertainty, with embedded technologies of hydrogen production, storage, and utilization. Three novel ambiguity sets enriched with the moment, Wasserstein distance, and unimodality information are adeptly devised. Building upon these elaborated ambiguity sets, we develop efficient and scalable reformulations of the expected objective function and uncertain constraints, leading to either a tractable mixed-integer second-order cone programming problem or a linear programming problem. We validate the effectiveness and operating flexibility of the proposed electricity-hydrogen model using both a 6-bus test system and the IEEE 118-bus test system. Furthermore, we demonstrate the superior cost performance and computational efficiency of our developed DRO approaches.</description></item><item><title>Spatial-Temporal Wind Power Probabilistic Forecasting Based on Time-Aware Graph Convolutional Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10502289</link><description>Spatial-temporal wind power prediction is of enormous importance to the grid-connected operation of multiple wind farms in the wind power system. However, most of the conventional methods are usually limited to predicting an individual wind farm's power, and thus lack enough effectiveness of wind power forecasting of multiple adjacent wind farms. This paper proposes a novel spatial-temporal wind power probabilistic prediction approach, named ZF-GCN-MHTQF, based on time zigzags and flexible convolution at graph convolutional network, point-wise loss function and the heavy-tailed quantile function. The proposed framework combines the advantages of time zigzags and flexible convolution at graph convolutional networks that can extract temporally conditioned topological information from multiple wind farms efficiently and incorporate the extracted topological information to predict wind power. At the same time, the proposed method incorporates the strengths of point-wise loss functions and heavy-tailed quantile functions which can effectively tackle the problem of the traditional multi-quantile regression and accurately capture the full conditional distribution information of wind power. In our experiments, two real-world wind power datasets from Australia are utilized to validate the proposed model. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art spatial-temporal models.</description></item><item><title>Robust Learning-Based Model Predictive Control for Wave Energy Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504609</link><description>This paper proposes a robust learning-based model predictive control (MPC) strategy tailored for sea wave energy converters (WECs). The control algorithm aims to maximize power extraction efficiency and maintain the WECs' operational safety over a wide range of sea conditions, subject to system constraints and plant-model mismatches. The theoretical basis is the robust tube-based MPC (RTMPC), enabling WEC system state trajectories to evolve around the noise-free nominal WEC model state trajectories. The disturbances can be bounded by pre-computed uncertainty sets for tightening the WEC's physical constraints to guarantee the constraint satisfaction of an uncertain WEC system. Typically, RTMPC constructs a tube with constant sets of uncertainties, which is likely to be overly conservative and hence potentially degrades energy conversion performance. In this work, a machine learning-based uncertainty set is introduced to dynamically predict and quantify the model uncertainties at each sampling instant, which can effectively enlarge the feasible region of the WEC TMPC control problem. The proposed RTMPC not only ensures improved energy conversion efficiency but also guarantees the operational safety of WECs under uncertain conditions. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed controller.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Short-Term Forecasting of Large Distributed Solar PV Fleets Using Sparse Smart Inverter Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504585</link><description>Ultra-short-term power forecasting for distributed solar photovoltaic (PV) generation is a largely unaddressed, highly challenging problem due to the prohibitive real-time data collection and processing requirements for a sheer number of distributed PV units. In this paper, we propose an innovative idea of forecasting the power output of a large fleet of distributed PV units using limited real-time data of a sparsely selected set of PV units, referred to as pilot units. We develop a two-stage method to address this problem. In the planning stage, we use the K-medoids clustering algorithm to select pilot units for the installation of real-time remote monitoring infrastructure. In the operation stage, we devise a deep learning framework integrating Long Short-Term Memory, Graph Convolutional Network, Multilayer Perceptron to capture the spatio-temporal power generation patterns between pilot units and other units, and forecast the power outputs of all units in a large PV fleet using the real-time data from the few selected pilot units only. Case study results show that our proposed method outperforms all baseline methods in forecasting for power outputs of individual PV units as well as the whole PV fleet, and the forecasting time resolution is not dependent on that of weather data.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Coordination of Networked-Microgrids Toward Decentralized Operation: A Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10505017</link><description>Multiple individual microgrids can be integrated as a networked microgrid system for enhanced technical and economic performance. In this paper, a two-stage data-driven method is proposed to hierarchically coordinate individual microgrids towards decentralized operation in a networked microgrid (NMG) system. The first stage schedules active power outputs of micro-turbines and energy storage systems (ESSs) on an hourly basis for energy balancing and cost minimization, where ESSs are controlled by a local P/SoC droop scheme. In the second stage, the reactive power outputs of PV inverters are dispatched every three minutes based on a Q/V droop controller, aiming to reduce network power losses and regulate the voltage under real-time uncertainties. At offline training stage, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning model is trained to learn an optimal coordination policy, enhanced by a safety model framework. For online application, the trained agent can work locally in a decentralized manner without information exchanges, and the safety model can also be applied to monitor and guide online actions for safety compliance. Numerical test results validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Temperature-Dependent Resistance Constrained PV Accommodation Capacity Improvement Based on Multi-Objective DRL</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10508485</link><description>Against the backdrop of the low-carbon energy transition, distribution system operators face the urgent challenge of balancing the contradictory demands of high photovoltaic (PV) accommodation capacity and low operation cost. Meanwhile, most iteration-based PV accommodation capacity improvement methods are limited by imprecise line resistance and the conflicting relationship between decision efficiency and modeling accuracy. To this end, a two-timescale distribution network dispatching approach based on muti-objective DRL is proposed. This approach is an online decision-making method based on real-time data and robust to temperature-dependent resistance via constructing a two-stage decision-making model based on multi-objective Markov decision process considering the weather factors. Also, the proposed model has a vectorized reward function to assess the trade-off between the economy and accommodation capacity for better operation. A novel multi-objective DRL (MODRL) algorithm based on the tchebycheff norm is proposed, which decomposes the proposed decision-making model into multiple sub-models for learning Pareto optimal policies. Comparative tests on the IEEE 33-bus system validate that the proposed method effectively acquires optimization strategies under varying user preferences to improve economic and PV accommodation capacity. The proposed algorithm obtains more diverse Pareto fronts and high-quality solutions than other state-of-the-art MODRLs.</description></item><item><title>Voltage Regulation Enhanced Hierarchical Coordinated Volt/Var and Volt/Watt Control for Active Distribution Networks With Soft Open Points</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10508977</link><description>The integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) into active distribution networks (ADNs) is essential for reducing carbon emissions but often results in voltage fluctuations and violations. This paper proposes a hierarchical voltage control framework that effectively coordinates diverse controllable devices with various response times in an ADN. The framework comprises three stages: day-ahead scheduling of on-load tap changer (OLTC), intra-day optimization for droop slopes and references for droop controllers in Soft Open Points (SOPs) and distributed generators (DGs), and real-time local voltage regulation. Unlike existing approaches, the proposed approach analytically establishes voltage stability constraints and incorporates them into droop slope optimization for local controllers, mitigating voltage oscillation risks. Additionally, a novel deviation-aware optimization method is developed to calculate optimal voltage references. This method treats the deviations between fixed-point voltages and their references as uncertainties and accounts for their impacts on voltage security through chance-constrained programming. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving voltage regulation performance with guaranteed stability.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Power Forecasting of Wind Farm Cluster Based on Global Information Adaptive Perceptual Graph Convolution Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10521869</link><description>At present, the installed capacity of wind power has increased significantly. Improving the power forecasting accuracy of Wind Farm Cluster (WFC) is of great significance to promote the consumption of renewable energy. How to effectively extract the complex spatio-temporal correlation between wind farms is the key to improve the power forecasting accuracy of WFC. Aiming at the above problems, this paper proposes a short-term WFC power forecasting method based on global information adaptive perception graph convolution. Compared with the traditional static graph structure, this paper designs the construction method of multiple Characteristic Graph Structures (CGSs) according to the correlation between farms. Firstly, a set of calculation methods suitable for Dynamic Correlation Coefficient (DCC) between wind farms is proposed, and according to this method, the dynamic correlation of WFC is described from multiple perspectives to obtain the graph structure at each moment, then, the graph embedding and clustering algorithm are used to obtain multiple CGSs containing key features of WFC. Finally, by establishing an Adaptive Graph Convolution Network (AGCN), the prediction accuracy is improved by graph switching. Compared with the traditional WFC forecasting method, the root mean square error of the proposed forecasting method is reduced by 1.14%&#8211;3.42%.</description></item><item><title>Aerodynamic-Constrained Frequency Response Services Dominated by Distributed Wind Power Generation in Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10522920</link><description>This paper proposes an aerodynamic-constrained frequency response service (FRS) method tailored specifically for active distribution networks (ADNs) which are dominated by distributed wind turbines (DWTs). First, a novel equal energy incremental rate criterion (EEIRC) is derived, based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition, for optimally utilizing the rotor kinetic energy that can enhance the frequency regulation capability of DWTs. Next, considering the coupling characteristics of inverter-side frequency and the wind turbine motion, the necessary and sufficient condition is explored for DWTs to maintain mechanical and electrical coupling (MEC) stability as they respond to ADN frequency deviations. Then, leveraging the Lie derivative and Lyapunov theory, the aerodynamic-constrained model adaptive control (ACMAC) is proposed to enable the frequency response of DWT, adapting the frequency control logic autonomously under significant disturbances to prevent DWT instability. Finally, comprehensive simulations are conducted on the modified IEEE 123-bus system with 100% local wind power generation to validate the effectiveness and superiorities of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Objective Optimization and Stable Operation Control Strategy for Fractional Frequency Transmission System Based on Large Signal Stability Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10528906</link><description>Fractional frequency transmission systems perform well in offshore wind power transmission, yet analyzing the large signal stability of the whole system still remains a significant challenge. Particularly, the absence of optimized stable operation control strategy under large signal disturbances threatens the system's long-term reliability and stability. To tackle the issues, this paper develops the multiple T-S fuzzy model, incorporating equivalent models for offshore wind farms, M3C, and industrial frequency loads, and analyzes stability under large signal disturbances, considering coupling effects and interactions with different frequencies. Furthermore, to address the challenge of system inability to directly transition to a new steady-state point after encountering large signal disturbances, such as load transients, a multi-objective optimization method based on Normalized Boundary Intersection (NBI) is proposed. This method aims to solve the problem by determining one optimal intermediate transition point for the stable operation control strategy. By comprehensively considering stability margins and operational efficiency, the system adopts an optimal operational mode during transient processes to smoothly transition to the target operating point. Finally, simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness of large signal stability analysis findings and the stable operation control strategies.</description></item><item><title>Development and Performance Analysis of Aquila Algorithm Optimized SPV Power Imputation and Forecasting Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10534859</link><description>Solar photovoltaic (SPV) generators play a vital role in the global pursuit of sustainable energy. However, the intermittent nature of SPV generators poses a challenge to power system planning. Accurate long-term SPV power forecasting is essential, but obtaining high-quality training dsecata for many years is cumbersome due to faults in sensors, communication, or databases, leading to missing values. This paper proposes an attention network (AN) for SPV power imputation to address missing historical data. In addition, the SPV power forecasting model using BDLSTM NN is proposed for forecasting the SPV power in the long-term horizon. During training, the weights and biases of the imputation and forecasting models are proposed to be optimized using the Aquila optimization algorithm (AOA). Training and testing results substantiate that the proposed imputation and forecasting models consistently attain superior accuracy with a reduction in training time regardless of the missing rates, climatic patterns, and seasons as compared to benchmark models.</description></item><item><title>Inertia Estimation for Microgrid Considering the Impact of Wind Conditions on Doubly-Fed Induction Generators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10534804</link><description>With wind power penetration increasing, it is crucial to accurately estimate the impact of wind power generation on grid inertia levels. This article proposes a microgrid inertia estimation model with distributed wind power generation, considering the impact of wind conditions on doubly-fed induction generators (DFIG). The frequency response mechanisms of a DFIG-based wind turbine (WT) are investigated across different wind speed zones. A non-synchronous inertia matrix is formulated, accounting for the impact of varying wind speeds. A Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO)-based identification method is proposed for identifying the elements of the inertia matrix. The simulation reveals that the wind speed affects the microgrid inertia response through the turbine speed control. The method can assess the risk of frequency issues and assist in the safe and stable operation of microgrids.</description></item><item><title>An Electrolyzer Model for Power System Operation Optimization Over Broad Temperature Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10463117</link><description>Electrolyzers are recognized as promising equipment to improve power systems' operation flexibility. However, existing electrolyzer models used in power system operation optimization are either nonconvex or inaccurate when operating over a broad temperature range. Hence, this letter proposes an enhanced feasible operational area of electrolyzer (EFOAE) model. The EFOAE model is the first model that is convex and accurate over a broad temperature range (0 $^{\circ }$C&#8211;80 $^{\circ }$C). Therefore, the EFOAE model is favorable for operation optimization of the power systems with high penetration of renewables. Besides, to reduce errors, this letter improves the current electrolyzer feasible operational area derivation method, and removes the infeasible part in EFOAE. Compared with existing narrow temperature range (60 $^{\circ }$C&#8211;80 $^{\circ }$C) electrolyzer models, using EFOAE may release greater flexibility for power systems' operation, thereby reducing costs by 4.6% and wind curtailment by 63% in case studies.</description></item><item><title>Droop Coefficient Design of Wind Turbine Considering Rotor Speed Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10483536</link><description>This letter provides the design rule of the droop coefficient for the power synchronization loop (PSL) based grid-forming wind turbine (WT) considering the transient rotor speed constraints. The dynamic model for PSL-based WT is established first, and it is shown that the larger the droop coefficient, the larger the steady-state rotor speed deviation is. Accordingly, the maximum droop coefficient for ensuring the existence of equilibrium is derived. Finally, with the proper scaling of the transient rotor dynamic equation, the conservative evaluation of the maximum droop coefficient is obtained to make sure the WT does not touch the lower limit of the rotor speed during disturbance.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Wind Turbines and HVDC Power Transmission Lines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10531697</link><description>An innovative scheme for the direct integration of wind turbines into the existing High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission systems without the need for boost power converters and step-up transformers is presented in this article.

Employing electromagnetic transient (EMT) analysis in MGs becomes crucial for controlling the rapid transients. However, this requires an accurate but high-order model of power electronics and their underlying control loops, complexifying the stability analysis from the viewpoint of a higher control level. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a large-signal order reduction (LSOR) method for MGs with considerations of external control inputs and the detailed dynamics of underlying control levels based on singular perturbation theory (SPT). Specially, we innovatively proposed and strictly proved a general stability and accuracy assessment theorem that allows us to analyze the dynamic stability of a full-order nonlinear system by only leveraging our derived reduced-order model (ROM) and boundary layer model (BLM). Furthermore, this theorem furnishes a set of conditions that determine the accuracy of the developed ROM. Finally, by embedding such a theorem into the SPT, we propose a novel LSOR approach with guaranteed accuracy and stability analysis equivalence. Case studies are conducted on MG systems to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Event-Triggered Secondary Frequency Regulation by Sharing HESS Power in Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10413203</link><description>The fluctuated power output of renewable energy sources brings new challenges to frequency control, especially for islanded microgrids with small spinning reserves. However, energy storage systems and widespread flexible loads can be employed to the frequency regulation thanks to their flexibility of power outputs. This paper investigates the frequency regulation problem for islanded microgrids with distributed heterogeneous energy storage systems (HESS) composed of battery energy storage systems (BESS) and building thermal energy storage systems (BTESS). A distributed event-triggered balanced power sharing strategy considering denial of service (DoS) attacks is designed for frequency regulation by allocating HESS power according to BESS state of charge (SoC), BTESS state of temperature (SoT) and their capacities. The range of control parameters for a stable controller are all provided by Lyapunov analysis. Moreover, the frequency feedback control gain for HESS is derived by using linear quadratic regulator. Simulation results show that the proposed frequency regulation strategy can guarantee the recovery of microgrids frequency and the proportional sharing of HESS power. Besides, SoC and SoT balancing with fewer communications are achieved, even with considering various parameters of HESS, such as capacity, efficiency and with communication link failures as well as DoS attacks.</description></item><item><title>Control of AC-AC Interlinking Converters for Multi-Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10416262</link><description>This paper considers the control of AC-AC interlinking converters (ILCs) in a multi-grid network. We overview the control schemes in the literature and propose a passivity framework for the stabilization of multi-grid networks, considering both AC grid-following and AC grid-forming behavior for the ILC connections. We then analyze a range of AC/AC interlinking converter control methods derived from the literature and propose suitable controllers for this purpose including both AC grid-forming and grid-following behavior. The controller we propose is partially grid-forming; in particular, it is based on a combination of a grid-following and a grid-forming converter to improve the stability properties of the network. Simulation results and theoretical analysis confirm that the proposed ILC control designs are appropriate for the multi-grid network.</description></item><item><title>Fuzzy Granulation Interval-Based Fault Diagnosis Method for Ring-Type DC Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10416239</link><description>The lack of relevant protection schemes and standards brings significant challenges to the promotion of direct current microgrid (DCMG) technologies. The existing line fault diagnosis methods usually require additional measuring devices to obtain fault signals. Although reducing the number of sensors can lower the system costs, it also increases the difficulty of diagnosis. Pole-to-pole (PP) and positive pole-to-ground (PPG) fault classification under unknown fault resistance, and negative-to-ground (NPG) fault detection under unobvious positive pole current characteristics are two major difficulties. To solve the above issues, a fuzzy granulation interval (FGI) theory-based line fault diagnosis method is proposed in this paper. Only locally measured bus-side voltage and positive pole current signals shared with the converter controller inputs are required. Firstly, the fault characteristics and diagnosis difficulties are analyzed. Then a new NPG fault index interval range (IR) is designed to extract the abnormal post-fault voltage fluctuations. Moreover, the PP/PPG fault classification strategy is designed according to the interval characteristics and capacitor discharge process. Finally, the performance of the proposed method has been evaluated through MATLAB/Simulink simulations and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately discriminate different line faults within 1.5 ms under different fault conditions.</description></item><item><title>Reliability Evaluation of Pilot Virtual-Mesh FREEDMSs by SST Series and Three-Port Power Hub Parallel Energy Routers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10423828</link><description>Integrating FREEDMS and an energy router help overcome the variability and intermittency of renewable resources for energy Internet development. Due to the developed information technology interconnection approach, energy routers are expanding with more and more multi-port topologies, which can be considered as a point-to-point connection approach. In this paper, another connection approach is proposed. On the other hand, recently, SST (series) and three-port power hub (parallel) approaches as energy routers for FREEDMS have been getting more and more attention. However, the existing literature focusing on the reliability of FREEDMS infrastructures still needs to be addressed. The FREEDMS infrastructure enhances the smart grid&#8217;s reliability and resilience to support power to communities, so its reliability evaluation is critical to determine its superiority. This paper addresses and compares the reliability evaluation of existing energy routers by SSTs and Three-Port Power Hubs. Instead of series one, the Pilot Virtual-Mesh FREEDMS infrastructure and a parallel energy router approach are proposed.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Anti-Icing and De-Icing Coordination Scheme for Resilience Enhancement in Distribution Networks Against Ice Storms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443290</link><description>Ice storms can cause serious damage to power distribution systems, thus the development of effective anti-icing and de-icing strategies is of great significance. In this article, an optimal anti-icing and de-icing coordinated operation scheme is proposed to enhance the resilience of distribution systems against ice storms, which is based on the ice-melting capacity of distribution lines. Firstly, a comprehensive risk analysis for anti-icing and de-icing in ice storms is provided. Then, a novel critical condition for anti-icing initiation is proposed based on the weather forecast deviation and potential load loss in distribution systems. On this basis, the coordinated optimization model for anti-icing and de-icing in distribution networks with intelligent soft open point and energy storage systems is established, aims at minimizing the overall load loss. Considering the double risk of overloading anti-icing and de-icing methods, the power flow limit violation function is used in the optimization model to reasonably allocate the proportion of various risks. Finally, the proposed method is verified in the IEEE 33-node distribution network.</description></item><item><title>A Coordinated Emergency Response Scheme for Electricity and Watershed Networks Considering Spatio-Temporal Heterogeneity and Volatility of Rainstorm Disasters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10422813</link><description>This paper proposes a coordinated emergency response scheme for the secure operation and mutual coordination of electricity-watershed networks under spatio-temporal heterogeneity and volatility of rainstorms. The risk interdependencies of water flooding and power outages across power distribution networks (PDNs) and watershed networks (WSNs) are formulated, and a rainstorm-triggered failure model is proposed to quantify the potential spatio-temporal outage risk of PDNs and WSNs. A hyperplane transformation based partition method is developed to extract the uneven spatial distribution and temporal variability of rainfalls. Then, a coupled electricity-watershed network model derived from Saint-Venant partial differential equations (PDEs) is formed to describe the load flow of PDNs and nonuniform hydrodynamic processes of WSNs under compounding impacts of rainstorm variability and failure occurrences. Furthermore, an optimal joint scheduling strategy is proposed to coordinate the dynamic PDN reconfiguration and WSN pump cluster drainage. In order to reduce the computational burden of original PDE-constrained emergency optimization problem, a progressive hedging-based accelerated solution algorithm combined with multiple equivalent linearization techniques is presented. Comparative results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in reducing load shedding and mitigating flood damage losses.</description></item><item><title>Two-Stage Optimal Dispatch of Electricity-Natural Gas Networks Considering Natural Gas Pipeline Leakage and Linepack</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10439984</link><description>The interdependence of electricity and natural gas networks (ENGNs) has led to increased complexity and competing interests among stakeholders. In the event of a leakage failure in a natural gas pipeline, the changes in pipeline parameters pose significant challenges to the optimization and dispatch of natural gas and power grid supply systems. Hence, it would be difficult to simultaneously coordinate the respective interests and reduce the loss of load in the power grid. This paper first presents a natural gas pipeline flow model that accounts for pipeline leakage and linepack, followed by a two-stage dispatch to optimize the benefits for both electricity and natural gas suppliers, where the optimal dispatch with the worst-case scenario is linearized through mixed-integer programming (MIP). Then, a joint solution model for leakage rate and linepack is established based on the macropore leakage model and the dispatch of natural gas suppliers, considering the impact of natural gas flow rate changes on leakage parameters. The actual natural gas supply and the two-stage optimal dispatch are obtained by using the column-and constraint generation (C&amp;amp;CG) method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage optimal dispatch improves the power supply reliability and offers promising economic prospects for ENGNs, where the accuracy of power grid dispatch is significantly improved considering the natural gas pipeline leakage and linepack.</description></item><item><title>Defining and Characterizing Resilient Region of Interdependent Gas and Power Networks Under Extreme Events</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478308</link><description>With the increasing interconnection between gas and power networks, a small fraction of failed components caused by extreme events may trigger widespread cascading failures in an interdependent gas and power network (IGPN). A question of practical interest is how many initially failed components could break down the whole network, which can help us determine the condition for the collapse of the system. Considering that, the resilient region defined by the expected minimal fraction of initially failed components to break down the system is proposed for IGPNs to analyze the system resilience from a macroscopic perspective. To determine the resilient region, an innovative model is proposed based on the combination of percolation theory (that has been widely used in complex science) and statistical physics methods. Specifically, initial stochastic disturbances are simulated by a percolation model which progressively removes failed components from the network, and the percolation threshold (i.e., a critical fraction of failed components breaking down the network) is used as a statistical indicator for the system collapse conditions. On this basis, the boundaries of resilient regions can be characterized by the curves of the percolation threshold, and the corresponding resilience indices are developed. Considering the realistic failure propagation behaviors triggered by initial disturbances, a flow heterogeneity-driven cascading failure (FHCF) model is proposed, by which the resilient region can be computed numerically. Besides, criticality metrics are proposed to evaluate the influence of each component on the resilient region. Finally, the effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on two test IGPNs, and measures to enhance the resilience of IPGNs are concluded.</description></item><item><title>Improving the Load Flexibility of Stratified Electric Water Heaters: Design and Experimental Validation of MPC Strategies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10436431</link><description>Residential electric water heaters have significant load shifting capabilities due to their thermal heat capacity and large energy consumption. Model predictive control (MPC) has been shown to be an effective control strategy to enable water heater load shifting in home energy management systems. In this work, we analyze how modeling tank stratification in an MPC formulation impacts control performance for stratified electric water heaters under time-of-use (TOU) rates. Specifically, we propose an MPC formulation based on a three-node thermal model that captures tank stratification, and compare it to a one-node formulation that does not capture stratification and a standard thermostatic controller. These strategies are compared through both real-time laboratory testing and simulation-based evaluation for different water use patterns. Laboratory experiments show cost reductions of 12.3&#8211;23.2% for the one-node MPC and 31.2&#8211;42.5% for the three-node MPC relative to the thermostatic controller. The performance of the one-node MPC is limited by significant plant-model mismatch, while the three-node formulation better approximates real-world dynamics and results in much more effective cost reduction and load shifting. A simple analysis of how each strategy performs under water use forecast errors is also provided.</description></item><item><title>A Risk Diversification Strategy for Integrated Demand Response Under Imperfect Rationality</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10444038</link><description>Integrated demand response (IDR) is acknowledged as a cost-effective and low-carbon tool that helps alleviate imbalances between energy supply and demand in energy systems. However, the imperfect rationality of consumers can lead to a series of new issues, such as cognitive characteristics of bounded rationality as well as irrationality, subjective uncertainty, and correlated risks. This paper proposes an improved consumer model by using a dynamic subjective weight function with a rationality degree indicator to cope with cognitive characteristics, coupled with a deduced skew distribution modelling the subjective uncertainty. Besides, MESP model is also improved to deal with the correlated risks by managing the diversification level of risks that is defined based on Shannon entropy. The mathematical formulation of the proposed model is expressed as a bi-level stochastic optimization problem, which is equivalently converted into a single-objective optimization problem to be solved efficiently. Simulation results validate advantages of our model in enhancing the accuracy of consumer behavior prediction, effectiveness of incentive strategies, diversification level of response risks, which contributes to achieve a win-win situation between consumers and MESP by decreasing not only total response power deviation as well as cumulative response risks of MESP but also consumer&#8217;s discomfort level.</description></item><item><title>Analytical Fault Modeling of Droop-Controlled IIDG and its Cluster</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10409553</link><description>Fault modeling of inverter-interfaced distributed generators (IIDGs) is the basis of power system fault calculation and protection scheme design. Due to its inherent properties and flexible control strategy, analyzing the transient-state fault responses of droop-controlled IIDG is difficult, and an analytical fault model has yet to be proposed. This work establishes a controlled voltage source-based fault equivalent model of droop-controlled IIDG in synchronous reference frame to address this research gap. The impacts of droop characteristics, virtual impedance, double-closed-loop controller, current limiting, and low-voltage-ride-through requirements are all considered, and the obtained model can cover both the transient- and steady-state fault responses. An IIDG clustering method based on the equivalent admittance matrix of the grid is also proposed, which lays the groundwork for model reduction. A corresponding model aggregation method is then provided. With this, the complexity of fault analysis for peer-to-peer controlled distributed power systems can be significantly reduced. The scheme proposed in this paper is verified by simulation experiments in PSCAD/EMTDC software.</description></item><item><title>Agri-Energy-Environment Synergy-Based Distributed Energy Planning in Rural Areas</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10430377</link><description>Rural passive distribution networks can no longer meet the modern agricultural electrification and cleanliness requirements, and it is urgent to carry out distributed energy planning construction in rural areas. This paper studies the theoretical and methodological aspects of distributed energy planning in rural areas considering crop growth mechanisms. In light of the effects of agricultural load control on agricultural production, we have created a facility-based agricultural load control model rooted in crop physiological ecology. The proposed model encompasses electric irrigation, high-pressure sodium lighting and heating loads. In response to the impact of agricultural load control on carbon emissions in the energy system, carbon cycling within the agricultural and energy systems has been analyzed and modeled. Considering the significant differences in greenhouse load requirements at different growth stages of different crops, the distributed energy planning model is established based on representative daily profiles that reflect typical crop growth patterns. The proposed model constraints encompass constraints related to the healthy growth of crops and constraints within the energy system, with the optimization goal set to minimize the 15-year planning cost. We validate the planning model by applying it to a case study involving a rural energy system in Hebei Province, China, with an annual electricity consumption of 5,600,376 kWh. The adoption of this model led to a cost reduction of  $7.3\times 10^{{ 5}}$  CNY compared to conventional planning methods. The collaborative synergy between agriculture, energy, and the environment manifested in an annual carbon reduction benefit (ACRB) of  $1.7\times 10^{{ 4}}$ CNY from photovoltaic generation and an ACRB of  $1.2\times 10^{{ 4}}$  CNY from greenhouse gas absorption.</description></item><item><title>A Bandwidth-Conscious Event-Based Control Approach to Secondary Frequency Regulation Under Vehicle-to-Grid Service</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433821</link><description>This paper addresses the problem of communication resource-efficient secondary frequency regulation of power grids under vehicle-to-grid supplementary service. First, an event-based frequency regulation framework is established for power grids incorporated with electric vehicle (EV) participation, enabling system performance analysis and control design under event-based communication. The framework also takes into account the EV aggregator dynamics with battery charging/discharging processes under practical travel demands. Second, a novel resource-efficient event-based broadcast mechanism (REBM) is developed for intelligent transmissions of command signals from the dispatch center to the power plant and distributed EV aggregators. By deciding the broadcast actions with the particular consideration of the real-time bandwidth occupancy, the designed REBM is capable to flexibly adapt the command transmission rate to variable network status. Then, a co-design approach to the desired REBM and frequency controller is derived, based on which an implementation algorithm is provided for achieving satisfying secondary frequency regulation performance with enhanced communication efficiency. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed approach is verified through comparative case studies.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Planning of Standalone Net-Zero Energy Systems With Small Modular Reactors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433761</link><description>Renewable-based standalone systems are widely developed worldwide with the decentralization of power and energy systems. However, challenges are posed due to the intermittent nature of renewable resources and the lack of inertia. Small modular reactors (SMRs), a clean but also flexible and controllable energy, can be deployed to provide flexibility and inertia support to standalone energy systems with high penetration of renewable energy. In this paper, we propose a novel standalone net-zero energy system planning scheme that coordinates SMRs with other distributed energy resources, where both steady-state operation constraints and dynamic frequency security constraints are considered to guarantee the operational feasibility of the plan. Since the dynamics of SMR are very complex, the planning model becomes a complex and unanalytical optimization problem. To this end, we first develop a physics-informed data-driven approach to model the dynamic frequency characteristics of SMRs with high accuracy. On this basis, we propose a &#8220;checking and adjusting&#8221; heuristic approach to iteratively solve a series of MILP problems without the non-linear and unanalytical frequency constraint and then check whether the constraint can be satisfied. In this way, we can get a feasible and suboptimal solution in a tractable manner. Comprehensive case studies have been conducted, and results show that the inclusion of SMRs can substantially increase the flexibility and frequency security of standalone net-zero energy systems.</description></item><item><title>Joint Planning of Utility-Owned Distributed Energy Resources in an Unbalanced Active Distribution Network Considering Asset Health Degradation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10436425</link><description>Rapid integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) in active distribution networks (ADNs) necessitates advanced planning methods to optimally determine the size, site, and installation time of DERs. However, existing approaches often assume balanced networks and neglect health degradation of DER assets, limiting the accuracy and practicality of the planning results. This paper proposes a new planning method for utility-owned distributed generators (DGs) and energy storage systems (ESSs) in an unbalanced ADN considering asset health degradation. First, the three-phase branch flow is modeled for unbalanced characteristics of ADNs, and host DERs separately in different phases. Then, based on the Wiener degradation process, the aging path of each DG unit is modeled to estimate its available capacity along with service time; the ESS aging is modeled to reflect the degradation cost during charging and discharging. Finally, a copula-based stochastic programming method is presented considering the correlations between renewables and power demands. The inclusion of market volatility in electricity price uncertainty further enhances planning realism. Numerical case studies on an IEEE-34 bus three-phase ADN demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>MADP-Based Explicit Online Operation Policy for Robust Energy Management of ADN</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10453347</link><description>This paper proposes a multiparametric approximate dynamic programming (MADP)-based explicit online operation policy for the robust energy management problem of active distribution network (ADN). First, the online energy management problem is described from the perspective of distributionally robust optimization (DRO). Then, the risk-averse concept is introduced to quantitatively control the conservativeness of DRO. Considering that it is a complex online optimal problem, which is intractable for traditional algorithms, an MADP-based explicit online operation policy is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm is improved based on the multiparametric programming theory, according to which an explicit online operation policy can be further derived. Compared to traditional online decision-making policies, which need to execute an optimization program, the proposed policy is able to directly obtain solutions through an explicit expression. In this way, the calculation efficiency can be enhanced significantly. Cases on several test systems validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Interaction Dynamics Analysis and Active Stabilization of a Weak Grid-Tied Hybrid PV-Wind Power Generator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10466715</link><description>This paper addresses the dynamic stability of a hybrid photovoltaic (PV) and wind turbine (WT) system tied to a weak grid by back-to-back voltage-source converters (VSCs). The overall system stability is assessed by developing a detailed time-domain nonlinear model (TDNLM) and a linearized state-space model (LSSM). The dynamic interactions at both the peak-power point (PPP) and off-PPP operation of the PV and WT power characteristics curves have been examined. The results reveal that the complete system is stable under PV-only and WT-only generation scenarios at the PPP and off-PPP operation regions. However, the PV-WT hybrid system experiences low- and high-frequency fluctuation instabilities in the current-limited region (CLR) of the PV characteristic due to the interaction between the high dynamic resistances of the PV-WT source and the weak grid. Conversely, the system remains stable at the PPP and voltage-limited region (VLR) of the PV characteristic and in all operational regions of the WT characteristic. Motivated by these challenges, a novel active damping method is proposed to mitigate the interaction dynamics, maintaining overall system stability by relocating unstable eigenmodes and reshaping the dc-link transfer function. The proposed damping method offers several benefits: 1) it is simple yet efficient and can be implemented and modeled using linear analysis tools; 2) it allows for dynamic and stable operation across various operating regions; 3) it does not interfere with steady-state performance in both stiff and weak grid operations; 4) it facilitates successful low-voltage-ride-through (LVRT) at different operating regions; and 5) it effectively addresses its shortcomings by eliminating the need for additional voltage or current sensors, thereby enhancing simplicity and reducing cost in comparison to other approaches. Detailed offline and real-time simulations validate the analytical findings and the effectiveness of the proposed stabilization method under different operational scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Clusters Supported Bi-Level Control System With Lower Communication Requirements for a Distribution Network With Distributed Battery and Photovoltaic Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475702</link><description>This paper proposes a bi-level control framework for dynamic microgrid clusters in a distribution network with distributed photovoltaic and battery storage systems. The proposed bi-level control framework comprises interactive secondary and tertiary level control systems. A distributed event-triggered mechanism is proposed for the secondary level control of each dynamic microgrid cluster to achieve frequency and voltage regulation and balancing of the state of charge of battery storage systems within the cluster. At the tertiary level, a receding horizon model predictive control is implemented to minimize transmission power losses and battery storage systems losses by providing optimal battery storage systems output powers and the voltage source converters output voltages, with a one-minute interval. The secondary level control is modified to implement the optimal solutions provided by the tertiary level model predictive control. Furthermore, the secondary level distributed event-triggered control minimizes unnecessary data transmission by introducing a time delay, resulting in a reduced communication burden. The proposed bi-level control framework is validated in real-time on a modified IEEE 13-node test feeder using RTDS with the tertiary level model predictive control solved on a computer via the hardware-in-loop method.</description></item><item><title>A Contextually Supervised Optimization-Based HVAC Load Disaggregation Methodology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10440142</link><description>This paper presents a novel contextually supervised optimization-based approach for disaggregating heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) loads using smart meter or Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition data. To disaggregate the load into HVAC loads, large and infrequently used loads (LIUL), and base loads, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize a set of five loss terms, consisting of the reconstruction errors of the overall load profile, the ramp rate losses, and three distinct loss functions linked with the HVAC load, base load, and LIUL, respectively. To enhance accuracy, we incorporate two forms of contextual information into the problem formulation. First, we utilize mutual information to estimate HVAC energy consumption. Second, we employ a base load dictionary to constrain HVAC load estimation errors. The obtained HVAC load profiles are fine-tuned by abnormal ramp detection followed by binary hypothesis testing. The proposed method is developed and tested using sub-metered residential and commercial building data. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods across various data resolutions and load aggregation levels, showing excellent transferability and generalizability.</description></item><item><title>Electric Vehicles Charging Time Constrained Deliverable Provision of Secondary Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10411057</link><description>Aggregation of electric vehicles (EVs) is a promising technique for providing secondary frequency regulation (SFR) in highly renewable energy-penetrated power systems. Equipped with energy storage devices, EV aggregation can provide reliable SFR. However, the main challenge is to guarantee reliable intra-interval SFR capacities and inter-interval delivery following the automatic generation control (AGC) signal. Furthermore, aggregated EV SFR provision will be further complicated by the EV charging time anxiety because SFR provision might extend EV&#8217;s charging time. This paper proposes a deliverable EV SFR provision with a charging-time-constrained control strategy. First, a charging-time-constrained EV aggregation is proposed to address the uncertainty of EV capacity based on the state-space model considering the charging-time restriction of EV owners. Second, a real-time economic dispatch and time domain simulation (RTED-TDS) cosimulation framework is proposed to verify financial results and the dynamic performance of the EV SFR provision. Last, the proposed charging time-constrained EV aggregation is validated on the IEEE 39-bus system. The results demonstrate that with charging time-constrained EV aggregation, the dynamic performance of the system can be improved with a marginal increase in total cost. More importantly, the charging time constraint can be respected in the proposed SFR provision of the EV aggregation.</description></item><item><title>An Enhanced SD-GS-AL Algorithm for Coordinating the Optimal Power and Traffic Flows With EVs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10415053</link><description>The electric power distribution network (PDN) and the transportation network (TN) are generally operated/coordinated by different entities. However, they are coupled through electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs). This paper proposes to coordinate the operation of the two systems via a fully decentralized framework where the PDN and TN operators solve their own operation problems independently, with only limited information exchange. Nevertheless, the operation problems of both systems are generally mixed-integer programs (MIP), for which mature algorithms like the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) may not guarantee convergence. This paper applies a novel distributed optimization algorithm called the SD-GS-AL method, which is a combination of the simplicial decomposition, gauss-seidel, and augmented Lagrangian, which can guarantee convergence and optimality for MIPs. However, the original SD-GS-AL may be computationally inefficient for solving a complex engineering problem like the PDN-TN coordinated optimization investigated in this paper. To improve the computational efficiency, an enhanced SD-GS-AL method is proposed by redesigning the inner loop of the algorithm, which can automatically and intelligently determine the iteration number of the inner loop. Simulations on the test cases show the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed framework and algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Graph Reinforcement Learning for Carbon-Aware Electric Vehicles in Power-Transport Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10415871</link><description>Transitioning towards a low-carbon future necessitates massive efforts from both the transport and power sectors. Electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as a promising approach to realize this objective, leveraging their smart routing strategies and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) techniques. Previous studies have addressed various challenges in EV routing and scheduling through model-based optimization methods while ignoring the system uncertainties and dynamics. This paper focuses on studying the carbon-aware EV joint routing and scheduling problem within a coupled power-transport network that can enable EV recharging behaviors within the transport network while concurrently delivering carbon-intensity services within the power network. Specifically, a carbon emission flow model is introduced as a mechanism for tracing and calculating the nodal carbon intensity signals tailored for EVs to provide their carbon services. To solve this problem, we propose a model-free multi-agent reinforcement learning method that harnesses graph convolutional networks to capture essential network features and employs a parameter-sharing framework to learn large-scale control policies. The efficacy and scalability of the proposed method in achieving cost-effective and low-carbon transitions are verified through case studies involving two power-transport networks with 100 and 1,000 EVs, respectively.</description></item><item><title>DiffCharge: Generating EV Charging Scenarios via a Denoising Diffusion Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10418170</link><description>Recent proliferation of electric vehicle (EV) charging load has imposed vital stress on power grid. The stochasticity and volatility of EV charging behaviors render it challenging to manipulate the uncertain charging demand for grid operations and charging management. Charging scenario generation can serve for future EV integration by modeling charging load uncertainties and simulating various realistic charging sessions. To this end, we propose a denoising Diffusion-based Charging scenario generation model coined DiffCharge, which is capable of yielding both battery-level and station-level EV charging time-series data with distinct temporal properties. In principle, the devised model can progressively convert the simply known Gaussian noise to genuine charging demand profiles by learning a parameterized reversal of the forward diffusion process. Besides, we leverage the multi-head self-attention mechanism and prior conditions to capture the unique temporal correlations associated with battery or charging station types in actual charging dynamics. Moreover, we validate the superior generative capacity of DiffCharge on a real-world dataset involving ample charging session records, and attest the efficacy of produced charging scenarios on a practical EV operation problem in the day-ahead electricity market.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Dynamic Pricing of Fast Charging Stations Considering Bounded Rationality of Users and Market Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10423379</link><description>Electric vehicles (EVs), as popular transportation carriers and flexible electric loads, couple both the power distribution networks and transportation networks. The pricing schemes of fast charging stations significantly affects the EVs&#8217; on-tirp charging behaviors and the operations of coupled power and transportation networks. This interdisciplinary paper proposes an optimal dynamic pricing method for fast charging stations to boost charging network operator&#8217; (CNO&#8217;s) profits and avoid excessive charging costs of EVs. Time-varying traffic flow and charging demands are generated by a dynamic traffic assignment simulation, where a boundedly rational dynamic user equilibrium model is presented to capture the cost sensitivity of EVs and gasoline vehicle users. Additionally, a market regulator supervises the CNO&#8217;s pricing, balancing the interests of the CNO and users via a regulation constraint. To address the optimal dynamic pricing issue, we propose a three-level Stackelberg game involving the distribution network operator, CNO, and users. The existence of a game equilibrium is assured by the fixed-point theory. A Gauss-Seidel iteration algorithm with inertia weight is designed to solve the pricing problem. The numerical results have corroborated the effectiveness of the proposed method, illuminating the effects of bounded rationality and market regulation on the CNO&#8217;s profits and users&#8217; travel costs.</description></item><item><title>A Robust V2G Voltage Control Scheme for Distribution Networks Against Cyber Attacks and Customer Interruptions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433072</link><description>A decent vehicle-to-grid (V2G) control scheme improves voltage stability and grid reliability of distribution networks (DNs) by providing reactive power and ancillary services. However, unknown malicious attacks in cyber layers and uncertain EV charging/unplugging in physical layers will disturb the measurement process, leading to controller parameters&#8217; mismatching and severe voltage violations. This paper proposes a robust V2G voltage control scheme for DNs investigating cyber attacks and EV customer interruptions. Firstly, the impact of cyber attacks is characterized by time-varying uncertain matrices function with Lebesgur measurable elements, while the EV customer interruptions are represented by Signum variables. Then, a new state-space equation for V2G voltage control in DNs is constructed by incorporating above matrices function and Signum variables. Moreover, a robust voltage controller is proposed for measurement disordered V2G systems to suppress voltage violations while achieving  $H_{\infty }$  performance. By utilizing linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques, sufficient conditions for system closed-loop exponentially mean-square stability and the controller parameter tuning are presented. Case studies conducted on modified IEEE European low voltage test feeder compare two voltage deviation indices of the proposed controller with those of existing methods, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed approach against measurement anomalies.</description></item><item><title>Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional-Based Recurrent Network for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Demand Forecasting in Energy Market</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10445239</link><description>The increasing adoption of electric vehicles has led to new and unpredictable load conditions for electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs), making charging demand forecasting important to the profitable deployment of EVCSs. Although existing spatial-temporal forecasting models have made significant progress, they ignore the realistic topologies of EVCS networks and the influence of external interference on charging demand. Moreover, limited research exists on developing forecasting models from the perspective of EVCSs participating in the energy market. This paper proposes a novel parallel-structured spatiotemporal mutual residual graph convolution-combined bi-long short-term memory for predicting the charging demand of EVCSs. First, a new mutual adjacency matrix considering both the static and dynamic attributes of EVCSs is constructed. This matrix is then combined with graph convolution and residual blocks to capture multi-level spatial dependencies and map relations between nodes and external factors. Second, to address temporal dependencies, CBi-LSTM combining Bi-LSTM with an additional predictor that considers day-type tendency features is developed. Finally, a parallel structure is adopted to obtain the final prediction results and preserve the integrity of spatiotemporal dependencies. Case studies validated the performance of the proposed model, which demonstrated high forecasting accuracy and the potential for profitable application in the energy market.</description></item><item><title>Resilient Resource Allocations for Multi-Stage Transportation-Power Distribution System Operations in Hurricanes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10445529</link><description>The resilience of distribution networks (DNs) or transportation networks (TNs) has attracted a wide attention due to the frequent occurrence of extreme natural disasters. However, the existing works usually investigate the resilience of two systems independently, which neglects their coordinated operations. This paper models the interactions of DNs and TNs and coordinates multiple resilience enhancement strategies to make a more cost-effective resource allocation scheme for the operation of transportation-power distribution networks (TDNs) in hurricanes. Specifically, resource allocations and TDN operations are designed as a two-stage mixed-integer stochastic programming (TMISP) model, where the first stage is to make resource allocation decisions before the hurricane strikes, and the second stage is to perform multi-stage resilience enhancement strategies to minimize the expected TDN operational losses. The uncertain TDN outages with defensive resources in hurricanes are modeled as decision-dependent uncertainties, which are decoupled into decision-independent uncertainties for generating TDN outage scenarios. A comprehensive scenario reduction method is utilized to reduce the redundancies in simulated scenarios. The penalty-based Gauss-Seidel approach is combined with a scenario-skip technique to solve the TMISP problem with binary variables in both stages. Numerical simulations show that the proposed solution methods provide superior performances in computational efficiency and accuracy, over the traditional scenario reduction and scenario-wise decomposition algorithms in solving the TMISP problem. The investment efficiency is increased with the coordination of various DN and TN resources and multiple resilience enhancement strategies, compared with those of separate allocation schemes.</description></item><item><title>Market-Level Integrated Detection Against Cyber Attacks in Real-Time Market Operations by Self-Supervised Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10426800</link><description>The increasing integration of information and communication technologies into power grids makes the coupling between cyber and physical power system operations intricate. Along with the deregulation of energy markets, there is an increased potential opportunity for cyber attacks, challenging the effectiveness of current cyber protection methods. In a real-time electricity market, attackers can utilize various kinds of cyber attacks to cause significant financial losses and create catastrophic consequences for grid operations. Therefore, detecting cyber attacks in the real-time market is crucial. However, most of the existing detection methods are primarily designed to identify a single type of attack. Furthermore, there is a scarcity of research focused on developing market-level detection methods against cyber attacks based on market-level behaviors. To fill the above gap, in this paper a novel self-supervised learning based method is proposed to detect multiple types of cyber attacks by analyzing real-time locational marginal prices (RTLMPs) data. Specifically, an autoencoder-enhanced generative adversarial network (GAN)-based method is proposed to examine the spatial-temporal correlations of RTLMPs, and determine whether the RTLMPs are compromised by the attackers or not. Finally, Midcontinent Independent System Operator data are employed for case studies, and simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed data-driven method.</description></item><item><title>Risk-Sensitive Mobile Battery Energy Storage System Control With Deep Reinforcement Learning and Hybrid Risk Estimation Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10415092</link><description>The mobile battery energy storage systems (MBESS) utilize flexibility in temporal and spatial to enhance smart grid resilience and economic benefits. Recently, the high penetration of renewable energy increases the volatility of electricity prices and gives MBESS an opportunity for price difference arbitrage. However, the strong randomness of both the traffic system and renewable energy leads to difficulty in achieving profit with acceptable risk. To address this problem, this paper proposes a risk-sensitive MBESS control framework based on safe deep reinforcement learning, which can constrain the risk under a certain level according to the company&#8217;s risk preference. The risk-estimation safe deep deterministic policy gradient (RE-SDDPG) algorithm is proposed to learn the optimal policy under the premise of lacking direct risk signals. Moreover, a hybrid risk estimation method is proposed to avoid local convergence caused by inaccurate estimation during the learning process. Last, a parameter-sharing method is applied to increase learning efficiency by sharing the Q networks&#8217; parameters. The proposed methods are tested in the IEEE 30-bus system. The results show that the proposed method can keep the profit at a relatively high level while reducing the risk and increase learning efficiency compared with existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Cyber-Resilience of Power Systems&#8217; AGC Sensor Data by Time Series to Image Domain Encoding</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10418545</link><description>The shift to wide area networks (WANs) in power systems has introduced security challenges. While research has focused on attack detection, adversaries can outsmart even advanced anomaly detectors. Further, existing techniques fail to ensure data confidentiality, exposing telemetered data to eavesdropping. To address these evolving threats, we propose a novel framework to enhance power system data communication security over WANs. This innovative approach combines time series to image transformation, digital watermarking, and machine learning. These elements collaboratively encode sensor data into an unintelligible format, maintaining operational impact. We begin by converting time-series data into images with the Gramian Angular Field algorithm. These images are subtly embedded with invisible watermarks. The framework introduces an additional security layer to detect image tampering during communication. Using an Autoencoder-Support Vector Regression model, we restore the watermarked images to the original time series. Notably, the watermarking method is system-independent, maintains sensor data confidentiality, and certifies data integrity. In time-critical power system operations, traditional encryption and authentication can introduce latency. The proposed approach minimizes computational overhead and ensures real-time responsiveness, effectively securing power system data communications. To demonstrate the proposed framework&#8217;s effectiveness, experiments were conducted on the IEEE-39 bus system&#8217;s Automatic Generation Control system.</description></item><item><title>Data Protection Method Against Cross-Domain Inference Threat in Cyber&#8211;Physical Power Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10423301</link><description>Recent advancement of data-driven methods has enabled the mining of associations among various data sets, particularly those generated from cyber-physical power grids (CPPG) where different measurements may be inherently coupled by an underlying system. As such, attackers may infer sensitive parameters jointly from several publicly shared electricity data across different security domains based on their revealed associations. Traditional data protection methods, mainly focusing on reducing the risks of direct data probing, may not be applicable to properly guard sensitive information in such scenarios. In this paper, we elaborate on such a data security issue, namely cross-domain inference (CDI), and then propose the decoder-ensemble variational autoencoder (DE-VAE) which is used for noise-adding to protect against such attack. The DE-VAE is designed with a mutual information maximization scheme to preserve the original usability of the noise-added data. Meanwhile, a multi-objective optimization is solved to achieve a trade-off between privacy protection and data usability. Our protection method is evaluated on experiments involving four real-world scenarios in the modern sensor-rich smart power grid. The experimental results show that our method can provide effective protection ability against CDI threats without sacrificing much usability, and achieves a performance gain of more than 45% compared to several non-trivial baselines.</description></item><item><title>DAMGAT-Based Interpretable Detection of False Data Injection Attacks in Smart Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433005</link><description>False data injection attacks (FDIAs) significantly disrupt the secure operation of smart grids by manipulating the measured values collected by intelligent instruments. Existing studies have utilized deep learning techniques to enhance the detection of FDIAs, however, these studies often overlook the spatial correlation between power grid topology and measurement data. Meanwhile, the high complexity of deep neural network severely impedes the interpretability of detection models, resulting in the incredibility of detection results. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes an interpretable deep learning FDIAs detection method, named dual-attention multi-head graph attention network, DAMGAT. The DAMGAT introduces a dual-attention mechanism that incorporates both node feature attention and spatial topology attention into a multi-head graph attention network. This mechanism efficiently aggregates attack characteristics and spatial topology information by dynamically capturing the potential correlations between FDIAs detection and measurement data. Furthermore, the proposed model can provide clear and credible interpretations for high-accuracy detection results via analyzing features and spatial topology attention weights. Extensive simulations are performed using the IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus test systems. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art FDIA detection methods in terms of accuracy, while also providing reasonable interpretability for features and spatial dimensions.</description></item><item><title>FDI Attack Estimation and Event-Triggered Resilient Control of DC Microgrids Under Hybrid Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443300</link><description>In this paper, false-data-injection (FDI) attack estimation and event-triggered resilient control of DC microgrid (DC-MG) systems under FDI and denial-of-service (DoS) hybrid attacks are studied. In order to describe more general DoS attack characteristics, a time-constrained DoS attack (TCDA) model is established. This model only requires attack duration information compared to the classic DoS model. Based on the above TCDA model, a new event-based switching DC-MG system model with FDI attack compensation is established by using pulse observer, event-triggered mechanism and switching state feedback control law. In addition, by using the piecewise time-varying Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method related to the attack parameters, the sufficient conditions for the exponential stability of the closed-loop system are given. More importantly, a joint design scheme of event-based state feedback controller and FDI observer is proposed to realize FDI attack estimation and event-triggered resilient control under hybrid attacks of DC-MG. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed joint design scheme is demonstrated through the experimental study of DC-MG with two constant power loads.</description></item><item><title>A Monolithic Cybersecurity Architecture for Power Electronic Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443303</link><description>Power electronic systems (PES) face significant threats from various data availability and integrity attacks, significantly affecting the performance of communication networks and power system operation. As a result, several attack detection and reconstruction techniques are deployed, which makes it a costly &amp; complex cybersecurity operational platform with significant room for incremental extensions for mitigation against future threats. Unlike the said traditional arrangements, our paper introduces a foundational approach by establishing a monolithic cybersecurity architecture (MCA) via incorporating semantic principles into the sampling process for distributed energy resources (DERs). This unified approach concurrently compensates for the intrusion challenges posed by cyber attacks by reconstructing signals using the dynamics of the inner control layer. This reconstruction considers essential semantic attributes, like Priority, Freshness, and Relevance to ensure resilient dynamic performance. Hence, the proposed scheme promises a generalized route to concurrently tackle a global set of cyber attacks in elevating the resilience of PES. Finally, rigorous validation on a modified IEEE 69-bus distribution system and a real-world South California Edison (SCE) 47-bus network, using OPAL-RT under diverse operating conditions, underscores its robustness, model-free design capability, scalability, and adaptability to dynamic cyber graphs and system reconfiguration.</description></item><item><title>Wide Area Measurement-Based Cyber-Attack-Resilient Breaker Failure Protection Scheme</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10458870</link><description>Breaker Failure Protection trips the backup breakers when the primary breaker fails, causing a significant loss of load. Hence, a cyber-attack on the Breaker Failure Protection scheme may lead to major disturbance in a power system. Currently, there is a lack of literature addressing the cyber-attack on Breaker Failure Protection scheme. This paper proposes a novel Wide Area Measurement-based cyber-attack-resilient Breaker Failure Protection scheme. Modern digital relays have Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) integrated with them. A digital relay with PMU functionality is called Relay-PMU in this work. The proposed scheme has two parts. Part 1 is named as Synchrophasor-based Fault Validation Algorithm. It checks whether the Breaker Failure Protection operation is genuine or due to a cyber-attack. Breaker Failure Protection Relay-PMU will trigger the Part 1 of the proposed scheme which runs in a Phasor Data Concentrator. A novel concept named Dynamic Relay White-listing is proposed to avoid the usage of phasors from the susceptible Relay-PMUs. Part 2 is the modifications to the logics of the existing common Breaker Failure Protection schemes to incorporate the decision from the Synchrophasor-based Fault Validation Algorithm. The proposed scheme is computationally efficient and compatible with all common Breaker Failure Protection schemes. PSCAD simulations of the IEEE-118 bus system validate the proposed scheme. The execution time of the proposed scheme in the lab implementation setup adheres to the timeline of the Breaker Failure Protection scheme.</description></item><item><title>Customized Load Profiles Synthesis for Electricity Customers Based on Conditional Diffusion Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10438078</link><description>Customers&#8217; load profiles are critical resources to support data analytics applications in modern power systems. However, there are usually insufficient historical load profiles for data analysis, due to the collection cost and data privacy issues. To address such data shortage problems, load profiles synthesis is an effective technique that provides synthetic training data for customers to build high-performance data-driven models. Nonetheless, it is still challenging to synthesize high-quality load profiles for each customer using generation models trained by the respective customer&#8217;s data owing to the high heterogeneity of customer load. In this paper, we propose a novel customized load profiles synthesis method based on conditional diffusion models for heterogeneous customers. Specifically, we first convert the customized synthesis into a conditional data generation issue. We then extend traditional diffusion models to conditional diffusion models to realize conditional data generation, which can synthesize exclusive load profiles for each customer according to the customer&#8217;s load characteristics and application demands. In addition, to implement conditional diffusion models, we design a noise estimation model with stacked residual layers, which improves the generation performance by using skip connections. The attention mechanism is also utilized to better extract the complex temporal dependency of load profiles. Finally, numerical case studies based on a public dataset are conducted to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>LDM: A Generic Data-Driven Large Distribution Network Operation Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10498082</link><description>With the growing intelligence of power grids, the application of data-driven AI technologies has been widely studied in distribution network (DN) control and operation. However, most existing studies can only address a specific task. The recent surge of powerful, versatile AI models has inspired us to explore whether the grid controller can also evolve toward greater intelligence, enabling it to perform multiple DN operation tasks. To this end, this letter proposes a novel generic data-driven Large Distribution network operation Model (LDM) based on multitask reinforcement learning (MTRL). It can concurrently learn multiple DN operation skills and perform distinct tasks separately. Specifically, to effectively handle the unaligned heterogeneous action spaces across different tasks, action-masking is incorporated. Case studies on a modified 33-bus system prove the generalization capabilities of LDM.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Beacon-Aided AUV Localization: A Reinforcement Learning Based Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10416757</link><description>Beacon-aided autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) localization supporting maritime surveillance applications in underwater acoustic sensor networks selects a fixed number of beacons with constant transmit power, and thus has degradation of localization accuracy with severe channel fading and position fluctuation of beacons. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning based AUV localization scheme to choose the beacons and their transmit power to improve the localization accuracy and energy efficiency based on the AUV depth, the received signal strength, the number of selected beacons and the beacon energy consumption. According to the least squares method, the AUV position is calculated based on the isogradient sound speed model and the round-trip time of the localization signals. The localization error averaged over different beacon sets is evaluated to formulate the localization policy distribution. Deep neural network is designed to estimate the expected long-term discounted utility with higher feature extraction efficiency for the underwater networks with a large number of beacons. The Cramer-Rao lower bounds of the proposed localization schemes are derived to analyze the effect of the position fluctuation of beacons on the localization accuracy. Simulation results verify the performance gain in terms of the localization accuracy and the beacon energy consumption over the benchmark.</description></item><item><title>Publicly Accountable Data-Sharing Scheme Supporting Privacy Protection for Fog-Enabled VANETs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10444080</link><description>Vehicle ad hoc networks (VANETs) provide a convenient mobile communication environment for vehicles, pedestrians, and infrastructure. However, data confidentiality, access permission leakage, and privacy disclosure, are major issues of concern in such systems. Therefore, we present a publicly accountable data-sharing scheme for VANETs based on an expressive ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) algorithm. In this paper, we use white-box traceability and auditing technology to enforce accountability of both traitors and the key authority, and we employ two authorities to generate user keys collaboratively to weaken the power of one component and prevent the authority from tampering with users' identities. Considering the flexible change of vehicle attributes, we implement the revocation of malicious users or vehicles by updating partial keys and ciphertexts related to revoked user's attributes. Our method also supports attribute revocation and attribute update to deal with the complex and changeable environments of VANETs and achieves privacy preservation by adopting partial policy hiding technology. Multiple fog nodes are deployed at the edge of the cloud server to assist users who are short on resources in completing the encryption and decryption calculations. Comprehensive experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme has many advantages over others in terms of key storage consumption and the computational time consumption of encryption and decryption operations.</description></item><item><title>Standalone Intelligent Reflecting Surface With Automatic Update of Phase-Shift Switching Schedule for Improved Communication and Localization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10418507</link><description>An intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) allows to control signal propagation and may substantially improve the energy utilization efficiency for sixth-generation mobile communications. We previously proposed a wireless communication system using a standalone IRS that solves two problems: 1) channel estimation overhead for the reflective elements and 2) shared IRS use by multiple wireless network operators. The standalone IRS sweeps the reflected beam by periodically switching the phase shift to cover a wide area. However, when the user area is limited, signals with a phase shift that is not reflected in the user direction are lost. Hence, we propose a method for the standalone IRS to automatically detect useless phase shifts and update the phase-shift switching schedule according to the communication environment. Furthermore, we propose an indoor localization method that supports the automatic update for potential applications such as smart factories and smart homes, in which both communication and the localization of user equipment are required. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves the communication efficiency and localization accuracy by properly updating the phase-shift switching schedule.</description></item><item><title>Joint Resource Allocation for Maximizing Energy Efficiency in mmWave-Based Wireless-Powered Communication Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10418564</link><description>In this article, we consider a millimeter-wave (mmWave)-based wireless-powered communication network (WPCN) which consists of a hybrid access point (HAP) and multiple energy-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In the network, the HAP first transfers radio frequency (RF) energy to multiple IoT devices in the downlink via time division multiple access (TDMA), and then the IoT devices concurrently transmit their individual data to the HAP by using the harvested energy in the uplink via the frequency division multiple access (FDMA). We aim to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the considered network by jointly optimizing the grouping strategy of IoT devices and antenna allocation of the HAP for wireless energy transfer (WPT), sub-timeslot allocation of the downlink and uplink transmissions, as well as bandwidth allocation for wireless information transmission (WIT). To address the non-convexity of the formulated optimization problem, a two-stage design method is proposed to obtain the near-optimal solution. In the first stage, by fixing the sub-timeslot of WPT while maximizing the conditional harvested energy of all IoT devices, the stable grouping strategy with the optimal antenna allocation is obtained based on the principle of two-side exchange stability (TES). In the second stage, we derive the optimal sub-timeslot and bandwidth allocations for maximizing the EE by leveraging the Dinkelbach algorithm with the Lagrange dual method. Numerical results reveal that the proposed algorithm can achieve a close-to-optimal performance for energy harvesting in the downlink. In addition, the EE can be significantly enhanced in comparison to the competitive schemes.</description></item><item><title>Massive Wireless Energy Transfer Without Channel State Information via Imperfect Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10422762</link><description>Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) utilizes low-cost, passive reflecting elements to enhance the passive beam gain, improve Wireless Energy Transfer (WET) efficiency, and enable its deployment for numerous Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, the increasing number of IRS elements presents considerable channel estimation challenges. This is due to the lack of active Radio Frequency (RF) chains in an IRS, while pilot overhead becomes intolerable. To address this issue, we propose a Channel State Information (CSI)-free scheme that maximizes received energy in a specific direction and covers the entire space through phased beam rotation. Furthermore, we take into account the impact of an imperfect IRS and meticulously design the active precoder and IRS reflecting phase shift to mitigate its effects. Our proposed technique does not alter the existing IRS hardware architecture, allowing for easy implementation in the current system, and enabling access or removal of any Energy Receivers (ERs) without additional cost. Numerical results illustrate the efficacy of our CSI-free scheme in facilitating large-scale IRS without compromising performance due to excessive pilot overhead. Furthermore, our scheme outperforms the CSI-based counterpart in scenarios involving large-scale ERs, making it a promising solution in the era of IoT.</description></item><item><title>User Localization and Environment Mapping With the Assistance of RIS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10419033</link><description>With the introduction of sixth-generation (6 G) communication, the attention to integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is growing rapidly due to the diverse requirements for 6 G communication services. However, the sensing performance in wireless scenarios is constrained by limited resources, such as the number of array antennas, spectrum, and power. Nevertheless, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is suitable for assisting ISAC because it can manipulate the incident signals with relatively lower power consumption. Therefore, this paper proposes a user localization and environment estimation problem with the assistance of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and RIS. Considering that carrier frequency offsets (CFO) will impact the location estimation in OFDM, we first investigate the joint estimation of time of arrivals (TOA) and 2-D direction of arrivals (DOA) without CFO estimation by taking advantage of matrix transformation. In order to increase the ability of environment estimation of wireless signals, we develop an efficient environment estimation method with the help of RIS to adjust the directions of the incident signals in different frequencies. Finally, by taking the space-time continuity of user movement and the geometry features of environment into account, we establish the probability transition model of the estimation process for user's location and environment by factor graph. The performance of our factor graph-based estimation algorithm is demonstrated by simulation results.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Joint Optimization Method of Multi-Agent Task Offloading and Resource Scheduling for Mobile Inspection Service in Smart Factory</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10419027</link><description>In smart factories, Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) are usually used for patrol service, which can carry out such tasks as detecting abnormal device status, transporting material and simultaneously making their own path plan. Hence, these tasks require intensive computational power and real-time response and it is difficult to complete them by a single node. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a joint optimization method of task offloading and resource scheduling of multiple AGVs for smart factory patrol service. The goal is to minimize the overall energy consumption of the AGVs, by jointly using MEC and D2D offloading, while meeting the constraints of the delay, power, available computing capacity and bandwidth of AGVs. We first analyze the impact of information collection and cooperation tasks on transmission delay and formulate an energy consumption minimization problem. Then, we propose a two-step algorithm to get the solutions of the optimization problem. For resource allocation sub-problem, we design an efficient algorithm for power and bandwidth allocation by using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition based on the properties of convex bandwidth. To solve the nonlinear task offloading problem, we transform it into a linear mixed integer problem by introducing slack variables and use Gurobi for the solution. Simulation results show that compared with other methods, the proposed algorithm has good performances on convergence speed and energy conservation of AGVs in the process of patrol tasks under different scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Signal Model and Linear Combining Design for Multi-Numerology Massive MIMO Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10423197</link><description>In order to provide flexible radio access technologies, the fifth generation (5G) New Radio (NR) employs various choices of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) numerologies. Nevertheless, a comprehensive signal model of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) uplink (UL) systems with multiple numerologies remains unclear. Most previous studies have solely considered the signals of two numerologies within only one least common multiplier (LCM) symbol duration, which is the time duration for synchronizing distinct numerologies, and aimed to address inter-numerology interference (inter-NI). However, the inter-NI from OFDM symbols in the previous LCM symbol duration should also be considered in UL systems. Accordingly, this paper provides a generalized baseband signal model with an arbitrary number of numerologies that encompasses all the inter-NI. In addition, we conduct an analysis of signal power and derive a tractable form of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) expression. Based on the analysis, we propose linear combining designs with respect to the zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) criteria for multi-numerology systems. Simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed linear combiners. In particular, we demonstrate that the proposed ZF combiner is able to perfectly eliminate all the inter-NI. Furthermore, the simulation results verify that the derived lower bound of the achievable rate with the proposed ZF combiner is very tight.</description></item><item><title>Performance Analysis of Downlink Cooperative User Relaying FD/HD NOMA Over Nakagami-$m$ Fading Channels</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10423266</link><description>This article investigates a cooperative user relaying non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), in which the near user (NU) works as a relay for the far user (FU) to convey data from the base station (BS). Two situations are explored: (1) No direct link (NDL) between the BS and the FU, and (2) Direct link (DL) between the BS and the FU. The NU communicates in half-duplex (HD) or full-duplex (FD) mode using a decode-and-forward mechanism. Channel coefficients are obtained using Nakagami-$m$ distribution, whereas self-loop interference at the NU in FD mode is modelled using Rayleigh distribution. Three performance metrics are analyzed: outage probability, ergodic rate, and energy efficiency. For these parameters, closed-form expressions are derived considering different possible scenarios, or asymptotic expressions are provided. Simulation results show an error floor in the outage probability plots in the FD NOMA case. The system throughput for two NOMA users is investigated in delay-limited and delay-tolerant transmission modes. Using the DL helps to improve the diversity of the FU in both the HD and FD modes. A throughput ceiling exists for the NU in the FD NOMA case and the FU in both the HD and FD modes. It is clear from the simulation results that FD NOMA outperforms HD NOMA in terms of the considered performance metrics in the low and mid-SNR regions. Numerical studies explain how diverse system factors, including self-loop interference, variable node distances, source transmit power, and power allocation coefficients, affect various performance indicators.</description></item><item><title>Constant Modulus Waveform Design for RIS-Aided ISAC System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10423173</link><description>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology is receiving more and more attention, and waveform design is an important research direction. In the ISAC system of multi-user communication and multi-target sensing, system performance requirements limit the freedom degree of the integrated waveform. This paper studies the joint waveform design and passive beamforming in the ISAC system aided by reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). We consider the practical constant modulus waveform design and study the minimization of weighted mean square cross-correlation pattern (MSCCP) under the unit modulus constraints of RIS reflection phase shift, target illumination power and multi-user interference (MUI) constraint. We decompose the original non-convex problem into multiple sub-problems for alternating optimization (AO). The redundant constraints are incorporated into the objective function of the subproblem as penalty terms to obtain a problem whose feasible region is manifold. Then, an efficient Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) algorithm is proposed to solve it. The simulation results show that under the constant modulus waveform constraint, the introduction of RIS can significantly improve the freedom of waveform design. The MSCCP between the beams transmitted by the BS can be reduced under the constraint of the target illumination power and MUI.</description></item><item><title>FedAEB: Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Joint Client Selection and Resource Allocation Strategy for Heterogeneous Federated Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10416384</link><description>Recently, federated learning (FL) has become a promising distributed learning technology by collaboratively training shared learning models on clients. However, due to the statistical heterogeneity of clients and differences in computing and communication resources, the convergence speed and accuracy of FL may decrease. The energy consumption and latency performance of clients may also be affected. To achieve a flexible balance between FL's model performance, overall energy consumption, and latency, thereby meeting customized requirements, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based FL framework called FedAEB. It adopts a dynamic optimization method based on the Soft Actor-Critic network for client selection and resource allocation, which can effectively adapt to complex and time-varying systems. The weight factors that balance optimization variables can be flexibly adjusted according to different application needs. Many experiments have been conducted on well-known and state-of-the-art datasets, demonstrating that our FedAEB outperforms the benchmark method in reward values, learning accuracy, energy consumption, and latency performance.</description></item><item><title>Adversarial Attacks on Graph Neural Networks Based Spatial Resource Management in P2P Wireless Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10416752</link><description>This article introduces adversarial attacks targeting a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based radio resource management system in point-to-point (P2P) communications. Our focus lies on perturbing the trained GNN model during the test phase, specifically targeting its vertices and edges. To achieve this, four distinct adversarial attacks are proposed, each accounting for different constraints, aiming to manipulate the behavior of the system. The proposed adversarial attacks are formulated as optimization problems, aiming to minimize the system's communication quality. The efficacy of these attacks is investigated against the number of users, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and adversary power budget. Furthermore, we address the detection of such attacks from the perspective of the Central Processing Unit (CPU) of the system. To this end, we formulate an optimization problem that involves analyzing the distribution of channel eigenvalues before and after the attacks are applied. This formulation results in a Min-Max optimization problem, allowing us to detect the presence of attacks. Through extensive simulations, we observe that in the absence of adversarial attacks, the eigenvalues conform to Johnson's SU distribution. However, the attacks significantly alter the characteristics of the eigenvalue distribution, and in the most effective attack, they even change the type of the eigenvalue distribution.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic UAV Routing for Multi-Access Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10416694</link><description>Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) is a paradigm in which the computation of traffic and services is moved from a centralized cloud to the edge of the network and closer to the customer. This paradigm is expected to effectively reduce latency, making it suitable for real-time applications. A key technology for this paradigm is the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to mount edge servers that meet customers' computing requirements. The use of UAVs in MEC is attractive because they are close to customers and can be deployed dynamically. In real-time applications, users update the terrestrial network with their locations and computing needs by sending real-time requests. Therefore, from the terrestrial network's perspective, both the locations and arrival times of tasks are randomly distributed. It is crucial to manage the UAV efficiently to maximize the number of computational tasks completed during its flight time, as UAVs have limitations in terms of energy, power and speed. Due to the random nature of the arrival of tasks, existing studies address this problem with the traditional approach of using machine learning (ML). This approach suffers from two drawbacks: 1) ML algorithms are computationally intensive and 2) they are heuristic methods that offer no guarantees of optimality. In this paper, we present an alternative approach for UAV management. We propose an algorithm for UAV routing and task scheduling based on Lyapunov optimization that has a low computational cost while considering energy consumption and path stability. We also developed Theorem 1, which provides upper bounds on the long-term performance of the UAV. Numerical results based on realistic UAV parameters show the feasibility of our proposed algorithm and its advantage over ML algorithms. We have also investigated the conditions that can further improve the performance of task offloading in terms of uplink power, UAV speed, and CPU resources.</description></item><item><title>On Intelligent Placement Decision-Making Algorithms for Wireless Digital Twin Networks via Bandit Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10418559</link><description>In this work, we present a novel approach to address the problem of minimizing the total cost in wireless digital twin network (WDTN) through the design of an intelligent digital twins (DTs) placement algorithm. The total cost is defined as the weighted sum of latency and energy consumption, evaluating the importance of these two factors. The dynamics in the WDTN require an adaptive and flexible approach to perform DT placement over time. To efficiently tackle the non-convex and non-stationary optimization problem for DT placement, we develop a multi-armed bandit (MAB) driven algorithm. Initially, we remodel the original problem of DT placement as a variation of the budgeted-MAB problem to enhance the efficiency of resources utilization within a fixed budget. Subsequently, we exploit the contextual information about the DTs and edge servers to establish associations across different time slots, effectively addressing the non-stationary nature of the problem. To further make the DT placement decisions and reduce uncertainty of the placement strategy, we propose an extension of the upper confidence bound (UCB) strategy. This extension incorporates both the efficiency of resources utilization and contextual information of the WDTN while considering energy consumption, latency, and other relevant factors. Extensive and comprehensive numerical simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of our devised algorithm. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of energy consumption, latency, and total cost when compared to various baseline schemes. These findings highlight the effectiveness and robustness of our developed algorithm in achieving significant improvements in cost reduction for WDTN.</description></item><item><title>Downlink Coverage Probability and Rate Analysis Based on Backhaul-Access Pair in Moving Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10420465</link><description>Moving networks with mobile small base stations (MSBSs) provide ubiquitous and continuous services for users in beyond fifth-generation (B5G) system. MSBSs are mounted on the vehicle, receive/transmit signals from/to macro base stations (MBS) via wireless backhaul, and provide 5G connectivity to user equipments (UE). In this paper, we develop a stochastic geometry-based analytical framework for analyzing the downlink coverage probability and rate coverage of moving networks, where the service distance distribution of a typical UE (an arbitrarily selected receiving UE) associated with an MSBS is characterized as a joint distribution of backhaul-access pair, and its closed-form expression is derived at various MSBS movement locations. By utilizing this characteristic, we further derive the coverage probability based on the Laplace transform of the interference power distribution. Furthermore, the downlink rate coverage for the typical UE is derived using backhaul-access pair and Voronoi mosaics to characterize the mean and particular load on the serving MBS and MSBS, respectively. Our simulation results show that there exists an optimal ratio of wireless backhaul bandwidth allocation maximizing the rate coverage for given network parameters such as the density and selection bias of MSBSs. Additionally, we also observe that there are saturating values of the network parameters in the process of improving the network metrics without the need to be blindly increased.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Task Scheduling in Digital Twin Empowered Cloud-Native Vehicular Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10423175</link><description>Intelligent driving has advanced significantly in recent decades, paving the path for the transportation of the future. Digital twin (DT) technology, which can bridge the physical and virtual space gaps in real time, plays an important role in the collaboration of vehicles and roads for intelligent driving. In this paper, we design the Digital Twin empowered Cloud-native Vehicular Networks (DT-CVN) architecture as well as the workflow for task execution aiming at executing intelligent driving tasks efficiently and reliably. In DT-CVN, we propose a design and implementation scheme for digital twins, in which different modules of the same digital twin entity can be deployed in different network locations in a distributed manner by taking advantage of the distributed features of microservices based on cloud-native technology. Furthermore, we design the modules reuse and requests aggregation mechanisms of digital twins invocation for task scheduling in DT-CVN, which can improve its efficiency even further. Then we model the task scheduling in DT-CVN into a combinational optimization problem and propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based adaptive task scheduling algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can improve the efficiency of task scheduling while reducing energy consumption.</description></item><item><title>Learning-Enhanced Joint Estimation of AOAs and Source Number With Quantized Phase-Only Measurements</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10416197</link><description>This correspondence proposes to estimate the angle of arrival (AOA) and source number with quantized phase-only (PO) measurements extracted via multiple one-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), thereby significantly reducing the power consumption. A density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN-) enhanced expectation-maximization (EM-) generalized approximate message passing (GAMP-) based estimator is developed. Firstly, the AOA estimation problem is converted as detecting supports of cluster-sparse signals and then solved by modified EM-GAMP in a single snapshot. Secondly, the coarse AOA estimates from multiple snapshots are clustered by DBSCAN to estimate the source number and improve the AOA estimation accuracy. Simulation results show that the quantized PO measurements scheme is more energy-efficient than the conventional complex-valued measurements scheme. The AOA and source number estimation performance of this scheme is superior to that of the one-bit quantized measurements scheme due to the extreme quantization loss of the latter. Furthermore, the DBSCAN-enhanced estimator incorporates the AOA estimate results from multiple snapshots and effectively eliminates outlier AOA estimates, thereby improving the AOA estimation performance, particularly at low signal-to-noise ratios.</description></item><item><title>Energy Efficiency-Oriented Joint Communication and Computation Resource Management in NOMA-Enabled V2X Underlaid Cellular Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10417718</link><description>The existing computation and communication (2C) optimization schemes for cellular-based vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) networks are done without considering the influence of the social trust. Computational tasks may be offloaded to the untrusted vehicles, making it difficult to accurately execute computational tasks. This may lead to a re-offloading of the computational tasks, consuming additional power, and decreasing the EE for offloading. To address the issue, this work devotes itself to investigate social-mobility-aware underlaid C-V2X framework and proposes a novel EE-oriented 2C assignment scheme. In doing so, we assume that the task vehicular user (T-VU) can offload computation tasks to the service vehicular user (S-VU) and the road side unit (RSU) by non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). We formulate an EE maximization problem to assign the 2C resources simultaneously through joint optimization, which turns out to be a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. To solve it, we transform it into separated computation and communication resource allocation subproblems. Dealing with the first subproblem, we fully integrate the characteristic of both social and mobility, and design a heuristic algorithm to achieve edge server selection and task splitting. Then, to address the complex co-channel interference in the second subproblem, the power allocation and spectrum assignment solutions are obtained utilizing a tightening lower bound method and a Kuhn-Munkres (KM) algorithm. Finally, we solve the original problem through an iterative method. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can significantly enhance the system EE.</description></item><item><title>Energy-Efficient Covert Communications for UAV-Assisted Backscatter Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10415569</link><description>In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient covert communication framework for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted backscatter systems, where one UAV is deployed to collect data from one ground backscatter device (BD), in the presence of a warden who is trying to detect whether BD is transmitting or not. We first analyze the false alarm probability (FAP) and miss detection probability (MDP) for the covert communication and investigate the detection error probability by considering the location and channel uncertainty of warden. Then, aimed at maximizing the energy efficiency (EE) of our proposed system subject to reliability and covertness constraints, we optimize the UAV transmit power and hovering point jointly and design a low-complexity solution based on alternating optimization (AO), Dinkelbach method and successive convex approximation (SCA) solutions. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and highlight the fundamental trade-off between the EE and covertness constraint.</description></item><item><title>UAV-Enabled Robust Covert Communication Against Active Wardens</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10418490</link><description>This correspondence investigates the robust unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled covert communication system with active ground wardens of collusive detection and location uncertainty. The three-dimensional (3D) trajectory and transmit power of UAV are jointly optimized to maximize the average covert transmission rate subject to the worst-case covertness constraint. The problem is intractable due to its nonconvexity and semi-positive definite matrix constraint, and an iterative suboptimal algorithm is proposed based on the block coordinate descent, S-procedure and successive convex optimization to tackle it. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is effective and robust for UAV-enabled covert communications against active wardens.</description></item><item><title>PV System Installation Assessment Based on Power Measurement for Balcony Power Plant Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10507888</link><description>Photovoltaic systems for balcony power plant applications are rapidly growing, and with it comes the need for holistic concepts for energy utilization. Since these systems are intended for users without deep technical knowledge, the applications need to work and optimize themselves automatically without the user having to interfere. Therefore, this article presents a method to estimate the azimuth and the inclination of photovoltaic modules by analyzing the on-site power data and comparing it to a power forecast by Forecast. Solar, thereby making it unnecessary for users to provide these values themselves. The information gained hereby can be used to obtain and optimize a power forecast considering prevailing on-site conditions for energy management purposes. This is done by using low-volume power data at hourly resolution, where a single day of data is enough to make an estimation. The results of this method provide PV installation parameters with a resolution of the azimuth in 45$^{\circ }$-steps and the inclination in 15$^{\circ }$-steps, which are matched to the best-fitting power forecast.</description></item><item><title>High-Efficiency TOPCon Solar Cells With Laser-Assisted Localized Boron Doping via Silicon Paste</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10500405</link><description>In the present study, we establish a physical model for laser-assisted localized boron doping in N-type tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cells by employing the fluid dynamics method. Our simulations reveal that a flat-top beam inflicts less thermal damage on silicon than a Gaussian beam at a constant laser energy density. Additionally, we observe an acceleration in the flow rate of molten silicon in the molten pool as the laser energy density increases. This acceleration facilitates efficient doping of boron atoms into the silicon substrate, albeit accompanied by an expansion of the local thermal damage range. In light of these findings, we utilized boron-doped silicon paste as a doping source in experiments conducted on a 15 MW TOPCon solar cells production line employing four distinct laser energy densities. The experiments yielded a reduction in the sheet resistance to 81.9 &#937;/cm in the boron-doped regions, an increase in the peak boron doping concentration to 1.08 &#215; 1019 atoms/cm3, and a doping depth of 2.38 &#956;m. Consequently, the highest efficiency enhancement recorded was 0.14%, culminating in an efficiency of 25.06%. This research outlines the mechanism of the laser-assisted localized boron doping process and provides insights for enhancing the efficiency of TOPCon solar cells.</description></item><item><title>UV Laser Scribing for Perovskite Solar Modules Fabrication, Pros, and Cons</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10528668</link><description>Laser scribing is one of the most challenging steps in fabricating solar modules, which determines their internal resistance, geometrical factor, and efficiency. Pulsed Nd:YVO4 lasers with wavelengths of 355, 532, and 1064 nm are the most common lasers used in the photovoltaic industry. As using one single laser source for all scribing steps is more cost effective, in this article after summarizing recent progress in laser scribing for perovskite modules, a nanosecond UV-laser (355 nm) is used for all scribing steps needed for series interconnections in structures with glass or plastic substrates and studied how different scribing parameters, such as repetition frequency, output average power density, and scan speed, must be selected to adjust the transferred power density to the layer, enabling efficient scribing without overheating and cracking the layers. In addition to producing sharp strips on glass/ transparent conducting layer (TCO) substrates, especially thick fluorine-doped tin oxide, nanosecond UV laser provides a wide window for patterning the perovskite layer without damaging glass/TCO. However, in the case of plastic substrates, melted materials deform the edges of the strips&#8217; profiles. These results, along with reviewed results from the literature, provide a good insight into optimized laser scribing for perovskite solar module fabrication.</description></item><item><title>Metamorphic and Lattice-Matched GaInP Rear-Heterojunction Solar Cells for Improved Performance at Elevated Temperatures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10502388</link><description>We present the characteristics of n-on-p front-junction (FJ) and rear-heterojunction (RHJ) GaInP solar cells at operating temperatures (T) up to 300 &#176;C. Photovoltaic cells with efficient operation at high T may be important for satellite missions near the sun or as laser power converters for sensors operating in harsh environments. In this article, we show that the time-resolved photoluminescence lifetime (${{\tau }_{\text{TRPL}}}$) values in both lattice-matched (LM) n-Ga0.51In0.49P and metamorphic (MM) n-Ga0.37In0.63P double heterostructures are high and increase significantly with T. In contrast, the ${{\tau }_{\text{TRPL}}}$ values in their p-type counterparts are lower and decrease with T. We go on to demonstrate both LM and MM solar cells in FJ and RHJ configurations. The internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of MM RHJ cells increases significantly up to T = 300 &#176;C due to the increase in both ${{\tau }_{\text{TRPL}}}$ and the linear increase in diffusivity with T. In contrast, the IQE for MM FJ cells is nearly unchanged as T increases, while the IQE of LM cells drops sharply across all wavelengths. RHJ cells maintain higher open-circuit voltage and fill factor than their FJ counterparts, leading to a significant efficiency advantage at T = 100&#8211;300 &#176;C. Taken together, our work shows that MM cells perform well at elevated T and that RHJ cells are promising for high-T operation.</description></item><item><title>A Hysteresis Compensation Algorithm for the Generation of Nonlinear Voltage Sweep for IV-Characteristic Measurement of High-Capacitance Solar Modules With Xenon Flasher</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10540034</link><description>Short measurement time of tens of ms at industrial production leads to high influence of parasitic current on the current voltage (IV) curve characterization. This parasitic current deteriorates the measurement accuracy and should be mitigated. However, most methods, like, e.g., sectional measurement or DragonBackTM, are based on either unpractical long measurement time or sophisticated simulations. We present an algorithm for the generation of voltage sweep for low hysteresis measurement of IV characteristics in high capacitive solar modules. Using one linear voltage sweep-based IV characteristics as input, an optimized nonlinear voltage sweep is generated with our algorithm. While the linear voltage ramp during a 93 ms pulse leads to a hysteresis error at maximum power (&#1013;Pmpp) of 1.46% for a 1-cell heterojunction minimodule and 2.35% for a 120-cells heterojunction solar module, the &#1013;Pmpp with the optimized nonlinear voltage ramp is reduced to 0.38% and 0.48%, respectively. The hysteresis error of short-circuit current (&#1013;Isc) and hysteresis error of open-circuit voltage (&#1013;Voc) remain below 0.5% by optimized nonlinear voltage ramp. Thus, all three hysteresis error parameters &#1013;Pmpp, &#1013;Isc, and &#1013;Voc fulfill the standard IEC 60904-1 (edition-3).</description></item><item><title>Measurement of Photovoltaic Module Deformation Dynamics During Hail Impact Using Digital Image Correlation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10551381</link><description>Stereo high-speed video of photovoltaic modules undergoing laboratory hail tests was processed using digital image correlation to determine module surface deformation during and immediately following impact. The purpose of this work was to demonstrate a methodology for characterizing module impact response differences as a function of construction and incident hail parameters. Video capture and digital image analysis were able to capture out-of-plane module deformation to a resolution of &#177;0.1 mm at 11 kHz on an in-plane grid of 10 &#215; 10 mm over the area of a 1 &#215; 2 m commercial photovoltaic module. With lighting and optical adjustments, the technique was adaptable to arbitrary module designs, including size, backsheet color, and cell interconnection. Impacts were observed to produce an initially localized dimple in the glass surface, with peak deflection proportional to the square root of incident energy. Subsequent deformation propagation and dissipation were also captured, along with behavior for instances when the module glass fractured. Natural frequencies of the module were identifiable by analyzing module oscillations postimpact. Limitations of the measurement technique were that the impacting ice ball obscured the data field immediately surrounding the point of contact, and both ice and glass fracture events occurred within 100 &#956;s, which was not resolvable at the chosen frame rate. Increasing the frame rate and visualizing the back surface of the impact could be applied to avoid these issues. Applications for these data include validating computational models for hail impacts, identifying the natural frequencies of a module, and identifying damage initiation mechanisms.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Power Prediction for Bifacial PV Systems in Varied Shading Conditions: A Circuit-LSTM Approach Within a Digital Twin Framework</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10529620</link><description>The prediction of bifacial photovoltaic (bPV) system performance under variable conditions has persistently challenged researchers and practitioners alike, largely due to the unstable and imprecise irradiance measurements and the extensive training processes required for machine learning-based methods. Addressing these issues, this study introduces an innovative digital twin system that integrates a novel circuit-long short-term memory (LSTM) model with the newly proposed triangle-shading pattern estimation method, eliminating dependencies on direct irradiance measurements and historical data.

However, maintaining PV system efficiency remains a challenging problem. In desert regions, soiling is one of the most significant environmental factors that can cause PV system loss. In our early work, a PV soiling loss estimation method based on a single-image feature and in-lab testing was developed. In this study, we extend our previous work by incorporating various image features in a machine-learning regression model to predict PV soiling loss. The new model is trained and tested using PV performance data and RAW panel images collected in the field over several months, covering real-time soiling loss levels up to about 28%. There are 479 RAW images with 21 unique soiling loss levels, which were taken under different camera settings. The results show that the new method can reliably predict the soiling loss when the images are taken under similar settings as the training data (R-squared value of 0.98 and normalized RMSE is 0.01 for the training dataset).</description></item><item><title>Effects of Local Economy and Seasonal Cleaning Cycle on Yield and Profit of Soiled Solar Farms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10550921</link><description>Alongside advancements in photovoltaics (PV) technology, efficient solar farm operation (e.g., strategic panel cleaning) can help lower electricity generation costs in the field. In this work, we study the effects of season-dependent soiling and cleaning on energy yield, revenue, and profit in four locations &#8211; Dhaka (Bangladesh), Oregon City (USA), Berlin (Germany), and Rumah (Saudi Arabia). These locations cover a wide range of soiling rates, season-dependent rainfall, cleaning costs, and tariff rates for a broad techno-economic analysis of soiling-affected solar farms. While a two-month cleaning cycle, for example, apparently seems too long for soiling-prone locations (Dhaka and Rumah) &#8211; this is too frequent for Oregon City and Berlin due to their high cleaning costs. Therefore, the optimal strategy for maximum profit for the latter two locations is to never clean the panels. Even at optimal cleaning cycle (maximum revenue/profit), there is a profit-loss of 13.28%, 19.97%, 1.39%, and 42.88%, compared with the respective soiling-free rated farm output at these locations. We also show the sensitivity of output and profit to the variations in soiling rate and cleaning cost; farms in Dhaka and Rumah show strong sensitivity due to the high soiling rate and low cleaning costs.</description></item><item><title>Multidimensional Evaluation Method for the Operational Status of Photovoltaic Arrays in Large-Scale PV Power Stations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10506328</link><description>As the core and critical component of photovoltaic (PV) power stations, accurately evaluating the operational status of PV arrays is key to enabling intelligent operation of the power station. In the actual power station, only current and voltage data of the PV array are available, but the outputs of PV arrays exhibit noticeable random fluctuations, making it challenging to comprehensively evaluate the PV arrays in terms of power generation, data quality, and stability. To solve the above problems, this article proposed evaluation indicators for the operational status of arrays from multiple dimensions, including data quality, normalized generated power, performance ratio, dynamic performance, and stability of the arrays. The indicators were calculated individually, and then a comprehensive evaluation and recognition of the arrays&#8217; operational status were achieved through the utilization of weight calculation and quantile method. The article presented a systematic approach for evaluating the operational status of PV arrays using multidimensional evaluation indicators and the comprehensive evaluation method innovatively. The proposed multidimensional indicators provide a comprehensive evaluation of the PV arrays' operational status, without requiring any additional hardware investment. This study aims to provide a theoretical and practical foundation to effectively monitor the operational status of PV arrays. Compared with the traditional fuzzy C-means method, the method can give quantitative evaluation results of the operational status for PV arrays.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Calibration of Bit Weights in SAR and Pipelined SAR ADCs Based on Code Distribution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10489909</link><description>This article comprehensively analyzes the effects of differential capacitor array mismatches on the decision levels of charge-redistribution-based successive-approximation-register (SAR) analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), reveals the intrinsic relation between the differential CDAC mismatches and the output code distribution of SAR, and proposes a bit-weight calibration (BWC) algorithm for SAR in terms of raw output codes, which does not require any modification to the original design. The proposed BWC is applicable to other architectures that incorporate a SAR as a substage, such as a pipelined SAR (P-SAR). Physical measurement results are presented for a pure SAR and simulation results are presented for a two-stage P-SAR, both of which verified the theoretical analyses and the proposed calibration method.</description></item><item><title>ADC/DAC-Free Analog Acceleration of Deep Neural Networks With Frequency Transformation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10473702</link><description>The edge processing of deep neural networks (DNNs) is becoming increasingly important due to its ability to extract valuable information directly at the data source to minimize latency and energy consumption. Although pruning techniques are commonly used to reduce model size for edge computing, they have certain limitations. Frequency-domain model compression, such as with the Walsh&#8211;Hadamard transform (WHT), has been identified as an efficient alternative. However, the benefits of frequency-domain processing are often offset by the increased multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations required. This article proposes a novel approach to an energy-efficient acceleration of frequency-domain neural networks by utilizing analog-domain frequency-based tensor transformations. Our approach offers unique opportunities to enhance computational efficiency, resulting in several high-level advantages, including array microarchitecture with parallelism, analog-to-digital converter (ADC)/digital-to-analog converter (DAC)-free analog computations, and increased output sparsity. Our approach achieves more compact cells by eliminating the need for trainable parameters in the transformation matrix. Moreover, our novel array microarchitecture enables adaptive stitching of cells column-wise and row-wise, thereby facilitating perfect parallelism in computations. Additionally, our scheme enables ADC/DAC-free computations by training against highly quantized matrix-vector products, leveraging the parameter-free nature of matrix multiplications. Another crucial aspect of our design is its ability to handle signed-bit processing for frequency-based transformations. This leads to increased output sparsity and reduced digitization workload. On a  $16 \times 16$  crossbars, for 8-bit input processing, the proposed approach achieves the energy efficiency of 801 tera operations per second per Watt (TOPS/W) without early termination strategy and 2655 TOPS/W with early termination strategy at VDD = 0.85 V for 16-nm predictive technology models (PTM).</description></item><item><title>Toward Efficient Retraining: A Large-Scale Approximate Neural Network Framework With Cross-Layer Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504795</link><description>Leveraging approximate multipliers in approximate neural networks (ApproxNNs) can effectively reduce hardware area and power consumption, making them suitable for edge-side applications. However, the propagation of layer-by-layer errors limits the application of approximate multipliers to large-scale ApproxNNs and complex tasks. Currently, retraining techniques that consider approximate multiplication errors are commonly used to compensate for the accuracy loss. However, due to the irregularity of the errors introduced by approximate multiplier, it is difficult for the existing generic acceleration hardware (e.g., GPU) to efficiently simulate its function and accelerate retraining, which thereby leads to a huge retraining overhead in ApproxNNs&#8217; application. In this article, we propose an ApproxNN framework that introduces errors with regular and controlled positions for high-efficiency retraining of large-scale ApproxNNs. An approximate multiplier design that matches this framework is also presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed ApproxNN framework. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed ApproxNN framework is able to achieve up to  $46\times $  speedup in retraining, and the proposed approximate multiplier reduces area/power-delay product (PDP) by 31%/63% compared to the exact multiplier. Compared with the floating-point neural network (NN) model, an accuracy decrease of only 1.13% is achieved when applied to ResNet50 on ImageNet dataset with only 15-epochs retraining, which surpasses other state-of-the-art designs.</description></item><item><title>An Energy Efficient Soft SIMD Microarchitecture and Its Application on Quantized CNNs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478774</link><description>The ever-increasing computational complexity and energy consumption of today&#8217;s applications, such as machine learning (ML) algorithms, not only strain the capabilities of the underlying hardware but also significantly restrict their wide deployment at the edge. Addressing these challenges, novel architecture solutions are required by leveraging opportunities exposed by algorithms, e.g., robustness to small-bitwidth operand quantization and high intrinsic data-level parallelism. However, traditional hardware single instruction multiple data (Hard SIMD) architectures only support a small set of operand bitwidths, limiting performance improvement. To fill the gap, this manuscript introduces a novel pipelined processor microarchitecture for arithmetic computing based on the software-defined SIMD (Soft SIMD) paradigm that can define arbitrary SIMD modes through control instructions at run-time. This microarchitecture is optimized for parallel fine-grained fixed-point arithmetic, such as shift/add. It can also efficiently execute sequential shift-add-based multiplication over SIMD subwords, thanks to zero-skipping and canonical signed digit (CSD) coding. A lightweight repacking unit allows changing subword bitwidth dynamically. These features are implemented within a tight energy and area budget. An energy consumption model is established through post-synthesis for performance assessment. We select heterogeneously quantized (HQ) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) from the ML domain as the benchmark and map it onto our microarchitecture. Experimental results showcase that our approach dramatically outperforms traditional Hard SIMD Multiplier-Adder regarding area and energy requirements. In particular, our microarchitecture occupies up to 59.9% less area than a Hard SIMD that supports fewer SIMD bitwidths, while consuming up to 50.1% less energy on average to execute HQ CNNs.</description></item><item><title>Better-Than-Worst-Case: A Frequency Adaptation Asynchronous RISC-V Core With Vector Extension</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475190</link><description>In recent years, asynchronous circuits have become more popular in neural network chips and the Internet of Things (IoT) due to their potential advantages of low-power consumption and high performance. However, the existing design methods for asynchronous circuits are still constrained by critical paths, increasing power consumption and hindering the further improvement of performance. In this article, a fully digital design method for frequency adaptation asynchronous bundled-data (BD) circuits is proposed. The proposed method is straightforward, effective, widely applicable, and independent of asynchronous controllers. It allows to automatically work on different frequencies as required, which can improve performance and reduce power consumption, achieving better-than-worst-case. To verify the proposed method, an asynchronous RISC-V processor with vector acceleration extension is designed on both TSMC 65-nm process and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platform. According to the postlayout simulation results, compared with its synchronous version, the asynchronous processor achieves a 10% speed improvement (from 227.3 to 250 MHz) with a 37% power reduction (from 135 to  $85~\mu \text{W}$ /MHz) under ideal conditions. Even under the worst conditions, the asynchronous processor achieves equivalent performance to the synchronous processor, while still reducing power consumption by 29% (from 133 to  $95~\mu \text{W}$ /MHz). On the FPGA platform, asynchronous processor also achieves higher speed while lower power consumption.</description></item><item><title>A Reliable and Efficient Online Solution for Adaptive Voltage and Frequency Scaling on FPGAs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10453488</link><description>Adaptive voltage and frequency scaling (AVFS) technology adjusts the supply voltage and clock frequency based on the actual operating conditions of the circuit. It can significantly improve performance or reduce the power consumption of the device. Existing online field-programmable gate array (FPGA) AVFS solutions have relatively low adjustment efficiency. Many existing solutions rely on offline steps, which do not consider the runtime operating conditions. This article proposes a complete FPGA AVFS solution, which includes a versatile self-checking timing monitor (SCTM) with small resource overhead, efficient AVFS algorithms without any offline steps, and user-friendly comprehensive automation software. Compared with existing online solutions, the proposed solution improves scaling efficiency by reducing the number of configuration times for the clock generation unit. The effectiveness of the solution is evaluated by a set of pubic benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that it can set an appropriate voltage&#8211;frequency operating point for the application circuit within dozens of milliseconds. For power-oriented adjustment, the proposed solution can save power ranging from 33.93% to 43.46%, while keeping the frequency not slower than the one reported by the static timing analysis (STA). For performance-oriented adjustment, it can achieve a performance improvement ranging from 60.26% to 101.90% at the nominal voltage.</description></item><item><title>Built-In Self-Test of SFQ Circuits Using Side-Channel Leakage Information</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10495792</link><description>Cryogenic testing and verification of single-flux quantum (SFQ) circuits consist of various challenges, such as limited number of input&#8211;output pins, flux trapping, and cooling power constraints. Developing design for testability (DFT) techniques for SFQ circuits, which address these challenges, is an important research area. In this work, a built-in self-test (BIST) methodology of SFQ circuits is proposed, which focuses on a novel way of the readout of test signals by using side-channel leakage information. The side-channel leakage can exhibit the dependence of internal data (logical &#8220;1&#8221; and &#8220;0&#8221;) on the power consumption. By measuring the variations in the power supply of an SFQ circuit at room temperature, the information about internal test signal states can be extracted with the proposed BIST methodology. As a case study, a rapid SFQ (RSFQ) 4-to-2 priority encoder circuit is considered. The existing Josephson junction (JJ)-based stuck-at fault model is applied with the proposed BIST methodology. The proposed BIST design is compared with a conventional shift register-based readout circuitry. The proposed BIST design can provide 79% lower static power consumption and 65% lower layout area. In addition, other advantages and drawbacks of the proposed design are discussed, such as yield, number of pins, testing time, interpretation of test results, and hardware security.</description></item><item><title>SCAR: Power Side-Channel Analysis at RTL Level</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10508974</link><description>Power side-channel (PSC) attacks exploit the dynamic power consumption of cryptographic operations to leak sensitive information about encryption hardware. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a PSC analysis to assess the susceptibility of cryptographic systems and mitigate potential risks. Existing PSC analysis primarily focuses on postsilicon implementations, which are inflexible in addressing design flaws, leading to costly and time-consuming postfabrication design re-spins. Hence, presilicon PSC analysis is required for the early detection of vulnerabilities to improve design robustness. In this article, we introduce SCAR, a novel presilicon PSC analysis framework based on graph neural networks (GNNs). SCAR converts register-transfer level (RTL) designs of encryption hardware into control-data flow graphs (CDFGs) and use that to detect the design modules susceptible to side-channel leakage. Furthermore, we incorporate a deep-learning-based explainer in SCAR to generate quantifiable and human-accessible explanations of our detection and localization decisions. We have also developed a fortification component as a part of SCAR that uses large-language models (LLMs) to automatically generate and insert additional design code at the localized zone to shore up the side-channel leakage. When evaluated on popular encryption algorithms like advanced encryption standard (AES), RSA, and PRESENT, and postquantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms like Saber and CRYSTALS-Kyber, SCAR, achieves up to 94.49% localization accuracy, 100% precision, and 90.48% recall. Additionally, through explainability analysis, SCAR reduces features for GNN model training by 57% while maintaining comparable accuracy. We believe that SCAR will transform the security-critical hardware design cycle, resulting in faster design closure at a reduced design cost.</description></item><item><title>Analyzing the Vulnerabilities of External SDRAM on System-on-Chip Field Programmable Gate Array Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478320</link><description>System-on-chip (SoC) field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices are becoming increasingly prominent in a vast range of applications. The fusion of the FPGA&#8217;s unmatched parallel computing capacity and flexibility with a full-bore processing system makes these devices extremely powerful. With recent technological progress, SoC FPGA devices are implemented in increasingly complex systems where security and safety are often issues of concern. To cater to these concerns, these devices are commonly fit with encryption and authentication capabilities to ensure the confidentiality and authenticity of externally stored bitstreams, firmware, and bootloaders. However, while much effort is placed into securing these partitions when stored in external memory, little attention seems to be paid to the security of this data once it is decrypted for execution. This article investigates how vulnerable systems are to attacks that target decrypted data during execution. We demonstrate that data stored in external synchronous dynamic random access memory (SDRAM) can provide access to trusted and secured interfaces of SoC FPGA devices even with diligently applied security features.</description></item><item><title>FLAT: Layout-Aware and Security Property-Assisted Timing Fault-Injection Attack Assessment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478871</link><description>The ease and inexpensive setup of injecting timing faults in a hardware design make it vulnerable to adversaries, resulting in confidentiality or integrity violations. The state-of-the-art fault-injection attack assessment frameworks do not consider significant timing variations during layout generation from a gate-level design when assessing security threats of timing faults. Additionally, existing mitigation methods focus on higher design abstractions (e.g., register transfer level (RTL) and gate level), resulting in substantial area, power consumption, and latency overhead. To address these limitations, we propose our layout-aware and security property-assisted timing fault-injection attack assessment (FLAT) framework that automatically assesses the feasibility of injecting controlled timing faults into the layout of a design using clock glitches and quantifies its vulnerability concerning security properties. If the design is vulnerable, FLAT modifies the layout to tune the fan-in path delays of the security-critical registers as local countermeasures. Unlike system-wide mitigation approaches, these countermeasures incur minimal overheads at an IP or system-on-chip (SoC) design regarding power, performance, and area while ensuring security against timing faults. To demonstrate the effectiveness of FLAT, we perform security assessments on the postlayout designs of various benchmarks [e.g., advanced encryption standard (AES), rivest-shamir-adleman (RSA), and floating-point unit (FPU)] by targeting major fault injection attack vectors and deploying local countermeasures. These assessments indicate that the FLAT framework adeptly evaluates each design&#8217;s susceptibility to timing faults and implements the countermeasures to mitigate this susceptibility to the desired level.</description></item><item><title>A 128-Gbps Pipelined SM4 Circuit With Dual DPA Attack Countermeasures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10487004</link><description>In this brief, a high-speed secret merchant-4 (SM4) cryptographic circuit with strong robustness against differential power analysis (DPA) attacks is proposed for securing the wireless networks for the first time. To achieve a high-throughput design for the SM4 algorithm, 32-stage pipelined encryption rounds and key expansion rounds are employed. Moreover, to resist DPA attacks, one pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) is embedded to randomly alter the SM4 circuit with a 32-stage or 34-stage pipeline, the other PRNG is utilized for realizing redundant operations to further break the correlation between the processed data and power dissipation of the SM4 circuit. When compared to a regular SM4 cryptographic circuit, the proposed SM4 architecture is capable of achieving a high throughput and satisfactory robustness against DPA attacks without compromising much power, area, and performance overhead. The result shows that the pipelined SM4 cryptographic circuit achieves a 128-Gbps throughput and 47423- $\mu \text{m}^{2}$  area with a high measurement-to-disclosure (MTD) value (&gt;1 million) after synthesizing in the SMIC 14-nm process design kits (PDKs).</description></item><item><title>A 0.7-pJ/b 12.5-Gb/s Reference-Less Subsampling Clock and Data Recovery Circuit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10491140</link><description>A 12.5-Gb/s 1/5-rate reference-less subsampling clock and data recovery (CDR) circuit is presented. The subsampling phase detection technique widely used in the low jitter phase-locked loop design is adopted for the CDR&#8217;s clock recovery operation. It brings not only a design simplification but also the low-power consumption of the CDR. The 1/5-rate subsampling phase detection circuit is also introduced for further power reduction. The false-lock detector is proposed that monotonically ascends or descends the clock frequency until the phase lock is achieved. It shares the outputs of the subsampling phase detection circuit and removes the frequency detector from the CDR loop. The measured power consumption and efficiency of the proposed CDR at 12.5 Gb/s are 8.8 mW and 0.7 pJ/bit, respectively. At the same time, the peak-to-peak and rms jitters show 21 and 3.7 ps in 2.5-GHz clock signal, respectively.

High-frequency transistor modeling is employed to analyze the stacked cell, and a methodology is developed to maximize the output power ( $P_{\text {out}}$ ) and power-added efficiency (PAE) of each cell. The  $P_{\text {out}}$  and power gain of the cell are studied, and the optimum operation point is determined. A proof-of-concept integrated PA is implemented in a 45-nm CMOS silicon-on-insulator (SOI) process, where stacking and parallel power combining techniques are adopted to achieve 18.7-dBm  $P_{\text {out}}$  and 4.8% PAE at 200 GHz.

This DPT can provide two optimum inductive values at two different frequency bands to optimally design the matching networks for each band without using any switch circuitries. It operates as the output and input matching networks in a parallel power combiner and divider, respectively. DPT-based PA breaks the trade-off between bandwidth and performance in conventional wideband PAs by separating one whole wideband into two narrow bands providing optimum input and output matchings for each band. The DPT-based PA has two input and two output ports. One set of input and output ports is dedicated to a lower frequency band and the other set of input and outport ports can be used for a higher frequency band. Each output port can drive a separate antenna in a phased array for each frequency band. The proposed PA prototype is fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process achieving 15.3 and 14.0 dBm of saturated output power in 28 and 39 GHz. The peak efficiency of the PA is 34.1% and 30.2% at 28 and 39 GHz frequency bands.

To address synchronization and interference issues in the conventional noncoherent transceiver with on&#8211;off keying (OOK) modulation, two techniques are proposed. The first one is twin-OOK (T-OOK) modulation, in which two pulses are used to represent 1-bit data. A short-duration synchronization pulse is employed for baseband synchronization, while a long-duration data pulse based on frequency-hopping (FH) OOK is employed for data transmission. The proposed modulation scheme not only addresses the synchronization problem of a transceiver baseband but also enhances the spectrum efficiency of a transmitter by adopting an FH method. The second one is uncertain-intermediate frequency (IF) down-conversion with quadrature demodulation. The quadrature uncertain-IF receiver achieves robust demodulation over frequency drift and good narrowband-interference (NBI) tolerance with an on-chip bandpass filter (BPF). In addition, ranging accuracy is enhanced with in-phase and quadrature (IQ) two-path signals. A prototype 6&#8211;8-GHz communication/ranging UWB transceiver is implemented in 65-nm CMOS. The transceiver achieves&#8211;71-dBm sensitivity at 10 Mb/s and 0.96-cm root-mean-square (rms) ranging accuracy. The transmitter and the receiver have the power consumption of 3.83 and 5.38 mW, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Highly Selective Receiver With Programmable Zeros and Second-Order TIA</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10352437</link><description>This article presents a wideband blocker tolerant receiver (RX) for fifth-generation (5G) user equipment applications. Two programmable zeros around the channel bandwidth are introduced to sufficiently suppress the close-in blockers of 5G applications. Since the effect of zeros gradually diminishes at larger out-of-band offset frequencies, an auxiliary current-sinking path is also introduced to reduce the RX input impedance at far-out offset frequencies. Moreover, a simple second-order transimpedance amplifier (TIA) is adopted to enhance the proposed RX selectivity. The utilized TIA synthesizes two complex conjugate poles to achieve a flat gain response and &#8722;40 dB/dec roll-off. A 40-nm CMOS RX prototype occupies 1.15mm2 and consumes 84&#8211;140mW from a 1.3-V supply voltage over the 0.5&#8211;3-GHz operating frequency range. The RX achieves a 160-MHz RF bandwidth, 2.6&#8211;4.2-dB noise figure, a &#8722;0.3-dBm blocker 1-dB compression point (B1dB), and an out-of-band third-order intercept point (IIP3) of 22.5 dBm. As a test case, using the 3GPP standard, a &#8722;15-dBm continuous wave (CW) close-in out-of-band blocker located at 85-MHz offset from the passband edges is applied to the RX. Thanks to the receiver&#8217;s high selectivity, the RX achieves 100% throughput while detecting 100-MS/s quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) signal with 16 dB higher power than the reference sensitivity.</description></item><item><title>A 16-GHz Background-Calibrated Duty-Cycled FMCW Charge-Pump PLL</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10325605</link><description>A 16-GHz charge-pump phase-locked loop (CP-PLL) for a robust duty-cycled frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar chirp generation is presented.

In this article, we presented an FD receiver (RX) with multi-domain SICs using capacitor stacking (CS)-based delay cell in the RF canceller which breaks the trade-off among delay, loss, form-factor, and noise. In addition, a delay bandwidth (BW) expansion method is proposed to break the limitation of delay BW product, which is demonstrated in the BB canceller. A prototype is fabricated in 65 nm CMOS process. The proposed FD RX can operate in 0.5&#8211;4 GHz with a gain of 29&#8211;32 dB. At 2 GHz local oscillator (LO) frequency, the RF canceller can achieve a delay of ~2&#8211;7.5 ns while consuming 10 mW. The baseband (BB) canceller can achieve a delay of 9&#8211;15 ns while consuming 4.4 mW. These large nanosecond-scale delays ensure 32&#8211;38 dB SIC over 20 MHz signal BW in case of applying a commercial circulator (isolation of 23&#8211;26 dB). In FD mode, the RF and BB cancellers degrade the RX noise figure (NF) by less than 0.9 and 0.4 dB at 2 GHz LO frequency, respectively. The RX power handling is improved by 11.5 dB. The active chip area is only 0.4 mm2.</description></item><item><title>A 30-&#956;W 94.7-dB SNDR Noise-Shaping Current-Mode Direct-to-Digital Converter Using Triple-Slope Quantizer for PPG/NIRS Readout</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10329563</link><description>This article presents a low-power, high-resolution, high dynamic range (DR) current-mode direct-to-digital converter (CM-DDC) using a noise-shaping triple-slope quantizer. Both thermal and quantization noises can be first-order shaped out of band, increasing the resolution effectively. High resolution can be realized without using a high sampling rate or high-order shaping architecture. A coarse-fine zoom style quantization is exploited, which reduces the conversion time and, thus, the power consumption of active circuit blocks with dynamic biasing. On the circuit level, a chopped current digital-to-analog converter (DAC) is proposed to reduce 1/ $f$  noise of the current DAC, enhancing the DR. The CM-DDC with light-emitting diode (LED) driver and digital control circuitry is implemented in a standard 55-nm CMOS process and characterized experimentally. The converter achieves a signal-to-noise and distortion-ratio (SNDR) of 94.7 dB and a cross-scale DR of 136.5 dB in 20-Hz bandwidth with 30- $\mu \text{W}$  power for photoplethysmography (PPG)/near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) applications. Thanks to the shortened conversion time, the converter&#8217;s sampling frequency and signal bandwidth can be adjusted to 200 Hz and 2 kHz, achieving 90.5- and 79.2-dB SNDR, respectively, which allows various current sensing applications. The proposed CM-DDC is also validated with on- body chest PPG measurement.</description></item><item><title>Enabling Online GaN Power Device Self-Health Monitoring With Analog SGD Supervised Learning and TJ-Independent Precursor Measurement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10320386</link><description>In order to mitigate reliability challenges on emerging wide-bandgap (WBG) gallium nitride (GaN) power devices, this article investigates a software&#8211;hardware codesign solution utilizing online device condition monitoring and machine-learning technologies, with an ultimate goal of achieving intelligent device self-health learning efficiently and effectively. Specifically, an on-die logarithm-based analog stochastic gradient descent (SGD) supervised learning engine is developed to train a GaN power circuit to establish and update its own device thermal model seamlessly through autonomously self-tested condition precursor  $r_{\text {DS}\_{}\text {ON}}$ . To remove the adverse temperature ( $T_{J}$ ) impact on condition monitoring efficacy, a nonintrusive online  $T_{J}$  sensing scheme is introduced by evaluating the ambient temperature ( $T_{A}$ ) and the instant power loss ( $P_{\text {LOSS}}$ ) to accomplish a truly  $T_{J}$ -independent precursor measurement.

Together with the customized digital controller, the proposed SC converter can enable  $C_{\mathrm {LOAD}}$ -free operation for fast and robust DVS transitions while relaxing the associated dynamic loss. We further investigate on an all NMOS power switch implementation to optimize both the DVS speed and switching loss. Fabricated in 65-nm CMOS, the proposed SC converter achieves step-down VCRs of 5:4/3/2/1. It can provide an output voltage  $V_{\mathrm {OUT}}$  from 0.16 to 0.96 V with an input voltage  $V_{\mathrm {IN}}$  of 1.2 V, while achieving a measured steady state peak power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 93.4%. The measured peak dynamic PCE when switching between 5:4 and 5:3 at a VCR transition frequency ( $f_{\mathrm {VCR\_{}TRAN}}$ ) of 100 kHz is 89.6%.

The resulting equation shows that the MPPT efficiency only depends on the rectifier duty cycle, and is independent of any other system variables, such as voltage bias-flipping efficiency, the open-circuit voltage from the harvester, vibration frequency, etc. As a result, MPPT can be achieved by regulating the duty cycle, simplifying circuit implementation, and achieving self-regulating and continuous MPPT. This design was fabricated in a 180-nm BCD process. The measured results show 98% peak MPPT efficiency and up to 738% output power enhancement.</description></item><item><title>A 27 W Wireless Power Transceiver With Compact Single-Stage Regulated Class-E Architecture and Adaptive ZVS Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10335186</link><description>This work presents a reconfigurable single-stage regulated Class-E (SSRE) wireless power transceiver that delivers 27 W for wireless charging at 6.78 MHz. The power stage of the transmitter merges a buck and a Class-E power amplifier (PA) into one conversion stage, saving one inductor and one capacitor with improved system efficiency. Instead of using a bulky external impedance tuning block to ensure a 50% duty cycle operating point, the proposed Class-E zero-voltage switching (ZVS) controller allows the Class-E stage to work at an adaptive duty cycle without an off-chip tuning circuit. The high voltage and high current stress of the Class-E stage is handled by a GaN transistor, the driver of which uses an NMOS transistor for the high-side switch that realizes a rising edge of 2.8 ns with no overshoot. For directly sensing high voltage without using a resistor divider, an HV-NMOS shielded push-pull comparator is designed. An adaptive dead time control based on a sample-and-hold (S/H) feedback loop is proposed to reduce reverse conduction and recovery loss of the buck stage. The proposed solution demonstrates good trade-off among power level, efficiency, and power density. The SSRE WPT system delivers a maximum dc output power of 27 W with an end-to-end (E2E) efficiency of 63.0% if the receiver uses a traditional passive rectifier. The peak E2E efficiency of 80.0% is achieved at dc output power of 9.5 W; furthermore, in a two-chip differential transmitter configuration, the maximum output power reaches 45 W, and the maximum E2E efficiency is 83.7%.</description></item><item><title>A Multimode 157 &#956;W 4-Channel 80 dBA-SNDR Speech Recognition Frontend With Direction-of-Arrival Correction Adaptive Beamformer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10327732</link><description>This work introduces a speech recognition frontend system that solves the problems of conventional adaptive beamforming (ABF) with: 1) low digital signal processing (DSP) power consumption (3 $\times $  lower than state-of-the-art ABF) thanks to an innovative greedy blocking matrix (GBM) employing simple calculations; 2) automatic direction-of-arrival (DOA) error compensation with direction tracking delay-and-sum beamformer aided by the GBM; 3) a multimode hybrid analog-to-digital converter (ADC) adapts to signal conditions; and 4) multimode beamforming takes advantage of high-signal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to reduce total power by 54%.

First, to reduce fabrication cost by eliminating a 32.768-kHz crystal, an on-chip real-time clock (RTC) using a machine-learning (ML)-based RC oscillator (RCO) calibration is proposed for the excellent frequency stability of the RTC; thus, it achieves a 0.68-ppm/&#176;C stability, nearly comparable to that of an RTC crystal, with the power consumption of 48.2  $\mu \text{W}$ . Second, to extend battery life through a fast start-up operation of the XO, the sampling phase-locked loop (S-PLL)-based injection technique reduces the start-up time and energy by 18.2 and 8.8 times, respectively, despite a high swing of 1.2 V. Finally, to mitigate a phase noise (PN) degradation according to a capacitive load ( ${\rm C_{L}}$ )-trimming of XO for the temperature compensation, a  ${\rm C_{L}}$ -dependent feedback resistor adjusting a 4kTR noise through a pulsewidth modulation is also proposed; thus, the 76.8-MHz XO accomplishes a PN of less than &#8722;158.2 dBc/Hz at 100-kHz offset while consuming the power of 1.08 mW. Consequently, the proposed single-XO-based CMIC meets all reference clock requirements of the system-on-chipset (SoC) and RF chipsets for 5G frequency range (FR)1 and FR2 communication.</description></item><item><title>Design of Dual Lower Bound Hysteresis Control in Switched-Capacitor DC&#8211;DC Converter for Optimum Efficiency and Transient Speed in Wide Loading Range for IoT Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10319457</link><description>This article proposes a dual lower bound hysteresis control (LBHC) method with frequency control for the design of switched-capacitor (SC) dc&#8211;dc converters in always-on Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. Conventional SC control methods often face a tradeoff between speed and efficiency. Efficiency is crucial for battery life, while speed is essential for system responsiveness. This article aims to use the proposed method to achieve frequency-independent regulation of the output dc level. This helps achieve a fast response time at the system level by tuning controller frequencies without compromising stability. Furthermore, the proposed dual LBHC loop guides frequency and power scaling, ensuring consistent efficiency over a wide range of load currents through two clock-gated comparator operations per clock cycle. By analyzing the operating principle, this article also discovered that designing the dual LBHC based on its maximum load current point can guarantee its stability over the entire load range. To illustrate this concept, a fully integrated 2:1 capacitive dc&#8211;dc converter was implemented using a 180-nm CMOS process. The results demonstrate guaranteed efficiency of at least 75% across load current ranges up to  $228\times $ , with a peak efficiency of 80.4%. In addition, an active response time of 80 ns is achieved during load transients ranging from 0.04 to 4 mA.</description></item><item><title>A 10-Gb/s Wireline Receiver Using Linear Baud-Rate CDR and Analog Equalizer for Free Space Optical Communication Over 10- and 100-m Distances</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10387436</link><description>Free-space wireless optical communication (FSO), which adopts the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology, transmits and receives various data and wavelength combinations on a single channel. The mixed data and wavelengths are separated by WDM demodulation using the different refraction of light. Due to chromatic dispersion, the phase of the arriving optical signal would depend on the wavelength. Therefore, clock and data recovery (CDR) is required to determine the optimum sampling point in FSO-WDM systems. The proposed baud-rate CDR uses an integrator to generate a clock phase at the data center. Because the integrator output determines early or late signals, the proposed CDR does not require any reference voltage or additional clock phase. The proposed analog equalizer (AEQ) of the receiver in the front end compensates for the inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by the electrical-to-optical converter, atmospheric channel, and optical-to-electrical converter. The AEQ reduces the ISI by using a feedback loop. The prototype receiver achieved a bit error rate (BER) of 10&#8722;11 regardless of the wavelength thanks to the proposed AEQ and baud rate CDR in FSO-WDM system over 10- and 100-m distances. The power efficiency and area of the proposed receiver were 3.8 pJ/bit and 0.147 mm2, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Voltage Level Detection for Near-VTH Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10251163</link><description>Voltage level detectors (VLD) are used to monitor the supply voltage in integrated circuits (ICs) to determine when the system can initiate computation. The VLD must detect its own supply voltage, which is more challenging for low-voltage applications such as near- $V_{\mathrm {TH}}$  computing (NVTC), which also requires low latency and rapid supply changes; furthermore, internal races in the VLD may cause false indications or glitches in the system and should be prevented by design. This work presents a glitch-free VLD that can detect supplies as low as 385 mV at a power of 217 nW and a measured latency of 10  $\mu \text{s}$ . This was achieved by inserting a deterministic delay into one of the internal nodes, as well as low-voltage circuitry. The circuit is fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process and occupies a footprint of 6900  $\mu \text{m}^{2}$  with a measured temperature drift of 105  $\mu \text{W}/^{\circ }\text{C}$  and a sigma variation of 8 mV across 32 units. These characteristics make the circuit attractive for the near-threshold computing segment.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Comparison of Logic Architectures for Digital Circuits in a-IGZO Thin-Film Transistor Technologies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10345652</link><description>In this work, five different logic architectures [diode-load (DL), dual-input diode-load (DINP-DL), pseudo-CMOS (P-CMOS), crossover, and differential] for digital circuits in amorphous indium-gallium-zinc-oxide (a-IGZO) thin-film transistor (TFT) technologies are analyzed and compared.

However, they also face integration and current-sharing challenges. To tackle these challenges, this article presents an all-digital dual-loop distributed LDO with one global controller (GC) and multiple scalable local voltage regulators (LVRs). For fully synthesizable and easy integration, all the control circuits are implemented using standard digital cells. In each LVR, we use a 5-bit time-to-digital converter (TDC) for fast local voltage sensing. The global integral loop provides the dynamic reference bits for all the LVRs, compensating the TDC PVT variations in the LVRs. This all-digital comparator-TDC quantizer, combined with coarse-fine tuning and asynchronous window control, enables the proposed LDO architecture to obtain high output accuracy and one-cycle transient response. For current balancing in distributed scenarios, we introduce a digital primary-secondary one-time calibration scheme to tackle the mismatches among the local TDCs. A distributed LDO prototype with one GC and nine LVRs is implemented in a 28-nm bulk CMOS process. Measurements with one LVR and multiple LVRs demonstrate the stability and scalability of the proposed architecture. With nine LVRs, the measured droop is 54 mV under a 1.35-A/10-ns sharp load step. We also obtain a good load regulation of 3 mV/A, a peak current efficiency of 99.67%, and a current density of 16.7 A/mm2.</description></item><item><title>A 28.8-mW Accelerator IC for Dark Channel Prior-Based Blind Image Deblurring</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10374412</link><description>This work presents an accelerator that performs blind deblurring based on the dark channel prior. The alternating minimization algorithm is leveraged for latent image and blur kernel estimation. A 2-D Laplace equation solver is embedded to reduce the latency by 56% for boundary wrapping. For latent image estimation, gradient data locality is employed to reduce the latency by 57%. A sorting engine is designed to reduce the latency in data access by 96% for calculating the dark channel. A pipelined mixed-radix 1-D fast Fourier transform (FFT) engine is used for efficient latent image estimation and blur kernel estimation. By employing image size approximation, 85% of additions and 97% of multiplications for FFT can further be saved. In the blur kernel estimator, a 2-D convolution engine with a parallel architecture is implemented, reducing the latency by 79%. The accelerator supports blur kernels of  $25\times 25$  and  $49\times 49$  pixels for blurred images of  $129\times 129$  and  $257\times 257$  pixels, respectively.

However, SRAM-based CiM cells have rather low density and thus very limited total on-chip memory capacity. This fact, unfortunately, results in undesired weight data reload operations from the off-chip dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) in data-intensive scenarios and may even tarnish the energy efficiency of CiM at the task level. Therefore, exploration toward higher density CiM in CMOS is critical to ensure truly high energy efficiency in practice. Aligned with the goal of ultrahigh density, this article presents the first one-transistor (1T) multi-level-cell (MLC) read-only memory (ROM) CiM macro for multi-bit MAC. The highlights of the proposed ROM CiM techniques include: 1) multi-source-driven (MSD) 1T-MLC ROM; 2) charge-domain capacitor sharing (CDCS) for ultrahigh CiM memory density; and 3) ROM-based transfer-learning architectures to provide flexible support of different tasks with minor accuracy degradation. These techniques are demonstrated with a fabricated 2-Mb 1T-MLC ROM CiM macro for 8 b  $\times $  8 b MAC computing. This macro features a record-high cell density of 0.096- $\mu \text{m}^{2}$ /bit and a macro weight density of 3984 kb/mm2 in a 65-nm pure CMOS technology. It also achieves 3.8 $\times $ &#8211;55.3 $\times $  lower energy consumption per image inference than the state-of-the-art CiM macros when considering the possible DRAM access.</description></item><item><title>A 28-nm 50.1-TOPS/W P-8T SRAM Compute-In-Memory Macro Design With BL Charge-Sharing-Based In-SRAM DAC/ADC Operations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10335178</link><description>This article presents a low-cost PMOS-based 8T (P-8T) static random access memory (SRAM) compute-in-memory (CIM) macro that efficiently reduces the hardware cost associated with a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). By utilizing the bitline (BL) charge-sharing technique, the area and power consumption of the proposed DAC have been reduced while achieving similar conversion linearity compared to a conventional DAC. The BL charge-sharing also facilitates the multiply-accumulate (MAC) operation to produce variation-tolerant and linear outputs. To reduce ADC area and power consumption, a 4-bit coarse-fine flash ADC has been collaboratively used with an in-SRAM reference voltage generation, where the ADC reference voltages are generated in the same way as the MAC operation mechanism. Moreover, to find the suitable ADC sample range and resolution for our CIM macro, a CIM noise-considered accuracy simulation has been conducted. Based on the simulation results, a 4-bit ADC resolution with a cutoff ratio of 0.5 is chosen, maintaining high accuracy. The 256  $\times $  80 P-8T SRAM CIM prototype chip has been fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process. By leveraging charge-domain computing, the proposed CIM operates in a wide range of supply voltage from 0.6 to 1.2 V with an energy efficiency of 50.1-TOPS/W at 0.6 V. The accuracies of 91.26% and 65.20% are measured for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, respectively. Compared to the state-of-the-art SRAM CIM works, this work improves energy efficiency by 1.2 $\times $  and area efficiency by 6.5 $\times $  due to the reduced analog circuit hardware costs.</description></item><item><title>MACC-SRAM: A Multistep Accumulation Capacitor-Coupling In-Memory Computing SRAM Macro for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10322874</link><description>This article presents multistep accumulation capacitor coupling static random-access memory (MACC-SRAM), capacitor-based in-memory computing (IMC) SRAM macro for 4-b deep convolutional neural network (DNN) inference. The macro can simultaneously activate all its 128  $\times $  128 custom 9T1C bitcells to perform the vector-matrix multiplication (VMM). MACC-SRAM also integrates 128 stepwise-charging and discharging input drivers (SCD-IDRs) to efficiently convert the digital codes of the input activations into analog voltages in a 2-b serial fashion. As a result, it can save up to 66% of the capacitor-driving energy. Also, the macro adopts an adder-first architecture to reduce the analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion overhead for the analog-mixed-signal (AMS) computation. The partial sums of the four adjacent rows, representing different bit positions in the 4-b weights, are first accumulated with an analog switched-capacitor adder and then converted to digital codes by a 6-bit successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Compared with the ADC-first architecture, where partial sums of each row are first converted to digital codes and then accumulated in the digital domain, the adder-first architecture can save 60.7% of the area and 66.7% of the energy consumption of the A/D conversion. Moreover, the co-optimization of the DNN model by increasing the sparsity further reduces 39.4% of the capacitor-driving energy with a neglectable 0.4% DNN accuracy loss. We prototyped the macro in 28 nm technology, and the measurement shows an energy efficiency of 163 tera-operations per second per watt (TOPS/W) and a throughput of 211 giga-operations per second (GOPS) for a 4-b/4-b DNN model under 0.9 V supply, among the highest of the recent IMC SRAMs.</description></item><item><title>eDRAM-CIM: Reconfigurable Charge Domain Compute-In-Memory Design With Embedded Dynamic Random Access Memory Array Realizing Adaptive Data Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10310140</link><description>This article presents a compute-in-memory (CIM) architecture for a large-scale machine learning (ML) accelerator, which employs  $1T1C$  embedded dynamic random access memory (eDRAM) bitcells as charge domain circuits for convolution neural network (CNN) multiply-accumulation-averaging (MAV) computations. By repurposing existing  $1T1C$  eDRAM columns to construct an adaptive data converter, dot-product, averaging, pooling, and rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation on the memory array, the eDRAM-CIM design eliminates the need for an extra dedicated hardware accelerator, which significantly reduces the hardware implementation cost and increases the reconfigurability of the CIM computation circuit. In the eDRAM-CIM design, 8 b digital inputs from image pixel values are converted to analog domain directly on eDRAM columns. The dot-product is computed without disturbing the kernel weights, which are stored in the eDRAM array, preventing data duplication and additional intra-memory data movement. In addition, the convolution results are transferred back to the digital domain using an in-eDRAM adaptive dynamic range successive-approximation (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) utilizing a narrow range of dot-product distribution to reduce ADC latency and energy. A 16 Kb eDRAM-CIM prototype, implemented in the 65 nm CMOS process, demonstrates the concept and the functionality of the test-chip using the CIFAR-10 dataset with 8 b input and 8 b signed weight, achieving 90.77% accuracy, 4.71 GOPS throughput, 4.76 TOPS/W energy efficiency, and 8.26 GOPS/mm2. A scalability analysis is developed to show that the presented eDRAM-CIM approach, which was adopted in an advanced eDRAM technology node, shows promising energy efficiency (11.21 TOPS/W) and throughput (22.2 TOPS), suggesting its potential for application in large-scale energy-efficient CIM designs.</description></item><item><title>HGRP: A 181-&#956; W Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition Processor Based on Bi-Directional Convolution and Iteration-Free Feature Clustering</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10412130</link><description>Hand gesture recognition (HGR) has become a prevalent human&#8211;computer interaction (HCI) approach on smart edge devices.

On the algorithm aspect, this work utilizes color- and depth-based hand segmentation for better background removal under complex backgrounds. In addition, the proposed bi-directional convolution-based feature extraction (FE) improves the rotation resistance, and the iteration-free feature clustering scheme reduces processing latency. On the hardware aspect, the adaptive activation of the gesture recognition core (GRC) reduces the dynamic power of the system by eliminating unnecessary signal toggling.

The number of applications that use negative-R to compensate for the DC-gain, unity gain bandwidth (UGB), and noise of operational amplifiers (op-amps) is increasing. However, due to process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variations, conventional negative-R has limitations in providing ideal compensation. Therefore, this paper presents an auto-tuning (AT) negative-R that can automatically calibrate for PVT variations, overcoming the limitations caused by mismatching issues in conventional negative-R. The proposed single-bit 3rd-order CTDSM applies AT negative-R to the first integrator, resulting in consistent and optimal integrator performance.

The design utilizes a current reuse approach in the process voltage temperature (PVT) resistant complementary transimpedance amplifier (TIA) to achieve excellent noise performance while minimizing power consumption. Besides, the integration of a second-order Twin-T Elliptic Low-pass Notch filter (TTE-LPNF) followed by the TIA enhances the linearity performance of the receiver and helps achieve wideband response due to positive capacitive feedback and shunting notch. The active RC-based buffer circuit is designed to efficiently drive a  $50~\Omega $  load impedance while providing substantial bandwidth.

The proposed OPA enables achieving output power back-off (OBO) compensation without affecting the saturation matching. Then, the circuit structure is simplified by introducing a post-matching circuit to integrate the combiner and the reactive compensation network (RCN). Moreover, a simplified dual-impedance matching network (DIMN) is placed between each transistor and the output combiner, leading to increased OBO range with improved efficiency. This technique not only takes into consideration the influence of parasitic parameters but also match the required impedance at both saturation and OBO points, simultaneously. The above design idea is successfully verified by using the gallium nitride (GaN) high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) to develop an OPA circuit operating at 2.6 GHz, providing 45.2 dBm of peak output power.

However, voltage scaling will degrade the radiation-aware reliability of traditional latch obviously. In addition, although the shrinkage of feature sizes results in the reduction of latch area, the occurrence possibility of double node upset (DNU) and triple node upset (TNU) events are increasing. Achieving a good balance among delay, power, area and reliability performance is becoming an important issue in the design of radiation-hardened latches, especially considering the coming commercial aerospace applications. Therefore, this paper proposes a TNU self-recoverable latch with wide voltage range (TRLW), which is low overhead and very suitable for UDVS technique. The TRLW latch is mainly composed of two completely interlocking triangle structures, and is able to self-recover from any possible TNU event. Clock-gated isolated cells are skillfully utilized to avoid current conflict. Meanwhile, six transmission gates are carefully integrated into TRLW latch to reduce the propagation delay  ${t}_{d2q}$  and critical path delay  ${t}_{crit}$ . Accordingly, the overall performance of TRLW latch is always excellent from normal voltage to near-threshold voltage (NTV). Simulation results based on 28nm CMOS process show that TRLW latch can achieve complete SNU, DNU and TNU self-recovery in all possible cases, and the soft error rate of TRLW latch only raises by 4.6% when the supply voltage is decreased from 0.9 V to 0.3 V. Moreover, compared with the other reported TNU self-recovery latches, TRLW latch consistently achieves the minimum delay, power, area and delay-power-area product (DPAP) under different process, voltage and temperature (PVT) conditions, and obtains average reductions of  $3.43\times $ ,  $3.03\times $ ,  $2.66\times $ ,  $1.40\times $  and  $10.83\times $  for  ${t}_{d2q}$ ,  ${t}_{crit}$ , power, area and DPAP when operating from 0.5 V to 1.0 V.</description></item><item><title>AxOCS: Scaling FPGA-Based Approximate Operators Using Configuration Supersampling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504662</link><description>The rising usage of AI/ML-based processing across application domains has exacerbated the need for low-cost ML implementation, specifically for resource-constrained embedded systems. To this end, approximate computing, an approach that explores the power, performance, area (PPA), and behavioral accuracy (BEHAV) trade-offs, has emerged as a possible solution for implementing embedded machine learning. Due to the predominance of MAC operations in ML, designing platform-specific approximate arithmetic operators forms one of the major research problems in approximate computing. Recently, there has been a rising usage of AI/ML-based design space exploration techniques for implementing approximate operators. However, most of these approaches are limited to using ML-based surrogate functions for predicting the PPA and BEHAV impact of a set of related design decisions. While this approach leverages the regression capabilities of ML methods, it does not exploit the more advanced approaches in ML. To this end, we propose AxOCS, a methodology for designing approximate arithmetic operators through ML-based supersampling. Specifically, we present a method to leverage the correlation of PPA and BEHAV metrics across operators of varying bit-widths for generating larger bit-width operators. The proposed approach involves traversing the relatively smaller design space of smaller bit-width operators and employing its associated Design-PPA-BEHAV relationship to generate initial solutions for metaheuristics-based optimization for larger operators. The experimental evaluation of AxOCS for FPGA-optimized approximate operators shows that the proposed approach significantly improves the quality&#8212;resulting hypervolume for multi-objective optimization&#8212;of  $8\times 8$  signed approximate multipliers.</description></item><item><title>Sparsity-Aware In-Memory Neuromorphic Computing Unit With Configurable Topology of Hybrid Spiking and Artificial Neural Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478711</link><description>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have shown great potential in achieving high energy efficiency and low power consumption compared to artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, there remains a significant accuracy gap between SNNs and ANNs. To address this issue, we present an in-memory neuromorphic computing (IMNC) chip that supports hybrid spiking/artificial neural networks (S/ANNs) and sparsity-aware data flows. With the IMNC chip, we aim to improve inference accuracy while simultaneously achieving high energy efficiency through optimization at the algorithm, architecture, and circuit levels. First, at the algorithm level, we note that SNNs extract temporal features from input spikes using time-domain convolution operations. Based on this insight, we efficiently utilize leaky integrate (LI) neurons to hybridize SNNs and ANNs, thereby improving accuracy while maintaining highly sparse operations. Second, at the architecture level, we design a sparsity-aware architecture that supports a hybrid S/ANN topology with varying sparsity. Finally, at the circuit level, we propose a ring-based in-memory computing (IMC) macro, whose energy consumption is inversely proportional to the input sparsity, making it ideal for performing energy-efficient multiplication and accumulation (MAC) operations in both SNNs and ANNs. We evaluate the proposed hybrid S/ANNs on various classification tasks and demonstrate their stronger classification and generalization ability compared with pure SNNs. Notably, our IMNC chip, fabricated using 22 nm CMOS technology, achieves impressive measured accuracy rates of over 95% for voice activity detection (VAD) and ECG anomaly detection. Additionally, our IMNC chip demonstrates superior dynamic energy efficiency of 0.43 pJ per synaptic operation, outperforming related works.</description></item><item><title>An RF Modulation Based on k-th Order PWM Harmonic</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10477945</link><description>A Sub-Nyquist Radio Frequency Pulse Width Modulation (RFPWM) technique, which extends the concept of Sub-Nyquist DACs to RFPWM, is introduced in this paper. The carrier frequency is selected as the  ${k}$ -th order harmonic of the PWM switching frequency. This choice enables operation within an extended frequency range for a particular switching transistor in contrast to the conventional RFPWM approach, where the carrier and switching frequencies are identical. The feasibility of this methodology is verified by both extensive simulations and experimental measurements. While there is a reduction in output power proportional to the harmonic number, this approach has the potential to set the transmitted power to these fixed steps in an all-digital format without compromising spectral performance, as evidenced by comprehensive simulations. Furthermore, the method exhibits strong spectral performance within and outside the desired frequency bands across different quantization scenarios, covering carrier frequencies up to four times the switching frequency. The proof of concept for Sub-Nyquist RFPWM transmitter is a fully digital field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation, enabling adaptability to multistandard signals. The pulse position/pulse-width modulation is based on an outphasing approach, using the FPGA transceivers to generate the high-speed binary waveform. Measurements were carried out using a 1.4-MHz LTE 64-QAM signal with a PWM switching frequency of 311 MHz, achieving ACPR values below &#8722;39 dBc when the second and third harmonics were used as carrier frequencies (622 MHz and 933 MHz, respectively).</description></item><item><title>Impact of Aging and Process Variability on SRAM-Based In-Memory Computing Architectures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10493861</link><description>As the SRAM-based In-memory Computing (IMC) paradigm arises as a promising candidate to break the memory wall bottleneck and deliver optimal energy efficiency, reliability has been paid less attention. Serious reliability issues that concern a conventional SRAM cell includes increased process variations as well as the dominant transistor aging mechanisms, such as Bias Temperature Instability (BTI) and Hot Carrier Injection (HCI) phenomena. These degradation impacts the speed, noise margin and input offset voltage a SRAM structure. Though the vulnerability of a SRAM cell to transistor aging has been extensively studied in the literature, there is still missing information on how aging impacts the SRAM-based IMC architectures along with the process variability. In this work, through simulation, we present a comprehensive study on impact of aging and process variability on commonly employed SRAM-based 6T- and 8T- IMC architectures. In the current study, degradation&#8217;s stochastic behavior is examined by coupling process fluctuations brought on by aging. The confluences of two degradation mechanisms help to identify the worst-case failures. This study serves as one of the first ones that provide BTI induced aging analysis on multiple IMC logic operations and offer perspectives for designing robust SRAM-based IMC based architectures.</description></item><item><title>A 32-Bit Ripple-Ling Hybrid Carry Adder</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10409891</link><description>The low-order bits of the Ling adder are not on the critical path, eliminating the need for a carry lookahead method to calculate their output sums. In this paper, we propose a hybrid carry adder that combines high-order Ling and low-order ripple techniques. The low 11 bits of the adder utilize a ripple-carry structure, while the high 21 bits employ a Ling-based parallel prefix structure. This approach simplifies the low-order sum circuit without compromising the critical path length of the adder. Furthermore, new intermediate variables are introduced to facilitate Shannon expansion and enable efficient implementation of the output sum. This ensures that the control signal of the output MUX maintains a delay consistent with its input signal. The output sum circuit is further custom designed using reusable logic circuits. The proposed adder is verified using the conventional 180 nm and 28 nm processes, as well as the advanced 14 nm FinFET process, with the layout area as  $4557.5 \mu \text{m}^{2}$ ,  $193.2 \mu \text{m}^{2}$ , and  $73.8 \mu \text{m}^{2}$ , respectively. Testing results show that the maximum delay is 0.83 ns, 0.312 ns, and 0.183 ns respectively for the adder using 180 nm, 28 nm, and 14 nm processes respectively. The proposed adder provides an area optimization of approximately 10%~30% and optimizations of 10% in power and speed compared to the conventional Ling adder.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Latency Power Series Approximate Computing and Architecture for Co-Calculation of Division and Square Root</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10454097</link><description>The calculation of division and square root is widely used in edge computing related to image processing, clustering, recognition, and reconstruction, among others. Their common multi-stage serial calculation takes longer, and requires a higher latency, and more redundant hardware resources for multi-dimensional parallel computations. This work proposes a low-latency power series approximate digital computing (PSADIC) paradigm and architecture, which achieves a fast low-latency calculation of multi-dimensional mathematical expressions, focusing on the co-calculation of division and square root. This approach allows to compute not only the division and the square root, but also the inverse and the inverse square root. Moreover, serial and pipelined architectures have been designed here to achieve smaller areas and lower latencies, respectively. Compared to the multi-stage calculation with CORDIC (COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer), the mean relative error distance (MRED) is reduced by 67% in PSADIC. Under TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) 40nm CMOS technology, the proposed serial and pipelined architectures achieve a 66.67% overall latency reduction compared to the CORDIC when using both its own maximum clock frequency, and a 75% cycle latency reduction.

However, the hardware performance of GCNs is often bounded by random and non-continuous memory accesses due to the sparse graph data, which incur high latency and high power consumption. The emerging computing-in-memory (CIM) architecture significantly reduces the overhead of data movements, which is suitable for memory-intensive GCN acceleration. Existing analog-based CIM solutions require a large amount of analog-to-digital (AD) and digital-to-analog (DA) conversions, which dominate the overall area and power consumption. Furthermore, the analog non-ideality can degrade accuracy and reliability of CIM. To address these challenges, this work proposes a digital CIM accelerator based on SRAM, called DCIM-GCN, to accelerate GCN algorithm. DCIM-GCN introduces innovations on three levels: circuit, architecture, and algorithm. At the circuit level, digital CIM is proposed with SRAM sub-arrays to eliminate the power and area expensive AD/DA converters. Furthermore, we have incorporated the multi-address feature into the digital CIM, thereby leveraging its ability to efficiently process sparse matrix multiplication. At the architecture level, the sparsity-aware computation engine takes advantage of sparsity in GCNs and leverages CIM to minimize memory accesses and data movements. Finally, at the algorithm level, the balance mapping algorithm tackles workload imbalance issues, while the vertex reorder algorithm reduces idle states for aggregation engines, resulting in increased hardware utilization. Our DCIM-GCN achieves  $1.89\times $  and  $2.42\times $  speedup and  $4.58\times $  and  $9.46\times $  energy efficiency improvement on average over other CIM-based graph accelerators, e.g., PASGCN and PIM-GCN, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A 593nJ/Inference DVS Hand Gesture Recognition Processor Embedded With Reconfigurable Multiple Constant Multiplication Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10506245</link><description>Hand gesture recognition (HGR) is a popular technique for edge-based human-computer interaction. Dynamic vision sensors (DVS) are often used in HGR systems due to their low latency, high dynamic range, low energy consumption, and asynchronous event triggering. While Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are commonly thought to consume less energy than Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in DVS-based HGR systems, this work demonstrates that a DVS-based HGR system on chip (SoC) incorporating CNN can achieve lower power consumption through algorithm and hardware co-design. The proposed edge-side processor for DVS-based HGR integrates a median filter processing core and an AI accelerator core for preprocessing and CNN inference on the DVS output data. To reduce hardware costs without sacrificing accuracy, the median filtering core uses a simplified median filtering function tailored to the specific application scenario. The paper suggests using reconfigurable multiple constant multiplication (RMCM) techniques for the AI accelerator core to share computational resources among processing element (PE) arrays, thereby reducing computational costs and power consumption. The entire DVS gesture processor was implemented in a 65nm technology, achieving an energy requirement of 593.4nJ per inference on-chip with a guaranteed accuracy of 92.4%.</description></item><item><title>Low-Power Row Driver for Digitally Driven OLEDoS Microdisplay</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10415282</link><description>Microdisplays are a key component in many contemporary portable electronic systems.

Power supply noise is strongly related to the design quality of the power distribution network and the activity of transient currents. In this paper, a method for estimating the worst-case voltage supply based on the ramp time of the transient current is proposed. At the same time, the worst-case current activity can also be obtained which can be used to guide the core or field programmable gate array (FPGA) design for a given power distribution network. The ramp current is first encoded and divided into segments. Then, two dynamic matrices are used to track the worst-case accumulated voltage noise and worst-case current activities. The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art approaches showing consistent advantages in estimating the worst-case power supply noise. Its accuracy is also validated by comparing the simulated and measured data.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Distributed H&#8734; Current Sharing Consensus Optimal Control of DC Microgrids via Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10444694</link><description>Distributed control of DC microgrid is becoming more and more important in modern power system. An important control goal is to ensure voltage stability and current sharing of DC bus. In the presence of constant power loads and uncertainties, a novel distributed quadratic optimum control technique based on reinforcement learning (RL) is developed in order to ensure correct current sharing and adequate performance. Firstly, the system model with power coupling is established and transformed into a linear heterogeneous multi-agent system (MAS) with unknown disturbances. Subsequently, a neural network (NN)-based adaptive model-free observer is developed. Since not all followers have direct access to the leader&#8217;s information, a distributed cooperation performance index with discount component is created by fusing the dynamics of the observer and the follower. The  $Q$ -learning technique is applied to obtain the optimal control strategy to achieve voltage stabilization and current sharing without using system dynamics. Finally, simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of this strategy.</description></item><item><title>Finite-Time Decentralized Sliding Mode Control for Interconnected Systems and Its Application to Electrical Power Systems: A GA-Assisted Design Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10444614</link><description>This paper addresses the problem of finite-time decentralized sliding mode control (SMC) for interconnected systems under Round-Robin communication protocol.

The most recent VLC communication standards specify orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) as the underlying modulation due to its spectral efficiency and compatibility with existing broadband modems. However, a key challenge remains in realizing VLC modulators capable of generating OFDM signal compatible with the primary illumination function, while ensuring the efficacy of the luminaires. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to integrate OFDM modulation into a switching power supply. Commutating diodes in the DC/DC converter are replaced by light-emitting diodes (LEDs) which are used for communication while the larger illumination string of LEDs is left unmodulated preserving the quality of illumination and luminaire lifetime. Biasing the switching MOSFET to its saturation region during its off states allows for the MOSFET to act as an amplifier, amplifying the OFDM communication signal and injecting it to the light-emitting commutating diode (LECD). As a result, energy efficient LED drivers capable of OFDM signal transmission are realized. Both simulation and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, showcasing superior performance compared to existing literature in terms of component count, efficacy, illumination quality, and reliability. Notably, based on simulation results, the efficacy of our approach surpasses the bias-T approach by approximately 6.25%.</description></item><item><title>Observerless Output Feedback Control of DC-DC Converters Feeding a Class of Unknown Nonlinear Loads via Power Shaping</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10460357</link><description>In microgrids, DC-DC converters play an important role in energy conversion.

Targeting an average output power of few  $\mu $ W with a peak output power requirement of a few mW in each output channel, the proposed converter transfers constant-charge to its outputs in a complete switching cycle. Multiple IoT nodes are serviced in a time-division multiplexing under discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) of operation for minimizing the cross-regulation issue. An internal priority sequencing logic ensures reliable power-up sequencing during startup.

Counting the edges produced by the VCO and feeding them back in the loop imposes a design challenge in terms of latency and silicon area. This can be circumvented by including in the loop a subset of VCO phases, and by increasing the resolution by means of digital filtering, as in a Leslie-Singh architecture. Using a small subset of VCO phases produces modulation side bands at mid frequencies, especially in high speed applications. By proper digital filtering, modulation side bands are pushed up to high frequencies as if all the VCO phases were used in the loop. This is investigated and proved. A simulation example is also given to show that simple filtering can be enough to attenuate those modulation side bands in practical applications.</description></item><item><title>A Miniaturized Filtering Power Divider With High Selectivity and Wide Stopband Based on 3-D Heterogeneous Integration Technology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10402054</link><description>Based on a novel circuit of the lumped filtering power divider (FPD), a miniaturized FPD with wide stopband, high selectivity and high isolation using 3D heterogeneous integration technology is proposed. The lumped circuit can realize the filtering characteristics of transmission zeros (TZs) controllable, bandwidth controllable, and rejection controllable. 3D heterogeneous integration technology in this brief is the integration of organic substrates and integrated passive device technology by the bump flip-chip technique.

The sub-ADC achieves 2 GS/s conversion rate in 28 nm CMOS technology and uses pipelined structure to have high resolution at the same time. In the adopted sample-and-hold amplifier-less (SHA-less) pipeline, a comparator-based correction method is proposed to solve the associated aperture error in the frontend stage where input is sampled at the latch node. By tunning the path bandwidth, rather than using delay line in comparator clock path, the output spreading related to aperture error is reduced by the proposed tunning method to offset-limited level up to 4 GHz input frequency. The modified reference buffer in the ADC reuses the existing transconductance and improves its power efficiency when driving the pipeline stages. Buffers and digital calibrations are implemented on-chip to help wideband high-speed operation and to correct non-idealities in analog circuits. The fabricated ADC chip achieves 59.7 dB SNDR, 60.3 dB SNR and 69.3 dBc SFDR at 1.95 GHz input frequency. The input bandwidth is above 5 GHz.

Pitch-matching analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) to dense memory pitches limits the area and achievable precision of ADCs. Consequently, CIM literature focuses on increasing MAC effective-number-of-bits (ENOB) by performing quantisation with lower step-size (to reduce error variance), clipping the long tail of the MAC probability density function (PDF) in the process. This brief proposes an alternative, which is to quantise the input-conditioned MAC- PDF (CMPDF), which is the MAC distribution resulting from a given input. A one-shot CMPDF location technique is detailed, which enables the proposed input-conditioned MAC quantisation (ICQ) scheme. Various DNN s are implemented in state-of-the-art clipped quantisation technique (Optimal Clipping Criterion) and compared against ICQ. Results show that DNNs employing ICQ see accuracy improvement over DNNs that do not employ ICQ by 1.6 &#8211; 39.4% at iso-ADC precision. DNN layers implemented using ICQ saw an improvement in MAC ENOB up to 4.3 bits over the precision of the employed quantiser (ADC), which is upto 2.2 bits more than the OCC result for the same.</description></item><item><title>Transceiver for Ultrasonic Intra-Body Area Networks With Non-Coherent BPSK Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10411990</link><description>This brief presents a transceiver for an Ultrasonic Intra-Body Area Network (UIBAN) enabling regular monitoring of low data rate bio-signals.

Unlike conventional RTL-to-GDS flows that heavily focus on utilizing commercial 2-D design tools, our design flow delves deep into the suboptimal issues inherent in implementing cross-tier connections, which are not adequately addressed by 2-D tools. Our proposed flow provides seamless optimization for such connections through three key design stages following pseudo-3D placement: 1) 3-D routing-aware tier partitioning that induces subtle imbalances in cell area distribution between tiers to maximize the utilization of monolithic intertier vias (MIVs); 2) MIV-guided detailed placement that optimizes the placement by strategically utilizing reserved whitespace for enhanced 3-D connections; and 3) MIV-aware 3-D routing that takes full advantage of the fine-tuned placement result. Experiment results using open-source benchmark circuits in advanced 7-nm technology nodes show that our proposed M3D design flow achieves up to 9.92% wirelength reduction per 3-D net, resulting in 76.70% improvement in worst negative slack, and an equivalently improved 60.28% energy-delay-product over the state-of-the-art M3D design flow on average even with challenging design conditions.

To achieve this, we propose incorporating a performance monitoring counter (PMC)-based power model into thermal control, which enables a more accurate evaluation of the CPU&#8217;s power consumption. We demonstrate the plausibility of this approach using polynomial regression based on Moore&#8217;s Law. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight PMC sampling method that can collect multiple PMCs at once in the kernel space, reducing sampling overhead. By replacing the utilization-based model in the original the intelligent power allocation (IPA) with a PMC-based power model, we realize the PMC-based IPA governor can be ported to real mobile devices. After updating the thermal control governor in the Linux kernel, we perform tests on our PMC-based IPA using a mobile phone device. We compare it with Stepwise and IPA, which are commonly used in current mobile phone systems. We choose the CPU-intensive workbench, I/O-intensive workbench, and CPU and I/O-intensive hybrid workbench as workloads. The results show that PMC-based IPA effectively reduces energy consumption while improving performance. In particular, during the CPU and I/O-intensive hybrid experiment, where CPU-intensive and I/O-intensive tasks are executed alternately, PMC-based IPA reduces the running time by 10.0% and energy consumption by 16.6% compared to the original IPA. In order to verify the benefits of PMC-based IPA, mobile phone testing software AI Bench and Antutu are utilized. The results show that our scheme is able to control temperature more precisely than IPA and achieves a better score while consuming less energy, particularly during AI computing. These experiment results suggest that PMC-based IPA is valuable for practical use.</description></item><item><title>CoMN: Algorithm-Hardware Co-Design Platform for Nonvolatile Memory-Based Convolutional Neural Network Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10413506</link><description>Computing in memory (CIM) convolutional neural network (CNN) accelerators based on nonvolatile memory (NVM) show great potential to improve energy efficiency and throughput, while the multiple design levels and huge design space of CIM-based CNN acceleration system make cross-level co-design methodology and platforms extremely desired.

It is designed with the goal of maximizing energy efficiency per classification. TULIP is constructed by arranging a collection of unique processing elements (TULIP-PEs) in a single-instruction&#8211;multiple-data (SIMD) fashion. Each TULIP-PE contains binary neurons that are interconnected using multiplexers. Each neuron also has a small dedicated local register connected to it. The binary neurons are implemented as standard cells and used for implementing threshold functions, i.e., an inner-product and thresholding operation on its binary inputs. The neurons can be reconfigured with a single change in the control signals to implement all the standard operations used in a QNN. This article presents novel algorithms for implementing the operations of a QNN on the TULIP-PEs in the form of a schedule of threshold functions. TULIP was implemented as an ASIC in TSMC 40nm-LP technology. A QNN accelerator that employs a conventional multiply and accumulate-based arithmetic processor was also implemented in the same technology to provide a fair comparison. The results show that TULIP is  $30\times -50\times $  more energy-efficient than an equivalent design, without any penalty in performance, area, or accuracy. Furthermore, TULIP achieves these improvements without using traditional techniques such as voltage scaling or approximate computing. Finally, this article also demonstrates how the run-time tradeoff between accuracy and energy efficiency is done on the TULIP architecture.</description></item><item><title>GroupQ: Group-Wise Quantization With Multi-Objective Optimization for CNN Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10423832</link><description>Mixed-precision Neural Networks achieve high-energy efficiency and throughput for hardware deployment. The most common mixed-precision methods adopt layer-wise granularity. However, the layer-wise method does not quantize the model to its limit because the optimal bit precision that preserves accuracy for different kernels can be different. To address this issue, this article presents GroupQ, a group-wise quantization method with multi-objective optimization for convolutional neural network (CNN) accelerators. Group-wise divides the convolutional kernels in a layer into several groups by clustering, and each group shares the same bit precision. The multi-objective optimization algorithm is used to optimize the quantization policy automatically based on the selected quantization objectives, such as model accuracy, model size, or computation cost. The experiments show that GroupQ significantly outperforms the existing layer-wise retraining-free methods, even better than some training-based methods. Specifically, GroupQ achieves a 0.49% higher accuracy with up to 28.1% smaller bit operations (BOPs) on ResNet-18 compared to HAWQ-V3 and can quantize MobileNetV2 to 1.65-MB model size with 71.75% top-1 accuracy. This article shows that GroupQ is friendly for hardware deployment by a lookup table (LUT)-based mixed-precision processing element (LMPE) proposed for CNN accelerators. LMPE provides power reduction of up to 3.6%, up to 3.9% lower area, compared to conventional implementation.</description></item><item><title>SUN: Dynamic Hybrid-Precision SRAM-Based CIM Accelerator With High Macro Utilization Using Structured Pruning Mixed-Precision Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10414052</link><description>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) play a key role in many deep learning applications; however, these networks are resource intensive. The parallel computing ability of computing-in-memory (CIM) enables high energy efficiency in artificial intelligence accelerators. When implementing a CNN in CIM, quantization and pruning are indispensable for reducing the calculation complexity and improving the efficiency of hardware calculations. Mixed-precision quantization with flexible bit widths provides a better efficiency-accuracy tradeoff than fixed-precision quantization. However, CIM calculations for mixed-precision models are inefficient because the fixed capacity of CIM macros is redundant for hybrid precision distributions. To address this, we propose a software and hardware co-design static random-access memory (SRAM)-based CIM architecture called SUN, including a CIM-adaptive mixed precision joint pruning quantization algorithm and dynamic hybrid precision CNN accelerator. Three techniques are implemented in this architecture: 1) a mixed precision joint pruning algorithm for reducing the memory access and removing the redundant computing; 2) a CIM-adaptive filter-wise and paired mixed-precision quantization for improving CIM macro utilization; and 3) an SRAM-based CIM CNN accelerator in which the SRAM CIM macro is used as the processing element to support sparse and mixed-precision CNN computation with high CIM macro utilization. This architecture achieves a system area efficiency of 428.2 TOPS/mm 2 and throughput of 792.2 GOPS on the CIFAR-10 dataset.</description></item><item><title>MURLAV: A Multiple-Node-Upset Recovery Latch and Algorithm-Based Verification Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10413196</link><description>In advanced CMOS technologies, integrated circuits are sensitive to multiple-node-upsets (MNUs) induced in harsh radiation environments. The existing verification of the reliability of latches highly relies on electronic design automation (EDA) tools considering complex error-injection scenarios. In this article, we propose a novel latch, namely, MURLAV, protected against quadruple node-upsets (QNUs) induced in harsh radiation environments, as well as an algorithmic error-recovery verification method. The latch provides complete recovery from all QNUs with a formed redundant structure. The algorithm can simplify the verification process and demonstrate the QNU recovery for the proposed MURLAV latch. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed latch can recover from any QNU and that it has lower area and delay overhead. Compared with existing latches of the same type, the proposed MURLAV latch achieves an overhead reduction of 34% in silicon area and 15% in delay on average at the cost of moderate power consumption.</description></item><item><title>Mix &amp; Latch: Comparison With State-of-the-Art Retiming on a RISC-V Benchmark</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10418169</link><description>Flip-flops (FFs) are the most commonly used sequential elements in synchronous circuits, but their timing requirements limit the operating frequency. Borrowing time with a latch-based approach can increase operating frequency, but traditional back-end optimization tools struggle to manage hold time requirements. The Mix &amp; Latch technique achieves higher frequencies and often lower area than commercial state-of-the-art retiming by exploiting four types of synchronous sequential gates, namely, positive and negative edge-triggered flip-flops (FFs) and positive and negative transparent latches, all using a single clock tree.In this article, we first significantly accelerate the Mix &amp; Latch flow convergence with respect to past work, by using a post-synthesis-based timing analysis that eliminates the first placement and routing needed for post-layout timing analysis. Then, by adding tolerance margins to the timing model, the pessimism is reduced to improve both convergence speed and maximum frequency. Finally, we reduce the complexity of the problem by applying the methodology only to the sequential elements belonging to critical paths. The effectiveness of Mix &amp; Latch is then demonstrated on a RISC-V processor core from the Pulp platform using 28nm CMOS FDSOI technology. The results are compared to both the original Mix &amp; Latch flow and a retiming performed with a state-of-the-art tool, showing a 25% frequency improvement over the original flow and 7.5% over the retiming flow. Compared to the retiming flow, we achieve comparable or lower power and area, while preserving the original registers and allowing logic equivalence checking.</description></item></channel></rss>
