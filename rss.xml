This study introduces a novel approach to address the OPGF problem by integrating problem decomposition with reinforcement learning (RL)-based cutting plane techniques. The proposed strategy divides the original OPGF problem into a simplified OPGF (SOPGF) sub-problem and a power and gas flow (PGF) calculation sub-problem. In the constraint set of the SOPGF sub-problem, linear inequality constraints (i.e., cutting planes or cuts) are introduced, bounding the feasible region of the SOPGF sub-problem and thereby obtaining the optimal solution to the original OPGF problem. The cuts are determined using an RL algorithm, and the RL agent is trained to maximize the rewards estimated by the PGF calculation. To enhance the efficiency of the agent training, action selection method is utilized in the RL-based cutting plane approach. Case studies are performed to assess the proposed strategy in comparison to conventional methods across diverse test conditions, verifying that the new approach surpasses conventional approaches in both computational efficiency and feasibility.</description></item><item><title>Modelling of AC-DC Voltage Control Coupling and Adaptive Fault Ride-Through Method for VSC-HVDC Integrated Wind Farms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948156</link><description>During grid fault, the voltage source converter-based high voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) integrated wind farms should effectively support the grid voltage while ensuring the integrated system security. Existing studies have neglected the AC-DC voltage control coupling caused by the sudden change in the grid's complex impedance due to the fault transition impedance, which may lead to transient DC overvoltage, poor elevation of grid voltage, or active power loss of wind farms. A faulted grid equivalent model based on the virtual fault is established, and the mechanism of AC-DC voltage control coupling of the integrated system caused by the complex impedance of the faulted grid is found. A coupling model of the grid-connection bus voltage of the integrated system, maximum DC voltage deviation, and active power of the wind-end converter is established, and the quantification method for the maximum grid voltage support capability of the integrated system is proposed. Finally, the adaptive symmetrical fault ride-through method balancing between AC-DC voltage control is proposed. Through simulation verification, the proposed method can maximize the grid voltage elevation and minimize the active power loss of wind farms while avoiding DC overvoltage and the steady-state AC overcurrent of grid-end converter under the premise.</description></item><item><title>Performance-Aware Control of Modular Batteries for Fast Frequency Response</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947730</link><description>Modular batteries can be aggregated to deliver frequency regulation services for power grids. Although utilizing the idle capacity of battery modules is financially attractive, it remains challenging to consider the heterogeneous module-level characteristics such as dynamic operational efficiencies and battery degradation. In addition, real-time decision making within seconds is required to enable fast frequency response. In order to address these issues, this paper proposes a performance-aware scheduling approach for battery modules to deliver fast frequency response (FFR) support. In particular, the conduction loss and switching loss of battery packs as well as converters are captured within a mix-integer quadratic constrained program (MIQCP). The cycle-based aging model identifies the aging cost of battery modules during frequent cycling by introducing the aging subgradient calculation and linearization. Case studies based on real-world battery data show that the proposed scheduling approach can effectively reduce power loss cost by nearly 28%&#8211;57% and battery aging cost by 4%-15% compared to conventional methods, which can also enhance the SoC balance.</description></item><item><title>Meta Reinforcement Learning Based Adaptive and Interpretable Energy Storage Control Meets Dynamic Scenarios</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948374</link><description>As renewable energy becomes more widespread, energy storage systems (ESSs) play an important role in managing energy distribution and economic arbitrage. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL)-based scheduling methods face performance degradation or failure in highly dynamic environments due to their limited generalization capability, especially amid increasing fluctuations in renewable energy output, electricity prices, and load demands. This paper proposes a novel ESSs control framework based on Meta-Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL), comprising offline training and online adaptation phases. The offline training phase features a dual-loop update framework, acquiring a model with highly generalizable initial parameters through a multi-task learning approach. In the online adaptation phase, the model can make adaptive adjustments rapidly in response to environmental changes. Lastly, a Shapley Value-based Meta-RL (SMRL) method is proposed to perform an in-depth analysis of decision-making outcomes. Multiple dynamic microgrid (MG) scenarios were simulated using real data with added fluctuation factors for model training and testing. The proposed Meta-RL based model exhibits significantly better adaptability in various scenarios, achieving approximately 20% to 50% performance improvement compared to the traditional RL model. A detailed analysis of the contribution of features behind scheduling decisions shows alignment with human intuition.</description></item><item><title>Periodic-Enhanced Informer Model for Short-Term Wind Power Forecasting Using SCADA Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10955286</link><description>Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems can collect abundant information about wind farm operation and environment. To better make use of SCADA data, a periodic-enhanced informer model for short-term wind power forecasting using scada data is proposed. Firstly, to effectively filter out noise in SCADA data, a v-p curve-based method is adopted by incorporating a quartile approach to remove sparse outliers; a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is then employed to eliminate stacked outliers from the power curve. Secondly, a multi-feature input set selection method based on Maximization Information Coefficient is introduced to make better use of the SCADA system data by reducing the number of features. Thirdly, a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) is designed to extract the scalar projection of the input set, followed by fusing the local time stamp and global time stamp to build the periodic information enhanced prediction model embedding layer. Subsequently, the enhanced input set is fed into an informer model to predict future wind power. Finally, considering the multiple temporal scales structure characteristics present in the dataset, a multi-scale deep fusion module is established in the informer model to deeply integrate the features of different scales. It can simultaneously avoid the resource waste and overfitting problems caused by increasing the network depth. The experimental results, which are obtained from several deep learning methods on real SCADA data, demonstrate that the suggested approach has good predictive capability.</description></item><item><title>Computationally Efficient Model Predictive Control for Enhanced Primary-Level Management of Standalone Microgrids With Hybrid Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10955859</link><description>This paper proposes a highly efficient model predictive control (MPC) technique for primary-level control of a hybrid storage system (HSS) in a microgrid with renewables. Generally, active set (AS)-based MPCs are used to control HSS-based microgrid systems, which are computationally complex. The high-complexity prevents making control decisions within the sampling time, which negatively affects the robustness of the control system. Moreover, high complexity necessitates powerful controllers, which increase the system's overall cost and energy consumption. On the other hand, less complex controls, such as supervisory control, reduce the storage system's stability, reliability, and lifetime. The proposed method is a closed-form AS-based MPC that shares the mutual advantages of both AS-based MPC and supervisory controllers with additional robustness. It thus significantly reduces the computational complexity while being stable and reliable, improving storage lifetime, and having higher robustness compared to MPC and supervisory controllers. The proposed method is compared to modified AS based MPC, Hildreth quadratic programming (HQP), and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) based MPC recently employed for an HSS microgrid application. The analysis showed that the proposed method could significantly outperform the conventional MPC methods in computational complexity and robustness, as well as the supervisory controller in terms of reliability, stability, enhanced battery lifetime, and robustness.</description></item><item><title>Analysis of a Disturbance Event With Inverter-Based Resources Using EMT Simulations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964428</link><description>Increasing penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) necessitates newer methods of planning and analysis of disturbances. The existing phasor-domain transient stability (TS) analysis may not capture the dynamics of IBRs during fault events. In this paper, electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations using high-fidelity detailed model of power grid and one of the affected photovoltaic (PV) plants during the Angeles Forest disturbance in 2018 are performed. In these simulations, the processes to develop EMT models of power grid from traditional phasor-domain TS data and PV plant from collected data are described. Thereafter, using these simulations, the response of the PV plant during the fault event in 2018 is replicated and a sensitivity analysis is performed. The sensitivity analysis consists of making changes to the components within the PV plant and in the power grid to evaluate the impact they have on the response observed by the PV plant during the fault event. This analysis provides an understanding of the components that impact the operation of a PV plant during fault events and provide guidance to system planners on the studies that need to be performed to maintain a reliable power grid as new IBR plants are integrated.</description></item><item><title>Categorical Spatial Interpolation of Solar Irradiance for Regional Distributed Photovoltaic Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964342</link><description>High-spatial-resolution (HSR) solar irradiance forecast data is important for regional distributed photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting. Distributed PV sites are widely geographically distributed and the cost of obtaining HSR irradiance forecast data with full regional coverage is very high. Improving spatial resolution through interpolation based on limited sparse irradiance forecast reference points is a low-cost and feasible approach. However, existing irradiance spatial interpolation methods would produce large errors under variable weather conditions (e.g., cloudy) with limited reference points, because local abrupt changes in irradiance usually occur under such weather conditions due to cloud movement. This paper proposes a categorical spatial interpolation method to improve the accuracy of distributed PV power forecasting with limited sparse irradiance forecast data. The method first converts satellite-derived shortwave radiation images into binary irradiance maps through adaptive thresholding, then trains a 3D U-net model to predict future irradiance category probabilities for each grid. These probability maps dynamically govern two parallel interpolation processes: one using reference stations in predicted clear-sky regions, another utilizing stations in cloudy zones, with final irradiance values determined by probability-weighted fusion. Case studies on a real dataset verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Centralized Control for Paralleled VSCs With Grid-Forming and Oscillation Suppression Capability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10965541</link><description>Paralleled multiple voltage source converters (VSCs) are adopted in photovoltaic (PV) or energy storage systems, and may suffer from oscillation and fault disturbance issues under various grid conditions. In this paper, a centralized control frame is proposed to suppress the active power oscillation and support the grid voltage/frequency via grid-forming (GFM) control. A virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control is applied as the centralized controller, which communicates with local controllers. The mutual damping and power angle feedback are adopted in the local controller to achieve an accurate active power sharing. The influence of key parameters such as the communication delay and mutual damping are analyzed. Finally, the proposed control is verified though the simulation and hierarchical controller-hardware-in-loop (CHIL) experiments.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Pseudo-Decentralized Control of Wave Energy Arrays</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10965503</link><description>In control of wave energy converter (WEC) arrays, since the dynamics of different devices are coupled by radiation effects, there has always been a dilemma between using centralized control, with optimal energy production but usually overwhelming computation, or decentralized control, with acceptable computation but performance degradation. This paper proposes a pseudo-decentralized control strategy that is effective in energy production but efficient in computation. In this method, a centralized estimation-forecasting scheme is applied to provide global information on the wave excitation force (WEF) experienced by each device. Then, the optimal unconstrained array motion is calculated from the WEF information, to serve as an initial guess of the optimal constrained motion. Finally, the constrained control moves of each WEC are optimized decentralizedly using model predictive control (MPC). However, in contrast to conventional decentralized control, each local controller not only maximizes its own energy production, but also takes into account the energy it contributes, through radiation, to other WECs, given their anticipated motion. In this way, the proposed controller enjoys the same computational simplicity as decentralized control, but is demonstrated, through comprehensive testing, to be capable of achieving performance close to the ideal centralized control across a wide range of sea states.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Energy Storage Configuration for Primary Frequency Regulation Performance Considering State of Charge Partitioning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10965852</link><description>The proportion of renewable energy in the power system continues to rise, and its intermittent and uncertain output has had a certain impact on the frequency stability of the grid. Therefore, a multi-type energy storage (ES) configuration method considering State of Charge (SOC) partitioning and frequency regulation performance matching is proposed for primary frequency regulation. Firstly, the Automatic Generation Control (AGC) signal is decomposed and reconstructed using the variational mode decomposition (VMD) method. Specifically, by combining the charge and discharge characteristics of Li-ion battery and flywheel energy storage (FES), component signals of different frequencies are allocated to different ES systems. Secondly, a multi-type ES capacity allocation optimization model considering SOC partitioning is developed, with the objective function being the minimization of the whole life-cycle planning cost of ES. Finally, based on actual data from a region in North China, the proposed method is verified by analyzing case studies under different scenarios. The results demonstrate that the method can effectively reduce computation time, optimize ES operating conditions, and thus lower the whole life-cycle planning cost of ES.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Grid-Interactive Power Performance Enhancement Method for D-PMSG-Based Virtual Synchronous Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10966203</link><description>Virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control is widely applied in grid-interactive inverters due to its similarity to synchronous generators. The VSG frequency variation is delayed by the synchronous swing equation to provide additional inertia support, which also leads to a slower power response. When applied to wind turbines (WTs), VSG reduces their power tracking ability, compromises the wind power capture efficiency, and affects the dispatch commands execution. The response to external frequency causes more power changes in WTs, making it difficult for wind power capture to keep up due to the mass of the rotor and blades, bring extra operational risks for WTs. To address these issues, this paper proposes a hierarchical grid-interactive power performance enhancement method for D-PMSG-based virtual synchronous wind turbines (VSWTs). The power performance is enhanced by coordinating the synchronous swing equation and voltage excitation equation parameters. The grid-forming power flow and electromechanical status of the VSWT are integrated to extend the kinetic energy (KE) utilization limits to ensure the efficiency and safety of the VSWT during the KE utilization-based wind power capture regulation. The proposed method comprehensively improves the grid-interactive power performance of VSWTs, and the effectiveness has been validated through comparative simulations.</description></item><item><title>Novel Voltage Support Strategies for DGs in Hybrid AC/DC Distribution Networks Under Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10970419</link><description>According to the grid codes, the higher the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC), the longer duration that the voltage-source converters (VSC) can stay connected to the grid. In hybrid AC/DC distribution networks (HADNs), owing to the low capacity, VSC-based distributed generator (DG) closest to the fault point may fail to significantly support the voltage at the PCC through current injection. Therefore, other large-capacity converters such as flexible AC/DC converters (FACs) should also inject currents to help it. However, in resistive-inductive HADNs, the voltage support effect is related to the current phases of converters, and the fault conditions. In this paper, circumstances under two fault position categories (upstream and downstream fault positions of DG) for double line-to-ground fault and three-phase short-circuit fault are analyzed. The interconnected sequence networks of HADNs under these two fault positions are proposed. Based on the proposed networks, the optimal current phase angles of DG and FAC for maximumly supporting voltages at the PCC of the DG are proposed. Moreover, the line sequence impedance calculation method is proposed. The simulation results verify the proposed strategy. The proposed strategy is suitable for low-capacity DGs in resistive-inductive HADNs to achieve voltage support and fault ride-through.</description></item><item><title>Learning-Accelerated ADMM for Stochastic Power System Scheduling With Numerous Scenarios</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10971244</link><description>The increasing share of uncertain renewable energy sources (RES) in power systems necessitates new efficient approaches for the two-stage stochastic multi-period AC optimal power flow (St-MP-OPF) optimization. The computational complexity of St-MP-OPF, particularly with AC constraints, grows exponentially with the number of uncertainty scenarios and the time horizon. This complexity poses significant challenges for large-scale transmission systems that require numerous scenarios to capture RES stochasticities. This paper introduces a scenario-based decomposition of theSt-MP-OPF based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Additionally, this paper proposes a machine learning-accelerated ADMM approach (ADMM-ML), facilitating rapid and parallel computations of numerous scenarios with extended time horizons. Within this approach, a recurrent neural network approximates the ADMM sub-problem optimization and predicts wait-and-see decisions for uncertainty scenarios, while a master optimization determines here-and-now decisions. Additionally, we develop a hybrid approach that uses ML predictions to warm-start the ADMM algorithm, combining the computational efficiency of ML with the feasibility and optimality guarantees of optimization methods. The numerical results on the 118-bus and 1354-bus system show that the proposed ADMM-ML approach solves the St-MP-OPF with 3-4 orders of magnitude speed-ups, while the hybrid approach provides a balance between speed-ups and optimality.</description></item><item><title>Finite-Time Stabilization of Floating Offshore Wind Turbines Under Wind and Wave Disturbances by Adaptive Barrier-Function Fractional-Order Sliding Mode Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10972122</link><description>Floating offshore wind turbines harness more vigorous and more stable winds, making them a promising solution for clean energy. However, their stability is compromised by sea waves and sudden winds, reducing power extraction. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a finite-time fractional-order adaptive SMC for tension-leg platform wind turbines to enhance stability and efficiency. A fractional-order model ensures accurate system representation, while a barrier-function-based adaptive control strategy guarantees rapid, finite-time convergence, mitigates chattering, and suppresses external disturbances through real-time estimation. The proposed controller effectively stabilizes the system, helping to maximize power extraction. Simulation results in the MATLAB-Simulink environment demonstrate superior performance compared to conventional methods in terms of disturbance rejection and convergence speed. Furthermore, hardware-in-the-loop validation using a Speedgoat platform confirms the method's real-time feasibility and robustness under realistic operational conditions. The proposed approach offers a significant advancement in floating offshore wind turbines stability and control, ensuring efficient energy harvesting even under severe environmental disturbances. These findings contribute to the development of more reliable and resilient floating wind energy systems, supporting the transition toward sustainable offshore wind power.</description></item><item><title>A Distributed Dispatch of Bi-Directional Power and Hydrogen Systems for Enhancing the Renewable Energy Integration in Grid-Connected Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10977964</link><description>The accelerating transition to renewable-based power grids is critical for carbon neutrality. Centralized renewable energy deployment usually forms grid-connected microgrids with limited power exchange with the main grid for stability concerns, which results in inadequate utilization of renewable energy. With hydrogen becoming an indispensable energy component, power-to-hydrogen (P2H) technology has become increasingly prevalent for mitigating renewable energy curtailments. In this paper, we present a coordinated dispatch model for bi-directional power-hydrogen system (BDPHS) that considers the electrolyzer dynamics for hydrogen storage and hydrogen fuel cell systems. We propose an improved alternating direction method of multipliers (I-ADMM) method that uses MILP for coordinated dispatch of renewable and hydrogen systems in a distributed manner. Numerical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed method for enhancing the economic benefits and mitigating renewable energy curtailments.</description></item><item><title>An Ultra-Short-Term Distributed Photovoltaic Power Forecasting Method Based on GPT</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10979247</link><description>With a lot of distributed photovoltaic (PV) stations connected to the grid, improving the accuracy of power prediction is helpful to safe and economical operation of the power system. However, most existing methods face challenges in dealing with data scarcity and random fluctuations. This paper proposes an ultra-short-term distributed PV power forecasting method based on Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). Firstly, virtual distributed PV power data is generated with different spatial resolutions. Next, the generated data is used to pre-train a Transformer-based model for predicting PV power from 15 minutes to 4 hours. Finally, the model is fine-tuned on real PV stations with a small data volume. The attention mechanism can learn correlations from lots of historical power data by pre-training. Fine-tuning can realize lightweight deployment and accurate prediction on newly built PV stations, effectively dealing with data scarcity. Models with 12.63M and 103M parameters are pre-trained using virtual data, respectively. The experimental results on datasets from 3 locations show that when there is 1 mo real data, the average RMSE decreases by 37.22%, 32.92% and 10.87% compared with the LSTM, linear model, and Transformer-based model, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Allocation and Two-Level Control of Reactive Power for Balancing Voltage and Power Factor of Renewable Energy Stations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10980477</link><description>Renewable energy stations(RES) must satisfy voltage security and power factor requirements for safe and efficient operation. However, these requirements often conflict, posing challenges in practical applications. This paper first analyzes the constraints and identifies the boundary of RES voltage regulation capability under power factor constraints. Building on the analysis, an optimal allocation and two-level control (TLC) of reactive power is proposed. It integrates the optimization of reactive power compensator (RPC) with the coordinated control of reactive resources, thereby balancing voltage regulation and power factor. From the allocation perspective, an RPC optimization method is proposed to maximize the feasible voltage range of RES under varying active power conditions of RES. From the control perspective, a TLC scheme is proposed, combining station and unit control. At the station level, the controller features a mode-switching function and calculates the overall reactive power reference value. At the unit level, the controller coordinates the converter-interfaced generations (CIGs) and RPC. Case studies are conducted on a real RES project in Bazhou, Xinjiang, China. Matlab/Simulink and Opal-RT real-time simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method enhances both voltage security and economic efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Autonomous Voltage Regulation for Smart Distribution Network With High-Proportion PVs:A Graph Meta-Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10982124</link><description>Smart distribution grids with a high percentage of distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems often face severe voltage quality problems. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) presents great potentials in achieving optimal voltage level control in distribution grids with the advantage of learning without explicit modeling. However, when DRL is applied to active voltage regulation in distribution grids with a high proportion of distributed photovoltaic (PV) power generation, it encounters several challenges, such as uneven learning among controllable devices and environmental instability, which impede the convergence of DRL. In addition, traditional reinforcement learning represents the distribution network with vectors and ignores topology information. In this paper, we transform the voltage control problem into a partially observable Markov decision process, and propose a multi-agent meta-reinforcement learning algorithm based on graph convolutional networks to improve voltage quality by combining DRL with meta-learning (ML). By integrating ML, our approach allows agents to better predict the actions of other agents, thus mitigating the instability of the environment. To address the problem of uneven learning among agents, we incorporate a self-concern mechanism and a value decomposition method into the critique network. The proposed algorithm is validated through experiments on IEEE 33-bus, 141-bus, and 322-bus systems and compared with five other multi-agent DRL methods and model-based model predictive control algorithms.</description></item><item><title>FDCA-DSTGCN: A Wind Farm Cluster Power Day-Ahead Prediction Model Based on Frequency Domain Information Gain and Dynamic Trend Sensing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10982214</link><description>Accurate wind farm cluster power prediction (WFCPP) is of vital significance for new power systems with large-scale wind power integration. The current WFCPP modeling method ignores the important role of wind direction and frequency domain information, resulting in insufficient use of spatial information and difficult to improve the prediction accuracy. In order to solve the above problems, a day-ahead power prediction model for wind farm cluster power is proposed based on information gain in frequency domain and dynamic trend sensing. Firstly, a cluster division method based on graph theory and progressive fusion of multiple information is proposed, and a virtual information node is set up. Secondly, a method to identify prevailing wind direction under time window is proposed for subsets, and a dynamic weighted directed graph structure is designed based on prevailing wind direction and wind speed. Thirdly, a dynamic spatio-temporal graph convolutional network model with frequency domain gain channel attention mechanism (FDCA-DSTGCN) is proposed to integrate the above information and complete the prediction. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a wind farm cluster in Inner Mongolia of China. Compared with the existing and traditional prediction methods, the normalized root mean square error of the proposed method is reduced by 1.13%&#8211;2.15%, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Assessing the Impact and Quantifying the Value of Flexibility in Transactive Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10989551</link><description>Distributed Flexibility (DF) is seen as a key tool in managing future distribution networks, but there are no comprehensive methods to quantify its value to stakeholders and impact on the network. Consequently, the potential costs and benefits of DF are uncertain, delaying the rollout of the concept onto real networks. This paper proposes a method to address that gap: a network-aware framework for modelling the interaction of DF with local and whole system markets to analyse the system performance in detail. The paper provides a set of mathematical models and algorithms to derive realistic supply and demand curves for flexibility in a distribution system, find the global equilibrium of multiple markets and services, model their impacts on networks, and perform cost-benefit analysis for stakeholders. The framework has been applied to a case study comprising a real network in England, forecast data of flexible demand and distributed generation, and the prices expected in the electricity system. The numerical study showed that DF can bring real value to all stakeholders when procured through markets; however, to maintain positive and consistent benefits to networks and stakeholders, appropriate price signals (i.e., tariffs and charges) must be designed for each network individually.</description></item><item><title>Coordinated Control of Grid-Forming Wind Turbines and Grid-Forming Energy Storage Systems for Power System Restoration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002600</link><description>Grid-forming wind turbines (GFM-WTs) provide a promising solution for the restoration of wind-integrated power systems owing to their fast restart and grid support capabilities. However, individual GFM-WTs rely on external GFM sources for self-start, and their GFM support capability may be hindered by wind power shortages, potentially causing restoration failures. To address these challenges, this paper combines GFM-WTs and GFM energy storage systems (ESSs) to construct a black-start source for power system restoration. The GFM-ESS can provide self-start conditions for the GFM-WT while also improving its GFM support capability to withstand wind power shortages and load restoration transients. To ensure the stability of the restored system, a coordinated control strategy is proposed. First, a pre-synchronization control is designed to enable the GFM-WT to seamlessly connect with the GFM-ESS. Second, a power system stabilizer is developed to mitigate the power oscillation between the parallel GFM-WT and GFM-ESS. Third, to coordinate their power outputs during the load restoration, a model predictive secondary frequency control considering the stability of the WT rotor speed and system frequency is presented. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can improve the stability and security of the system restoration process under wind power shortages.</description></item><item><title>Rotor Thrust Control for Large-Scale Wind Turbine in Near-Rated Wind Speed Region</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11003805</link><description>To limit the maximum rotor thrust in the near-rated wind speed region, this paper proposes a novel rotor thrust control scheme for large-scale wind turbines operating. It contains a rotor thrust identificator, a rotor thrust control loop, and a feedforward blade pitch controller. A simplified blade model is first proposed to achieve rotor thrust identification. Based on blade element momentum theory, the rotor thrust can be identified by the blade root out-of-plane bending moments. The rotor thrust control loop is then designed with the identified rotor thrust. Then, a feedforward blade pitch saturator is designed, called Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion based minimum Pitch Saturator (NDI-PS). It is realized by nonlinear dynamic inversion of the thrust coefficient curve. The simulation results exhibit outstanding performance of the proposed control scheme. Compared with existing controllers of NREL and Goldwind, power output is increased by 1% to 1.5%, while blade root and tower bottom loads are mitigated by about 4% .</description></item><item><title>Feature-Driven Microgrid Economic Dispatch via Solar-Induced Contingent Balancing Satisficing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11005474</link><description>For the multiple energy microgrid (MEMG), this paper builds an adaptive Wasserstein distance-based ambiguity set instead of characterizing its size for solving the economic dispatch (ED) problem considering uncertain solar outputs. With the ambiguity set, an electrothermal balancing satisficing (EBS) framework is proposed by defining a solar-induced contingent electrothermal balancing risk measure (SCEB-RM) to interpret the risk level for maintaining electrothermal balance under solar uncertainty. For comprehensive contingent cost targets, a multi-objective EBS is extended to refine the solar impact on electric and thermal energy resources, respectively, and provide the corresponding out-of-sample cost bounds. Using the realized solar data, a feature-driven EBS model is formulated by incorporating soft dynamic time warping-based k-means clustering into the ambiguity. A tractable counterpart is obtained by developing a solution approach on bilateral responsive affine resource adaptation, where satisfactory targets are specified by comparing with sample robust optimization as the baseline, serving as an instance. Using real-world datasets, combinations of IEEE test systems and thermal networks validate that EBS eliminates the risky condition of uncertainty while revealing the connection between targets and solutions. It is shown that cluster-wise information makes EBS withstand greater uncertainty as effectively as the state-of-the-art in most cases and sometimes better.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Mean-Corrected Recursive Estimation-Based Optimal DER Dispatch for Distribution System Voltage Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11004617</link><description>Recent advances in smart inverters offer opportunities to mitigate adverse grid impacts caused by high penetrations of distributed photovoltaics (PV) in distribution grids, such as voltage violations.

The proposed approach leverages available grid and controllable DER measurements, eliminating reliance on system model information while being adaptive and robust to volatile operating conditions. A mean-corrected recursive ridge regression (MCRRR) algorithm is proposed for sensitivity estimation, continuously refining the sensitivity model through a closed-form solution. It effectively manages varying grid operating conditions, such as changes in power injections and topology reconfiguration, to facilitate a time-varying update of the Load Sensitivity Factors (LSF). The proposed approach is formulated as a linear programming (LP) problem and is thus scalable to larger-scale distribution systems.

Imposing stability constraints in scheduling models is crucial to maintaining secure operations. This paper develops a novel voltage and frequency stability constrained unit commitment (UC) model for power systems with heterogeneous regulation resources, including synchronous generators (SGs), synchronous condensers, condenser retrofitted SGs, and wind power generators with grid-following or grid-forming converters. The frequency stability constraints encompass critical metrics across the entire frequency response process, effectively capturing the unique dynamics of diverse resources. The voltage stability constraints prioritize the long-term stability of buses with low stability margins, particularly those heavily penetrated by RESs. Furthermore, the proposed model captures the inherent coupling between frequency and voltage stability, offering extensibility for broader applications. To ensure computational efficiency, nonlinear terms in the constraints are linearized using a piecewise linearization algorithm. The proposed two-stage UC model optimizes operational costs while maintaining system stability. Case studies on the modified IEEE 9-bus system and the IEEE RTS-79 system validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Damping Evaluation Method of the Power Systems Integrated With Wind Farms During the Sub-Synchronous Control Interaction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11005697</link><description>This paper proposes a distributed damping evaluation method (DDEM) to assess the damping distribution0 in doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind farms during sub-synchronous control interactions (SSCI). The proposed DDEM identifies sensitive control parameters of the DFIG wind turbines at oscillatory frequencies through the explicit expression of the system's damping loss factor (DLF). It also evaluates the damping contribution by calculating the distributed damping loss factor (DDLF) for each element or subsystem in real-time. Initially, this paper presents the DLF concept for basic vibration systems and extends it to oscillatory power systems. Subsequently, an analytical expression of the DLF in DFIG-based wind farms is derived by calculating the dissipated energy and the maximum transient energy at the sub-synchronous frequencies. The DLF is then decomposed into DDLFs according to the physical structure of the oscillatory system, facilitating the development of the DDEM to evaluate the damping contributions. The efficacy of the DDEM is demonstrated through two case studies: the modified IEEE first benchmark model on sub-synchronous resonance (SSR) and the Guyuan wind power system model in North China.</description></item><item><title>A Secure Distributed Computation of Combined Heat and Power Dispatch Based on Transformation Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11008674</link><description>The widespread utilization of combined heat and power (CHP) units creates a tight couple between the power transmission system (PTS) and district heating systems (DHS). Since PTS and DHS are always managed by different operators with information security concerns, there has been a growing interest in implementing distributed solutions for combined heat and power dispatch (CHPD). However, existing distributed algorithms require an exchange of information, such as CHP output and dual multipliers, between PTS and DHS, posing a potential risk of information leakage. To address this issue, we introduce a transformation-based method to mask the CHPD model, thereby masking the real economic and physical coefficients using random nonsingular matrices. We discuss the selection principle for encryption matrices to diminish the additional computational burden caused by transformation. Then, we develop an improved Benders decomposition method by introducing valid inequalities and strengthening Benders cut to efficiently solve the masked CHPD problem in a distributed manner. The proposed secure analysis proves that the proposed method can resist two common threat models in information security, including semi-honest adversaries and external eavesdroppers. Numerical simulations are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Capacity Planning of Hybrid Renewable Energy - CCHP System Considering Inter Seasonal Borehole Thermal Energy Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11008841</link><description>Combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) systems are recognized for their high energy efficiency, with utilization rates exceeding 80%. However, traditional CCHP systems often rely on microgas turbines, contributing to carbon emissions. In this paper, we design a hybrid renewable energy - CCHP system, where the electric load is provided by photovoltaic and wind power, and the heating/cooling loads are supplied by converting power to heat by heat pumps. Considering the seasonal variability of renewable energy generation, we introduce borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) into the CCHP system, transforming the ground into a thermal storage that stores excess energy during summer for use in winter. We formulate the problem as a two-stage robust model with decision-dependent uncertainty. Then, we develop a customized algorithm based on Benders decomposition to effectively solve this model and discuss the algorithm improvement techniques. Our approach is validated through a case study of an actual system in Ordos, China, where the effects of BTES integration, uncertainty budget value, and varying ratios of renewable energy are analyzed.</description></item><item><title>A Quantum Annealing-Based Three-Stage Scheduling Strategy for Multi-Stack Fuel Cell Hybrid Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11014234</link><description>Fuel cell hybrid power systems (FCHPS) face significant challenges due to the non-convex nature of their optimization problems, especially in high-power applications with multi-stack configurations that involve numerous start-stop decisions, introducing a high number of binary variables. To address these issues, this paper presents a quantum annealing (QA)-based three-stage scheduling strategy for multi-stack solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)-based fuel cell hybrid power systems (FCHPS). The proposed method decouples the decision-making process across different timescales&#8212;day-ahead, intra-day, and real-time&#8212;tailoring decisions to the dynamics of various power sources within the FCHPS. In the day-ahead stage, global predictions inform the startup and shutdown of SOFCs; in the intra-day stage, short-term predictions refine power outputs; and in the real-time stage, adjustments are made to respond to immediate operational conditions. Quantum annealing is introduced to expedite the solution of the large-scale, binary optimization problems inherent in multi-stack configurations. A OPAL-RT-based experimental platform is used to validate the proposed strategy. In addition, a comparison between the proposed method and conventional methods is conducted, indicating that the proposed QA-based approach significantly speeds up the computation process&#8212;being 49.89 times faster than the dual model (DMPC) predictive control method and 22.25 times faster than the Gurobi-based method. It also optimizes the overall operational cost, achieving a reduction in the total objective function value by approximately 10.62% compared to the Gurobi-based method, and by 14.66% compared to the DMPC method.</description></item><item><title>Statistically Feasible Joint Chance-Constrained Scheduling of Integrated Distribution Network and District Heating System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11021270</link><description>This paper proposes a statistically feasible joint chance-constrained scheduling framework for integrated power distribution networks (PDN) and district heating systems (DHS).

Additionally, we introduce a novel constraint-specific uncertainty set reconstruction technique. This technique refines the uncertainty set by incorporating optimization-relevant information. It significantly reduces conservatism while ensuring system violation probability requirements. Comparative studies with state-of-the-art uncertainty optimization methods demonstrate the advantages of our approach. The proposed method improves computational efficiency by two orders of magnitude. It also achieves more cost-effective solutions than the best-performing benchmark method.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Short-Term Solar Power Prediction Using Sky Image Sequences by a Residual Vision Reformer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11021656</link><description>The unpredictable nature of solar power generation, largely influenced by fluctuating cloud cover, poses a challenge to the stability of renewable energy systems. Considering this, accurate forecasting of solar power can lead to better grid management and operation. With the advent of deep learning models, various models have been suggested to enhance the ultra-short-term solar power forecasting performance. Given that cloud images offer more direct and comprehensive information about cloud patterns compared to the numerical weather prediction data, analyzing cloud images allows for more precise and efficient cloud change predictions, leading to a more accurate ultra-short-term solar power forecasting. In this way, aiming to enhance the forecasting performance, in this paper, we introduce a deep learning-based model, including three main blocks. In the first block, a Multi-Stream Video Vision Transformer (MS-ViViT) model is proposed for extracting different types of spatio-temporal features from the input image sequences. The output features from the first block are input to the second block, Fused Improved Reformer (Fused I-Reformer), including three Improved Reformer (I-Reformer) models equipped with a Fused Encoder as well as a new loss function for sequence learning. Finally, an Attentive Residual Fully Connected (ARFC) model is proposed for solar power value prediction. The comparison results with 36 comparative models on six real-world datasets using seven evaluation metrics confirm the effectiveness of the proposed ultra-short-term solar power forecasting model.</description></item><item><title>Dual Agent Framework for Scheduling Networked Microgrids Using DRL to Improve Resilience</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11021619</link><description>The widely reported increase in the frequency of high impact, low probability extreme weather events pose significant challenges to the resilient operation of electric power systems. This paper explores strategies to enhance operational resilience that addresses the distribution network&#8217;s ability to adapt to changing operating conditions. We introduce a novel Dual Agent-Based framework for optimizing the scheduling of distributed energy resources (DERs) within a networked microgrid (N-MG) using the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) paradigm. This framework focuses on minimizing operational and environmental costs during normal operations while enhancing critical load supply indices (CSI) under emergency conditions. Additionally, we introduce a multi-temporal dynamic reward shaping structure along with the incorporation of an error coefficient to enhance the learning process of the agents. To appropriately manage loads during emergencies, we propose a load flexibility classification system that categorizes loads based on its criticality index. The scalability of the proposed approach is demonstrated through running multiple case-studies on a modified IEEE 123-node benchmark distribution network. Furthermore, validation of the method is provided by means of comparisons with two metaheuristic algorithms namely particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA).</description></item><item><title>Sample-Wise Graph-Based Multivariate Short-Term PV Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11024230</link><description>Reliable short-term photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting is of crucial significance for the rational dispatching of power sources and the effective control of operating costs for the power grid. However, temporal misalignment and regression accuracy imbalance of PV power data pose significant challenges to the reliability of forecast results. In this study, multivariate PV power forecasting is investigated from the perspective of forecast model samples. Firstly, the extent of misalignment of a sample is parameterized by a time-delay vector. Subsequently, the sample-wise graph is defined to relate the time-delay vector with PV power data. Then, the time-delay vector is estimated by minimizing the smoothness metric of the sample-wise graph. Finally, a sample-wise graph-based sample weighting strategy is introduced to address the issue of regression accuracy imbalance. The efficiency of the proposed PV power forecasting scheme is validated through extensive experiments on real-world datasets. Comparison experiments suggest that the proposed scheme can achieve remarkably improved short-term PV power forecasting.</description></item><item><title>Error-Based Active Disturbance Rejection Power Control for Large-Scale Wind Turbines Under Pitch Actuator Performance Degradation Failure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11027442</link><description>This study addresses the critical challenge of constant power control for large-scale wind energy conversion system under the combined effects of pitch actuator degradation and multiple disturbances. In the paper, a novel fault-tolerant control strategy based on error-based active rejection control (E-ADRC) is proposed. The approach incorporates a composite control architecture, comprising a disturbance rejection tracking loop and a fault-tolerant compensation loop. Within the tracking loop, an enhanced E-ADRC algorithm is suggested which not only retains the robustness and ease of implementation of traditional E-ADRC but also significantly improves the attenuation of low-frequency wind disturbances&#8212;the turbine&#8217;s primary disruption. The fault-tolerant compensation loop applies independent control signals, derived from pitch angle residuals, to each faulty actuator, mitigating the extra fault disturbances in rotor speed tracking dynamics. This dual-loop structure enables the turbine to restore high-stability power output after a fault. Furthermore, the fault-tolerant compensation mechanism ensures that, even in cases of part of the three actuators failure, the previously misaligned pitch angles are synchronized, effectively suppressing the detrimental aerodynamic imbalance and reducing adverse loads. The superiority of this approach in enhancing power output stability and reducing structure fatigue damage have been validated through a refined hardware-in-the-loop test.</description></item><item><title>Grid-Forming IBRs Under Unbalanced Grid Conditions: Challenges, Solutions, and Prospects</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11027640</link><description>The penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) into the grid is experiencing significant growth. Their control behavior during unbalanced grid conditions can impact system stability and protection. This paper evaluates the performance of prevalent grid-forming control-based IBRs (GFM-IBRs) under unbalanced grid conditions and proposes novel insights in a novel framework. First, we investigate the potential impacts of grid-forming control-based IBRs (GFM-IBRs) on system dynamics, protection, and fault ride-through (FRT) capability under unbalanced grid conditions based on extensive literature review and through EMT simulations in benchmark systems with IBRs. To discover these impacts and accommodate unbalanced grid conditions, we implement a generic control structure for full converter-based GFM-IBRs under FRT mode, then perform a comparative analysis of existing solutions that include sequence decomposition methods, positive sequence current-limiting methods, negative sequence controls, and current coordination methods, to identify their capabilities and limitations through literature review and EMT simulations in a large-scale power system. Finally, key challenges and solutions are discussed, highlighting prospects for future research.</description></item><item><title>Probability Density Function Control of Frequency Fluctuations in Renewable-Rich Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029151</link><description>The stochastic nature of renewable energy sources (RESs) necessitates treating power system frequency response as a random process with a nonstationary probability density function (PDF). Based upon the stochastic distribution control theory originated by the second author, this paper proposes a novel stochastic controller to improve the frequency PDF in power grids when integrating a large amount of RESs, thereby minimizing the effects of uncertainties and enhancing overall system stability. The key idea is to manipulate the controllable power generation resources so that the frequency PDF is make to follow a target PDF by using the stochastic distribution control theory originated by the second author. The proposed method can easily be plugged into existing automatic generation controls for multi-area transmission grids. The proposed method is validated via a modified Kundar&#8217;s two area system and 240-bus Western Electricity Coordinating Council systems. The simulation results show that the proposed control shapes the frequency PDF narrower and sharper, leading to a notable improvement toward minimizing the effects of randomness and uncertainty during grid operation.</description></item><item><title>Collaborative Operation of Renewable Energy Hydrogen Production Systems Considering Balanced Utilization and Extended Lifespan of Multi-Electrolyzers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029129</link><description>To address the challenges of low efficiency, poor economic performance, and limited adaptability in renewable energy&#8211;coupled alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) systems, this study proposes a power&#8211;state rolling optimization strategy (PSROS) based on a two-stage optimization framework. First, the large-scale AWE system is divided into multiple modules to reduce the variable dimension of the optimization problem. Then, a simplified module-level optimal efficiency model is developed based on the efficiency characteristics of AWE units. Subsequently, multi-objective optimization models are constructed at the module and unit levels, comprehensively considering hydrogen production volume, lifespan degradation, and utilization balancing. Finally, a finite-horizon rolling optimization mechanism is introduced to solve the two-stage optimization problem, improving the continuity and rationality of scheduling decisions at the end of each optimization horizon. Annual case study results demonstrate that, under the non-battery scenario, PSROS improves system efficiency by 9.92%, 11.12%, and 3.81%, and reduces the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) by 4.14, 5.43, and 2.35 CNY/kg compared with the simple start-stop strategy (SSSS), array rotation strategy (ARS), and rolling optimization strategy (ROS), respectively. With battery integration, the system efficiency is further improved by 0.77%, and the LCOH is further reduced by 0.49 CNY/kg.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Scheduling of Integrated Electric-Hydrogen-Thermal Systems Considering Hydroelectric Power Plant Peaking for Hydrogen Vessel Navigation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11030854</link><description>Transporting hydrogen by vessels may be more cost-effective than hydrogen trailers and hydrogen tankers, but it is also more sensitive to environmental factors (e.g., river levels). In order to capitalize on the advantages of based-vessel waterway hydrogen chains, a new short-term scheduling strategy of integrated electric-hydrogen-Thermal systems considering the hydroelectric power plant peaking for hydrogen vessel (HV) navigation is proposed in this paper. First, a temporal-spatial operational model of waterway hydrogen chains is developed. In this model, the relationship between the electrolysis temperature, hydrogen production efficiency, and maximum available operational power of the reversible solid oxide fuel cell (RSOC) is modelled. The impact of the hydroelectric power plant underflow on HV transfer is also evaluated. On this basis, a flexible multi-day collaborative scheduling strategy of the electric-hydrogen integrated system is designed, where the main power source, i.e., thermoelectric plant (TEP), is allowed to operate in pure power generation mode or cogeneration mode to release the operation flexibility. This scheduling model is first linearized as a mixed-integer second-order conic programming (MISOCP) problem and then solved efficiently through a two-layer method. Finally, case studies on a modified IEEE 118-node power system verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Region of Attraction Estimation for Power Systems With Multiple Integrated DFIG-Based Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11031118</link><description>The lack of suitable modeling methods for power systems with multiple doubly-fed induction generator-based wind turbines (DFIGWTs) integrated has left the analytical description of the boundary of the region of attraction (ROA) of such systems largely unexplored. To address this gap, this paper derives an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model for a power system with multiple DFIGWTs integrated. The proposed electromechanical model is validated in a single-machine-infinite-bus (SMIB) power system and a modified 3 machine 9 bus power system with root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of less than 9.5% for trajectory comparisons with the full model, demonstrating that it accurately captures the low-frequency dynamics of the full DFIGWT model. Subsequently, the ODE model is transformed into a polynomial differential-algebraic equation (DAE) model using a nonlinear coordinate transformation. To estimate the ROA, an enhanced expanding interior algorithm (EIA) based on sum of squares (SOS) programming is applied. The feasibility of the proposed model, along with the appropriate conservativeness of the improved EIA, is validated using two test systems that include multiple DFIGWTs and synchronous generators (SGs). By comparison, it is found that the time cost of the improved EIA is reduced by around 17% while maintaining the accuracy. These results demonstrate that the proposed approach has significant practical implications for the integration of wind farms into power systems, and offers an efficient tool for transient stability analysis.</description></item><item><title>Extreme Probabilistic Solar Power Prediction via Localized Sample Structure Recognition and Generalized Error Estimation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11033220</link><description>The fluctuations and uncertainty of solar power constantly threaten the secure operation and economic dispatch of power systems. Existing end-to-end point or probabilistic solar power prediction methods mostly lack effective integration of the two approaches, and the latent error caused by machine learning (ML) techniques is rarely taken into consideration. Hence in this paper, a combined extreme probabilistic solar power prediction (EPSPP) scheme is proposed, by integrating point forecasting with extreme error estimation. Firstly, the localized sample structure recognition (LSSR) is conducted to determine the neighborhood of meteorological conditions, where feature weights of Euclidean distance measurement are allocated with respect to the valid mutual information (MI) derived by two-dimensional diffusion kernel density estimation (2D-DKDE). Secondly, with the neighborhood generated by LSSR, an improved localized generalization error estimation (ILGEE) algorithm is put forward to infer the real-time maximal second-order origin moment of solar power point forecasting error corresponding to designated confidence levels. Finally, the solar power at each temporal moment is deduced as distinct Gaussian distributions, by modifying the mean value and variance according to statistical principles. For the sake of the so-called &#8220;extreme&#8221;, the proposed scheme could maintain reliability even under circumstances of the worst ML model precision. Cases from a real-world solar power station in Oregon, USA, are used to validate its effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>A Mechanism-Based Convex Model of Fuel Cell Systems Considering the Effect of Auxiliary System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10976439</link><description>Fuel cell systems (FCS) are recognized as promising electric sources of power systems. However, existing FCS models are either nonconvex or inaccurate when the FCS is under heavy load. This letter proposes a mechanism-based FCS feasible operational area (FCSFOA) model, taking into account the decline in fuel cell efficiency and the dynamic power consumption of the auxiliary system. Therefore, the FCSFOA model is accurate both under light load and heavy load, and the average error is only 5.4% compared with the actual data. In contrast, the FCS linear model, the most commonly used in the dispatch of power systems, has an average error of 24.4% . Besides, the FCSFOA model is also convex, which is favorable for the dispatch of power systems.</description></item><item><title>Mutual Information-Enhanced NARX-NN Digital Twins for Power Electronics in Smart Grid Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11131160</link><description>This paper presents a systematic and innovative data&#8211;driven framework for constructing Mutual Information&#8211;enhanced NARX&#8211;NN Digital Twins (DTs) of power electronic converters, demonstrated on a DC&#8211;DC boost converter in continuous conduction mode under closed&#8211;loop voltage control. A Digital Twin Instance (DTI) of the inductance current is built via time&#8211;delay embedding of hidden dynamic attractors. Sampling frequency is optimized using self&#8211;Mutual Average Information (sMAI) to capture intra&#8211;cycle Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) dynamics. Input preselection uses correlation analysis and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), followed by delay assignment via sMAI and cross-MAI (cMAI). The False Nearest Neighbours (FNN) criterion determines the minimal embedding dimension. Two NARX&#8211;NN configurations (4D and 5D) are trained on a high&#8211;fidelity MATLAB&#8211;SIMULINK model including parasitics, filtering, and non&#8211;idealities. Although thermal and voltage variations are excluded to isolate modelling effects, the 5D model outperforms the 4D under both nominal and perturbed loads. In the frequency domain (up to 50 kHz), it improves amplitude tracking. Experimental validation via offline transfer learning reduces steady&#8211;state error to approximately  $\pm \,1\%$  and transient errors to a few percent, peaking at -13% in unseen saturation case. The resulting DTIs are lightweight (&lt;1 GFLOPS), delay-aware, and interpretable, enabling scalable real&#8211;time integration into converter&#8211;centric smart grid digital twin architectures without solving differential equations.</description></item><item><title>RoCoF and Nadir of Frequency Optimization Control for Cluster-Oriented Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142799</link><description>The cluster-oriented microgrids can better manage large-scale renewable energy integration systems compared to individual microgrids, the operation control of microgrid clusters (MGCs) under disturbances still face numerous challenges. Apart from the mainstream steady-state requirements, the transient performances of nadir of frequency (NoF) and the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) exhibit more practical significance. To this end, this paper proposes a multi-index optimization approach to provide an optimal control-design solution for MGCs, enhancing the system robustness and security. Firstly, steady-state stability conditions directly related to two-layer cooperative (TLC) control parameters are derived using a quasi-invariance property. Secondly, the control parameter related sufficient conditions to guarantee the NoF and RoCoF transient performance indexes are analyzed and formulated through a matrix inequality. Lastly, a multi-index objective function is designed to integrate all these conditions, yielding optimal control parameters that make all constraints hold. Real-time simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Secondary Control for DC Microgrids With Near-Infinite Constant Power Load Accommodation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11151627</link><description>In DC microgrids, constant power loads (CPLs) inherently exhibit negative impedance characteristics, which are widely believed to degrade system stability as their penetration level increases. Consequently, extensive research has aimed to establish safe upper bounds for CPL penetration. However, these upper bounds are typically derived as sufficient conditions, making them overly conservative. Moreover, when multiple DC sources are connected in parallel to a common DC bus, the simultaneous need for current sharing and DC bus voltage regulation further complicates system control. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel distributed secondary control method based on the dynamic averaging of virtual voltage drops (VVDs). The proposed method offers two key advantages: 1) It ensures both precise current sharing and voltage regulation in single-bus DC microgrids, even in the presence of mixed ZIP loads, i.e., constant resistive loads (Z), constant current loads (I), and constant power loads (P). 2) Unlike existing approaches that impose conservative limits on CPL penetration, the proposed method theoretically demonstrates that the safe upper bound for CPLs can be arbitrarily large, enabling the DC microgrid to accommodate an almost infinite number of CPLs without compromising stability. Both Simulation and experiment studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Safety-Guaranteed Voltage Regulation of Distribution Networks Using a Learning-Assisted Switching Tube Model Predictive Control Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11124582</link><description>This article proposes a learning-assisted switching tube model predictive control (S-TMPC) approach to achieve absolutely safety-guaranteed voltage regulation in distribution networks (DNs). In order to model time-varying operation modes, the switching dynamics have been introduced based on respective equilibrium points in DNs. Then, to quantify the safe operation region of each mode, an active learning algorithm with a reliable oracle is developed to estimate the safety-guaranteed reachable set, which simplifies the conventionally linear-matrix-inequalities-based (LMI-based) computation. Next, considering power disturbances of renewable energy generation, a tube model predictive control approach for safe voltage regulation is introduced, and its exponential stability condition is given. Once the voltage deviation exceeds the boundary of the operation mode, a learning-assisted switching mechanism, of which the switching action is enabled by admissible minimum dwell-time analysis of switches among safe reachable sets (i.e., pre-learned tubes) is developed to absolutely ensure a safe voltage regulation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed voltage regulation method is verified by representative simulations and experiment tests.</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid Imitation&#8211;Reinforcement Learning Framework for Optimal Operation of Soft Open Points in Unbalanced Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11131604</link><description>This paper proposes a hybrid actor-critic framework for the optimal operation of a phase-changing soft open point (PCSOP) in an unbalanced distribution network.

Finally, three real-life cases in China are studied to verify the effectiveness of both the model and solution method. This work highlights the importance of sizing optimization in enhancing the economic feasibility and production potential of large-scale ISDSE systems.</description></item><item><title>Weather Routing-Based Multi-Energy Ship Microgrid Operation Under Diverse Uncertainties: A Risk-Averse Stochastic Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11145936</link><description>The voyage environment, such as weather conditions, directly influences the propulsion load of a ship and even poses challenges to its safe journey. In this context, this article proposes a novel weather routing based operation approach for a multi-energy ship microgrid (MESM), which not only coordinates the heterogeneous onboard energy flows (e.g., electricity, thermal energy, green hydrogen, and freshwater) while also optimizing voyage route and speed based on dynamic weather conditions. In particular, a detailed weather-based route selection model and a weather-dependent propulsion load model are formulated, accounting for key environmental factors such as wind, waves, and drifting ice. To mitigate the risk against the uncertainties in environmental factors and cold ironing prices, a risk-averse two-stage stochastic programming integrated with a rolling horizon method is employed. In model solving, a tailored progressive hedging (TPH) algorithm is developed to enhance computational efficiency. Case studies based on a real cruise voyage in a Nordic country validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and the efficiency of the developed solution methods.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Reduction Method for Available Time Intervals of Large-Scale Demand-Side Resources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11121918</link><description>Incorporating demand-side resources (DRs) via virtual power plants into power system dispatch has become increasingly prevalent to increase power balancing flexibility. Nonetheless, diverse available time intervals for DRs impose substantial computational burdens for aggregation and may lead to infeasible dispatch after disaggregation. This work proposes an efficient reduction method for aggregating DRs with diverse time intervals and demand requirements while ensuring feasible dispatch. The method determines how to reduce the time interval ranges of all DRs to alleviate dispatch complexity. We reformulate an equivalent ILP problem with an available time interval matrix to reduce the problem scale. To further alleviate the computational burden, a fast approximation algorithm that combines interval clustering and weight selection is designed for large-scale DR aggregation. Numerical tests show that the proposed method maintains larger aggregated feasible regions to provide more flexibility than other inner-approximation methods, while maintaining feasible dispatch. Overall, the reformulated problem and fast approximation algorithm effectively reduce the computational time with a limited reduction in dispatch optimality.</description></item><item><title>Learning-Enabled Adaptive Power Capping Scheme for Cloud Data Centers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11123584</link><description>The rapid growth of the digital economy and artificial intelligence has transformed cloud data centers into essential infrastructure with substantial energy consumption and carbon emission, necessitating effective energy management. However, existing methods face challenges such as incomplete information, uncertain parameters, and dynamic environments, which hinder their real-world implementation. This paper proposes an adaptive power capping framework tailored to cloud data centers. By dynamically setting the energy consumption upper bound, the power load of data centers can be reshaped to align with the electricity price or other market signals. To this end, we formulate the power capping problem as a partially observable Markov decision process. Subsequently, we develop an uncertainty-aware model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) method to perceive the cloud data center operational environment and optimize power-capping decisions. By incorporating a two-stage uncertainty-aware optimization algorithm into the MBRL, we improve its adaptability to the ever-changing environment. Additionally, we derive the optimality gap of the proposed scheme under finite iterations, ensuring effective decisions under complex and uncertain scenarios. The numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method using a cloud data center operational environment simulator built on real-world production traces from Alibaba, which demonstrates its potential as an efficient energy management solution for cloud data centers.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Preserving Economic Dispatch in Microgrids via Robust Gradient-Tracking Over Directed Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11126159</link><description>Existing differentially private optimization algorithms for the distributed economic dispatch problem (EDP) often involve a trade-off between privacy performance and optimization accuracy. This paper presents a robust gradient-tracking based differentially private distributed algorithm to enhance both privacy performance and optimization accuracy for EDP. In particular, we employ solely row stochastic weight matrices to enable each agent to locally allocate weights to received messages. Moreover, unlike most existing approaches that rely on decaying noise, our algorithm integrates persistent noise into the exchanged information to enhance privacy performance. To mitigate the impact of persistent noise, we incorporate robust gradient-tracking techniques and introduce noise attenuation factors. By carefully selecting the step size and noise attenuation factors, we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves almost sure convergence while simultaneously ensuring  $\epsilon $ -differential privacy. Finally, simulation experiments conducted on the modified IEEE 14-bus microgrid system and IEEE 118-bus power system validate the effectiveness of our algorithm in terms of both convergence and privacy performance.</description></item><item><title>End-to-End Stochastic Predict-Then-Optimize for Cost-Efficient Water-Energy Resource Scheduling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142824</link><description>Compared to other energy-intensive industries, urban water supply systems are unique due to the strong temporal coupling with the power grid, which intensifies grid stress during peak hours. This paper addresses the water-energy nexus by developing a water-energy resource scheduling model for whole-process water supply that incorporates electricity cost prediction uncertainties. Meanwhile, to minimize the scheduling cost in an end-to-end approach, we propose the Stochastic Predict-then-Optimize (SPTO), which aligns prediction distribution with the optimality gap by integrating probabilistic forecasting with stochastic optimization. Unlike traditional two-stage approaches, SPTO establishes a closed-loop feedback between forecasting and optimization, reducing cumulative errors and improving real-time adaptability. To enable end-to-end training, we derive the SPTO+, a differentiable convex upper-bound surrogate function based on Lagrangian duality, which provides surrogate gradient computation for end-to-end training. Experiments on real-world systems demonstrate that SPTO significantly reduces operational cost and decision regret, effectively coordinating water operations with dynamic grid conditions to support cost-efficient and grid-responsive scheduling.</description></item><item><title>Disaggregating Distributed PV Power From Aggregate Measurements in Transmission Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11135456</link><description>The growing integration of Photovoltaic (PV) systems into distribution networks has limited visibility for system operators, as the power output of low-power PV systems is not typically monitored. The study presented in this paper introduces a novel approach for disaggregating PV generation from net-load measurements recorded at the transmission system level. The proposed technique is applied to actual data from an existing transmission line feeder to identify PV generation from net demand measurements. The developed methodology incorporates Geographical Information Systems (GIS) for detecting PV panels based on an algorithm that provides an accurate estimate of solar PV capacity. These estimations are validated against actual data from a local utility, showing a close match between the two. This information is then utilized in reliable software tools to simulate PV power generation in the studied region, which is then used to estimate and disaggregate the generated power from net-load data by applying multiple Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. The results demonstrate that, with the proposed approach, it is feasible to adequately disaggregate PV power generation from transmission feeder net-load measurements with minimal or no additional sensor infrastructure.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Objective Energy Management Strategy for Distribution Network With Distributed Renewable Based on Learning-Driven Model Predictive Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11130449</link><description>This paper investigates the energy management of distribution network with distributed renewable.

A battery energy storage system (BESS) is commonly used to manage these demand charges. Economic model predictive control (EMPC) with a reference trajectory can be used to dispatch the BESS to optimize the microgrid operating cost. Since demand charges are incurred monthly, EMPC requires a full-month reference trajectory for asymptotic stability guarantees that result in optimal operating costs. However, a full-month reference trajectory is unrealistic from a renewable generation forecast perspective. Therefore, to construct a practical EMPC with a reference trajectory, an EMPC formulation considering both non-coincident demand and on-peak demand charges is designed in this work for 24 to 48 h prediction horizons. The corresponding reference trajectory is computed at each EMPC step by solving an optimal control problem over 24 to 48 h reference (trajectory) horizon. Furthermore, BESS state of charge regulation constraints are incorporated to guarantee the BESS energy level in the long term. Multiple reference and prediction horizon lengths are compared for both shrinking and rolling horizons with real-world data. The proposed EMPC with 48 hour rolling reference and prediction horizons outperforms the traditional EMPC benchmark with a 2% reduction in the annual cost, proving its economic benefits.</description></item><item><title>Two-Tier Aggregation of Distributed Energy Storage Units Considering Network Access Purchase</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11131318</link><description>The number of distributed energy storage units (ESUs) within a distribution network is expected to increase because of the rapid deployment of 5G base stations, and they can be aggregated and formulated into a bid model of polytopic shape, which is consistent with market rules. However, it is challenging to design such a polytope that best captures their aggregate flexibility and satisfies distribution network constraints. This paper proposes a two-tier inner approximation aggregation model that aggregates the flexibility of ESUs first to the corresponding network buses and then to the substation. The uncertain power load of the 5G base station affects the minimum reserved energy of its backup battery. Therefore, with the aid of distributionally robust chance-constrained programming, a customized affine transformation-based method for inner approximation of the flexibility set is proposed to capture the charge/discharge logic and to handle uncertainty. In addition, the acquisition of network access limits is integrated into the optimal flexibility design of the aggregator by deriving the approximate form of the cost function in an auction framework. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of economy and uncertainty handling.</description></item><item><title>Cybersecurity by Design for Resilient Voltage Regulation in Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11131258</link><description>The transition to smart grids is advancing through the integration of grid-connected devices such as distributed energy resource (DER) inverters, distribution static synchronous compensators (D-STATCOMs), and electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, all of which play a vital role in voltage regulation within active distribution networks (DNs). Yet, these devices face growing exposure to cyber threats. This paper proposes a cybersecurity framework embedded directly within their control systems to address these risks by design. Drawing on the widespread deployment of distribution phasor measurement units (D-PMUs) for voltage monitoring, the framework incorporates a digital twin for real-time assessment, supported by data fidelity tests. This approach enables the timely detection and mitigation of false-data injection (FDI) and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, preserving voltage stability without requiring hardware modifications. Simulations on the IEEE 33-node test feeder confirm the framework&#8217;s effectiveness in strengthening the resilience and security of grid-connected systems, representing a meaningful step forward in the protection of smart grids.</description></item><item><title>Reliability Analysis of Virtual Power Plants for Peak-Regulation Service Using Phased Mission System Framework</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11133693</link><description>This paper proposes a reliability analysis method of virtual power plants (VPPs) for peak-regulation service by adopting the phased mission system (PMS) framework. Firstly, the PMS framework of VPP for peak regulation service is established by modeling it as a multi-phased mission, decomposed into several tasks including receiving, assigning, and executing the peak-regulation instructions. Besides, the single-phased binary decision diagram (BDD) model is proposed to evaluate the VPP&#8217;s performance of single-phased mission with the consideration of prime and auxiliary approaches for different tasks. Moreover, the whole-phased BDD model is proposed to analyze the VPP&#8217;s reliability for peak-regulation service by integrating the single-phased BDD model. Next, two reliability indices of VPP towards peak-regulation services are novelly proposed to represent the success rate and the insufficiency of peak-regulation service. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through extensive numerical tests on a verified IEEE test system.</description></item><item><title>Quantum Optimization for Optimal Power Flow: CVQLS-Augmented Interior Point Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11137411</link><description>This paper presents a quantum-enhanced optimization approach for solving optimal power flow (OPF) by integrating the interior point method (IPM) with a coherent variational quantum linear solver (CVQLS). The objective is to explore the applicability of quantum computing to power systems optimization and address the associated challenges. A comparative analysis of state-of-the-art quantum linear solvers&#8212;Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL), variational quantum linear solver (VQLS), and CVQLS&#8212;revealed that CVQLS is most suitable for OPF due to its stability with ill-conditioned matrices, such as the Hessian in IPM. To ensure high-quality solutions, prevent suboptimal convergence, and avoid the barren plateau problem, we propose a quantum circuit parameter initialization technique along with a method to guide the IPM along the central path. Moreover, we design an ansatz tailored for OPF, optimizing the expressibility and trainability of the quantum circuit to ensure efficient convergence and robustness in solving quantum OPF. Various optimizers are also tested for quantum circuit parameter optimization to select the best one. We evaluate our approaches on multiple systems to show their effectiveness in providing reliable OPF solutions. Simulations for the 2-bus system are conducted on a commercial IBMQ quantum device, while simulations for the other larger cases are performed using the IBM quantum simulator. While promising, CVQLS is limited by current quantum hardware, especially for larger systems. We use a quantum noise simulator to test scalability.</description></item><item><title>Aggregation of Heterogeneous DERs by the Subgradient Vertex Search Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11141502</link><description>The exploitation of distributed energy resources (DERs) is essential for the advancement of smart grids. However, the heterogeneity and scale of DERs pose major challenges to their aggregation, which is necessary to maximize their potential. This study adopts a linearized model that integrates a diverse array of DERs including power generation, energy storage, and flexible loads with varying dissipation rates. We used the model to analyze the compact form and mathematical implications of aggregation, for which we propose the subgradient vertex search method to solve. This method efficiently identifies vertices of the aggregate feasible region, which are used to construct its convex hull. Unlike traditional hyperplane-based methods, this method not only provides an inner approximation efficiently but also can converge to the exact solution. Numerical simulations validated its accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an energy flowchart to visualize high-dimensional space of energy change processes and provide a case study involving two vehicle-to-grid (V2G) charging piles to explain the mechanism of feasible region scaling, demonstrating the practical significance of precise aggregation.</description></item><item><title>Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning for Resilient Self-Proactive Distribution Grids Against Wildfires</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142361</link><description>With the growing risks and frequency of wildfires, power distribution systems (PDS) face significant challenges in maintaining reliability and security. Existing literature primarily focuses on post-event service restoration using stochastic optimization methods. Nevertheless, such approaches fall short in managing the dynamic and uncertain nature of wildfires, particularly when it comes to taking proactive measures to mitigate power outages. To address this problem, this paper introduces a wildfire smart resilience controller (WF-SRC) that utilizes a model-assisted safe Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) mechanism to reduce the impacts of wildfire-induced disruptions. The WF-SRC continuously monitors and analyzes both the status of the PDS and the spatiotemporal dynamics of wildfires, then executes preemptive actions to prevent wildfires from compromising distribution lines. These actions include optimally dispatching stationary and mobile distributed energy resources (DERs) that operate under a master-slave control scheme. While recent works assume full observability and formulate the PDS resilience problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), this approach leads to an impractically large state space and limited realism. In contrast, our approach models the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). This explicitly captures real-world sensing limitations, such as noisy measurements that arise during extreme events. The POMDP is tackled using an LSTM-TD3 DRL agent, enabling effective sequential decision-making in environments with incomplete information. Using real-world data from Alberta wildfires, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution in reducing wildfire impact, optimizing energy distribution, and enhancing robustness to uncertainties, ultimately contributing to a more resilient and proactive power grid.</description></item><item><title>Synergising Hierarchical Data Centers and Power Networks: A Privacy-Preserving Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142335</link><description>In the era of digitization, data centers have emerged as integral contributors sustaining our interlinked world, bearing responsibility for an increasing proportion of the world&#8217;s energy consumption. To facilitate the their fast rollout while progressing towards net-zero energy systems, the synergy of hierarchical data centers (cloud-fog-edge) and power networks can play a pivotal role. However, existing centralized co-dispatch manners encroach on the privacy of different agents within the integrated systems, meanwhile suffering from the combinatorial explosion. In this research, we propose a near-optimal distributed privacy-preserving approach to solve the non-convex synergy (day-ahead co-dispatch) problem. The synergy problem is formulated as a mixed integer quadratically constrained quadratic programming considering both communication and energy conservation, where Lyapunov optimization is introduced to balance operating costs and uncertain communication delays. To mitigate impacts of the highly non-convex nature, the normalized multi-parametric disaggregation technique is leveraged to reformulate the problem into a mixed integer non-linear programming. To further overcome non-smoothness of the reformulated problem, the customized  $\ell _{1}-$ surrogate Lagrangian relaxation method with convergence guarantees is proposed to solve the problem in a distributed privacy-preserving manner. The effectiveness, optimality, and scalability of the proposed methodologies for the synergy problem are validated via numerical simulations. The results also indicate that computing tasks can be migrated within the hierarchical data centers, demonstrating the flexible resource allocation capabilities of the hierarchical architecture, further facilitating peak load balancing in the power network.</description></item><item><title>Performance-Integrated Virtual Power Plant Management in the Frequency Regulation Market</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11146637</link><description>Renewable integration in power systems causes a surge of frequency fluctuations, primarily due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy. To address this challenge, distributed energy resources (DERs) pave one promising way for frequency regulation by their aggregation as a virtual power plant (VPP). For a VPP participating in the frequency regulation market, its regulation performance is critical for interaction with the system operator. This paper explores a performance-integrated management scheme for a VPP to optimize the utilization of heterogeneous DERs in the frequency regulation market. The relationship between the regulation performance and the DER reserve portfolio is first revealed through a data-driven method, which has rarely been studied in current work. This facilitates the integration of the mapped frequency regulation performance into the aggregation and disaggregation processes in the VPP management. Furthermore, in the aggregation process, the VPP&#8217;s feasible operation region associated with the high-dimensional variables and constraints is characterized through a cluster-based aggregation method. Given the massive heterogeneous DERs, this proposed method ensures satisfactory accuracy within the reduced computation time by efficiently capturing the representative DER characteristics. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified using real-world DER data from the Dataport database.</description></item><item><title>Assessment, Cause Localization, and Mitigation for Small-Signal Stability Risks in Multi-Parallel Grid-Forming Converter Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11151621</link><description>This article addresses small-signal stability issues for multi-parallel grid-forming converter systems based on a newly developed extended passivity theory.

The objective is to unify and simplify the tasks for (i) clustering visualisation, (ii) outlier detection and (iii) generative profile modelling under one concept. The lower dimensional projection of standardised MV load profiles unveils a latent distribution in a three-dimensional sphere. This spherical structure allows us to detect outliers by fitting probability distribution models in the spherical coordinate system, identifying measurements that deviate from the spherical shape. The same latent distribution exhibits an arc shape, suggesting an underlying order among load profiles. We develop a principal curve technique to uncover this order based on similarity, offering new advantages over conventional clustering techniques. This finding reveals that energy consumption in a wide region can be seen as a continuously changing process. Furthermore, we combined the principal curve with a von Mises-Fisher distribution to create a model capable of generating profiles with continuous mixtures between clusters. The presence of the spherical distribution is validated with data from four municipalities in the Netherlands. The uncovered spherical structure implies the possibility of employing new mathematical tools from directional statistics and differential geometry for load profile modelling.</description></item><item><title>Power-SAM: An Advanced Abnormality Change Detection Algorithm for Intelligent Monitoring in Power Equipment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11126170</link><description>Timely detection and management of abnormalities are critical to ensuring the safe and stable operation of the smart grid. To address this, a novel abnormal change detection (ACD) model, termed Power-SAM, is proposed for smart grids based on Artificial Intelligence. Firstly, integrate the strong generalization capabilities and efficient image segmentation performance of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) while employing fine-tuning strategies to enhance its applicability for processing images in power scenarios. Secondly, the Time Difference Feature Generator (TDFG) was designed to generate feature vectors suitable for ACD, allowing SAM to adapt to power ACD tasks. Thirdly, a feature fusion network, which combined feature aggregation with differential computation, was adopted, enhancing the model&#8217;s ability to detect subtle changes in power scenes. Lastly, CBAM-FPN by integrating Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and lightweight Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) was introduced to Power-SAM, improving ACD performance for multiscale targets. An image dataset for substation change detection was constructed from real-world power scenarios and ACD requirements. This dataset was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed Power-SAM model. The results demonstrate that the algorithm achieves precision, recall, F1-score, and IoU metrics of 95.25%, 93.35%, 94.41%, and 89.41%, respectively, outperforming current state-of-the-art artificial intelligence models.</description></item><item><title>Prediction of Charging Station Load Uncertainty Based on Multi-Dimensional Quantile Spatial-Temporal Traffic Flow Forecast</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119652</link><description>The uncertainty prediction of electric vehicle charging station load plays a crucial role in ensuring the stable operation of power grids. In this paper, a charging station load uncertainty prediction method based on multi-dimensional quantile spatial-temporal traffic flow forecast is proposed. First, considering the complex spatial-temporal correlation characteristics of traffic flow, a traffic flow forecast model based on multi-dimensional spatial-temporal graph convolutional network is designed. The model can deeply explore spatial-temporal correlation characteristics and effectively capture both the static spatial correlations with fixed topological structures and the dynamic spatial correlations of real-time traffic flow. Second, taking into account the importance of prediction results under different confidence levels, this paper combines the forecast model with a weighted quantile regression model and introduces a novel weighted loss function, which can achieve traffic flow uncertainty prediction without the need to predefine the uncertainty probability density distribution and meet the differentiated requirements for uncertainty prediction in grid operation and business decision-making. Furthermore, considering the influence of factors such as road congestion and electricity prices on charging load, a charging station load uncertainty prediction model based on an enhanced queuing model is proposed, which can more accurately convert traffic flow uncertainty into load uncertainty, and thus more accurately simulate the charging station loads. Finally, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Learning-Accelerated Distributed Economic Dispatch in Vehicle-to-Grid Integrated Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119663</link><description>Next-generation smart grids require decentralized optimization frameworks to coordinate diverse energy assets, including renewables, dispatchable generators, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G)-enabled electric vehicles (EVs). A critical challenge lies in reducing the overall communication overhead and computational burden for distributed economic dispatch through learning-accelerated optimization, while addressing uncertainties in EV charging patterns, time-varying communication networks, and battery longevity constraints. This paper proposes a learning-accelerated distributed optimization framework for V2G-integrated microgrids. A novel alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) enhanced by deep neural networks, termed learning-accelerated ADMM (LA-ADMM), is developed to predict optimal dual variables, with theoretical convergence under dynamic network conditions rigorously proved. For handling EV uncertainties, the framework incorporates model predictive control (MPC) architecture with dispatch package strategies that minimize computational overhead through adaptive reuse of historical solutions during steady-state operations. Battery lifespan preservation is achieved through tight coupling of operational constraints with a universal constant current-constant voltage (CC-CV) charging protocol. Validation via IEEE 39-bus simulations and Raspberry Pi-based hardware experiments demonstrates 70.9% iteration reduction compared to ADMM-MPC baselines, effective peak shaving/valley filling, and &lt;2% deviation between simulated and physical power profiles.</description></item><item><title>Inertia-Emulation-Based Fast Frequency Response From EVs: A Multi-Level Framework With Game-Theoretic Incentives and DRL</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142805</link><description>As the modern power grids increasingly integrate intermittent renewable energy sources, the reduction in system inertia creates challenges for frequency stability. Electric vehicles (EVs), with their rapid response capabilities and growing penetration, offer promising potential for providing virtual inertia services. In this paper, a novel fast frequency response framework with virtual inertia of EVs is proposed in a coupled power-transportation network. The proposed framework addresses the complex coordination required across multiple stakeholders through a hierarchical approach encompassing grid operators, charging stations (CSs), and EV users. At the grid level, the optimal inertia scheduling is developed to reduce system costs, considering the spatial-temporal characteristics of EVs and power fluctuations. For coordination between CSs, a game-theoretic incentive mechanism is designed to maximize collective benefits while encouraging EV participation in inertia services. In each CS, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based inertia control strategy can achieve the optimal inertia distribution, considering both EV battery conditions and user requirements. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. This approach provides a feasible operation solution for providing EV-based inertia in modern low-inertia grids.</description></item><item><title>Risk-Averse Decision-Dependent Distributionally Robust Optimization for the Resilient Cyber-Physical Distribution System Against Contingencies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11126174</link><description>The cyber-physical deep coupling brings the distribution system the possibility of superposition vulnerability on cyber and physical spaces, which will potentially raise the unobservability and uncontrollability issues of the system, readily causing power outages during contingencies. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a resilience-oriented design for the cyber-physical distribution system based on a risk-averse decision-dependent distributionally robust optimization (DD-DRO) model. Firstly, observable and controllable intentional islands, as a promising way, are formed against contingencies by remote-controlled switch deployment, wireless communication configuration, and local controller activation. To this end, the cyber-physical coupling mechanism is investigated by hybrid wired/wireless communication modeling and fault propagation modeling, ensuring the cyber system&#8217;s observation and control. Secondly, reinforcement measures are adopted to mitigate the risk of uncertain contingencies, however, triggering decision-dependent uncertainty. To handle this uncertainty, the adaptive moment information method is developed to construct an N-k decision-dependent ambiguity set. Therefore, the proposed DD-DRO model is formulated and then recast to a mixed-integer linear programming problem by linearization techniques, which is solved by a customized nested column-and-constraint generation algorithm. Finally, numerical results on the modified IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 69-bus test systems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and method.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Sensing, Transmission and Control for QKD-IoT Empowered Power-Communication Coupling Smart Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11126162</link><description>Quantum-classical hybrid encryption has elevated security levels of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled distributed power control. However, the decoupled design of communication and power systems introduces substantial technical challenges. Outdated or tampered state data propagating from communication to power domains trigger cascading control failures, as demonstrated in the 2015 Ukraine grid cyberattack. This motivates us to investigate the fundamental question of how to achieve power-communication collaborative control optimization by proposing a cross-domain gap driven optimization framework of integrated sensing, transmission and control. Our novel framework addresses these limitations through three synergistic innovations: (i) accurate false data injection (FDI) attack sensing based on temporal correlation, (ii) secure data transmission based on hierarchical cooperative learning, and (iii) trust and delay-weighted consensus control. Its superiority is validated through simulations across diverse attack scenarios, grid topologies, and network scales. It exhibits strong scalability and robustness in large-scale complex grids. Key finding revels that blocking propagation paths of outdated and tampered consensus variables effectively mitigates control deviations and oscillations.</description></item><item><title>Self-Organizing Post-Contingency Distribution Network via Drone-Assisted Resilience-Oriented Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142358</link><description>Distribution networks with inverter-based distributed energy resources may increasingly face extreme events. While localized and islanded energy supply can enhance grid resilience, post-contingency distribution networks may struggle with efficient communication capabilities and energy sources owing to inevitably tight cyber-physical interdependence. Currently, post-contingency distribution networks do not comprehensively integrate cyber-physical self-organization capabilities using mobile resources. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a drone-assisted distribution network self-organization framework to enable operational data collection and control implementation, further maximizing the system resilience margin. Specifically, post-contingency communication services, i.e., data collection and control actuation, are scheduled via a multi-drone flight trajectory optimization considering drone recharging needs. Due to recharging periods with no emergency communication services, a resilience-oriented optimization is developed to co-optimize power injections and generator parameters for both static optimality and dynamic stability. This involves a compromised objective function that balances long-term energy consumption with short-term tolerant power imbalance. Finally, the proposed communication-control service provision framework is demonstrated through comprehensive case studies.</description></item><item><title>Exploring Smart Grid Vulnerability Against Intelligent Inverter Parameter Tampering Attack</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11159533</link><description>The integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) with inverter-based resources (IBRs) significantly improves remote management and monitoring capabilities of power electronic devices in modern power systems. Nevertheless, this integration presents significant security vulnerabilities, rendering smart inverters susceptible to various cyber threats. To this end, this paper develops a novel vulnerability exploration method for smart grids against IBR parameter tampering attacks. In particular, a zero-knowledge Destabilising Attack based on Fuzzing-Assisted Reinforcement Learning, named DAFARL, is proposed with the following steps. First, search engines are employed to explore vulnerable IBRs accessible via the Internet. Subsequently, smart grid stability sensitivity to parameter alterations in inverters is evaluated through the proposed fuzzing-assisted reinforcement learning approach, enabling the identification of critical parameters without prior knowledge of the system model. On this basis, an optimal attack strategy is then formulated, considering attack difficulty, risk, and computational efficiency to achieve the cost-benefit trade-off. Furthermore, the corresponding active and passive defense mechanisms are designed to mitigate the negative impact of attacks. In addition, electromagnetic transient simulations conducted on a modified IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate that inverter-level parameter manipulations can lead to severe system-wide stability degradation. These results substantiate both the effectiveness of our proposed sensitivity analysis methodology and the stealth characteristics of DAFARL.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Agent Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning for HVAC Control With Flexible DERs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11123597</link><description>As electricity consumption in commercial and residential buildings continues to rise, reducing energy costs presents an increasing challenge. Heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, which typically account for 40%&#8211;50% of a building&#8217;s energy use, are prime targets for energy savings. Intelligent control of HVAC temperature through the exploitation of HVAC load flexibility brings significant potential to reduce energy consumption and electricity expenses. The nonlinear models of HVAC systems challenge traditional control methods, while the uncertainty introduced by HVAC load flexibility complicates distributed energy resource (DER) management using conventional optimal dispatch techniques. In response to these challenges, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach. The lower-level agents focus on balancing comfort and energy conservation, while the upper-level DRL agents optimize the use of DERs to reduce peak demand based on the control outcomes of the HVAC by the lower-level agents. In the upper-level agents, we incorporate a multi-agent structure based on ensemble learning, which acts based on historical and current data without relying on precise load forecasting to address the delayed rewarding issue in DRL. This allows for the effective reduction of energy costs. The proposed method is tested using a real-world microgrid comprising 413 buildings in Southern California, and the results demonstrate that our approach can significantly reduce overall electricity bills while ensuring the comfort of consumers and residents.</description></item><item><title>EdgeHEM: Sparse Federated Reinforcement Learning for Home Energy Management at the Edge</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11126167</link><description>With the growth of energy demand and the popularization of distributed energy resources, home energy management (HEM) has emerged as a crucial technology to improve energy efficiency and reduce electricity costs.

Network partitioning method can reduce such complexity by dividing the MGC into self-adequate partitions. However, existing dynamic network partitioning methods normally update the network partitioning results at fixed time intervals, which limits the ability to adapt to spatiotemporal variations in output of renewable energy sources (RESs), load demand, and grid topology. To address this, a dynamic network partitioning method based on an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) combined with depth-first search (DFS) is proposed. IGA is employed to optimize the partitioning index, and DFS is subsequently applied to obtain the network partitioning result. Furthermore, a dynamic update mechanism is designed to adaptively update the partitioning results according to spatiotemporal variations in system conditions. Simulation results on the modified IEEE 123-bus system show that the proposed method achieves better partitioning quality than the genetic algorithm (GA), spectral clustering, and Louvain algorithms while maintaining computational efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Tuning Friendly Deep Reinforcement Learning Method for Inverter-Based Volt/Var Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119650</link><description>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have been applied to power system problems in active distribution networks, including the inverter-based volt/var control (VVC).

Case studies demonstrate that the proposed optimal S2G dispatch solution is physically realizable and fully satisfies the battery charging needs of ESs within thermal security constraints.</description></item><item><title>Prediction-Free Online Energy-Macroclimate Management for Agricultural Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11145940</link><description>This letter proposes an energy-macroclimate management mechanism for rural agricultural microgrids (AMGs) and develops a prediction-free online method to address the reliance on prediction in real-time decision making.

The carrier recombination lifetime of cells is derived from measured Suns-Voc data based on sample-specific inputs of substrate thickness and resistivity. This work presents a sensitivity analysis of the carrier recombination lifetime measurements on silicon photovoltaic cells due to uncertainty in input thickness and resistivity and proposes best practices to reduce these uncertainties to achieve results with a high level of confidence. J0e uncertainties less than 1 fA/cm2 can be achieved with measurement or knowledge of input parameters beyond what is given on a specification sheet.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Photovoltaic Power Forecasting Using the LGB Model and Synthetic Features</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10969139</link><description>Over the past decade, the growing demand for sustainable energy has led to significant interest in photovoltaic (PV) power generation. Due to its intermittent nature, accurate PV power forecasting is essential for the efficient management and monitoring of PV systems. In this context, the accuracy of meteorological data is critical. However, it is not always possible to obtain such data on a local basis, and often some information, such as irradiance, is obtained from models whose characteristics are not known in detail. To overcome this limitation, this study evaluates five synthetic features that combine clear-sky global horizontal irradiance and cloudiness data to estimate total irradiance in the absence of direct measurements. A light gradient boosting model is used to evaluate the predictive performance of a model using these synthetic features compared to a model based on conventional meteorological inputs, including irradiance. The results, evaluated over a reference week, show that the feature labeled $\chi _{5}$ slightly improves model accuracy (passing from an RMSE of 84.013 to 87.232 W/kWp and $R^{2}$ from 0.888 to 0.875). These results show that synthetic features can achieve comparable results and in some cases even improve prediction performance.</description></item><item><title>Study of Photovoltaic Parameters of Efficient Bulk-Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells for Indoor Applications Under Varied Intensities and Indoor LED Lighting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11123166</link><description>Bulk-heterojunction devices with D18 and Y12 as active material were fabricated with an inverted ITO/zinc oxide/active material/molybdenum (III) oxide/Ag structure. Donor D18 and acceptor Y12 have complementary absorption spectra covering the visible range (300&#8211;800 nm). Furthermore, the energy layer alignment of these materials also makes it easier for charge generation and transport. All these factors lead to exploiting the possibility of using these organic solar cells (OSCs) for indoor photovoltaic (IPV) applications. The devices prepared previously were soaked in light (AM1.5 G) and illuminated under three types of white LED: warm white, standard white, and cool white. The intensities of the lights were varied, and the photovoltaic parameters of the cells were recorded. The variation of photovoltaic parameters with the intensity and color-correlated temperature (CCT) of different lights was thoroughly studied in this work. The external quantum efficiency of devices was also recorded. Here, we obtained cells with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.88% in AM1.5 G, which went up to 27.58% in indoor lighting. All the devices were prepared without the nitrogen glovebox and were characterized in ambient conditions, which is the first step toward commercializing and integrating the cells in the Internet of Things (IoTs). IPV, being an emerging field, the study of photovoltaic parameters under varied intensity of light and different lights reveals a lot of information about the behavior of cells. Such a study has never been performed before, and the correlation between intensity and CCT of light with photovoltaic parameters and PCE unveils invaluable information about indoor OSCs. The results of this study could potentially aid in optimizing and developing OSC for self-sustaining IoTs in the near future.</description></item><item><title>Uncovering Structure&#8211;Performance Relationships in Organic Photovoltaics: Interpretable Machine Learning Model for Predicting the Power Conversion Efficiency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11123139</link><description>Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) represent a promising photovoltaic technology, but the design of candidate molecules has traditionally followed a trial-and-error approach, which is inefficient. However, machine learning provides a data-informed strategy by learning from large OPV material datasets, supporting the accelerated discovery and optimization of high-performance OPV materials. In this study, we use an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model to predict the density functional theory-calculated power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OPV donor materials using structural features extracted from the Harvard Photovoltaic Dataset (HOPV15) dataset. To enhance predictive performance, we select the most informative molecular fingerprints based on the averaged feature importance scores from both random forest and XGBoost. Our XGBoost model achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy on HOPV15 with $R^{2}$ = 0.918 and RMSE = 0.302%, outperforming prior methods. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations, we identify key Morgan and PubChem substructures that influence PCE, offering interpretable insights. This framework supports accurate, explainable OPV prediction and holds promise for high-throughput screening.</description></item><item><title>Color Engineering in CIGS Solar Cells: An Electro-Optical Modeling Perspective</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11126070</link><description>Photovoltaic panels are typically black or dark blue, which can limit their integration into the surrounding environment. Enhancing their appearance through color modifications can promote broader adoption, particularly for building integrated applications. Optimizing the performance of colored Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) cells requires a thorough understanding of how layer thickness influences both color hue and efficiency. We analyze colored CIGS solar cells using a self-consistent electro-optical simulation approach. Unlike previous studies that focus solely on optical properties, our approach integrates both optical and electrical modeling to provide a more accurate assessment of device performance. By accounting for light behavior, charge generation, recombination processes, and electrical transport, we analyze how variations in layer thickness influence both color and efficiency. In addition, we examine the effects of installation angle and lighting conditions on color perception and power output. This study offers deeper insights into the mechanisms governing colored CIGS solar cells, contributing to a more precise assessment of their practical implementation across different applications. A color&#8211;geometry&#8211;performance map is developed to evaluate whether the manufactured colored CIGS solar cells meet both aesthetic and performance criteria as well as to explain the observed behavior.</description></item><item><title>Postannealing in Metal&#8211;Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition Reactor: A Scalable Method for Improving InGaAsP Solar-Cell Efficiency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11173713</link><description>InGaAsP solar cells with a bandgap of approximately 1.05 eV, which are lattice matched to InP substrates, generally exhibit relatively lower crystal quality and energy conversion efficiency compared with other III&#8211;V compound semiconductor solar cells, such as the GaAs solar cell. This is mainly owing to the challenges in achieving a uniform chemical composition and reducing nonradiative recombination defects during the growth process. In this study, we effectively addressed this challenge by directly performing postannealing within the metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition system. Following annealing, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current density (JSC) of the solar cells were improved by 38 mV and 3.84 mA/cm2, respectively. The analysis of voltage losses, along with time-resolved photoluminescence results, revealed that the improvements in VOC and JSC were attributed to the reduction of nonradiative recombination defects and enhancement of carrier lifetime, respectively. X-ray diffraction analysis showed a reduction in the full width at half maximum of the peak in annealed InGaAsP samples, indicating that annealing significantly enhanced the compositional uniformity of the material, which was likely driven by the redistribution of group-III atoms (In and Ga in InGaAsP) during the thermal annealing process. In addition, low-temperature photoluminescence results confirmed a reduction in nonradiative recombination defects, further corroborating the findings from the voltage-loss analysis. Postannealing treatments have significantly enhanced the crystal quality of InGaAsP, leading to a notable 32% improvement in the efficiency of InGaAsP solar cells in the best cases. Thus, this study highlighted annealing as an effective and scalable approach to optimizing the growth process for InGaAsP-based solar cells.</description></item><item><title>New Model for Estimating the Temperature and Solar Irradiance of Photovoltaic Panels Based on Maximum Power Point Tracking Measurements</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11165153</link><description>This article proposes a new method for estimating the temperature and irradiance of a photovoltaic module using current and voltage measurements within a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control system. Unlike traditional methods that depend on external data, such as those provided by complex irradiance and wind speed sensors and equipment, this approach relies solely on panel-specific I&#8211;V measurements needed for MPPT, enabling accurate estimations through a simpler and real-time method. A comparative evaluation of various panel temperature estimation techniques confirms that the proposed method outperforms existing ones, resulting in mean absolute estimation errors below 1 &#176;C for temperature and 4 W/m2 for irradiance. The method effectively addresses temperature variations, particularly under low irradiance conditions, where the proportional relationship between current and irradiance becomes less reliable. Results indicate that incorporating the estimated panel temperature significantly enhances irradiance predictions, especially in real-world operating conditions. Furthermore, the method remains valid even as the panel ages, making it a valuable tool for optimizing photovoltaic system performance. Given its simplicity and its low cost, this technique is well suited for real-time monitoring and optimization of solar energy installations.</description></item><item><title>Experimental Investigations on Performance and Safety of c-Si PV Modules Installed in Hot Semiarid Climatic Conditions in India</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11153737</link><description>In this study, field testing of multicrystalline-Si photovoltaic (PV) modules was carried out in a 760-kWp grid-interactive solar PV (SPV) power plant at Manesar, Haryana. This study assesses the field-level defects and their impact on PV modules after the infant stage in a hot semiarid climatic condition, which was not reported earlier in any other works. The test methodology involved insulation resistance (wet leakage current test), visual inspection, infrared imaging, and I&#8211;V measurements in the field. The safety and performance tests were carried out for a period of 1 month, and the results were analyzed in accordance with the relevant IEC standards, i.e., IEC 62446-2:2020, IEC 61215-1-1:2021, IEC 60904-1-2020, and IEC 60891-1-2021. The results indicate that out of 125 tested PV modules, 83 (66.4%) failed in the wet leakage current test, 122 (97.6%) had hotspot issues, and all the modules exhibited visual defects, such as delamination, ingression of water, moisture and dust particles, snail trail, edge sealant degradation, corrosion of PV cell metallic contacts, visible cell cracks, and burn marks, in PV cells. For the PV modules tested, an average annual power degradation of 2.46% was observed with maximum and minimum degradation of 6.15% and 1.25% per year, respectively. The failure mode and effects analysis outcomes suggest that the maximum risk level for PV modules under investigation is edge seal degradation and delamination with the highest risk priority numbers (RPNs) (RPN = 360 and 350, respectively). The results presented in this article provide new insight on various aspects such as degradation rate and safety considerations specific to similar climatic conditions and will be beneficial for all stakeholders of SPV power plants including module manufacturers.</description></item><item><title>Computational Intelligence-Based Modeling of a UAV-Integrated PV Module in Icing Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11152334</link><description>Solar UAVs utilize solar energy to extend flight endurance and reduce maintenance compared to traditional UAVs. However, in-flight icing presents significant challenges, impacting both aerodynamic performance and the operational reliability of UAV-integrated photovoltaic (PV) systems. Ice accumulation on wings degrades mechanical properties, while icing on PV modules obstructs sunlight, adversely affecting their parameters. Partial shading from ice is more harmful than uniform shading, complicating PV module behavior analysis. This study presents a novel approach to model the behavior of UAV-integrated PV modules incorporating the impact of nonuniform in-flight icing into irradiance calculations. By analyzing how ice formation acts as an obstacle and considering its effect on the PV module governing equations, this research develops a computational framework alongside with segmenting the PV module's operational curve into two zones: ice-covered and normal. The parameters for these zones are determined using advanced computational intelligence methods. The proposed method enables predictions of PV module performance using trained machine learning models, enhanced by the minimum redundancy maximum relevance technique, under dynamic and adverse conditions such as movement-induced sunlight variations and partial shading. The trained models&#8217; performance is validated through experimental tests, demonstrating the reliability and effectiveness of the approach.</description></item><item><title>Wireless Sensor Network-Based Fault Detection and Localization for Solar Stations: An Experimental Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11107362</link><description>This article introduces a wireless sensor network (WSN) system that enhances photovoltaic (PV) performance during shading through real-time fault detection and adaptive optimisation. The solution employs five strategically placed sensors and a Chipkit Max32-based algorithm that: 1) detects shading faults with 98.2% accuracy via dynamic voltage-current correlation, 2) localises faults at 95.7% precision using impedance mapping, and 3) recommends bypass actions to limit power loss. Experimental results demonstrate a 27.4% improvement in power output under shading versus conventional systems, with 1.8-s response times (60% faster than academic alternatives) at $23/node (62% cheaper than commercial optimisers). Key innovations include a hybrid series-parallel classification matrix and adaptive current weighting, which reduces false alarms by 41%. The system maintains more than 94% of the maximum power point during dynamic shading, as validated through comparative analysis with seven state-of-the-art methods. This work establishes a new standard for cost-effective, real-time PV monitoring while resolving critical WSN limitations in sensor density and shading response.</description></item><item><title>Three-Stage Optimization-Based Framework for Grid-Connected Sizing of a PV Power Plant System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11130570</link><description>The grid-connected sizing of a photovoltaic (PV) power plant system aims to determine the equipment and components necessary to operate and integrate PV panels into an on-grid system with compatibility, efficiency, affordability, and reliability. In this context, this article proposes a new three-stage optimization-based framework for the grid-connected sizing of a PV power plant. In Stage 1, the $k$-means clustering algorithm is utilized to determine the placement and dimensions of the inverters, as well as the number of strings and the arrangement of PV modules in strings. During Stage 2, the DC wiring is sized to facilitate the connection between the PV strings and the inverters. Finally, in Stage 3, the AC wiring is sized to connect the inverters to the power substation. Stages 2 and 3 are formulated as mixed-integer linear programming problems to minimize investment costs and reduce AC power losses. The framework is implemented using different tools and libraries, including Quantum Geographic Information System for geospatial panel placement, Python libraries such as scikit-learn for clustering, and Pyomo for modeling the optimization problem of Stages 2 and 3 with the Gurobi solver. A real-world case study of a PV power plant located in Brazil, which covers an area of 13 000 m$^{2}$ and a nominal power of 1.2 MW, is used to validate the proposed framework. The results demonstrate the robustness, feasibility, and scalability of the proposed methodology.</description></item><item><title>Smarter PV Single Axis Tracking: A Study on Diffused Light Capture</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11141479</link><description>Solar trackers are advantageous for photovoltaic (PV) systems, typically generating more energy than those mounted on fixed racks. However, this is not always the case, when the sun is obscured by clouds, it is often more efficient to position the PV panel in a fixed horizontal position toward the zenith in order to collect the most diffuse irradiance. This study introduces a hybrid single-axis tracking (SAT) algorithm, named Sundelay, which utilizes sky images to determine the optimal moments for switching between sun tracking and a fixed horizontal position. Sundelay is evaluated through simulations conducted in two distinct locations: Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Eugene, Oregon. The simulations leverage a novel dataset comprising minutely recorded $180^{\circ }$ direct irradiance measurements obtained from a multiplanar irradiance sensor (MPI) and images captured by an all-sky camera. Our findings indicate energy gains of up to 4.3% with a 61% reduction in the movement of the SAT system over a month, while maintaining minimal impact on irradiance and movement during clear sky conditions.</description></item><item><title>An Interpretable Deep Learning Model for Solar Power Generation Forecasting in a Grid-Connected Hybrid Solar System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11214301</link><description>Solar energy adoption is rapidly growing as a sustainable option, with solar panels used on residential buildings, commercial properties, and large-scale farms. However, the unpredictable nature of solar power can lead to suboptimal energy generation from photovoltaic (PV) panels. Despite the high effectiveness of deep learning (DL) models in forecasting PV power, they often struggle with the perception of being &#8220;closed boxes&#8221; that lack clear explanations for their prediction results, which fail to highlight the key features for PV prediction. To address the critical issue of full transparency, this study explores a well-known DL model named lightweight deep neural network (LWDNN) in PV power forecasting, along with the application of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) tools like Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). Real-time data collected from a grid-connected solar PV system located in Dhaka were utilized to perform the prediction. By enabling XAI model interpretation, we identified feature contributions and explained individual predictions, reducing training computational demands without compromising accuracy. The reliability of the LWDNN model is assessed using both complete and reduced feature sets through performance metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2). The test results show that the proposed LWDNN model based on SHAP analysis outperforms conventional schemes by achieving RMSE = 6.180 kW, MAE = 1.939 kW, and R2 = 0.988. Finally, the model was implemented on a Raspberry Pi for low-power solar forecasting, demonstrating the feasibility of edge deployment.</description></item><item><title>Impact of Wind Speed and Direction on Cooling of a Pontoon-Based Floating Photovoltaic System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11196060</link><description>Floating photovoltaics (FPVs) are gaining traction as a land-saving alternative to ground-mounted photovoltaics (GPV). A commonly cited advantage of FPVs is their potential for lower operating temperatures due to the cooling effect of water. However, existing literature shows that the thermal performance of FPV systems may not consistently exceed that of GPV systems, as it is influenced by technology and location. Consequently, studying the thermal properties of a range of FPV systems is crucial to optimize power output and enable accurate energy yield modeling for new sites. This work investigates the thermal properties and calculated heat loss coefficients, or U-values, associated with the Faiman model for an FPV system using Ciel &amp; Terre's Hydrelio Air floats, located in a pond in South Africa. A dependence of U-values on wind direction was observed, with improved cooling when the wind approaches from the rear side of the system. The estimated U-value components were U0 = 21.6 W/m2&#183;K and U1 = 3.60 W&#183;s/m3&#183;K for wind from the front and U0 = 19.4 W/m2&#183;K and U1 = 7.10 W&#183;s/m3&#183;K for wind from the rear side. The impact of the observed cooling variation due to wind direction on system performance was also evaluated, revealing a 1.7% increase in median performance ratio when the wind originates from the rear side.</description></item><item><title>An Anomaly Detection Method for the Output Power of Photovoltaic Arrays Based on TKAN</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11137363</link><description>One of the greatest challenges facing photovoltaic (PV) power generation systems today is maintaining their operation at the desired power generation efficiency. To achieve this goal, the anomaly detection of the output power of PV arrays is crucial for ensuring reliability and safety. This article proposes an anomaly detection for the output power of PV arrays based on temporal Kolmogorov&#8211;Arnold networks (TKANs). First, a dataset of PV array parameters is constructed by selecting the time series of output power, ambient temperature, component temperature, and irradiance of the PV array as input features. Second, the PV array parameter dataset undergoes feature normalization by obtaining the boundary values of environmental information and operating parameters, and scaling them to the range of 0&#8211;1. Then, the processed dataset is trained using the TKAN neural network to obtain the anomaly detection model of the output power of the PV array. Finally, the proposed method is compared and analyzed with three other methods, such as Isolation Forest, $K$-means, and long short-term memory, verifying its reliability and superiority. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in a self-built PV power plant.</description></item><item><title>Is the Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) a Sufficient Indicator to Describe the Efficiency of Agrivoltaic System?</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11192315</link><description>The land equivalent ratio (LER) is a widely used coefficient by researchers in studies related to agrivoltaic systems.

We demonstrate this using 14nm and 5nm FinFET-based ring oscillators, by collecting data across varying supply voltages, temperatures, and process corners. Using three baseline ML models&#8212;XGBoost, Random Forest, and a Neural Network&#8212;we simulate real-world design scenarios where parameter fine-tuning may not always be feasible. Key tasks include predicting layout performance from schematic data, performance prediction across process corners, and fabricated chip performance. Our results show that these models can achieve less than 5% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for power and frequency prediction while reducing required simulations by more than  $2\times $ . When migrating from 14nm to 5nm, XGBoost and Neural Network achieve high accuracy (&gt;0.99  $R^{2}$ ) using just 10% of the otherwise required 5nm simulations. We also present an extensive robustness analysis to demonstrate that our results are not limited to a single data split or initialization. By varying random seeds across multiple runs, we evaluate the stability of each model with respect to algorithm initialization and the selection of training data subsets. This demonstrates that the observed accuracy is consistent and not the result of a specific, favorable configuration. This framework offers a promising approach to accelerating circuit design across technology nodes by reducing simulation costs while maintaining accuracy in predicting performance.</description></item><item><title>An Integer-N Reference-Double-Sampling PLL for Frequency-Multiplied Octa-Phase Clock Generation Achieving &#8722;251.9 dB FOMJitter-N</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11131491</link><description>This paper presents a reference double-sampling phase-locked loop (RDSPLL) that integrates frequency multiplication and octa-phase clock generation into a single system, significantly reducing power consumption. A differential ring oscillator (DRO) is employed to generate octa-phase clocks with high phase accuracy. The reference double-sampling technique extends the loop bandwidth, effectively suppressing phase noise from the ring oscillator and thereby reducing jitter. To achieve accurate and efficient phase error detection, we proposed a novel offset-compensated hybrid phase detector (OCH-PD), featuring an offset calibration and a comparator-ADC hybrid quantizer. The offset calibration utilizes the CDAC to dynamically compensate for the mismatch in double-sampling, improving jitter and spur performance. The hybrid quantizer supports dynamic mode switching based on different locking states: during the coarse frequency locking phase, it operates in the ADC mode to accelerate the locking process; once a stable lock is achieved, it switches to the comparator mode to enable low-power, high-speed quantization. Fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, the prototype achieves 674 fs RMS jitter at 2.4 GHz while consuming only 3.43 mW, resulting in a  $\text {FOM}_{\text {Jitter-N}}$  of -251.9 dB. With offset calibration, the reference spur at 100 MHz is suppressed from -56 dBc to -80 dBc, and the jitter is reduced from 1.42 ps to 674 fs. The locking time improves from  $10.5~{\mu }$ s to  $1.6~{\mu }$ s using the hybrid quantizer. The eight-phase accuracy remains better than 1&#176; over the frequency range of 2-2.8 GHz.</description></item><item><title>A Compact, Power-Efficient, and On-the-Fly I2C-to-SPI Converter for Distributed E-Textile Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11073551</link><description>This paper presents a 0.36-mm2 I2C-to-SPI converter chip designed for electronic textile (E-textile) applications, featuring an on-the-fly conversion scheme that eliminates the need for on-chip data buffers and internal clock generation. By leveraging the synchronous nature of both I2C and SPI protocols, the proposed design forwards each incoming I2C data bit, SDA (Serial Data Line) directly to the SPI output using the I2C serial clock line (SCL), thereby reducing both area and power consumption. Two versions of the chip are proposed: a &#8216;full&#8217; die and a &#8216;compact&#8217; die. The converter enables seamless integration into distributed in-textile architectures by minimizing silicon overhead. The &#8216;full&#8217; die implementation achieves a  $7.33\times $  area reduction compared to commercially available I2C-to-SPI converters, while the &#8216;compact&#8217; version further reduces the footprint by  $14.73\times $  through the use of a small corner seal-ring and a linear pad ring layout. Measurement results confirm robust operation at ultra-fast I2C frequency (5 MHz), consuming only 0.379 mW for the &#8216;full&#8217; die and 0.333 mW for the &#8216;compact&#8217; variant.

Three operation modes, the energy-saving (ES) mode, the normal (NM) mode, and the high-resolution (HR) mode, can be supported by reconfiguring the resolution of the internal SAR ADC (N ${}_{\mathrm {SAR}}$ ) and the oversampling rate (OSR), while the NTF optimization is realized by modulating locations of zeros and poles in the context of a specific mode to enhance the NS effect. The prototype ADC is fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS and operates under a 1.8-V supply. Operating at 5MS/s sampling rate, the ADC&#8217;s OSR can be configured as 8 or 16 in different operation modes, so its bandwidth can be configured as 312.5kHz or 156.25kHz. With NSAR and OSR reconfigured to be 8-bit and 8 for the ES mode, it achieves a signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) of 80.3dB and consumes  $201\mu $ W. Attributing to the NTF optimization, 27% power saving can be reached in the ES mode with respect to that when the optimization were disabled for the same SNDR. In the HR mode, NSAR and OSR are set to be 9-bit and 16, respectively. And a SNDR of 93.3dB is obtained at the expense of consuming  $280\mu $ W. It is evidenced that the SNDR can be boosted by 6.4dB owe to the NTF optimization, resulting in an optimal SNDR-based Schreier figure-of-merit (FoM ${}_{\mathrm {S}}$ ) of 180.8dB for the ADC. The values for NSAR and OSR are determined to be 9-bit and 8 for the NM mode, and the achievable SNDR is 88.2dB. The occupied core area is 0.537 mm2.</description></item><item><title>LearnAFE: Circuit-Algorithm Co-Design Framework for Learnable Audio Analog Front-End</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11044866</link><description>This paper presents a circuit-algorithm co-design framework for learnable analog front-end (AFE) in audio signal classification. Designing AFE and backend classifiers separately is a common practice but non-ideal, as shown in this paper. Instead, this paper proposes a joint optimization of the backend classifier with the AFE&#8217;s transfer function to achieve system-level optimum. More specifically, the transfer function parameters of an analog bandpass filter (BPF) bank are tuned in a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-aware training loop for the classifier. Using a co-design loss function LBPF, this work shows superior optimization of both the filter bank and the classifier. Implemented in open-source SKY130 130nm CMOS process, the optimized design achieved 90.5%&#8211;94.2% accuracy for 10-keyword classification task across a wide range of input signal SNR from 5 dB to 20 dB, with only 22k classifier parameters. Compared to conventional approach, the proposed audio AFE achieves 8.7% and 12.9% reduction in power and capacitor area respectively.</description></item><item><title>A 15&#8211;28 GHz Low-Noise Amplifier With 0.75-dB Gain Ripple Across the Full K-Band</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11060582</link><description>The design of a 15&#8211;28 GHz broadband low-noise amplifier (LNA) is presented, employing a magnetically coupled resonator (MCR) to achieve simultaneous bandwidth extension and output matching. To address the increased in-band ripple that occurs when enhancing bandwidth with limited on-chip inductor values, an emitter-collector feedback transformer is introduced to mitigate the MCR ripple by generating an additional pole.

Many preclinical studies and clinical applications urgently require a portable, high-quality, low-cost, and fast imaging system. Thus, translating advanced image reconstruction algorithms into hardware implementations is highly desired. However, existing iterative PA image reconstructions, although exhibit higher accuracy than the delay-and-sum algorithm, suffer from high computational cost. In this paper, we introduce a novel model-based hardware architecture for palm-size PA tomography (palm-PAT), aiming at enhancing both the speed and performance of image reconstruction at a much lower system cost. To achieve this, we propose an innovative data reuse method that significantly reduces the consumption of hardware storage resources, achieving a reduction of approximately 75% in hardware storage requirements. We conducted experiments utilizing the FPGA implementation of the algorithm, using phantom, human finger data in vivo and ex vivo breast tumor data to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that our proposed architecture can substantially reduce system cost while maintaining high imaging performance. The novel hardware architecture design of the model-based algorithm achieves a speedup of up to approximately 270 times compared to the CPU, while the corresponding energy efficiency ratio is improved by more than 2700 times.</description></item><item><title>DCiROM: A High-Density Fully-Digital Compute-in-Read-Only-Memory Macro for Energy-Efficient Task-Level DNN Inference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11062902</link><description>Compute-in-memory (CiM) is a promising approach to alleviating the von Neumann memory wall bottleneck in data-intensive tasks. As a candidate to build CiM, static-random-access memory (SRAM) has become popular in accelerating deep neural networks (DNNs) because of its mature fabrication support and high flexibility. However, SRAM-based CiM suffers from low memory density, resulting in frequent weight reloading and increased power consumption during end-to-end inference tasks. Recently, read-only-memory (ROM)-based analog CiM (ACiM) has demonstrated the potential to deploy all DNN weights on-chip by leveraging high-density ROM. It may also achieve encouraging flexibility by exploiting the synergy between a small SRAM and a big ROM. Nevertheless, it faces challenges in achieving high computing density due to limitations in analog-to-digital converter (ADC) performance. Meanwhile, digital CiM (DCiM) improves computing density but incurs significant energy and area overhead due to the adder tree. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the first fully digital and flexible compute-in-read-only-memory (DCiROM) design approach. On the one hand, DCiROM introduces a novel ROM-logic fusion CiM that reduces the CiM area by 51% while maintaining high memory density and computing performance. On the other hand, DCiROM achieves high flexibility with minimal area overhead by proposing two innovative multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) resource-reusing techniques. This work has implemented a DCiROM chip with 3024Kb ResNet-56 parameters using a 65nm CMOS technology. This macro achieves 6.9-29.5x higher normalized FoM (memory density x computing density) than the state-of-the-art CiM works. Additionally, it reduces energy consumption per image inference by 2.9-9.9x compared to SRAM-based CiM works when off-chip access is considered.</description></item><item><title>A Bit-Partitioned Floating-Point 6T SRAM Computing-in-Memory Macro Based on Dual-Edge Time-Domain Structure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11080504</link><description>In the computing-in-memory (CIM) field, floating-point (FP) CIM is afflicted with high computing latency and energy consumption due to the intricate procedures involved in exponent computation and processing. In this work, an 8Kb FP time-domain (TD) static-random-access-memory (SRAM) CIM macro is presented. Fabricated with a 180nm process, this macro exhibits low computational latency and high energy efficiency. A novel FP computing architecture is proposed, which is capable of concurrently executing exponent summation, maximum value finding, difference generation, and mantissa shifting. This architecture effectively reduces the overall delay in exponent computation and processing, thereby enhancing the throughput. Furthermore, a bit-partitioned computing concept and an exponent sparsity scheme are introduced. In this scheme, sparsity judgment is made solely by processing the high 4 bits of the exponent, which significantly reduces power consumption in the remaining exponent computation and processing steps. Additionally, based on the bit-partitioned concept, a dual-edge TD exponent summation and mantissa multiplication-and-accumulation (MAC) circuit is devised. This circuit not only suppresses nonlinear errors during multi-bit computation but also exploits both the rising and falling edges of pulses for computation, thus accelerating the macro&#8217;s operation speed. Compared to previous approaches, an extra 24% power reduction is achieved. At a sparsity level of 90%, a normalized energy efficiency of 14.418 TFLOPS/W and a normalized area efficiency of 0.041 TFLOPS/mm2 are attained. When this work is applied to the ResNet-18 model with BF16 format for input, weight, and output, the accuracy loss on the CIFAR-100 dataset is merely &#8722;0.16%.</description></item><item><title>Booth-Assisted Mixed-Precision Reconfigurable Digital Computing-in-Memory Engine With Ternary-Input 1T2R ReRAM for Edge AI</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11128898</link><description>ReRAM has emerged as a promising candidate for computing-in-memory due to its excellent compatibility with advanced CMOS processes, high density, and non-volatility. Meanwhile, Digital Computing-in-Memory (DCIM) offers higher energy efficiency than its analog counterpart and supports full-precision processing. However, existing ReRAM-based DCIMs are hindered by error-prone readout and low input parallelism. The inefficient bit-width reconfiguration also incurs significant hardware overhead during neural network mapping. This paper reports a 64Kb DCIM engine based on 1T2R ReRAM bitcells for multiply-and-Accumulate(MAC) acceleration. The ternary-input Booth-assisted multiply-in-memory (TB-MIM) flow allows bi-state ReRAM with limited readout margin to achieve high-accuracy computation with high parallelism.

The proposed CIS employs a dual ramp generator and column-parallel gain control to enable two-stage analog gain (AG) adjustments, achieving up to 256 unique column-wise gain patterns. Additionally, this study introduces an innovative image synthesis method, which allows for HDR implementation without any loss of image resolution during the synthesis process. This ensures that the sensor maintains high-resolution imaging quality while adapting dynamically to illumination changes. These innovations allow for fine-grained HDR image synthesis within a single frame, eliminating motion blur and supporting real-time performance in dynamic environments. By combining these features, the proposed approach achieves a balance between high adaptability and high-quality imaging, meeting the stringent requirements of modern machine vision systems.

However, traditional CIM architectures face challenges such as high resource consumption, especially in data conversion, which can significantly impact chip area and energy efficiency. To address these challenges, this work proposes a computational CIM architecture utilizing multilevel analog memory, named AM-CIM, tailored for near-sensor (NS) computation of real-time KWS applications. Additionally, approximate memory technology is integrated into the AM-CIM architecture, employing data resilience scheduling for analog memory which contributes to significant reductions in hardware overhead. This integration facilitates a hardware-software co-design approach. To deploy KWS tasks in AM-CIM, a gated recurrent unit (GRU) network, referred to as MAC-GRU, is implemented. By employing Mel-energy as the input feature at the near-sensor end, the system achieves a 93.13% reduction in feature extraction power consumption. Evaluation results based on TSMC 180-nm technology demonstrate that the AM-CIM architecture achieves an accuracy of 88.51% for 10-keyword classification with a power consumption of  $546~\mu W$ , while reducing analog memory area by 43.32%.</description></item><item><title>MGARoute: Efficient Analog Routing With Multi-Stage Rip-Up and Rerouting Under Geometric and Symmetry Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11051139</link><description>Routing is a critical path-planning challenge in integrated circuit (IC) design, especially in analog IC design, where the complexity of the routing problem increases significantly owing to complex constraints and process parameters.

However, in real circuits, multiple inputs can switch simultaneously, resulting in a significant speed-up. This discrepancy can lead to circuit failures due to inaccurate early analysis, despite static timing analysis (STA) tools adopting conservative strategies. Consequently, multi-input switching (MIS) models have gained importance for timing libraries. For complex logic gates, however, the number of possible transitions that must be considered for characterization increases significantly, posing a substantial challenge in modeling MIS effects. We propose a novel approach to address this challenge by combining the power of satisfiability (SAT) solvers and machine learning (ML) techniques. First, we perform a logical analysis on the Boolean function of a given logic gate to identify input patterns that can lead to MIS-induced speed-up. This task is formulated as a SAT problem, and a SAT solver is utilized to extract all MIS-relevant transitions, thereby significantly reducing the characterization and modeling effort. Next, we leverage ML techniques to accurately capture the complex dependencies of MIS-induced speed-up under various circuit and environmental conditions. To streamline this process, we introduce an automated tool framework named LiMo (Library Model), which integrates a SAT solver, SPICE simulator, dataset optimization strategies, ML training/testing infrastructure, and multiprocessing capabilities to create MIS-aware timing libraries. The results on benchmark circuits reveal that ignoring MIS effects can result in relative root mean square errors (RRMSE) exceeding 40% in timing attributes. In contrast, LiMo-generated libraries achieve RRMSE errors below 7% compared to SPICE simulations, while delivering results  $\sim 10,000 \times $  faster, underscoring their suitability for incorporating MIS effects in STA for industrial designs.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Hybrid Dynamic Event-Triggered Bipartite Consensus Control for Multi-Agent Systems Against DoS Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11048444</link><description>This paper addresses the secure bipartite consensus control problem for multi-agent systems under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. A class of aperiodic time-sequence-based DoS attacks is considered, and its impact on both undirected and directed network topologies is analyzed. The stability analysis is conducted using a Lyapunov function approach combined with an iterative method. To reduce energy consumption and prevent Zeno behavior, a hybrid dynamic event-triggered mechanism is introduced. This mechanism incorporates an improved dynamic event-triggering condition, which determines when each agent updates its control signal and transmits its currently triggered state to neighboring agents. The proposed approach integrates this mechanism with the developed distributed control protocol and to ensure bipartite consensus even in the presence of DoS attacks. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through two simulation examples.</description></item><item><title>Autoencoder-Based Transceivers for Multiple Access Human Body Communication Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11054282</link><description>The Internet of Bodies (IoB) represents a transformative technological innovation that merges the bio-physical and digital realms through networks of intelligent devices positioned in, on, and around the human body. Human Body Communication (HBC) offers a promising method for enabling IoB networks, using the human body as a communication channel for multiple wearable nodes. Despite the prevalence of HBC peer-to-peer communication methods in the literature, the challenge of implementing multiple access techniques for HBC at the physical layer remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a new multiple access HBC (MA-HBC) system that leverages autoencoders to design and implement low-power and efficient transceivers sharing a common channel. The proposed MA-HBC system consists of multiple autoencoder-based transceivers trained jointly to optimize overall network performance. It supports various data rates ranging from 164 kbps to 5.25 Mbps, making it suitable for a wide range of IoB applications. To validate the design, a prototype implementation is presented. Additionally, to ensure suitability for wearable devices, a low-power hardware transceiver architecture is provided with an estimated energy efficiency of 105 pJ/b when implemented using TSMC 65nm LP technology. The results show that the proposed MA-HBC system outperforms traditional IEEE 802.15.6 based transceivers for two users with time Sharing, achieving a 3.9 dB improvement in Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at a block error rate of  $10^{-2}$ .</description></item><item><title>Continuous Flow 4096-Point FFT/IFFT Hardware Architecture for 5G Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11073142</link><description>This paper presents a high-throughput, low-latency 4096-point FFT/IFFT hardware design tailored for 5G applications.

The desired features of a theoretical framework for DPs are heavily inspired on classical phasor theory: the ability to transform time differential equations into equivalent algebraic complex equations, while maintaining the familiar notions of phasors, magnitudes and phases, and describing instantaneous power by two components, active and reactive power. Current frameworks rely on integral transforms which need approximations and truncations to allow for practical computation and application and do not offer a theory of nonstationary power. Further, the integral transforms are difficult to operate with and are not suitable to transform any generic nonstationary signal due to convergence requirements and frequency resolution challenges. This paper presents a new theoretical framework for DPs, based on differential operators, that offers a natural and efficient framework to transform nonstationary sinusoidal signals into Dynamic Phasors, while also offering a solid theory on nonstationary power extending the conventional well defined active and reactive power definitions.</description></item><item><title>Online Distributed Convex Optimization for Unbalanced Varying Graphs With Delayed Feedback</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11081829</link><description>Feedback signal delays present a common challenge in the online decision-making processes of various real-world systems, such as real-time economic dispatch in power systems. These delays, primarily induced by limited computational capabilities or unknown parameter changes, can significantly hinder the performance or even effectiveness of online decision-making strategies. This study investigates distributed optimization over time-varying unbalanced networks with delayed feedback signals. We propose discrete-time distributed online algorithms for both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems. Each node in the network has access only to its individual time-varying local objective function with a delayed time sequence. At each decision-making step, each node selects the appropriate local online behavior, which depends on the information from its neighbor nodes, towards the minimization of global cumulative cost function value. We demonstrate that sublinear regrets can be ensured as long as the time-varying unbalanced communication networks maintain  $\mathcal {B}$ -strong connectivity. For a general convex or  $\mu $ -strongly convex local objective function, the network regret and individual regret grow as  $\mathcal {O}((\ln (T))^{2})$  and  $\mathcal {O}(\sqrt {T})$ , respectively, and are intrinsically related to the feedback delays and step sizes. To validate the proposed algorithms, numerical studies are carried out on constrained distributed time-varying economic dispatch problems.</description></item><item><title>Constant Voltage Regulation of Delayed Inductive Power Transfer Systems: A Data-Driven Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11048450</link><description>This paper delves into the constant voltage output regulation problem for delayed inductive power transfer (IPT) systems with linear matrix inequality region constraints.

Ever increasing interface speed has resulted in multi-phase clock distributions (e.g., half-rate, quarter-rate architecture) becoming a reality over single / complementary phase clock distribution for performance reasons. Conventional techniques of clock distribution often involve distributing multi-phase clocks in pairs of complementary clock phases with proper shields around these phases to avoid coupling with other non-complementary clock phases of multi-phase clock distribution. However, these schemes suffer heavily when speeds/datarates and routing length of clock distribution increase. A mutually coupled multi-phase clock distribution scheme is proposed that overcomes signal integrity issues observed in the conventional multi-phase clock distribution scheme. Two schemes, correct by design (CD) and correct by layout (CL) are proposed to boost performance over conventional methods. Mutual coupling is effectively used between N-phase clocks and matched clocks are distributed with minimal/zero power overhead. Implemented in 7nm FinFET technology, the proposed schemes improve clock swings by ~4.75%-8%, random jitter (RJ) by ~4%-10%, rise/fall times by 10%-23% and achieve perfect matching between N phases of the clock.</description></item><item><title>A 31.25 MHz Bandwidth 52.4 dB SNDR VCO-Based ADC With on-Chip Non-Linearity Correction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11054050</link><description>This brief presents a method for correcting nonlinearities in voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) based analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).

However, achieving this promise has remained elusive due to the lack of suitable training algorithms. Analog memory devices exhibit asymmetric and nonlinear switching behavior in addition to device-to-device variation, meaning that most, if not all, of the current off-the-shelf training algorithms cannot achieve good training outcomes. Recently introduced algorithms have attracted limited attention, as they require bi-directionally switching devices of unrealistically high symmetry and precision and are highly sensitive. A new algorithm, chopped TTv2 (c-TTv2), has been introduced, which leverages the chopped technique to address many of these challenges. In this brief, we evaluate the accuracy and the performance of the c-TTv2 algorithm for analog TL using ResNet and Swin-ViT models, pre-trained on the CIFAR10 dataset, on a fine-tuning task using two subsets of the CIFAR100 dataset. We also investigate the robustness of our algorithm to changes in some device and circuit non-idealities, including weight transfer noise, write noise, symmetry point skew, symmetry point variability, pulse update noise, mean pulse response, device-to-device variability, the number of states, output noise, I/O resolution, and the minimum and maximum conductance device-to-device variability. We demonstrate that the c-TTv2 algorithm mostly surpasses the performance of analog/digital training and narrows the performance gap between analog and digital TL while being robust to changes in device and circuit non-idealities.</description></item><item><title>Smart Watchdog for RISC-V: A Novel Spiking Neural Network Approach to Fault Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11051055</link><description>Watchdog mechanisms must detect permanent and transient faults with minimal power and area overheads, but their own reliability is vital, as failures can jeopardize system integrity.

We validated ESTU on available Spiking Transformer models at the State of the Art and on a sEMG classification application addressing NinaPro DB-5, demonstrating improved accuracy of over 2% compared to the results of a vanilla SNN, fully unlocking spiking transformers capability at the edge at the cost of 3.76 mW during inference.</description></item><item><title>Accurate Prediction of Nonlinear Distortion of Multi-Carrier Signals</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11223667</link><description>Nonlinearities in power amplifiers adversely affect multi-carrier modulation techniques. Accurate prediction of nonlinear distortion is essential for making design trade-offs between output power and network throughput. We use the series form of the characteristic function (ch.f.) method to predict distortion spectra for sparse multi-carrier transmissions. This method results in efficient calculations of individual signal and distortion components. The method is validated both theoretically and practically. Theoretical validation is performed by modeling the signal as a bandpass Gaussian process that is hard limited, and it is shown that the series ch.f. method produces results that are identical with the classical Price&#8217;s theorem. Practical validation is shown by considering an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal with a fragmented spectrum which is then applied to an amplifier driven into compression for which application of Price&#8217;s theorem is difficult, and the predicted output spectrum corroborates laboratory measurements. Part of the computational efficiency is realized in that the nonlinearity can be expressed as the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of samples of its forward scattering parameter (i.e., S21) or transconductance function (including AM-PM effects), and distortion contributions of the signal can be expressed as numerical autoconvolutions of the clean spectrum. Signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) can be easily computed and parameterized across variables of interest, such as overdrive level.</description></item><item><title>A 12-MHz GaN-Based DC&#8211;DC Buck Converter Featuring Dual Reverse Conduction Controllers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11215820</link><description>This brief presents a 12-MHz 30V-to-12V GaN-based DC-DC buck converter incorporating a high-efficiency gate driver IC with dual (high-side and low-side) reverse conduction controllers (RCCs). The proposed dual RCCs dynamically minimize dead time and reverse conduction losses in the half-bridge GaN power stage. An active bootstrap circuit is also integrated to suppress bootstrap capacitor overcharging during reverse conduction. In addition, the gate driver IC includes a feedback control block and integrates nearly all essential building blocks (such as a PWM generator, a bias generator, and protection circuits) eliminating the need for external controllers. Fabricated in a 180-nm 30-V BCD process, the proposed gate driver IC occupies an active area of only 0.91 mm2. Measurement results show that the proposed buck converter achieves reverse conduction times of only 3.04 ns (V ${}_{\mathbf {SW}}$  rising edge) and 3.5 ns (V ${}_{\mathbf {SW}}$  falling edge), resulting in a 6.1% improvement in conversion efficiency, achieving a peak power efficiency of 85.75%.</description></item><item><title>LLC Resonant Converter With Reconfigurable Secondary-Side for Output Voltage Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11216413</link><description>This brief proposes a reconfigurable LLC resonant converter that enables the regulation of a tailored portion of the output voltage through a novel adaptive transformer turns ratio scheme implemented on the secondary rectifier. The converter employs a center-tapped transformer and a switch to reconfigure the secondary rectifier and adjust the effective turns ratio. Using the proposed concept, voltage regulation is achieved with a reduced number of switches and devices in the current&#8217;s path, no modification to the primary side, and fixed-frequency operation. A laboratory prototype rated at 4 kW with a 1 kV input voltage is implemented and tested to validate the feasibility and performance of the proposed converter.</description></item><item><title>Optimized Power Decoupling Control for Grid-Forming Converter Under Different R/X Ratios of Grid Impedance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11129106</link><description>In this brief, the power decoupling mechanism of grid-forming converter is analyzed, which indicates that the suitable voltage compensation is crucial for decoupling.
