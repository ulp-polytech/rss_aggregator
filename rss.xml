This article proposes a loosely coupled transformer with a customized T-shaped core and printed circuit board (PCB) coils, achieving high isolation and low capacitance within a limited footprint. Dual-output PCBs are oriented to reinforce the isolation between multiple coils, while orthogonal placement minimizes parasitic coupling. Bulk field grading is applied with an internal layer to reduce the electric field (E-field) stress, as well as alleviate the triple point. Finally, circuit decoupling is used to address the cross-coupling between multiple outputs, so that a quasi-constant voltage is available in each output channel against varying load while unregulated. The solution is tailored for a typical SiC half-bridge, which achieves a partial discharge inception voltage of 30 kV RMS with a minimal primary-to-secondary distance of 9.5 mm, a coupling capacitance of 2.65 pF, and an output power of 20 W per channel. The GDPS also supports self-regulated power delivery under slew rates of up to 180 kV/&#956;s, indicating its high common-mode transient immunity level.</description></item><item><title>An Empirical Model Informed Neural Network Core Loss Predictor for Soft Magnetic Materials</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947722</link><description>Advancements in materials, improved modeling, and optimized design of power magnetic components are imperative to push the efficiency and power density bounds of power electronic converters. The MagNet Challenge was launched in 2023 as the first IEEE Power Electronics Society International Challenge on Design Methods in Power Electronics, to leverage data-driven approaches for modeling losses in power magnetics with a goal to &#8220;Upgrade the Steinmetz Equation.&#8221; The nonlinear magnetic characteristics, material properties, tolerances introduced by material processing and manufacturing of ferrites, and circuit and component level nonidealities that impact core-loss measurements cannot be easily modeled using traditional methods. However, some of these effects can be captured using a neural network since they are good at deciphering the complex relationships between the input and output data. We presented an EMPirical model informed neural network (EMPINN) approach for core loss modeling of soft ferrites for the 2023 MagNet Challenge. In this work, we have radically improved our approach and reduced the size of our model by a factor of 20 to present an EMPINN core loss predictor. This article also delves deep into data preparation, choice of empirical models, custom training loss function, and how the neural network can find the localized fit Steinmetz parameters across a wide range of operating frequencies and peak flux-density ranges. The proposed model is compared with empirical and neural network-based approaches to showcase the benefits of combining these approaches. The proposed EMPINN core loss predictor outperforms state-of-the-art core loss models in terms of accuracy and size.</description></item><item><title>Monolithic Data-Driven Condition Monitoring Strategy for MMC Considering $C$ and ESR</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916965</link><description>Reliability of capacitors is a critical factor in ensuring the optimal performance of modular multilevel converters (MMC), which can be enhanced through health status monitoring and predictive maintenance. However, existing literature on MMC submodule capacitor condition monitoring primarily focuses on capacitance while overlooking the influences of the equivalent series resistance (ESR). Furthermore, the second problem is that the ESR is assumed to be negligible in the capacitance estimation. The assumption is not always valid, and may introduce significant errors in capacitance estimation. To improve existing condition monitoring methods, this article uses a capacitor&#8211;voltage equation to model the coupling effect of capacitance and ESR, based on which, particle swarm optimization is used to update the estimations of capacitance and ESR together. The proposed method offers more reliable health monitoring with two health indicators and derives a better estimation accuracy when the ESR is not negligible. Furthermore, to ensure the existence of the global optimal solution, the convexity of the data-driven problem is studied. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method are validated with simulations, experiments, and an open-source dataset.</description></item><item><title>A Series Arc Fault Detection Method Based on Time-Frequency Markov Permutation Transition Field for Photovoltaic Systems With Power Electronic Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10945512</link><description>Series arc faults (SAFs) are a primary cause of fire incidents in photovoltaic systems. Accurately and rapidly detecting SAF under the interference of power electronic devices remains a significant challenge. This article proposes an SAF detection method based on the time-frequency Markov permutation transition field (TFMPTF). First, variational mode decomposition is used to decompose the current signal into modes containing different frequency components to prevent interference between the information of different frequency bands. Then, the modes are transformed into two-dimensional matrices using TFMPTF. Innovatively, the concept of time-frequency permutation patterns state transition analysis in TFMPTF is proposed, from which the distinct structural information of the current signal can be effectively depicted. Afterward, singular value decomposition is employed to extract fault features from matrices. Finally, fault features are processed using a kernel extreme learning machine to obtain detection results. Offline experimental results show that the average detection accuracy of the proposed method is 98.97%, and the advancedness and adaptability of the proposed method are verified by comparing it with different methods. The proposed method and comparison methods are implemented in a microprogrammed control unit (MCU) for online experiments, further confirming that the detection speed and detection accuracy of the proposed method are reliable.</description></item><item><title>Model-Free Quantitative Diagnosis of Internal Short Circuit for Sodium-Ion Batteries With Charging Capacity Difference Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10945515</link><description>Thermal runaway caused by the internal short circuit (ISC) poses a significant safety risk for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) in electric vehicles and energy storage applications. Early detection of ISC faults is considered a potential way to reduce the risk associated with fire or explosion and can be identified via minor power leakage. However, diagnosing these leaks in the initial stages of ISC is quite challenging without battery modeling or preliminary experiments. Here, a model-free method based on charging capacity difference (CCD) analysis is proposed for quantitatively diagnosing ISC fault. First, a wavelet denoising algorithm with improved thresholding is presented to extract the real signals from the noise-containing voltage and current data. Subsequently, the ISC resistance is estimated by calculating the CCD variation between the ISC cell and the normal cell. Furthermore, the amount of power leakage during the charging process of ISC batteries is considered to improve the accuracy of the ISC diagnosis. Finally, experiments with elaborate ISC batteries are conducted to validate the method, achieving a resistance estimation error below 5% across different ISC severities while maintaining robustness to capacity inconsistencies. Compared to existing model-free methods, the proposed method significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy and broadens its applicability.</description></item><item><title>Active PWM Synchronization With ON-OFF-State Information of Power Semiconductors in Mission Profile Emulation Test</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10955354</link><description>In a power-electronics-based mission profile emulation (MPE) system, the converter under test (CUT) and the emulating converter are typically powered by the same dc voltage source for high efficiency. This also inevitably creates a circulating path for common-mode current ripples, which will cause sampling distortions and control errors. The current ripples have not been adequately addressed in the existing literature on the MPE. Typically, the common-mode current ripples can be suppressed by common-mode chokes. However, the amplitude of the common-mode current ripples fluctuates with the difference between the carriers of the CUT and the emulating converter, burdening the common-mode choke. The carrier difference can be fixed by synchronizing the carriers of the CUT and the emulating converter. However, conventional synchronization methods require modifications to the CUT, which changes its characteristics and prevents the MPE system from being plug-and-play. In this article, an active pulsewidth modulation synchronization method with on-off-state information of devices in the CUT is proposed. The carrier of the CUT can be reconstructed without modifications to the CUT. Then, the carrier of the emulating converter can be synchronized with the reconstructed carrier to minimize common-mode current ripples. This, in turn, reduces the burden on common-mode chokes and the volume of common-mode chokes. Besides, the control structure of the emulator remains unchanged, and the emulator can achieve a plug-and-play feature. Experimental results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Experimental Investigation on Fatigue Failure Evolution of Press-Pack IGBT Devices Under MMC Operating Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10949737</link><description>Converter valves based on the modular multilevel converter (MMC) topology are the core of the voltage source converter-based high-voltage direct current transmission system, with press-pack insulated gate bipolar transistor (PP IGBT) modules being the key components. Studying the long-term aging failure mechanism of the PP IGBT under actual MMC operating conditions is of great significance for improving the safe and reliable operation of the transmission system. In this article, an electric&#8211;thermal&#8211;mechanical coupled multifield model of the PP IGBT device is built to analyze the influence of junction temperature and pressure on stress and strain distribution, identifying the weak points. Then, based on the alternating current (ac) power cycling tested rig, which equivalently reproduces the working conditions of the MMC submodule, the influence of different junction temperatures and pressures on long-term aging failure is studied, revealing the evolution of key characteristic parameters during the aging process. Two main failure modes are identified under ac power cycling tests. One mode is caused by overvoltage short-circuit failure due to the blocking voltage drop, and the other is induced by open-circuit failure due to uncontrolled gate current. Finally, the evolution of microscopic morphology and static characteristic parameters over the entire lifetime during the power cycling test are obtained, emphasizing the differences between ac and direct current (dc) power cycling tests. The results show that there are significant differences in overheating failures between ac and dc power cycling tests, highlighting the critical role of ac conditions in failure analysis and reliability assessment. The study of the long-term failure evolution mechanism of the PP IGBT device under actual MMC working conditions aims to guide operational management, control protection, and device optimization design for the reliability of MMC systems.</description></item><item><title>A Coupled Inductor-Based SSCB With Reduced Components for DC Microgrid Protection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10930680</link><description>DC microgrids have gained importance for their high efficiency, no need for synchronization, high power quality, and potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Ensuring reliable and fast protection against over current and short-circuit faults is considered to be a challenge even to date. Solid-state circuit breakers (SSCBs) offer a promising solution, providing rapid and arc-less fault clearing. However, SSCBs employing fully controlled devices lead to higher costs and conduction losses. This article discusses a cost effective circuit breaker, using a semi-controlled switch based on a coupled inductor. The proposed SSCB has reduced overall components, a discharged capacitor and also allows the option to trip manually for maintenance. A detailed analysis and design methodology for component selection is presented in the later sections. The SSCB is experimentally validated by developing a laboratory prototype for a voltage rating of 400 V and at a nominal current of 15 and 20 A with a short circuit fault current of 60 A.</description></item><item><title>Transient Stability Analysis and Coordinated Phase Control Method for Multiparallel PLL-Synchronized Inverters During Grid Fault</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10937337</link><description>To utilize renewable energies, such as solar energy, distributed power generation systems are widely used, where multiple string inverters are parallelly connected to the grid and often adopt the phase-locked loop (PLL) for grid synchronization. However, under severe voltage sags caused by grid faults, the PLL-synchronized inverter system is susceptible to transient instability, which manifests as loss of synchronization. Although such transient instability caused by interactions between the inverter and the grid has been well studied in state-of-the-art research, the instability due to interactions among different inverters is not fully considered. Thus, to investigate this issue, this article establishes the modeling of an n-parallel PLL-synchronized inverter system for transient stability analysis while considering the parameter difference. It is revealed that the inter-inverter interaction introduces the transient instability risk, even though every grid-connected inverter is separately designed to keep synchronization during the grid fault. Subsequently, this article proposes a coordinated phase control method to enhance the transient stability of the multiparallel inverter system during grid faults. Finally, utilizing the RT-LAB OP5707XG platform, a real-time simulation model of a 3-parallel PLL-synchronized inverter system is established and tested to verify the theoretical analysis and the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Self-Powered SICE Circuit for Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting With a Complete Charge Extraction Electronic Breaker</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10962553</link><description>In piezoelectric transducer (PZT) energy harvesting, the synchronized electric charge extraction (SECE) technique is recognized for its desirable load-independent performance, while a self-powered SECE system remains a significant area of research. The electronic breaker is favored for its simplicity and reliability for achieving self-powering. However, current electronic breakers used in SECE tend to have a switch conduction time longer than one-fourth of the oscillation period ($T_{\rm LC}$), which results in charge backflow and compromises its load-independence feature. In this article, a complete charge extraction electronic breaker (CEB) is introduced. The CEB controls the switch-off action of the transistor via an envelope detector, ensuring the complete extraction of the accumulated charge from the PZT. Building upon the proposed CEB, a self-powered synchronous inversion and charge extraction (SP-SICE) circuit is proposed. Simulations and experimental results validate the effectiveness of both the CEB and the SP-SICE circuit. The measurements show that the SP-SICE circuit achieves a peak power output of 333.9 &#956;W and a significantly enhanced load-independence range up to 1000 k&#937;, which surpasses other existing techniques. The circuit has a stable output power without the need of a complex maximum power point tracking module, which makes it unprecedented among all relevant papers.</description></item><item><title>Elliptical-Curve-Based Method for Precise Calculation of Maximum Rotor EMF in DFIG Under Grid Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916789</link><description>The doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) is prone to losing control due to high rotor EMF during severe grid faults. Therefore, calculating the maximum rotor EMF of DFIG under different grid faults is the theoretical basis for various low voltage-ride through (LVRT) strategies. In traditional calculation methods, the amplitudes of the positive sequence, negative sequence, and transient dc components of the EMF are summed simply, but each component may not reach its maximum value simultaneously, leading to errors. In this article, the electromagnetic processes of the DFIG are investigated for quantifying the rotor EMF magnitude during grid faults. Then the vector trajectory of the rotor EMF is plotted by using the elliptical curve, and the analytical expression of the rotor EMF is obtained. By finding its extremum point, the maximum value of the rotor EMF under faults is calculated. Through the proposed method, the voltage boundary on the rotor side of DFIG under faults is precisely determined, which can provide reference for DFIG transient analysis and enhanced excitation converter design. At last, the accuracy of the proposed calculation method is experimentally validated through a 1.5-kW DFIG, with errors less than 2% under all fault conditions.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Construction Method and Control Strategy of Modular Battery Energy Storage Systems Based on Improved Droop Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10925909</link><description>The battery balancing technology based on modular converters needs to solve the problem of how to make many modular converters in series and parallel work together stably. In this article, according to the characteristics of modular battery energy storage systems, the application form of droop control is improved, and a battery unit with converter (BUC) is designed by combining battery, modular converter, and droop control. The properties of parallel BUCs and series BUCs are analyzed and redesigned to make them suitable for series&#8211;parallel expansion and the output current sharing control of the batteries. On this basis, a construction method of energy storage systems based on BUCs is proposed. In addition, a two-layer composite control strategy based on improved droop control is proposed, including the lower control strategy and the upper control strategy. Both simulation and physical experiments show that the proposed scheme can realize the constant voltage or constant current control of the total output of the energy storage system, and it can make the output current of each battery shared according to a given ratio with high control accuracy, and it can tolerate the communication failure of up to 2.5 s.</description></item><item><title>A New Active Clamp Quasi-Resonant High Step-Up DC/DC Converter Based on Built-In Transformer With Low Voltage Stress</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10930700</link><description>This article presents a new wide voltage gain dc/dc converter with low input current ripple. This topology uses a built-in transformer (BIT) with a low current level and voltage multiplier cell to reach high voltage gains under appropriate duty cycles. In this circuit, an active clamp circuit absorbs the energy of the leakage inductor from the BIT and delivers it to the output, thus, the zero voltage switching conditions at turn-on time are achieved for both switches. Due to the unique structure, very low voltage stresses are applied across the semiconductor components of the proposed circuit. In this circuit, a quasi-resonant performance in the main mode of the converter is considered to alleviate the switching power loss. Moreover, all diodes operate without reverse-recovery issues. Therefore, high voltage gain, low input current ripple, soft-switching performance, and low magnetic current stress are merits of the proposed converter, which helps to obtain enough high efficiency for the proposed circuit. The operational principle and steady-state analysis of the proposed converter have been analyzed in detail. Finally, a 25 V/400 V output, 200 W prototype with an efficiency of 96.3% is implemented in the laboratory to verify the analytical results.</description></item><item><title>Fault Diagnosis and Fault-Tolerant Operation Strategy for Triple-Port Hydrogen Production System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10930845</link><description>The multiport converter offers significant advantages in sustainable energy-based hydrogen production, such as high energy density and wide application potential. As the core energy hub in these systems, the multiport hydrogen converter demands high reliability. However, its numerous switches and complex operation increase the risk of failure. Currently, there are no effective fault diagnosis or fault tolerance solutions for these systems. Current fault diagnosis methods for two-port and multiport converters rely on many sensors, have low accuracy, and cannot handle multiswitch faults. In addition, existing fault tolerance strategies fall short of maintaining stable power for the electrolyzer and do not allow capacity sharing among ports. This article proposes a fault diagnosis method for open-circuit faults in a triple-port hydrogen converter and a corresponding fault-tolerant operating strategy. By optimizing a random forest algorithm with a sparrow search algorithm, high-precision multiswitch fault diagnosis is achieved using only three current sensors. Fault-tolerant operation of the system is ensured through an auxiliary switch following a failure. In addition, power sharing between output ports can be realized. This ensures the efficient and stable operation of the hydrogen production system. The effectiveness of this solution has been validated through simulations and experiments.</description></item><item><title>Grid-Following Voltage Source Converter With a PLL-Less PI Passivity-Based Controller for Unbalanced Grid Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10937257</link><description>Actual voltage-source converters (VSCs) advocate flexible and fast controls, low-voltage ripple levels at the dc-link, and grid compliances for operating under imbalanced grid conditions. To counteract these needs, this investigation focuses on proposing a straightforward passivity-inspired controller structure that facilitates the reference signals' generation to appropriately and quickly regulate grid currents and dc voltage ripples under unbalanced conditions, complying with the harmonic standard (ANSI/IEEE Std 519) thanks to the mitigation of the $\text{2}\omega$ oscillation. Since the proposal works on the abc reference frame, this prevents the use of a phase-locked loop, abc/dq0/abc and abc/$\alpha \beta$/abc transformations, and it reduces the computational burden in the prototyping stage. The results in both real-time simulation and experimental testbed confirm the controller's effectiveness for working under imbalance grid conditions greater than 35% of voltage drops in one or two phases, operating with low 2$\omega$ oscillations, and providing reactive power control. Besides, the controller is featured for settling back the voltage reference in less than 40 ms, guaranteeing voltage ripple levels below 5%, and fulfilling the harmonic standard since it reaches a total harmonic distortion maximum of 2.9%. Also, the passivity-based controller is characterized for reducing the computational burden by 73% compared to the widely used conventional, ensuring a lower computational cost than other approaches that use dq control as a basis.</description></item><item><title>Direct Power Distribution Strategy Based on Space Vector Modulation for Single-Stage Dual-DC-Port Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10944603</link><description>The single-stage dual-dc-port inverter directly connects the photovoltaic-battery hybrid system to the ac side, which offers the advantages of high efficiency and low cost due to the removal of dc&#8211;dc converter. The existing modulation-based power distribution strategies realize flexible power flow control by indirectly regulating redundant zero or small vectors via additional outer loop power controllers, which have the drawbacks of limited steady-state and dynamic response. To address this issue, the relationship between the dc-port power and large/small vectors is analytically revealed, which provides intuitive parameter design guidelines for power distribution control. On this basis, a direct power distribution strategy based on space-vector modulation is proposed, which regulates the dc-port power by splitting the reference voltage vector into large and small vectors. Compared to the conventional strategies, the proposed strategy shows better steady-state and dynamic response due to desirable power control directly realized in the modulation layer. Finally, the comprehensive comparison experimental tests are conducted to verify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed direct power distribution strategy.</description></item><item><title>A Decentralized Secondary Voltage Control Method With Unbalance Voltage Compensation Capability for Parallel Inverters in Islanded Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10945741</link><description>To stabilize voltage and improve power quality at the point of common coupling (PCC), this article extends the previous work by proposing secondary voltage control with unbalanced voltage compensation capability in islanded microgrids, which is fully independent of communication links. By injecting an extra small-ac-signal (SACS) into the output of each inverter, a droop relation is built between the SACS frequency and the voltage compensation components. The SACS active power is then calculated and coupled with the measured feeder impedance to adjust the voltage compensation components generated by the estimated positive and negative sequence voltage at the PCC, which in turn affects the SACS active power distribution. Compared with the existing method, the proposed method fully utilizes only one single injected SACS to achieve both secondary voltage control and unbalanced voltage compensation simultaneously, which reduces the control complexity and total harmonic distortion at the PCC. Meanwhile, the proposed method remains effective for both inaccurate PCC voltage estimation and activation delays. Moreover, the control parameters are designed in detail based on a small-signal differential mode model with complex feeder impedance. Finally, the simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>The Constant Power Transmission Control for Suppressing DC-Link Voltage Ripple Effect of Single-Phase AC&#8211;DC&#8211;AC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10946193</link><description>The dual active bridge (DAB) converter achieves relatively high efficiency and high power density. Therefore, it is widely used in ac&#8211;dc&#8211;ac converters to provide electrical isolation between the input and output. However, the single-phase converter inherently exhibits significant low-frequency voltage ripple in the DAB topology. Traditional control strategies focus on reducing voltage ripple and optimizing the capacitor size by transferring fluctuating power through the DAB converter. This method leads to higher magnetic component and switch currents, as well as a larger transformer size. To suppress these effects, this article proposes a constant power transmission (CPT) control for the DAB converter. The proposed CPT control dynamically adjusts the modulation width of each operating cycle by tracking the input&#8211;output voltage fluctuations in real-time through the control variables. This ensures constant power transfer in the DAB converter. Compared to traditional methods, the proposed control strategy reduces both the RMS and peak-to-peak values of the inductor current, thereby reducing the size of the converter and improving system efficiency. Simulation and experimental results confirm that the CPT control effectively reduces the peak-to-peak and RMS values of the inductor current by 40.7% and 18.8%, respectively, reduces the transformer size by 21.4%, and increases the efficiency by 1.1%.</description></item><item><title>Bidirectional Hybrid Isolated DC Transformer for All-DC Collection and Transmission System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947719</link><description>Bidirectional dc transformer (DCT) is the key energy conversion equipment for all-dc collection and transmission system. Cost, efficiency, and dc fault blocking capability are important considerations that are currently difficult to address simultaneously for the existing modular multilevel converter (MMC) based DCT. In this article, a bidirectional hybrid isolated dc transformer (BHIT) as an alternative to the existing MMC based DCT is proposed. By replacing half of the submodules (SMs) by antiparalleled thyristors, the proposed BHIT can reduce 36.7% device cost, 32.5% device loss, and 64.8% total SM capacitance compared with the existing MMC based DCTs. By tailoring the trapezoidal waveforms of the thyristors, continuous dc currents are ensured without any filtering effort. In addition, an active fault current limiting control is further proposed to reduce the fault current during short-circuit faults. The detailed operational analysis, control schemes, simulation results, and scale-down prototype are provided to validate the effectiveness of proposed topology.</description></item><item><title>Design of a Megawatt-Scale IGCT-Based Medium-Voltage Direct Current Transformer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947739</link><description>This article presents a robust design of a megawatt-scale medium-voltage (MV) direct current transformer (DCT) that features a bidirectional LLC resonant converter topology. This topology harnesses the inherent ability to control power flow seamlessly between two MVdc buses without relying on closed-loop control, maximizing efficiency and stability. Integrated gate-commutated thyristors were chosen as the power devices due to their superb on-state properties, enhancing the performance of this resonant DCT. The power stages incorporate a three-level neutral point clamped topology, paired with a split-capacitor dc-link, enabling three-level modulation during soft-start and two-level modulation during normal operation. Taking advantage of the resonant operation, the record-high switching frequency in the range of 5 kHz is achieved. The custom-designed medium-frequency transformer uses oil-insulated copper pipes for the windings and nanocrystalline core while integrating the inductive elements of the resonant tank. Power-in-the-loop experiments are presented that demonstrate the system's efficiency approaching 99%.</description></item><item><title>Understanding a Type of Forced Oscillation in Grid-Forming and Grid-Following Inverter Connected Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947721</link><description>This article investigates a novel oscillation phenomenon in systems with grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) inverters. Unlike previous studies that primarily focus on small-signal stability, this work explores forced oscillations (FOs), where GFL inverters act as excitation sources, inducing oscillations in GFM inverters. Specifically, interharmonics generated by maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control trigger low-frequency oscillation modes in GFM inverters. To analyze this phenomenon, the article first examines the power characteristics of the interharmonics injected by MPPT and leverages this understanding to develop a P-&#969; admittance model for GFM and GFL inverter connected systems. This model enables precise prediction of FO amplitudes and provides insights into the influence of factors such as the number of GFM inverters on oscillation behavior. To validate findings, hardware-in-the-loop experiments are performed to verify the observed behavior in a system consisting of photovoltaic farms with GFL control and battery energy storage systems with GFM control. Finally, merits and limitations of this work are explicitly highlighted to provide a balanced perspective.</description></item><item><title>Enhanced Modulation Strategy and Magnetic Component Parameter Design for Dual Active Bridge Converters to Improve Efficiency Under Variable Load Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10950087</link><description>Dual active bridge converter serves as the hub for energy exchange, with efficiency being its paramount indicator. A comprehensive optimization solution for efficiency improvement is proposed in this article, which consists of two parts. The part one is an optimal modulation strategy that achieves full soft switching under light-load conditions, minimizes peak current under heavy-load conditions, and enables seamless transitions between different modes. The part two is the optimization of magnetic component parameters, specifically the turns ratio and inductance, based on this modulation strategy to further reduce the current stress and enhance overall efficiency. Distinct from the previous work, the proposed solution offers noteworthy advantages: 1) the modulation strategy attains zero-voltage switching (ZVS) instead of quasi-ZVS under light-load conditions and facilitates seamless mode transitions; 2) the turns ratio and inductance are tailored for variable load conditions, rendering them applicable to a more extensive array of scenarios; 3) the analytical design method for magnetic component parameters enhances both the portability and accuracy compared to traditional exhaustive search methods. The experimental results confirm the theoretical analysis and illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed solution.</description></item><item><title>Quad-Port Magnetic Integrated Coupled Inductor Based Magnetic Network Energy Routers With High Power Density</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10962294</link><description>The magnetic network energy router (MNER) is promising for applications integrating multiple renewable sources, storages, and loads with the advantages of low component requirement, high efficiency, and high controllability. Power density is essential for MNERs, which is mainly restricted due to the use of multiple magnetic components, including the high-frequency transformer (HF-TF) and branch inductor (BI). This article proposes a quad-port magnetic integrated coupled inductor (MICI) based MNER with high power density. In the proposed quad-port MICI-MNER, the HF-TF and four BIs are magnetically integrated with a customized magnetic core, and the MNER's ports are partially magnetically coupled with each other to achieve the required power transfer.

This design achieves high voltage gain and a wide voltage regulation range, allowing for a reduced turns ratio in the high-frequency transformer (HFT). Consequently, voltage stress on the secondary-side switches is minimized, and associated losses in both the switches and HFT are reduced. An advanced modulation strategy is developed to enable soft-switching for all switches while effectively suppressing voltage spikes, without the need for additional clamping circuits. The microinverter supports split-phase output while maintaining voltage-source-inverter characteristics, making it suitable for both grid-connected and islanded operations. An accompanying control strategy ensures robust performance across both modes. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed topology, with a 600-W/50-Hz prototype achieving a peak efficiency of 97.12%.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Control of DC Coupled Fast EV Charging Station</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964326</link><description>This article proposes a new hierarchal control scheme for dc-coupled fast electric vehicle (EV) charging stations.

The main objectives of NPC-DAB converters include high steady-state efficiency, dc-bias elimination, fast dynamic characteristics, constant-power-load stability, and midpoint voltage balance (MVB). NPC-DAB converters may also experience various complicated operating conditions, such as startup, sudden reference voltage, and load change. Originating from the concept of natural switching surfaces (NSS), this article proposes a multitrajectory NSS boundary control (MNBC) to address these issues for the first time. First, the NSS mathematical models under various operating states of NPC-DAB converters were derived, laying a theoretical foundation for the proposed MNBC. With the proposed MNBC, elliptical and circular NSS will be used to flexibly adjust the dynamic trajectory of NPC-DAB converters in the geometric domain.

However, the conventional LLC resonant converter regulates the wide output voltage through a wide frequency range, which leads to low efficiency with large circulating energy and the difficulty of the resonant tank optimization. This article proposes a novel LLC-T resonant converter, which parallels an auxiliary transformer with the LC resonant tank for the wide output applications. The proposed LLC-T resonant converter narrows the frequency range with less circulating energy, lower voltage stress on the resonant capacitor, and smaller flux linkage in the resonant inductor compared to the conventional LLC resonant converter. Meanwhile, the zero-voltage switching turn-on is maintained throughout the wide output voltage range and load range. Furthermore, a precise time-domain based analysis and the design methodology are proposed. A 500-kHz, 1.35 kW, 400 V input /250 V&#8211;450 V output prototype is built to verify the concepts of the proposed topology and demonstrates a 97.82% peak efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Recovery Characteristics of RB-IGCT and Its Low Reactive Power Application in Hybrid Commutated Converter Based HVDC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10924665</link><description>Due to the limitation of the recovery characteristics of thyristors, the minimum extinction angle of traditional line commutated converter based high voltage direct current (LCC-HVDC) system is generally 12&#176;, which requires the system to be equipped with expensive and large reactive power compensation equipment. Hybrid commutated converter (HCC) based on reverse blocking integrated gate commutated thyristor (RB-IGCT) with better recovery characteristics can operate at ultra-low extinction angle. This article first conducts an in-depth mechanism study on the recovery process of RB-IGCT under HCC conditions. Then, the differences in the recovery process of RB-IGCT under different conditions are analyzed through experimental design. On this basis, a 6-RB-IGCTs component and a &#177;10 kV/1 kA HCC system are designed. The ability of RB-IGCT to operate with low reactive power has been fully verified through component level experiments and system level experiments. Finally, the reactive power optimization capability of HCC operating at ultra-low extinction angle is analyzed through PSCAD/EMTDC simulation calculation. The application of RB-IGCT with better recovery characteristics in HCC is of great significance for optimizing reactive power configuration in HVDC systems.</description></item><item><title>A Control Strategy for Modular Multilevel Converters Based on Arm Current Control Under Grid-Side Open-Circuit Fault</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10938332</link><description>To further improve the power supply sustainability of the ac/dc hybrid distribution networks, this article proposes a control strategy for the modular multilevel converter (MMC) under grid-side open-circuit fault, which is based on independent arm current control. Firstly, the behaviors of the MMC after the faults are analyzed, including single-phase and two-phase open-circuit faults. For single-phase open-circuit fault, the proposed strategy can be achieved by reconfiguring the amplitude and phase of the arm currents, thereby eliminating the zero-sequence current. For two-phase open-circuit fault, both the arm currents and voltages need to be reconfigured. After that, a method for detecting and locating specific faults is provided, which can be implemented by detecting the amplitude of the zero-sequence current. Besides, the postfault characteristics of the MMC under single-phase open-circuit condition are given, including submodule (SM) capacitor voltage ripple, circulating current, arm rms current and arm peak current. According to it, long-term postfault operation of the MMC can be guaranteed with 50% of the rated power. Additionally, stable dc-bus voltage and balanced SM capacitor voltage are satisfied even though one phase is disconnected. Moreover, with the proposed control strategy, although the MMC is able to operate for a short period of time in emergency situations when two phases are disconnected, it is not supposed to transmit power due to the inevitable large current on neutral conductors. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is validated by simulation and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>The Impact of Signal Delay and Power Surge on the Performance of Parity-Time Symmetric Wireless Power Transfer System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964069</link><description>Parity-time symmetry wireless power transfer (PTS-WPT) technology enables constant output that is independent of load and mutual inductance, simply by controlling the zero-crossing points of the transmitting voltage and current. This approach is straightforward to implement and holds significant application potential. This article provides a detailed analysis of the power characteristics of the PTS system under strong coupling conditions and identifies a phenomenon unique to low-frequency tracking, referred to as the double-PTS (DPTS) state. The critical conditions for this phenomenon are calculated, and it is demonstrated that it leads to power fluctuations exceeding 50%. Additionally, the study examines the impact of signal detection delay&#8212;an unavoidable interference factor in practical scenarios&#8212;on the degradation of output power. Experimental results from the prototype show that the DPTS state can be effectively eliminated through parameter decomposition or optimization of the coupling mechanism. Furthermore, signal delay induces a 22% power fluctuation in low-frequency PTS systems and reduces the output power of high-frequency PTS systems by approximately 40% below the rated value. These experimental results are in good agreement with theoretical analyses.</description></item><item><title>Improving Voltage Support in Islanded AC Microgrids During Unbalanced Short-Circuit Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10774184</link><description>In the event of a short-circuit fault in an islanded ac microgrid, grid-forming power inverters activate a resistive virtual impedance to protect themselves against over-current, whereas grid-feeding power inverters are tasked with providing voltage support. In this scenario, the sequence impedances that are responsible for voltage support exhibit significant variability depending on the values of both the virtual and short-circuit impedances. State-of-the-art control schemes do not take this variation into account, resulting in voltage support that could be enhanced. This article presents a control scheme designed for grid-feeding inverters that improve voltage support during unbalanced short-circuit faults. The scheme is based on an online measurement of the sequence impedances and the selection of the most appropriate current injection technique for voltage support using the measured impedance values. A theoretical analysis is also included, which was performed to verify the stability of the microgrid with the proposed control. Finally, experimental results from a laboratory microgrid are presented for validation purposes.</description></item><item><title>A New Design Concept for Permanent Magnet Vernier Machine: Positive-Mutual-Coupling for Improved Power Factor and Higher Field-Weakening Capability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10769525</link><description>This article investigates a permanent magnet vernier machine (PMVM) equipped with positive-mutual- coupling (PMC) winding. The conventional winding layout typically presents negative-mutual-coupling (NMC) among the three-phase windings due to the 120&#176; spatial phase shift. It is illustrated that in the conventional NMC winding, the negative phase-mutual inductance leads to increasing q-axis inductance and amplifying armature reaction. On the contrary, the investigated PMC winding exhibits positive phase-mutual inductance, cancellation effect on the q-axis flux linkage, and brings the characteristic current closer to the current limit. This contributes to suppressing armature reaction, improving the power factor, reducing the terminal voltage, and enhancing the field-weakening performance. The generic design methodology to obtain PMC winding is presented and exemplified on a 24-slot, 5-armature pole pair, and 19-rotor pole pair PMVM. Finite element analysis shows that the proposed PMC PMVM could improve the rated power factor and widen the constant torque region. With reduced terminal voltage and more voltage margins, the PMC PMVM can employ a higher q-axis current to generate torque, thus significantly enhancing the output torque and power factor during field-weakening operations. As a result, the output power capability and constant power speed range (CPSR) are improved dramatically. Finally, a PMC PMVM prototype is manufactured to validate the efficacy of PMC winding in improving field-weakening and power factor.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Modeling of Switching Surges in PMSM Drives Due to Eddy-Current Reaction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10774189</link><description>In this article, the phenomena of switching surges due to eddy-current reaction are investigated and analyzed for permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drives. With vector magnetic circuit (VMC) theory, a new three-phase PMSM model is proposed, where the differential terms of stator voltages are included for considering the transient eddy-current reaction. In this way, the cause of switching surges in PMSM drives is revealed to be the switching actions of power devices in power converters. Furthermore, the switching surges have been evaluated quantitatively by modeling the eddy-current reaction by a transient magnetic coefficient in the magnetic circuit, and the impact factors have been analyzed. The model predictive control (MPC) scheme is employed as an application case for evaluating the proposed PMSM model considering switching surges. Experimental results have been given to verify that the proposed modeling method can present improved current prediction accuracy and control performance at various conditions than the existing methods even when the disturbance observer is employed.</description></item><item><title>Two-Part Controller Design for Switched-Capacitor Based Buck&#8211;Boost Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10759530</link><description>Many of the buck&#8211;boost topologies have lower duty ratio range per unit voltage gain (DMR). In this article, controller design aspects, multi-mode operation of a switched-capacitor bridge based buck&#8211;boost converter (SCBDBBC) exhibiting better DMR is investigated. Presence of switched-capacitor bridge enhances the duty ratio range for bucking operation while the existence of two switches offers degree of freedom to realize multi-mode operations. These are: 1) buck&#8211;boost; 2) standalone boost; and 3) standalone buck operation. By exercising the degree of freedom associated with two switches, under the buck&#8211;boost operation three different multi-mode operations are feasible which are: 1) equal duty ratios with synchronized gate signals (DS1 = DS2); 2) unequal duty ratios with synchronized gate signals (case-1: DS1 &gt; DS2); and 3) unequal duty ratios with synchronized gate signals (case-2: DS1 &lt; DS2). Mathematical analysis is established for both the cases (case-1 and case-2). From voltage gain point of view both of these schemes result in identical gain, but the DS1 &lt; DS2 operation results in low source current ripple compared to equal duty ratio operation. Hence, detailed investigations are given for SCBDBBC under case-2 control. Since there are two controlling inputs (DS1, DS2) and one controlled output (vo), two controllers are designed using two-input single-output (TISO) control theory. To demonstrate the SCBDBBC operation and TISO based two-part controller design, a 48 to 24 V (in bucking)/ 60 V (in boosting) with power rating 24 &#8764; 60 W is chosen for experiments. The SCBDBBC multi-mode operation in standalone buck and boost operations are demonstrated in addition to buck&#8211;boost conversion. The analytical findings are in close agreement with experimental observations.</description></item><item><title>Regional Coupling Enhanced Self-Decoupling Omnidirectional Wireless Power Transfer Transmitter With Optimal Efficiency Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10759098</link><description>Omnidirectional wireless power transfer (OWPT) systems are widely used in consumer electronics products (CEPs), industrial robots, unmanned detection equipment, etc. However, nondirectional electromagnetic energy transfer reduces system transmission efficiency and increases magnetic field leakage in the free working space. Besides, existing control strategies find it difficult to simultaneously ensure system simplicity and efficiency, thereby increasing system development and operating costs. In this article, a novel transmitter structure with high efficiency and low-leakage flux has first proposed, consisting of three square coils placed in an orthogonal position. Moreover, a self-decoupling reconfiguration method can further stimulate the potential of the transmitter, and the space electromagnetic field can be homogenized by the proposed optimal efficiency strategy. An OWPT platform with 100 V/100 kHz is built to prove the effectiveness of our designed transmitter structure. The experiment results show that the system efficiency remains 75.06%&#8211;77.17% within a 90&#176; rotation range, with the fluctuation rate reduced to a maximum of 7.81%. The efficiency in the planar range is increased to 86.8%, with a fluctuation rate of only 4.1%.</description></item><item><title>Fully Soft-Switched High Step-Up Quasi Z-Source Converter With Controllable Duty Cycle Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10758281</link><description>This article proposes a new high step-up converter based on the quasi Z-source (qZs) structure. By applying high step-up techniques and active clamp cell to the basic converter, high voltage gain, very low switch voltage stress, and fully soft switching operation are realized. The&#160;proposed converter benefits from controllable duty cycle range achieved by coupled inductors to facilitate the qZs converters limitation. Therefore, by expanding the duty cycle range, more efficient operating points are provided for a particular application and solves the regulation difficulty at high voltage gains. Besides, the switches are turned on at ZVZCS, and capacitive turn-on losses are eliminated while all diodes turn-off without the reverse recovery loss. Due to the mentioned features, this converter can achieve high efficiency. Moreover, the presented converter has continuous input current with low ripple and common ground between the input and output which expands its applicability. The&#160;converter operation is fully investigated and to validate the theoretical analysis, a 200W prototype is implemented in the laboratory.</description></item><item><title>Fractional-Order Virtual Impedance-Based Low-Frequency Current Ripple Mitigation for a Differential Boost Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10774165</link><description>Differential boost inverter (DBI), which consists of two identical dc&#8211;dc boost converters, has been widely used in dc&#8211;ac conversion systems for low-voltage dc supplies such as fuel cells and batteries. However, a serious concern is the presence of significant low-frequency current ripple (LFCR) in the source current, which leads to system instability, reduced system efficiency, and a shortened lifetime of the new energy source. The DBI can be operated in dual mode, offering both differential mode (DM) and common mode (CM) functionality. Hence, the DBI is decoupled as a dc&#8211;dc converter and an inverter. The ac output voltage is well regulated under DM. Under CM, a control strategy based on fractional-order virtual impedance (FOVI) is proposed to reduce LFCR in this article. Where a fractional-order bandpass filter (FOBPF) is used for better dynamic performance, and a fractional-order notch filter (FONF) is introduced to further reduce LFCR and improve the system stability. Further, damping resistors are inserted to solve the resonance issue of DBI. The detailed design process of key parameters is given, and the performance of fractional-order filters is also deeply discussed. Finally, a 250 W prototype is constructed and tested to validate the effectiveness of the proposed FOVI-based control method.</description></item><item><title>Capacitively Isolated Dual Active Bridge Converter for On-Board Charger Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10769084</link><description>A bidirectional isolated dc&#8211;dc converter is normally employed in on-board charger (OBC) circuits to extend the output voltage range of the power factor correction (PFC) converter because the latter alone cannot meet the electric vehicle (EV) battery charging voltage range. The isolated dc&#8211;dc converter also prevents faults propagating from one side of the circuit to the other side and prevents the flow of leakage currents during charging, which is important for safety considerations. Because the capacitor has a higher energy density than magnetic elements, this article utilized a capacitively isolated dual-active bridge (CDAB) converter to provide isolation in the OBC. Specifically, two low equivalent series resistance (ESR) film capacitors are used to replace the transformer in the traditional dual active bridge (DAB) converter. A comprehensive analysis of the operating modes of the converter, based on single phase shift control, is presented together with a discussion of converter design parameters. A 1 kW laboratory prototype is constructed to experimentally verify the proposed topology. Compared with the conventional DAB and CLLC converters, the proposed CDAB converter has a higher power density and improved efficiency, confirming the superiority of the proposed topology.</description></item><item><title>Multiphase Interleaved Boost Converter With Frequency Modulation for Sensorless Current Sharing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10769531</link><description>In industries, conventional multiphase interleaved boost converters are used to divide current stresses in semiconductors and increase the processed power. However, owing to the high sensibility of current division under variations in parasitic resistances and differences in duty cycles between phases, techniques are required to guarantee the division of input currents. This article proposes a multiphase interleaved boost converter with soft switching based on the switching cell with pulse-frequency modulation (SC-PFM) to solve this problem. This proposal presents a self-balance of the currents between the phases without a current control loop and soft switching. Moreover, the output diodes do not suffer from reverse recovery. The converter operates with only one output voltage control loop and one voltage sensor. The currents are naturally balanced owing to the input characteristics of the converter with low impact from differences between parasitic parameters of the modules. The experimental results of a 2-kW prototype with two modules of the interleaved boost converter (IBC)-SC-PFM validate the effectiveness of this solution with an efficiency of approximately 98%.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Single-Phase to Three-Phase Power Conversion Systems for Medium and Low Voltage Single-Phase AC Systems in Remote Areas</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10774173</link><description>Single-phase medium or low voltage distribution networks remain the predominant choice in remote or rural areas, largely due to historical and economic considerations. As economic development progresses, the demand for high-quality three-phase power systems in these regions has increased steadily. To address the challenge of providing three-phase power in remote areas, this article introduces a single-phase to three-phase power flow controller (1PH&#8211;3PH PFC) for medium and low voltage distribution networks. The proposed system includes a reverse YNd11 transformer and three half-bridge converters, which have been specifically designed to mitigate grid voltage disturbances, including sags, swells, and harmonics, that may impact loads. Furthermore, the system ensures unit power factor operation while eliminating harmonic currents from the loads. The control strategy incorporates output voltage feedforward and weighted average feedback of the filter inductor current, thereby enhancing system responsiveness. Furthermore, the power flow of apparent and active power under various voltage fluctuation scenarios is analyzed. The proposed scheme is validated through simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments. The research results indicate that, in comparison to the UPQC-1Ph&#8211;3Ph scheme, the 1PH&#8211;3PH PFC solution significantly reduces the converter design capacity, with potential savings of up to 60% of capacity under conditions of a 25% voltage sag.</description></item><item><title>Circuit Modeling of Mechanical Motion Rectifiers in Wave Energy Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10759274</link><description>This work presents a novel circuit analogy for modeling and controlling mechanical motion rectifier (MMR)-based power take-off (PTO) systems in wave energy applications. Each component of the MMR is individually modeled, with particular emphasis on their velocity and torque constraints to derive their electrical analogies. The overall MMR circuit is synthesized using basic kinematic constraints, and a comprehensive friction model is integrated to address the limitations of existing approaches. The proposed circuit model facilitates the derivation of explicit expressions characterizing the MMR's nonlinear dynamics. A specific identification procedure is employed to determine the circuit parameters of an MMR prototype, which is subsequently validated through experimental testing. The developed electrical analogy offers a generalized modeling approach for MMR-based devices, allowing seamless adaptability to various MMR wave energy converters (WECs) and rectification mechanisms. This, along with the integrated friction model, explicit expressions for nonlinearities, and proven experimental accuracy, establishes a robust framework for developing comprehensive wave-to-wire models of different MMR-based WECs. Additionally, the inherited electrical simulation environment is particularly well suited for designing control techniques on the generation side aimed at maximizing wave energy absorption.</description></item><item><title>An Improved Flyback Resonant DC&#8211;DC Converter and Its Multiobjective Parameter Optimization Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10774169</link><description>Flyback converter is widely utilized for low-power dc&#8211;dc conversion with the simple circuit structure. However, it suffers severe switching loss caused by hard switching operation with the enhanced switching frequency. This article proposes a 10 MHz resonant dc&#8211;dc converter by ameliorating the traditional flyback converter. The converter employs a resonant inductor and two resonant capacitors, which achieves soft switching of both the switch and the diode. Furthermore, the circuit performance gets further improved by reversing the connection of the transformer dotted terminals. To solve the problem that the parameter design becomes thorny due to the introduction of multiple resonant components, a multiobjective parameter optimization design method is proposed, which combines back prorogation neural network (BPNN) and genetic algorithm (GA). It simplifies the design process and improves the design accuracy. Finally, two 10 MHz prototypes with 12 V input and 5 V/10 W output were built to verify the theoretical analysis.</description></item><item><title>Single/Three-Phase Compatible Sigma-Type OBC With Reduced Electrolytic Capacitor Volume</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10767742</link><description>This article proposes a sigma-type dc&#8211;dc converter with a reduced energy volume of the electrolytic capacitor (E-cap) for single- and three-phase compatible on-board charger (OBC). The proposed relay box configuration uses a minimal number of relays. In single-phase grid, the E-cap is connected to the dc-link via the input-parallel output-series (IPOS) structure to absorb second harmonic current. In a three-phase grid, a film capacitor connects to the dc-link instead of E-cap, maintaining the low voltage rating of the E-cap by the input-independent output-series (IIOS) structure. Additionally, the power of the regulated converter is reduced, allowing most of the power to flow through the unregulated converter, achieving high efficiency. The proposed sigma converter achieves soft-switching under a wide voltage range and reduces the power burden of the regulated converter through a reconfigurable leg. Experimental results from an 11 kW prototype validate the proposed circuit. The converter achieved a peak efficiency of 98.12% and maintained high efficiency under a wide voltage range.</description></item><item><title>Lifespan Maximization of Modular Battery Energy Storage Systems With State-of-Charge Imbalance Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10766894</link><description>Modular battery energy storage systems (MBESSs) are a promising technology to mitigate the intermittency of renewables. In practice, the batteries in an MBESS have disparities in their remaining useful life (RUL). Hence, the least healthy battery dictates the MBESS lifespan, which has motivated the development of RUL balancing methods. However, existing methods have not considered maximum lifespan extension, nor the SoC imbalance generated by RUL balancing, which can reduce the MBESS useable capacity. Hence, this article first develops a general optimality criterion for RUL balancing, that holds for any battery whose degradation rate is a strictly convex function of power. Accordingly, an optimal RUL balancing method is proposed to maximize the MBESS lifespan, while limiting the SoC imbalance and adhering to operational constraints through a model predictive control framework. Simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Robust Power Hardware-in-the-Loop Interface Under Uncertain Software and Hardware System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10769494</link><description>The power hardware-in-the-loop (PHIL) framework provides an attractive platform for evaluating new frameworks and power hardware including transformers, converters and machines. It allows for conducting diverse tests on a laboratory scale, providing results that closely resemble real-world scenarios, all while avoiding the high costs and risks associated with experimentation on a full-scale power system. However, despite its advantages of the PHIL framework, considerable challenges remain where often the performance is not robust and the fidelity to the real-world needs to be quantified and improved. This article addresses these challenges by synthesizing an interface between the hardware and software components of PHIL while employing a modern control perspective for managing inherent uncertainties. The article provides a methodology that quantifies model uncertainty caused by the point-of-connection in the emulated power network of the software system and the model uncertainty stemming from the varying nature of the hardware-under-test. To overcome these uncertainties, the article proposes a robust PHIL interface controller based on $\boldsymbol{\mu}$-synthesis. This controller ensures multiple objectives are met that includes robust stability, performance, accuracy, and tracking capabilities. To assess the effectiveness and viability of the proposed PHIL interface, a PHIL experiment is conducted. The experiment involves interfacing an emulated software system based on a 225-bus, 110 V, 60 Hz, 1 MW residential subnetwork of the University of Minnesota and suburb Minneapolis. The interface is established using a real-time simulator and a physical hardware system consisting of two 1-$\boldsymbol{\phi}$ 1.67 kVA inverter systems and one linear and nonlinear load, each with a capacity of 1.8 kVA.</description></item><item><title>Motion Control of Electro-Hydrostatic Actuators With Modeling and Compensation of Nonlinear Bulk Modulus</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10774188</link><description>Electro-hydrostatic actuators (EHAs) have been widely utilized in the aerospace and modern manufacturing industries owing to their small installation space, high energy efficiency, and extreme force generation capability. Recently, the model-based compensation controller has been designed to enhance the control quality of hydraulic systems. Meanwhile, some modified models focusing on friction, nonlinear flow, and flow leakage have been developed to further improve the control performance. However, the nonlinear characteristic of fluid bulk modulus reflecting oil elasticity has not been considered which still limited transient control accuracy. The existing studies on modeling of bulk modulus result in models too complicated to be used in control design. So a control-oriented model needs to reflect the real nonlinear behavior of the bulk modulus while feasible for control design. In this study, a control-oriented model for the effective bulk modulus is synthesized, which is not only able to reflect the nonlinear behavior of the real-world bulk modulus but also feasible for model compensation control design. By introducing such a model into the system dynamics, a model-based motion controller is developed for EHAs. The performance of the closed-loop system is evaluated in theory and also in comparative experiments where the proposed method further improves the trajectory tracking performance, especially during transient processes.</description></item><item><title>Coupling-Energy-Based Antiswing PD Control for a General n-Link Pendulum&#8211;Cart System: Theory and Experimental Validation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10774181</link><description>In this article, we study the antiswing control of an $\boldsymbol{n}$-link pendulum&#8211;cart system with viscous friction at each joint of the pendulum.

We introduce a new concept of the horizontal translational kinetic energy of the center of mass (COM) of the system as a basis to construct a new coupling energy and a new coupling displacement signal for enhancing the coupling between the actuated cart and the unactuated $\boldsymbol{n}$-link pendulum. Based on the coupling energy and the signal, we present an energy-based antiswing controller for the system and theoretically demonstrate the asymptotic stability of the downward equilibrium point (DEP), where the $\boldsymbol{n}$-link pendulum extends straight downward and the cart remains in a desired position. The energy-based controller features a simple structure with clear physical meanings. Moreover, we provide a method to determine the coupling gain and two control gains. Through hardware experiments implemented on a two-link pendulum&#8211;cart platform, we validate the effectiveness and robustness of our presented controller.</description></item><item><title>A Reconfigurable Auxiliary Circuit for Transient Enhancement in Processor Power Systems With Multiple Voltage Rails</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10769468</link><description>This article proposes a practical auxiliary circuit for multiple voltage rails to improve dynamic response under significant load steps with an ultrafast slew rate.

This article focuses on phase circulating current (PCC) suppression in PIMIs. First, a PCC prediction model is proposed, considering a one-control-cycle delay when applying the asymmetric regular sampling (ARS) rule. By employing this model, appropriate redundant vectors are selected to achieve an approximately 50% reduction in PCC. Then, another PCC prediction model is developed, incorporating a two-control-cycles delay. Utilizing this model, an ARS-based variable switching frequency pulsewidth modulation (VSFPWM) is proposed to precisely control the peak value of PCC, and a method for determining the boundary of the switching frequency is suggested. The proposed VSFPWM explores the capability of the pulsewidth modulation (PWM) algorithm to effectively control PCC under low-switching frequency and low-carrier ratio conditions by using two degrees of freedom: vector selection and switching frequency. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated by experiment with a 36-MVA inverter.</description></item><item><title>Robust Voltage Regulation in Dynamic Wireless EV Charging Systems via Dual-Frequency Oscillation Suppression</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10774175</link><description>This article designs an enhanced voltage regulator for dynamic wireless charging system (DWCS) in electric vehicles (EVs) with dual-frequency oscillation suppression.

However, DWCS faces complex disturbances such as sensor measurement noise and varying coil mutual inductance with EV movement. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a feedforward Kalman filter-based fixed-time antidisturbance control (FADC) scheme for DWCS, aiming to implement robust voltage regulation with improved dynamic response and oscillation suppression. Specifically, we integrate a Kalman filter into the controller's feedforward loop to predict low-frequency state information. Subsequently, a fixed-time extended state observer is devised to recover variations in the mutual inductance and other external disturbances. Then, a fixed-time antidisturbance control law is designed utilizing state prediction and disturbance estimation to produce the targeted control signal for the DWCS. Furthermore, we employ the Lyapunov stability criterion to demonstrate that the track errors remain bounded within a fixed-time frame. A notable advantage of our scheme is its capability to simultaneously address low-frequency voltage oscillations resulting from variations in the mutual inductance of DWCS, and high-frequency voltage oscillations resulting from measurement noise of sensors. Finally, experiment results validate that the proposed scheme effectively achieves dual-frequency voltage oscillation suppression for DWCS while enhancing dynamic response performance.</description></item><item><title>Day-Ahead Solar Power Forecasting Using LightGBM and Self-Attention Based Encoder-Decoder Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10736564</link><description>The burgeoning trend of integrating renewable energy harvesters into the grid introduces critical issues for its reliability and stability. These issues arise from the stochastic and intermittent nature of renewable energy sources. Data-driven forecasting tools are indispensable in mitigating these challenges with their rugged performance. However, tools relying solely on data-driven methods often underperform when an adequate amount of recorded data is unattainable. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a novel day-ahead hybrid forecasting framework for photovoltaic applications. This framework integrates a physics-based model with Machine Learning (ML) techniques, enhancing prediction reliability in environments with scarce data. Additionally, an innovative ML pipeline is introduced for data-abundant environments. The proposed ML tool comprises two branches: a set of regressors, each tailored for specific weather conditions, and a self-attention-based encoder-decoder network. By fusing the outputs from these branches through a meta-learner, the tool achieves predictions of higher quality, as evidenced by its superior performance over benchmark models in an investigated test dataset.</description></item><item><title>Brain-Inspired Collaborative Automatic Generation Control With Large-Scale Electric Vehicles Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10738205</link><description>Distributed energy sources, loads and storage equipment have intermittent and highly random characteristics, which can cause significant frequency fluctuations when they are integrated into a distributed power grid. The current multi-agent cooperative neural networks based algorithms in the distributed power grid would suffer from catastrophic forgetting issues, which might be difficult in achieving optimal control under strong random disturbances. Hence, this paper proposes a proximal brain-inspired policy optimization (PBPO) algorithm with an orthogonal weight modification method in the weight update of the policy networks. Thus the policy network can have the brain-inspired contextual awareness capability. It can obtain faster convergence to the optimal solution of the multi-area cooperative control, mitigating heavy frequency fluctuations caused by serious random disturbances in the grid. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated via the simulation experiments on the two load frequency control models of the energy integration of large-scale electric vehicles in the grid. The proposed PBPO algorithm outperforms various reinforcement learning algorithms with faster convergence, higher frequency stability and better control performance.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Factor-Coupled, Ahead-of-Time Aggregation of Power Flexibility Under Forecast Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10738509</link><description>The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) is significantly reshaping the role of distribution systems under active energy management. To aggregate the active-reactive power flexibility of DERs dispersed at the feeder and provide capacity support to the transmission system, it is essential to efficiently identify feasible substation power injection trajectories. This paper introduces a novel ahead-of-time flexibility characterization method to address it. First, a polyhedral non-feeder-level power flexibility region (PFR) is constructed, accounting for various time-dependent, power-coupled, and forecast error uncertainties. Then, a polyhedral feeder-level PFR is analytically derived through a coordinate transformation, which can reveal the uncertainty propagation path, i.e., how uncertainty applies to the feeder-level PFR. To facilitate the high-level application, a tractable chance-constrained Chebyshev centering optimization model is further developed to find a ball-shaped inner approximation of the feeder-level PFR. Finally, the proposed method is validated on a modified IEEE 123-bus test system. Both theoretical and experimental results show that, with appropriate robustness parameter settings, the proposed method can make the approximated PFR less conservative with abundant robustness against forecast error uncertainty.</description></item><item><title>Research on Water Hammer Effect and Cooperative Frequency Regulation Technology of PV-HBESS Compensated Hydroturbine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10740062</link><description>The water hammer effect in a hydroturbine and improper setting of the PID parameters of a governor can cause a hydropower unit to provide negative damping to the corresponding hydro power generation system, affecting its frequency. Therefore, a collaborative control method using photovoltaic (PV) and hybrid battery energy storage system (HBESS) is proposed to compensate the water hammer effect. First, models for hydropower, PV, and HBESS are established. Second, a coordinated control strategy for HBESS and the PV system is presented, where the PV system employs a variable load reduction frequency regulation strategy based on power output and frequency deviation changes. The HBESS follows the state of charge, frequency change rate, and frequency deviation changes, with the supercapacitors utilizing virtual inertia control and lead-carbon batteries employing droop control to rapidly respond to the water hammer effect. Last, a control strategy based on model predictive control (MPC) optimized with a whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is proposed to manage the hydropower unit parameters and the coordinated hybrid battery energy storage system to mitigate the water hammer effect. The MPC-WOA can rapidly identify the optimal PID parameters for the hydropower unit. The proposed strategy effectively suppresses fluctuations in turbine mechanical power and system frequency. Real-time simulation on the RTLAB platform validates that the proposed control method improves system frequency adjustment time by 45.40% compared to systems without compensation and reduces power feedback fluctuations by 87.22%, significantly enhancing frequency stability against the water hammer effect.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Wind Power Prediction Based on Wind2vec-BERT Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745561</link><description>In the era of new energy development, the requirements for all aspects of short-term wind power forecasting tasks are increasing day by day. However, the power condition of wind farms is naturally stochastic and variable as it is affected by multiple factors. Current neural network approaches focus only on the propagation of unidirectional attention and ignore the interaction of input variables. To further improve the accuracy of wind power prediction, this paper explores the application of the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) algorithm in wind power prediction. At the same time, GARCH series models are used for analysis and optimization after the prediction results are obtained to address the challenges posed by the inherent variability of wind. Meanwhile, Wind2vec, a new variable embedding method for wind power forecasting tasks, is proposed which can more efficiently fit the relationship between time series forecasting variables. The parameters are subsequently fine-tuned for the backbone layer of the BERT using the Adaptive Computation Time (ACT) method to make it more adaptive to the inputs of the power sequences of the power system. By BERT's bidirectional attention mechanism and transformer architecture, and refining it for the input layer, we aim to enhance the accuracy of wind power forecasts by capturing nuanced temporal dependencies within historical wind data. Using China Southern Power Grid real datasets demonstrates the effectiveness and correctness of the BERT-GARCH-M-based model in outperforming traditional forecasting methods. This research not only shows the adaptability of BERT to wind power prediction but also contributes to advancing the precision and reliability of renewable energy forecasts, paving the way for more sustainable energy utilization in the evolving landscape of new energy paradigms.</description></item><item><title>Cooperative Control for DFIG-Based Wind Turbine Generation System Covering All Operating Regions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745778</link><description>This paper addresses the multiple control problems over the whole wind speed range for the wind turbine generation system (WTGS), including the safety constraints on the rotational speed and the mechanical power, and the maximum power point tracking, by proposing a novel estimator-based cooperative control scheme for doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) and wind turbine. Firstly, we develop a global estimator to obtain precisely the unmeasurable shift-area turbine speed, which is effective for all wind speed zones and is employed to support the decision-making of the actual operating region and the desired reference signals. Secondly, based on this, a nonlinear adaptive DFIG controller and a pitch angle controller are designed to track the reference point, which ensures the completeness of the control tasks of the corresponding identified operating region. Thirdly, we apply the universal barrier Lyapunov function to the control synthesis of DFIG to impose the physical security constraints with any adjustable safety margin on WTGS. The superiority of the proposed framework is evaluated comparatively on the detailed WTGS model using multiple Monte Carlo simulations with three kinds of stochastic wind speed processes.</description></item><item><title>Pitch Control Scheme Considering Entire Dynamics and Full-Load Region in PMSG-Based Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10747229</link><description>Large-scale wind turbines (WTs) are built with light-strength materials, which would otherwise cost more than the economic benefits of power generation. Hence, these turbines with huge rotors and slender towers are more exposed to external forces such as gust winds and the wake effect during their operational lifetime. This paper strives to establish a bridge between the design principles of the pitch control system (PCS) and the inherent dynamics of the drivetrain, blades, and tower in a grid-tied 5MW PMSG-based WT. Based on this purpose, the dynamic representation of the PCS is described in more detail, then the pitch controller is designed based on the complete dynamic model of the WT using a gain-scheduled PI controller to be capable of providing desirable dynamical performance throughout the pitch actuation region. The parameters of the proposed controller are calculated according to the current operating point of the WT with the aim of ensuring the acceptable stability margin and reducing the WT loading as much as possible. The controller design process is accomplished by analyzing the linearized dynamic model of the PCS under various scenarios using responses resulting from the frequency domain, polar coordinate, and modal analysis. Finally, nonlinear simulations illustrate that the intended pitch controller has a superior response over the traditional PI controllers.</description></item><item><title>A Robust Photovoltaic Power Forecasting Method Based on Multimodal Learning Using Satellite Images and Time Series</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10747271</link><description>Ultra-short-term photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting holds significant importance in enhancing grid stability. Most PV power forecasting methods based on satellite images rely on pixel-level predictions, which are inefficient and redundant. Meanwhile, current deep-learning approaches struggle to establish correlations between large-scale cloud features and PV generation patterns. In this paper, an end-to-end model based on multimodal learning is proposed for directly obtaining multi-step PV power forecasts from satellite images and time series. To capture cloud dynamics and features within the region of interest (RoI), ConvLSTM-RICNN is utilized to encode satellite images. To mitigate the impact of noise and missing data in PV power, a robust fusion approach named DCCA-LF is introduced. This approach integrates deep canonical correlation analysis (DCCA) into late fusion (LF) to strengthen cross-modal feature alignment. The proposed model is verified using publicly available data from BP Solar in Alice Springs and Himawari-8, from January 1, 2020, to October 8, 2022. Comparison with current state-of-the-art research shows that the suggested model achieves the best RMSE and MAE with minimal complexity across all cloud conditions. Moreover, the proposed approach is robust to noise and missing data.</description></item><item><title>System Strength Constrained Grid-Forming Energy Storage Planning in Renewable Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10747388</link><description>With more inverter-based renewable energy resources replacing synchronous generators, the system strength of modern power networks significantly decreases, which may induce small-signal stability (SS) issues. It is commonly acknowledged that grid-forming (GFM) converter-based energy storage systems (ESSs) enjoy the merits of flexibility and effectiveness in enhancing system strength, but how to simultaneously consider the economic efficiency and system-strength support capability in the planning stage remains unexplored. To bridge the research gap, this paper develops a system strength constrained optimal planning approach of GFM ESSs to achieve a desired level of SS margin. To this end, the influence of GFM ESS power capacities and locations on the system strength is firstly quantified based on the framework of generalized short-circuit ratio. On this basis, system strength constrained optimal placement and sizing of GFM ESSs is formulated into optimization problems with eigenvalue constraints. Two practical scenarios with and without a limit on the number of selected sites are considered. Finally, quadratic support function based iterative optimization approaches are developed to address the planning problems. Case studies in the modified IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus systems validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches under different scenarios by comparing with two other benchmarks.</description></item><item><title>Machine Learning-Accelerated Method for Real-Time Optimization of Micro Energy-Water-Hydrogen Nexus</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752353</link><description>This paper explores the micro Energy-Water- Hydrogen (m-EWH) nexus, an engineering system designed to reduce carbon emissions in the power sector. The m-EWH nexus leverages renewable energy sources (RES) to produce hydrogen via electrolysis, which is then combined with carbon captured from fossil fuel power plants to mitigate emissions. To address the uncertainty challenges posed by RES, this paper proposes a real-time decision-making framework for the m-EWH nexus, which requires the rapid solution of large-scale mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) problems. To this end, we develop a machine learning-accelerated solution method for real-time optimization (MARO), comprising three key modules: (1) an active constraint and integer variable prediction module that rapidly solves MICP problems using historical optimization data; (2) an optimal strategy selection module based on feasibility ranking to ensure solution feasibility; and (3) a feature space extension and refinement module to improve solution accuracy by generating new features and refining existing ones. The effectiveness of the MARO method is validated through two case studies of the m-EWH nexus, demonstrating its capability to swiftly and accurately solve MICP problems for this complex system.</description></item><item><title>Virtuality-Reality Combination Control for Wind Farm Maximum Power Generation With Wake Model Dynamic Calibration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752354</link><description>Due to the time delay characteristic of wake effect, the future state information of downstream wind turbines (WTs) is required for wind farm (WF) dynamic optimization but cannot be directly measured. To address the issue, this study proposes a novel virtuality-reality combination control scheme for WF dynamic maximum power generation control (DMPGC). The wind speed in VWF is calculated by wake model without time delay, thus the future state information corresponding to the current freestream wind speed of RWF can be obtained in advance. To ensure consistency of state information between RWF and VWF, meanwhile to enhance the precision of WF optimization model, a wake model dynamic calibration method is proposed to improve the prediction accuracy of wake wind speed. Thereafter, an active wake control strategy based on calibrated wake model is implemented to maximize the total power generation of VWF, and the optimal control commands are delay dispatched to RWF according to the wake delay time. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves calculation accuracy of wake model, increases total power generation and owns better fatigue load distribution of WF under different wind conditions.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Affine Arithmetic-Based Optimal Dispatch Method for Active Distribution Networks With Uncertainties of Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752418</link><description>Affine Arithmetic (AA) is an effective interval analysis method for addressing uncertainties in power systems. However, previous research on AA-based optimization problems has struggled to accurately capture the uncertainties associated with electric vehicles (EVs) and the cumulative impact of uncertainties on energy storage systems (ESSs). Moreover, the reformulated AA model presents a significant computational challenge due to the high number of variables and constraints. This study proposes an efficient AA-based economic dispatch (AAED) method for active distribution networks incorporating EVs and ESSs while accounting for uncertainties. Specifically, an EV charging load-interval (CLI) model is developed to effectively capture the randomness of plug-in/plug-out times and initial/target energy. A confidence level is defined to prevent excessive conservatism in the CLI model. An ESS model is also formulated within the AA domain to address the cumulative impact of persistent uncertainty, ensuring an accurate state of charge monitoring. To enhance the computational efficiency of the AAED model without sacrificing accuracy, a fast-solving strategy is introduced. This strategy involves eliminating many state variables and constraints and replacing them with derived analytical partial deviation formulations that map the relationship between state and decision variables. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model and method.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Fault Ride-Through Capability of DFIG-Based WECS Using Dynamic Reconfiguration Hybrid Interlinking Transformer Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752838</link><description>The abnormal grid voltages, such as sags, swells, and harmonics caused by grid faults, seriously threaten the safe operation of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind energy conversion system (WECS). To enhance the fault ride-through (FRT) capability of DFIG and improve the converter capacity utilization, this paper proposes a novel DFIG-based WECS using a dynamic reconfiguration hybrid interlinking transformer (DR-HIT) technique for performance improvement under grid faults. Multiple operating modes and flexible switching strategies were developed based on the analysis of the proposed topology and principles. The proposed DR-HIT approach smooths the DFIG &#8217;s output power fluctuations through the cooperative control of the multifunctional converter (MFC) and grid-side converter (GSC) in shunt mode when the grid voltage is stable. Upon the occurrence of a grid voltage fault, the DR-HIT flexibly switches from shunt mode to series mode, maintaining the terminal voltage at a constant value. Additionally, once grid voltage recovers, the DR-HIT reverts flexibly to its shunt mode. Finally, simulations and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve accurate control of the system and flexible switching between different modes.</description></item><item><title>Cooperative Strategies for Frequency Control of Wind Turbines to Mitigate Secondary Frequency Dip: Coefficient Allocation and Exit Techniques</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752840</link><description>With the increasing integration of wind power into the power system, the incorporation of wind turbines into the grid's primary frequency regulation through inertia and droop control has been proven effective. However, a phenomenon known as secondary frequency dip (SFD) occurs when wind generators exit frequency regulation to restore the turbines&#8217; speeds. This paper introduces a cooperative approach to mitigate SFD. Initially, a system frequency response model is established, incorporating the combined effects of synchronous generators and wind turbines. Subsequently, a model to forecast the rotational speed of each wind turbine in response to load changes is developed. Based on these models, the droop and inertia coefficients of different turbines in a wind farm are optimized to minimize overall wind energy loss during frequency regulation, thereby alleviating SFD, while ensuring the rotational speed remains within a safe range. Additionally, a smooth transition strategy based on a low-pass filter is proposed to prevent an abrupt decrease in active power as turbines exit frequency regulation. Finally, to prevent a simultaneous drop in active power among a large number of wind turbines, a sequential exit strategy from frequency regulation is proposed. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in mitigating SFD.</description></item><item><title>Frequency and Voltage Disturbances Ride-Through Control Strategy for PV Power Plants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10755119</link><description>Large-scale photovoltaic power plants (PVPP) are being rapidly integrated to power systems worldwide. However, large penetration of PVPP will affect the frequency and voltage stabilities, especially for a weak power grid during individual and simultaneous disturbances. This paper introduces an adaptive control strategy for PVPP to accurately comply with grid code requirements and achieve fast frequency support (FFS) and enhanced low voltage ride-through (LVRT) performance during simultaneous disturbances events (SDE). The proposed control strategy relies on the support priority scheme for the grid frequency and voltage based on real-time measurements. An adaptive active power ramp rate (AAPRR) function imposed on the active power control loop of the PVPP is used to realize the simultaneous frequency and voltage support. Moreover, the voltage support is enhanced using a voltage regulation scheme that supports the voltage recovery post-fault without exceeding the PVPP inverter power headroom. The proposed control strategy demonstrates superior performance in enhancing the transient voltage and frequency responses when the power grid is subjected to consecutive and simultaneous disturbance events. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified using the OPAL-RT real-time simulator test bench.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Approach to Determine and Maintain Area-Wise Minimum Inertia in Renewable Energy Dominated Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10758198</link><description>The rapid displacement of synchronous generators by increased penetration of inverter-based resources (IBR) in power system areas that are potentially rich in renewable energy can lead to spatial non-uniform distribution of synchronous inertia. Consequently, even if the overall minimum inertia (MI) of the system is maintained, certain areas may experience stability issues, which would breach grid-code limits for the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) following a contingency. Given this context, a method to determine the MI that is specific to individual areas is introduced. Additionally, a method for redistributing surplus inertia from high-inertia areas to low inertia areas is introduced by reducing electrical distance between the nodes. This approach utilizes green corridors, which are additional transmission lines that are established to evacuate surplus renewable power to the areas with higher demand and fossil-fueled-based generation, as pathways to transfer inertia. Furthermore, a machine-learning-assisted technique to compensate for shortfall in area-wise MI by placing new synchronous inertia compensators is proposed. Using this method, system operators can identify the location and size of synchronous or virtual inertia that may be required. The amount of additionally required inertia is quantified by the size of synchronous inertia compensators, to uphold area-specific RoCoF in renewable energy-integrated power systems. The proposed methodology is tested and validated in the modified IEEE-39 bus system.</description></item><item><title>Dual-Stage MPC-Based AGC for Wind Farm Considering Aerodynamic Interactions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10757357</link><description>The wind farms are encouraged to provide Automatic Generation Control (AGC) services for the power grid. However, the complex aerodynamic interactions between turbines complicate the control of wind farms for AGC service. To address this issue, this paper proposes an explicit wind speed prediction model of each wind turbine based on the control actions of thrust coefficient (mainly realized by adjusting pitch angle) and yaw angle. Its accuracy is validated by numerical experiment based on Navier-Stokes equations. Since the adjustments of the thrust coefficients and yaw angles involve significantly different time scales, a dual-stage model predictive control (MPC) is proposed to coordinate them. It uses the proposed explicit wind speed prediction model as a surrogate for the wind speed of each turbine. In the first stage, it optimizes yaw angle reference based on whether or not the available wind farm power is sufficient at the predicted moments. In the second stage, it controls both thrust coefficient and yaw angle of each turbine, in order to track the AGC power signal and align the yaw angles with those determined in the first stage. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the dual-stage MPC for AGC power tracking of wind farm.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Control Strategy for Enhancing System Stability in Weak Grids by Mitigating Additional Disturbance Components from PLL</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10758341</link><description>Wind and photovoltaic power plants connected to weak grids can bring stability problems. The grid-connected inverter is an important connection port between the renewable energy and the grid. Some studies have indicated that the phase-locked loop (PLL) controller of the inverter can play a significant role in causing stability issues in weak grids. In this paper, a small-signal model of a phase-locked loop with complex variables is established. Then, the influence of phase-locked loop on system stability is analyzed. It is found that the presence of the PLL introduces additional disturbance components into the inverter control loop, resulting in a decrease in system stability. To mitigate the influence, a control strategy is proposed that involves injecting opposite disturbance components into the control loop to counteract the additional disturbance components. The proposed control strategy effectively improves the system stability. In addition, when compared to existing methods for enhancing stability, such as reducing the bandwidth of the PLL, the proposed method demonstrates a good dynamic response. The simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Contribution of PV Generation With Embedded Battery Storage to Capacity Adequacy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10766632</link><description>This paper proposes a real-time redispatch method for including PV-plus-battery plants in resource adequacy assessment (RAA) studies. The method offers the possibility to represent the market operation of the assets, while at the same time considering their response to reliability events, unlike existing methods in the literature that manage such assets in a single-dimensional manner, driven solely by adequacy contribution considerations or entirely ignoring this capability. In the proposed method, while the plant is initially dispatched in a market-oriented manner, i.e., with the objective of maximizing market revenues, its actual operation is adapted to meet system needs when reliability events take place. The method is incorporated into a Monte Carlo (MC) based RAA model in a computationally efficient manner, relying on a deterministic implementation of redispatching that does not impact significantly the computational burden of the RAA model, thus enabling the execution of multiple MC samples to achieve a high stochastic process accuracy. A merit order algorithm is also embedded into the RAA model to evaluate the PV-plus-battery market revenues. The model developed allows a refined calculation of the capacity value (CV) of such assets for different plant configurations and inverter loading ratios, while the upper and lower CV bounds are approximated via application of the adequacy- and market-oriented approaches available in the literature. Results show that the embedded storage energy capacity is crucial for the CV afforded by the assets, while any decrease in the inverter capacity does not significantly impact the CV value. Further, the CV of storage embedded in tightly coupled PV-plus-battery plants, where batteries are exclusively charged by the plant's own PV generation, is generally lower than the value of similar stand-alone storages operating without any charging constraints.</description></item><item><title>Adversarial Constraint Learning for Robust Dispatch of Distributed Energy Resources in Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10766908</link><description>The variability of renewables and power demands poses significant challenges for the dispatch of distributed energy resources (DERs) in distribution networks, as they often introduce uncertainties that may lead to power flow constraint violations. Robust optimization (RO) is a powerful tool for managing the operational risks caused by these uncertainties. However, solving robust DER dispatch problems is nontrivial since the non-convex AC power flow constraints prevent the use of strong duality to find deterministic counterparts. To this end, this paper proposes adversarial constraint learning that can provide linear surrogates for robust dispatch problems. This method begins by designing a gradient-based adversarial attack process to identify the worst-case constraint violations. A &#8220;teacher&#8221; model is trained in advance to enable rapid gradient calculations during this attack process. Under the teacher's supervision, two &#8220;student&#8221; models are then trained to predict the worst-case violation from candidate dispatch decisions and nominal operating conditions (i.e., renewable generation and power demands). These student models are further reformulated into equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) forms and serve as computationally efficient surrogates for the original robust dispatch problems. Simulations across various operating conditions and test systems demonstrate that our method can achieve desirable feasibility, low suboptimality, and high online computational efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Online Stream-Driven Energy Management in Microgrids Using Recurrent Neural Networks and SustainaBoost Augmentation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10768873</link><description>In recent years, the operation of microgrids (MG) has faced increasing challenges due to the growing penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) and the integration of electric vehicles (EVs), which introduce significant uncertainties in power supply and demand dynamics.

Existing advanced control strategies have altered the architecture of industry-standard controller, hindering their application in industrial projects. This study aims to propose a novel &#8216;Plan-Control&#8217; Hierarchical Controller (PCHC) for OWTs, with the inner &#8216;Control&#8217; loop utilizing an industry-standard controller and the outer &#8216;Plan&#8217; loop integrating a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC)-based planner. For the inner loop, the controller provides reference signals of generator torque and blade pitch to actuators of OWTs, with controller parameters, optimal constant in torque control and proportional-integral (PI) gains in pitch control, being transferred from the planner. For the outer loop, an NMPC-based planner determines controller parameters by solving multi-objective optimization formulations with variable prediction horizons. Interestingly, NMPC-based planner does not operate as often as controller in PCHC, but compensates for the residual error, arising from the mismatch of state-space model in the multi-step prediction process, by Gaussian Process regression. A cost function is jointly formulated to suppress mechanical power and rotor speed fluctuations, reduce structural loads, and restrict actuators' actions, with weighting factors tuned online and robustly. Finally, the multi-objective performance enhancement of the PCHC in power and speed stability, and structural load mitigations is demonstrated utilizing aero-hydro-servo-elasto-soil simulations with actual wind-wave environmental conditions. The PCHC maintains the architecture of the industrial-standard controller, thus smoothing the way for its implementation in industrial projects of OWTs.</description></item><item><title>Internal Energy Distribution Control Based Fault Ride-Through and Postfault Recovery Strategy for Offshore Wind Farms Connected to DR-MMC HVDC Under Onshore AC Grid Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10772121</link><description>Offshore wind farms (OWF) connected to diode rectifier (DR) and modular multilevel converter (MMC)-based HVDC confront challenges of surplus power induced by onshore AC faults. This paper proposes an internal energy distribution control (IEDC) strategy, which utilizes the rotor kinetic energy (KE) of wind turbines (WT) and the capacitor energy of MMC submodules to achieve fault ride-through (FRT) and postfault recovery (PFR). Firstly, the mechanism of OWF is analyzed, and an onshore AC fault detection method based on local measurements is proposed. Then, a two-stage FRT control strategy is proposed. Three preset power reduction and energy absorption curves are designed to utilize the internal energy to actively absorb excess power, and flexibly distribute surplus power to KE and MMC energy. An additional pitch angle control (APAC) is devised, which can reduce captured wind power and eliminate surplus power when the internal energy reaches its maximum value. Thirdly, a two-stage PFR control strategy is proposed. The preset power and energy recovery curves are designed to achieve fast active power recovery and release of stored excess internal energy after fault clearance. Case studies are performed on 2-terminal and 4-terminal test systems to validate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Area-Multi-Stage Based Self-Healing Distribution Network Planning and Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10787104</link><description>Extreme events such as earthquakes, floods, or wars could cause severe grid faults and large-scale outages in the distribution network. The active islanding technology can be used for self-healing of multiple outage areas with distributed resources, smart distribution facilities, and advanced controlling methods. The facilities related to the self-healing consist of relays, switches, distributed resources, and power electronics based soft open points (SOPs). However, the self-healing effect depends on not only the location, capability, and function of these facilities, but also the recovery process should be comprehensively considered and coordinated since the multi-stage recovery strategies are deeply coupled. These recovery stages usually consist of the relaying process, grid partition with smart switches (SSWs), resupply by distributed resources, and interconnection with SOPs. For the first time, this paper proposes a multi-area-multi-stage (MAMS) self-healing recovery area (RA) planning-operation collaborative approach considering the recovery sequence. First, the multiple self-healing stages of flexible RAs are defined and introduced. Second, the time-variant topological and operational constraints are proposed to represent the coupling relationships at different stages. Finally, the hybrid controllable load deployment strategy is used to compensate for the limited resource capacity in RA restoration. The effectiveness of the proposed collaborative model is verified by illustrative case studies.</description></item><item><title>Tube-Based Linear Parameter-Varying Model Predictive Control for Wind Energy Conversion Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10787116</link><description>Maximum power extraction and transfer from wind energy conversion systems (WECS) to the power grid depends on a high-performance control system. This paper proposes a robust tube-based linear parameter-varying (LPV) model predictive controller (MPC) for rotor speed and stator's active and reactive power control of a Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) based WECS. The turbine dynamics and the DFIG is modeled as a single LPV system, which enables the model transformation into an equivalent linear time-invariant (LTI) system to avoid online updates of the prediction matrix. Based on the LTI representation, a tube-based LPV MPC (TLPVMPC) is developed, consisting of a tracking nominal MPC with tightened constraint sets and a disturbance controller. In the proposed method, the disturbance upper bound is estimated by Kalman filtering, which provides less conservative performance. The proposed controller is compared to sliding mode control (SMC), LPVMPC and nonlinear MPC (NMPC) methods. Simulations are conducted under model uncertainties and partial faults in the DFIG control voltages. The results show the robust performance of the proposed controller in power extraction and reduction of mechanical stress build-up compared to the other control methods.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Voltage Control of Inverter-Based DG in Active Distribution Networks With Measurement-Strategy Mapping Matrix</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10795660</link><description>The high penetration of distributed generators (DGs) has exacerbated voltage violations in active distribution networks (ADNs). The sensitivity, as the law between nodal power injection and state variation, can be used to develop DG strategies. However, due to the nonlinearity, the accurate description and efficient application of sensitivity have become an important challenge in the establishment of DG control strategy. In this paper, an adaptive voltage control strategy for DGs is developed based on ADN sensitivity. First, the measurement-strategy mapping matrix is established to describe the complex time-varying sensitivity. The sensitivity between nodal voltage and reactive power is described as discrete matrix elements, which are generated based on the Koopman operator. Then, an adaptive voltage control model is built based on the measurement-strategy mapping matrix, in which the lifted linear decision rule (LLDR) is introduced to continue the discrete matrix elements as a couple of constraints. Efficient formulation of DG strategies is realized in a data-driven manner based on ADN sensitivity. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated using the IEEE 33-node system, practical 53-node system, and IEEE 123-node system. The proposed strategy can effectively cope with voltage problems while enhancing the adaptability to variations in practical operation.</description></item><item><title>Planning of Stationary-Mobile Integrated Battery Energy Storage Systems Under Severe Convective Weather</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10806563</link><description>Under extreme weather events represented by severe convective weather (SCW), the adaptability of power system and service restoration have become paramount. To this end, this paper presents a novel planning method of stationary-mobile integrated battery energy storage system (SMI-BESS) capable of spatial flexibility.

However, previous studies on DC collector systems of OWFs mainly focus on the DC series-parallel (SP) topology, which escalates the overall costs. To optimize the collector system layout, this paper proposes a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) based framework for improving the overall economic efficiency by leveraging an advanced DC series-parallel-parallel (SPP) topology. In the proposed framework, a hierarchical open-loop multiple travelling salesman problem (HOMTSP) is utilized to model the SPP topology, decomposing the collector system layout optimization (CSLO) problem into sub-problems for resolution. Subsequently, a hierarchical double Q-learning (DQL) is employed to solve these sub-problems, with a topology-guided mechanism to refine the routing results and correct crossed cables by incorporating topological characteristics. Furthermore, this study acquires the GIS data and the connection scheme of wind turbines in a real OWF for the case study. Numerical results show the SPP-based framework significantly improves the economic efficiency compared to the DC SP topology and the AC double-sided ring topology.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Design for Switchable Grid-Following and Grid-Forming Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10811873</link><description>This paper presents the design of a novel grid-forming (GFM) control structure adapted from a typical grid-following (GFL) control structure with minimal edits, thereby enabling a switchable control structure for voltage sourced converters (VSCs) to operate in either GFL or GFM mode by simply switching a flag manually. The VSC is shown to be able to operate in the GFL control mode synchronizing to the main grid through a phase-locked-loop (PLL) and operate as a GFM controller with power-based synchronization for both grid-connected and islanded conditions. To guarantee smooth operation, the control schemes and the mode switching logic have been carefully designed and examined via a series of experiments. The experiment results show that the switchable control structure can fulfill the desired control and operation functions and enable smooth transition between control modes.</description></item><item><title>Intraday Wind Power Forecasting by Ensemble of Overlapping Historical Numerical Weather Predictions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10812675</link><description>The numerical weather prediction (NWP) is crucial to improve intraday wind power forecasting (WPF) accuracy. However, conventional WPF methods relied solely on a latest reported single NWP, overlooking hidden information from sequentially reported multiple historical NWPs that are partially overlapped over time. Additionally, it's challenging to tackle intraday WPF as it involves both ultra-short-term and short-term horizons with different characteristics. Therefore, a novel spatio-temporal representation learning network is proposed for intraday WPF by ensemble of overlapping historical NWPs. Initially, an integrated mask-reconstruction representation learning pretraining strategy is employed to extract hidden representations of historical wind power measurements and overlapping historical NWPs, providing contextual information for the subsequent intraday WPF task. Then, the output layer is trained and end-to-end fine-tuning of the entire network is conducted to adapt to the specific forecasting task. Moreover, a multi-task learning strategy based on hard parameter sharing is adopted to ensure balanced predictive accuracy across each of forecasted wind farms. Case study and detailed ablation tests based on 5 real-world wind farms demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the forecasting accuracy of most wind farms by leveraging spatio-temporal correlation, achieving the best average performance across all time horizons compared to the baseline models.</description></item><item><title>Event-Triggered H-Infinity Pitch Control for Floating Offshore Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10820839</link><description>The complex wind and wave environment can lead to increased external disturbances and power fluctuations of floating offshore wind turbines, posing a significant challenge to their stable operation. To cope with this issue, this paper formulates an event-triggered H-infinity pitch control strategy for floating offshore wind turbines.

Then, the event-triggered control strategy is introduced into the H-infinity pitch control of floating offshore wind turbines. Based on this, a criterion for the asymptotic stability and H-infinity norm boundedness of floating offshore wind turbines is derived. Furthermore, an algorithm is presented for designing feedback gain matrices of the event-triggered H-infinity pitch control, which can effectively reduce the update frequency of the controller. Finally, a simulation is conducted on the IEA 15 MW Reference Wind Turbine by integrating OpenFAST with MATLAB/Simulink. The simulation results provide a comparative analysis of the event-triggered H-infinity pitch control strategy and the continuous-time pitch control strategy, demonstrating the superiority of the method proposed in this paper.</description></item><item><title>Frequency Constrained Dispatch With Energy Reserve and Virtual Inertia From Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10840325</link><description>With the increasing penetration of wind power and gradual retirement of conventional generating units (CGUs), wind turbines (WTs) become promising resources to provide steady-state energy reserve (ER) and frequency support for the grid to facilitate supply-demand balance and frequency security. In this regard, a novel frequency constrained dispatch framework with ER and virtual inertia from WTs is proposed. Firstly, this paper establishes the WT model with both ER and virtual inertia, whose energy sources are WT's deloading and rotor kinetic energy, respectively. Secondly, the system frequency response and CGUs' power response are derived while considering WTs exiting inertia response at frequency nadir. Then, this paper develops a stochastic-optimization-based frequency constrained dispatch model, where both WTs' frequency regulation parameters and rotor speeds are decision variables, so that the coupling between WT's mechanical and electrical parts and the coupling between system's transient dynamics and steady-state operation can be fully reflected. Finally, convex hull relaxation, convex hull approximation and deep neural networks are used to transform the original nonlinear model into a mixed-integer second-order cone programming model. Case studies on the 118-bus system verify the effectiveness of the proposed models and methods.</description></item><item><title>Secondary Frequency Regulation From Aggregated Distributed Photovoltaics: A Dynamic Flexibility Aggregation Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10840304</link><description>To fully utilize the potential of massive small-scale distributed photovoltaics (DPVs) for secondary frequency regulation (SFR), this article introduces a hierarchical coordination framework that incorporates the dynamic response characteristic (DRC) of DPV to automatic generation control (AGC) signals, thereby reflecting the dynamic flexibility of the aggregated DPVs (ADPVs). First, a reserved power feasible range is derived for scheduling the power reserve control (PRC) scheme considering the uncertainty in PV generation and the de-loaded margin base constraint. Second, a two-stage multi-cluster DRC aggregation method that considers the impact of the PRC scheme is developed to describe the equivalent DRC of the ADPVs. Last, the article constructs an integrated cost function (ICF) that reveals the interdependencies between SFR capacity, equivalent DRC and regulation cost, which enables the decoupled scheduling of the SFR indices and the PRC scheme. An event-triggered duty factor reassignment mechanism is further proposed to improve the reliability of SFR service deployment in case of unexpected events. Simulation results indicate that the framework is an efficient approach for quantifying, trading and realizing the dynamic flexibility of the ADPVs.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Scheduling and Commercial Testbed-Based Verification of Integrated PV-ESS Systems Considering Settlement Rules in South Korea</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10842237</link><description>This article proposes an optimal scheduling algorithm for an integrated PV-ESS system to maximize the overall revenue from both system marginal price (SMP) and renewable energy certificate (REC), considering detailed settlement rules in South Korea.

Comparing with the classic Lyapunov methods and equal-area methods, the proposed method does not require either detailed analytical expressions of the entire system or real-time fault detection and high-speed communication, which fundamentally creates a novel idea for distributed synchronous stabilization control. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated by Matlab/Simulink results.</description></item><item><title>Budget-Constrained Collaborative Renewable Energy Forecasting Market</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10850726</link><description>Accurate power forecasting from renewable energy sources (RES) is crucial for integrating additional RES capacity into the power system and realizing sustainability goals.

This paper presents a multi-objective bi-level LVRT control strategy for the two-stage PV grid-connected system to maximize the positive and negative sequence voltage support capability while ensuring safe operation under asymmetrical faults. The AC level controls the grid side inverter, while the DC level regulates the boost converter. The grid voltage support control strategy is implemented at the AC level to support the positive and negative sequence voltage of the point of common coupling. Considering there is an inherent contradiction between grid voltage support with the overcurrent of inverter and DC voltage oscillation, the current references are automatically adjusted to facilitate the maximum positive and negative voltage support while limiting the overcurrent and oscillation of DC-link voltage. Based on the power reference shared from the AC level, the DC level regulates the boost converter to stabilize the DC-link voltage speedily by utilizing the compensation current. Finally, simulations and experiments demonstrate the voltage support capability and fast dynamic response characteristics of DC-link voltage in different scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Two-Stage Planning for Smart Buildings With Flexible Heating Load Considering Climate Change Induced Heat Waves</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856233</link><description>Building energy planning is significantly challenged by climate change, particularly the increasing frequency of heat waves impacting heating and cooling demands. Current planning methodologies neglect the impacts of heat waves on energy consumption and do not accurately model the temperature-dependent performance of heat pumps (HPs). This paper addresses the critical issue of designing energy-efficient and climate-resilient buildings through optimal resource configuration under uncertain weather conditions. A two-stage stochastic optimization model for building energy system planning is proposed. In the first stage, the capacities of energy resources are optimized; in the second stage, operational strategies under various weather scenarios are determined. A novel long-term load forecasting method using morphing techniques is developed to generate scenario trees accounting for both normal conditions and heat waves, capturing the impact of climate change on energy demand. Additionally, a temperature-dependent HP model with finite partial output levels is introduced, improving upon existing fixed coefficient of performance models to reflect practical operational characteristics. Simulation results on a real educational building in Stockholm demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, showing an 8.33% reduction in heating capacity requirements and a 62.14% decrease in solution time, enhancing both resilience and computational efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive and Decentralized Control Strategy to Support Coordination of Multiple DC Microgrids Considering Transmission Line Impedance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856845</link><description>Multiple DC Microgrids (MGs) can be interconnected by interlinking converters (ICs) to support each other through coordinated control strategies. However, the nonnegligible transmission line resistance results in inaccuracies in decentralized coordination at steady state. To address this issue, an adaptive and decentralized control strategy is proposed to eliminate the impact of transmission line resistance and facilitate accurate power sharing among the DC MGs. The proposed strategy injects a perturbance to estimate the transmission line resistance based on the IC signals sampled before and after the perturbance, obviating the need for additional measuring devices on the transmission line. With the estimated results, the proposed strategy compensates for the transmission line resistance through virtual resistance, achieving accurate power sharing among the DC MGs under coordinated control. The compensation and coordination operations rely on the local signals from the IC, ensuring this power coordination in a decentralized manner. Furthermore, the estimation and compensation algorithm is decoupled at each IC port, allowing the easy extension of the proposed strategy. This paper discusses the application of the proposed strategy in three scenarios: two interconnected DC MGs, and several DC MGs interconnected via a multiport IC or multiple ICs. Using the example of two DC MGs with line impedance considered, the system stability is analyzed based on a small-signal model. Lastly, the feasibility of the proposed strategy in these scenarios is validated by the simulation and hardware-in-loop tests.</description></item><item><title>Mode Switching-Induced Instability of Multi-Source Feed DC Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10943241</link><description>In DC microgrids (DCMGs), DC-bus signaling based control strategy is extensively used for power management, where mode switching plays a crucial role in achieving multi-source coordination. However, few studies have noticed the impact of mode switching and switching strategies on system voltage stability. To fill this gap, this paper aims to provide a general analysis framework for mode switching-induced instability in multi-source DCMGs. First, manifold theory is employed to analyze the stability of the DCMG switched system. Subsequently, the instability mechanism and its physical interpretation are explored. The positive feedback activated by the decreasing DC bus voltage during the switching process leads to instability. Switching strategy may inadvertently contribute to this instability. To improve stability, a novel control method based on mode scheduling is proposed, by adjusting switching strategy and thereby correcting the system trajectory. Finally, both real-time simulations and experimental tests on a DCMG system verify the correctness and effectiveness of theoretical analysis results.</description></item><item><title>Distribution System Blackstart and Restoration Using DERs and Dynamically Formed Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10858306</link><description>Extreme weather events have led to long-duration outages in the distribution system (DS), necessitating novel approaches to blackstart and restore the system. Existing blackstart solutions utilize blackstart units to establish multiple microgrids (MGs), sequentially energize non-blackstart units, and restore loads. However, these approaches often result in isolated MGs. In DERs-aided blackstart, the continuous operation of these MGs is limited by the finite energy capacity of commonly used blackstart units like battery energy storage (BES)-based grid-forming inverters (GFMIs). To address this issue, this article proposes a holistic blackstart and restoration framework that incorporates synchronization between dynamic MGs and the entire DS with the transmission grid (TG). To support synchronization, we leveraged virtual synchronous generator-based control for GFMIs to estimate their frequency response to load pick-up events using only initial/final quasi-steady-state points. Subsequently, a synchronization switching condition is developed to model synchronizing switches, aligning them seamlessly with a linearized branch flow problem. Finally, we designed a bottom-up blackstart and restoration framework that considers the switching structure of the DS, energizing/synchronizing switches, DERs with grid-following inverters, and BES-based GFMIs with frequency security constraints. The proposed framework is validated in IEEE-123-bus system, considering cases with two and four GFMIs under various TG recovery instants.</description></item><item><title>Sensitivity-Based Heterogeneous Ordered Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Volt-Var Control in Active Distribution Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10879343</link><description>As power grids expand, maintaining stable voltage and minimizing losses become increasingly crucial. Meanwhile, the widespread use of heterogeneous devices in modern distribution systems necessitates effective multi-device coordination.

First, the sliding mode technique is introduced in the PNN to design a finite-time PNN (FTPNN). The stability and finite-time convergence of the proposed FTPNN are proved by the Lyapunov method and the setting time bound is given. Then, the deep FTPNN (DFTPNN) is designed by combining deep learning with the proposed FTPNN. The dynamic parameters in the MES that change over time are used as input variables for the DFTPNN, allowing the trained DFTPNN to respond immediately to changes in the dynamic parameters and to predict the solutions of the FTPNN with different parameters directly. Simulation experiments show that FTPNN has faster convergence compared to PNN. DFTPNN significantly reduces the computation time compared to FTPNN. DFTPNN provides predicted solutions to FTPNN. Since DFTPNN can respond immediately to changes in dynamic parameters and directly provide energy management strategies under different parameters, it can adapt to changing environments and promote the economic and stable operation of MES.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Enhanced Safe Reinforcement Learning for the Dispatch of a Local Energy Community</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10887028</link><description>Local Energy Community (LEC) has emerged as a viable community-focus framework to enhance local reliability and energy efficiency by integrating different energy sectors and managing local distributed energy resources (DERs). However, the difficulties associated with handling model complexity, along with privacy concerns arising from interactions between energy operators within the LEC, pose challenges for traditional algorithms in achieving coordinated dispatch. To this end, we develop a novel privacy-enhanced, safe, coordinated dispatch framework that integrates reinforcement learning (RL), the perturbation module, and the safety module. The private states of each energy sector within the LEC are concealed by the independent perturbation module before sharing. A central RL agent is then trained on the concealed state space to learn the optimal policy for coordinated dispatch under the complex and uncertain environment. Furthermore, dispatch actions are evaluated and refined by the safety module before the operators execute them. In this way, we can obtain an optimal policy without disclosing any sector&#8217;s private state while ensuring the safe operation of the LEC. Extensive experiments are carried out to validate the superior performance and scalability of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Industrial Energy Management and Production Decision Making via Lyapunov-Guided Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10934097</link><description>Energy-intensive industries have to reduce fossil fuel consumption while scheduling production for cost efficiency. It poses the question that how to coordinate renewable energy generation, storage, heat recovery and energy cascade utilization in real time to deal with the low energy efficiency and continuous production problems existing in complex dynamic coupled process production. This question is further complicated while facing difficulties in collaborative modeling and online control by the underlying stochastic process without accurate statistic knowledge. To characterize the above issues, a non-convex operation optimization problem is formulated for coupling production and energy joint scheduling. To obtain a simple online solution with provable performance, a method by combining Lyapunov optimization and actor-critic deep reinforcement learning is proposed. The former is used to decouple the original problem into small-size non-convex subproblems for each time slot and guarantee the long-term constraints. The latter aims at the non-convex part by using model information of the former to obtain accurate evaluations of production actions for fast convergence and high robustness with low computational complexity. The simulation shows that the proposed method can achieve the online optimal benefit while ensuring production tasks and system stability with high scalability.</description></item><item><title>A Statistical-Based Approach for Decentralized Demand Response Toward Primary Frequency Support: A Case Study of Large-Scale 5G Base Stations With Adaptive Droop Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856199</link><description>Due to the rapidity required for primary frequency control (PFC), the decentralized responses of distributed energy resources (DERs) are often uncoordinated and cannot be aggregated into a desired outcome. This paper proposes a novel approach to consolidate the decentralized responses of ON/OFF DERs as an organized droop control. For a DER population, a dynamic response threshold can be calculated based on its statistical distribution, enabling DERs to autonomously respond to PFC according to local states. The aggregation of their responses can align with any preset droop curve (linear or non-linear). The approach is demonstrated by a novel DER, 5G base stations (gNBs) and their backup energy storage systems (BESSs), marking the first attempt of gNBs for PFC support, to the authors&#8217; knowledge. In this regard, gNB dormancy model, based on user equipment (UE) access, and dynamic BESS response model, derived from experimental data, are developed. An adaptive droop control scheme is designed to enable gNBs within multiple radio access networks (RANs) to provide differentiated responses based on disturbances degree and RANs busyness level. Simulations based on real device data show that the proposed approach enables decentralized gNBs to perform accurate response, providing PFC support without affecting communication network operation.</description></item><item><title>Two-Timescale Online Optimization of Behind-the-Meter Battery Storage for Stacked Revenue by Providing Multi-Services</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10886993</link><description>Behind-the-meter (BTM) battery energy storage systems (BESS) are becoming increasingly important in the power system with the proliferation of intermittent distributed renewable energy sources. Stacked revenue can be achieved by providing multi-services to the power grid, justifying the substantial upfront cost of BTM BESS and promoting their future adoption. This paper focuses on optimizing the operation strategy of BTM BESS to maximize the time average stacked revenue obtained from multiple service markets, including energy arbitrage, frequency regulation, photovoltaic (PV) power smoothing and reactive power compensation. Challenges arise from the coupling of operation decisions both among multiple services and over the temporal dimension, considering the different decision timescales of service markets as well as the battery dynamics. The uncertainty of stochastic parameters further complicates the optimization process. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel two timescale online optimization scheme based on the Lyapunov optimization framework. The uncertainties are tackled by making decisions online, and the computation complexity is highly relieved by relaxing the temporal coupling with a drift-plus-penalty technique. Theoretic analyses are conducted to prove that the solution of this relaxed online decision problem is always feasible for the original one, and it can achieve near-optimum with a constant optimality gap. Extensive simulations utilizing the energy and frequency regulation data from the real market validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>Occupant-Centric Demand Response for Thermostatically-Controlled Home Loads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10879280</link><description>Efficiently managing energy usage to balance supply and demand on the electric grid is crucial, especially with the widespread deployment of distributed variable renewable electricity generation. This paper introduces two duty-cycle control methods for heating systems, adjusting thermostat setpoints to limit and shift electricity demand. The control approaches employ innovative techniques, such as adaptive duty cycling, to prioritize household thermal comfort while reducing peak demand. These control methods can respond to signals from the electric grid, including demand targets and time-of-use tariffs, and were tested physically on an electric furnace and heat pump in a test home during winter conditions in 2021 and 2022. The results are given as average demand reductions and energy use impacts with respect to the average indoor-outdoor temperature difference during the control period. For heat pumps, demand limiting control reduced power by 18.5% and 23.3% for indoor-outdoor temperature differences of 30&#176;F and 40&#176;F. Preheating-based demand shifting achieved reductions of 34.8% and 33.2% for the same temperature differences. Electric furnace tests showed demand reductions of 33.8% and 25.3% for demand limiting, and 56.1% and 45.7% for preheating-based demand shifting. These findings highlight the potential for innovative control methods to enhance grid efficiency and reduce energy consumption.</description></item><item><title>A &#8220;Smart Model-Then-Control&#8221; Strategy for the Scheduling of Thermostatically Controlled Loads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891668</link><description>Model predictive control (MPC) has been widely adopted for indoor temperature control and building energy management. There are two steps in traditional MPC: 1) modeling thermal dynamics as the state space function to represent the temperature variation influenced by thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs); 2) formulating an optimization problem for optimal scheduling of TCLs within the control horizon. However, such a &#8220;model-then-control&#8221; strategy could result in biased control because of the unaligned modeling error and control cost, i.e., minimization of model errors may not necessarily lead to minimal costs against actual thermal dynamics in buildings. To tackle this problem, we advocate for a &#8220;smart model-then-control&#8221; (SMC) strategy that incorporates thermal dynamics modeling into the temperature control task. In particular, instead of using mean squared errors (MSE), we adopt the control objective as the task-specific loss function to guide the model training. We further formulate an Input Convex Neural Network (ICNN)-based surrogate loss function, which is differentiable and convex for effective training. In this way, the objectives of both model training and temperature control in MPC are well-aligned to obtain cost-effective decisions. We validate the performance of the SMC strategy in single-zone and multi-zone buildings. The simulation results show that it can reduce control costs by 5.97% and 2.10% respectively when compared with traditional MPC.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive MARL Large Model for Dispatch Strategy Generation in Logistics-Energy Spatiotemporal Coordination of Container Seaports</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10915539</link><description>Logistics-energy coordination significantly enhances energy efficiency in electrified seaports. However, daily changes in environment data necessitate the re-implementation of optimization procedures, causing huge computational burdens. This paper proposes an adaptive multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) large model for logistics-energy spatiotemporal coordination of container seaports. The well-trained large model can directly generate optimal policy for each operating day from environment data without re-solving. To achieve this, a comprehensive logistics-energy coordination model is first established considering the spatial and temporal constraints of all-electric ships (AESs), quay cranes (QCs), auto guided vehicles (AGVs), and the seaport power distribution network (SPDN). The model is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Then a MARL large model is developed, involving a hypernetwork mapping environment data to optimal policy, and special structures for both hypernetwork and agent policy networks to adapt to any number of daily arrival AESs. Additionally, a cascading action modification layer is designed to ensure correct action outputs within complex spatiotemporal constraints. A tailored training method with two acceleration strategies are developed for the large model. Case studies illustrate that the large model after training can automatically generate optimal policies with little to no fine-tuning, outperforming existing methods that require extensive solution time.</description></item><item><title>Harmonic Stability Analysis of Microgrids With Converter-Interfaced Distributed Energy Resources, Part I: Modeling and Theoretical Foundations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854521</link><description>This paper proposes a method for the Harmonic Stability Assessment (HSA) of power systems with a high share of Converter-Interfaced Distributed Energy Resources (CIDERs). To this end, the Harmonic State-Space (HSS) model of a generic power system is formulated by combining the HSS models of the resources and the grid in closed-loop configuration. The HSS model of the resources is obtained from the Linear Time-Periodic (LTP) models of the CIDER components transformed to frequency domain using Fourier theory and Toeplitz matrices. Notably, the HSS of a CIDER is capable of representing the coupling between harmonic frequencies in detail. The HSS model of the grid is derived from the dynamic equations of the individual branch and shunt elements. The system matrix of the HSS models on power-system or resource level is employed for eigenvalue analysis in the context of HSA. A sensitivity analysis of the eigenvalue loci w.r.t. changes in model parameters, and a classification of eigenvalues into control-design variant, control-design invariant, and design invariant eigenvalues is proposed. A case of harmonic instability is identified by the HSA and validated via Time-Domain Simulations (TDS) in Simulink.</description></item><item><title>Harmonic Stability Analysis of Microgrids With Converter-Interfaced Distributed Energy Resources, Part II: Case Studies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854578</link><description>In Part I of this paper a method for the Harmonic Stability Assessment (HSA) of power systems with a high share of Converter-Interfaced Distributed Energy Resources (CIDERs) was proposed. Specifically, the Harmonic State-Space (HSS) model of a generic power system is derived through combination of the components&#8217; HSS models. The HSS models of CIDERs and grid are based on Linear Time-Periodic (LTP) models, capable of representing the coupling between different harmonics. In Part II, the HSA of a grid-forming, and two grid-following CIDERs (i.e., ex- and including the DC-side modelling) is performed. More precisely, the classification of the eigenvalues, the impact of the maximum harmonic order on the locations of the eigenvalues, and the sensitivity curves of the eigenvalues w.r.t. to control parameters are provided. These analyses allow to study the physical meaning and origin of the CIDERs&#8217; eigenvalues. Additionally, the HSA is performed for a representative example system derived from the CIGR&#200; low-voltage benchmark system. A case of harmonic instability is identified through the system eigenvalues, and validated with Time-Domain Simulations (TDS) in Simulink. It is demonstrated that, as opposed to stability analyses based on Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) models, the HSA is suitable for the detection of harmonic instability.</description></item><item><title>AC and DC Interaction Analysis and Transient Control Strategy for Soft Open Points in Unbalanced Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856184</link><description>Soft open points (SOPs) can play a key role in hybrid AC/DC distribution networks (DNs) due to their flexible power control ability. However, the sequence-domain behavior of SOPs in unbalanced DNs cannot be ignored from the perspective of system stability and safety. Therefore, this paper first investigates the interaction between AC and DC components in unbalanced DNs by considering SOPs with the typical  $V_{dc}$ /Q and P/Q control strategies in medium-voltage DNs. The analytical results indicate  $2^{\mathrm { nd}}$  frequency oscillations in q-axis voltage, power, and DC voltage are present in unbalanced DNs. This deteriorates the transient dynamics and synchronization of SOPs and may result in the disconnection of loads and resources. To address this, a robust sequence-decomposed control strategy is proposed for SOP. To ride through unbalanced DNs, an adaptive virtual impedance-based control is activated in the positive sequence to improve restoration capability, while the negative-sequence currents are suppressed by the inner control. The DC synchronization loop is implemented by using the transferred DC power and internal energy for frequency stability enhancement. The case studies in a 40-node medium-voltage DN indicate that the proposed control enables SOPs to ride through both unbalanced load and unbalanced fault conditions in a short transient time.</description></item><item><title>Accelerated Dynamic Event-Triggered Algorithm for Online Power System Optimization by Using Powerball Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10876194</link><description>Nowadays, online optimization for power systems has gained increasing attention due to many time-varying scenarios in practical applications. This paper proposes a novel feedback-based online algorithm for power system optimization problems by combining the powerball technique and a dynamic event-triggered mechanism, aiming to achieving a faster convergence rate and high communication efficiency simultaneously. In particular, a measurement-based prima-dual approach is utilized to solve the considered time-varying optimization problem. Taking the constrained resource issue, a more flexible triggering condition with a dynamic threshold is designed for dual variables to reduce communication burden. By further employing the powerball strategy, the primal-dual iteration is modified with an improved convergence rate. Finally, numerical experiments on test systems are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed online algorithm. It is shown that the proposed approach has superior convergence property especially in the initial process. Meanwhile, a better trade-off between the satisfactory system performance and communication resources consumption can be achieved.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Time Scale Frequency Regulation Control of Virtual Power Plant Based on Fuzzy Sets</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884854</link><description>With the continuous development of the power system, in the face of the frequency deviation caused by the randomness and volatility of renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic and wind power, considering the use of air conditioning, electric vehicle charging piles, and energy storage to form a distributed resource cluster that takes into account economy and efficiency to participate in frequency regulation auxiliary services to reduce frequency deviation. In the process of a virtual power plant (VPP) participating in frequency regulation auxiliary service, a multi-time scale frequency regulation control strategy of VPP is proposed, which can cope with frequency deviation on different time scales. By establishing a three-stage frequency regulation process, the collaborative optimization of distributed resources is realized. The priority principle is adopted to prioritize the scheduling of higher-value resources to participate in frequency regulation, which helps to allocate resources. In the process of tertiary frequency regulation, the fuzzy sets are used to optimize the frequency regulation strategy of energy storage, which reduces the switching times of energy storage and improves the stability of frequency regulation. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the feasibility of distributed resources participating in frequency regulation are verified by a case.</description></item><item><title>Model-Based Safe Reinforcement Learning for Active Distribution Network Scheduling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10930731</link><description>Data-driven methods, especially reinforcement learning (RL), are adept at addressing uncertainties but are poor at ensuring safety, which is a critical requirement in active distribution networks (DNs). To address the problem of active DN scheduling and to overcome RL&#8217; most critical drawback&#8212;security risk, this paper proposes a model-based safe RL framework that embeds a model-based safety module (MBSM) in the RL&#8217;s loop. The proposed framework can guarantee that the agent&#8217;s actions (real/reactive power outputs of controllable distributed energy resources (DERs)) strictly satisfy the DN&#8217;s operational security constraints. It does not rely on any expert knowledge and is suitable for application in large-scale systems. Comparative studies against existing Safe RL (SRL) and classic optimization methods verify that the proposed method achieves the best performance in terms of DERs operating cost and renewable energy consumption while strictly satisfying the DN&#8217;s operational security constraints.</description></item><item><title>Leveraging Time-Causal State Variable Aggregation for Real-Time Schedule of Massive Air Conditioners</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909698</link><description>Air conditioner (AC) loads offer promising flexibility for active distribution networks to manage uncertainties, such as those in renewable energy generation, electricity prices, and load demand. However, real-time scheduling of ACs is challenging due to their massive temporal coupling constraints and time-causal uncertainties. To address this, a novel time-causal aggregation-based approximate dynamic programming (TCA-ADP) algorithm is proposed for efficient scheduling. The time-causality requirements for aggregating state variables are first analyzed to align with the real-time sequential decision-making process. Subsequently, an enhanced aggregation model is developed to ensure both high accuracy and adherence to time causality. The aggregation process is further reformulated as a linear program to optimize aggregation parameters and enable tractable computation. Accordingly, the TCA-ADP leverages aggregated state variables to approximate the value function as a new way, balancing computational efficiency and economy against the large value function space of massive ACs. By training the value function offline using historical data, the TCA-ADP efficiently achieves near-optimal real-time scheduling of massive ACs through parallel and closed-form disaggregation. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the TCA-ADP, highlighting its aggregation accuracy, uncertainty handling, and the trade-off between economy and tractability.</description></item><item><title>Model-Free Aggregation for Virtual Power Plants Using Input Convex Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916791</link><description>The virtual power plant (VPP) has been advocated as a promising way to aggregate massive distributed energy resources (DERs) in a distribution system (DS) for their participation in transmission-level operations. This requires identifying the feasible set of VPP power transfers fulfilling DS operational constraints. The identification task is completed using the existing methods by relying on constraint parameters (e.g., line impedance). However, the constraint parameters in a DS may be inaccurate and even missing in practice. Consequently, this paper develops a model-free aggregation method for VPPs. The proposed method first develops an input convex neural network (ICNN)-based surrogate for the feasible set of VPP power transfers. Our ICNN-based surrogate can be determined in a model-free manner by historical data. Furthermore, it is proven by leveraging the convexity and epigraph relaxation of an ICNN that our ICNN-based surrogate can be reformulated as a linear programming model without binary variables. This allows efficiently embedding our ICNN-based surrogate in transmission-level operations so that numerous VPPs can be efficiently coordinated at the transmission level. The proposed method is verified by numerical experiments in the IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 136-bus test systems.</description></item><item><title>Anomaly Identification of Synchronized Voltage Waveform for Situational Awareness of Low Inertia Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10918789</link><description>Inverter-based resources (IBRs) such as photovoltaics (PVs), wind turbines, and battery energy storage systems (BESSs) are widely deployed in low-carbon power systems. However, these resources typically do not provide the inertia needed for grid stability, resulting in a low-inertia power system. IBRs and lack of inertia have been known to cause anomalies such as waveform distortions and wideband oscillations in power systems due to the limited inertia level, leading to increased generation trips and load shedding. To achieve effective anomaly identification, this paper proposes a synchro-waveform-based algorithm utilizing real-time synchronized voltage waveform measurements from waveform measurement units (WMUs). In the proposed method, different physical characteristics, as well as statistical features, are extracted from synchronized voltage waveform measurements to filter anomalies. Then, the anomaly identification approach based on the random forest is developed and deployed into the FNET/GridEye system considering trade-offs among accuracy, computational burden, and deployment cost. Moreover, four WMUs are specially designed and deployed on Kauai Island to receive instantaneous synchronized voltage waveform measurements. To verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, different experiments are carried out with collected field test data. The result demonstrates that the performance of the proposed synchro-waveform-based anomaly categorization algorithm can accurately identify anomalies 95.35% of the time, which has comparable performance among benchmarking algorithms.</description></item><item><title>A Unified Model for Smart Meter Data Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10935756</link><description>Making adequate utilization of smart meter data is conducive to improving the energy efficiency of the power system from demand side, especially with booming artificial intelligence (AI) technology. However, most existing AI-based methods are highly incompatible to each other due to unique designs based on their respective tasks. Low compatibility will lead to duplicate modeling among similar tasks and skyrocketing implementation costs, which is not suitable for diverse and changing demand-side tasks. Although large language models provide a promising way to build the general-purpose models, they either need substantial resources for pre-training or case-by-case design for fine-tuning. Hence, there are practically rare task-generic models available for power systems. In this paper, we propose a novel unified model for smart meter data applications. Specifically, we first propose a unified model with mixture-of-expert layers to ensure sufficient model capacity in a cost-effective manner, which makes the training from scratch affordable. Then, we design an information bottleneck-based training scheme to facilitate the unified model to efficiently learn the generic knowledge. Moreover, we develop a general framework based on pre-training paradigm to formulate a uniform objective function and provide a consistent workflow for different tasks. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method are validated on public datasets, where the proposed unified model can be applied to load forecasting, data imputation as well as anomaly detection, and realizes comparable performance to state-of-the-art task-specific methods.</description></item><item><title>Implicit Enhanced Distributed Heavy-Ball Energy Management Strategy for Microgrids With Time-Varying Social Welfare and Delay</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10918786</link><description>Diverse energy sources and fluctuating energy demands highlight the criticality of microgrid energy management (MEM). This paper develops a general model of social welfare maximization in the presence of time-varying social welfare with quadratic transmission losses, which implies that the fitting coefficients of the transmission losses, cost function, and utility function may vary over time. A significant difference with existing works is the dependence of the problem&#8217;s optimal solution on time variation, making higher requirements on the algorithm&#8217;s performance, especially the convergence rate. To address these challenges, we extend the conventional heavy-ball method and propose a novel implicit enhanced distributed heavy-ball algorithm. The algorithm incorporates multiple heavy-ball terms to accelerate convergence. Notably, the second heavy-ball term is implicitly implemented via an acceleration term that contains historical information and consensus error. Furthermore, the algorithm obviates the necessity for the sharing of additional auxiliary variables, thereby reducing the communication overhead. We demonstrate that the algorithm converges asymptotically to the neighborhood of the time-varying optimal solution even with arbitrarily large but bounded communication delays. Finally, detailed case studies illustrate that the algorithm can improve the convergence rate by 15.02% over conventional method, followed by the validation of its scalability and the discussion of the negative impact of delay.</description></item><item><title>Network Topology Flexibility-Aware Robust Electricity Trading for Distribution System Survivability Enhancement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10922206</link><description>Extreme weather events significantly threaten power system security and market operations, causing either substantial load fluctuations or grid line failures. Current distribution-level electricity market mechanisms often prove inadequate during such events. Furthermore, limited research has explored electricity market mechanisms for improving distribution system survivability. To fill this gap, this study proposes a double-auction mechanism to facilitate distribution-level transactions of non-utility distributed energy resources through market incentives for proactive system resilience enhancement. This mechanism aims to utilize a market-driven approach to achieve the highest system survivability in disasters. This trading mechanism is divided into two stages to address the direct changes in the tradability caused by line failures: clearing and delivery. During market clearing, the DSO operates as an auctioneer to concurrently optimize social welfare and prior-event network topology. The pricing rule employs an enhanced Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism to ensure truthful bidding and incentive compatibility. During delivery, the DSO performs redispatch to mitigate economic losses and compensates for energy curtailments through established settlement protocols. This market-driven resilience enhancement method formulates a bi-level two-stage robust optimization problem, solved using a customized column-and-constraint generation algorithm. Modified IEEE 13-node and 123-node systems are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Cyber-Physical Interdependence for Power System Operation and Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10870120</link><description>This paper summarizes the technical endeavors undertaken by the Task Force (TF) on Cyber-Physical Interdependence for Power System Operation and Control.

Motivated by the model predictive control for energy storage, our end-to-end method incorporates the prior knowledge of the storage model and infers the hidden reward that incentivizes energy storage decisions. This is achieved through a dual-layer framework, combining a prediction layer with an optimization layer. We introduce the perturbation idea into the designed decision-focused loss function to ensure the differentiability over linear storage models, supported by a theoretical analysis of the perturbed loss function. We also develop a hybrid loss function for effective model training. We provide two challenging applications for our proposed framework: energy storage arbitrage, and energy storage behavior prediction. The numerical experiments on real price data demonstrate that our arbitrage approach achieves the highest profit against existing methods. The numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world energy storage data show that our approach achieves the best behavior prediction performance against existing benchmark methods, which shows the effectiveness of our method.</description></item><item><title>A Lightweight Framework for Measurement Causality Extraction and FDIA Localization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10925483</link><description>False Data Injection Attack (FDIA) has become a growing concern in modern cyber-physical power systems. Many learning-based approaches have utilized the statistical correlation patterns between measurements to facilitate the detection and localization of FDIA. However, these correlation patterns are susceptible to the distribution drift of measurement data, which can be induced by changes in system operating points or variations in attack strength, leading to degraded model performance. Causal inference serves as a promising solution to this problem, as it can embed the physical relationship between measurements as causal patterns that are robust against data distribution drifts. However, causal inference is also computationally demanding. To leverage its advantages and address the computational cost issue, this paper proposes a lightweight framework based on causal inference and Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to extract causal patterns between measurements and locate FDIAs. The proposed framework consists of two levels. The lower level uses an X-learner algorithm to estimate the causality strength between measurements and generate Measurement Causality Graphs (MCGs). The upper level then applies a GAT to identify the anomaly patterns in the MCGs. Since the extracted causality patterns are intrinsically related to the measurements, it is easier for the upper level model to identify the attacked nodes than the existing FDIA localization approaches. A physical neighbor masking strategy is implemented to cut down the computational cost of both levels. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on the IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus systems. Experimental results show that the causality-based FDIA localization mechanism provides a lightweight solution to interpretable measurement causality extraction and robust FDIA localization.</description></item><item><title>S3Former: A Deep Learning Approach to High Resolution Solar PV Profiling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10874220</link><description>As the negative impact of climate change escalates, the global necessity to transition to sustainable energy sources becomes increasingly evident. Renewable energies have emerged as a viable solution for users, with Photovoltaic (PV) technology being a favored choice for small installations due to its high reliability, competitive market and increasing efficiency. Accurate mapping of PV installations is crucial in improving grid management, facilitating the integration of renewable energy, encouraging active participation from prosumers, and optimizing the economic performance of decentralized energy markets. To meet this need, S3Former is introduced, which is designed to segment solar panels from aerial imagery and provide size and location information critical for analyzing the impact of such installations on the grid. Although computer vision has become a preferred choice for such implementations, solar panel identification is challenging due to factors such as time-varying weather conditions, different roof characteristics, Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) variations and lack of appropriate initialization weights for optimized training. To tackle these complexities, S3Former features a Masked Attention Mask Transformer incorporating a self-supervised learning pretrained backbone. Specifically, the model leverages low-level and high-level features extracted from the backbone and incorporates an instance query mechanism incorporated on the Transformer architecture to enhance the localization of solar PV installations. Moreover, a self-supervised learning (SSL) phase (pretext task) is introduced to fine-tune the initialization weights on the backbone of S3Former, leading to a noticeable improvement on the results. To rigorously evaluate the performance of S3Former, diverse datasets are utilized, including GGE (France), IGN (France), and USGS (California, USA), across different GSDs. Our extensive experiments consistently demonstrate that the proposed model either matches or surpasses state-of-the-art models (SOTA) and validate the benefit of using the SSL method to improve the segmentation architecture.

With the advent of advanced metering infrastructure, data-driven outage location methods have significantly advanced beyond traditional approaches that rely on manual inspections. However, existing methods still face critical challenges, like reliance on single-source data, limited ability to handle partially observable systems or difficulties with loop networks. To the best of our knowledge, no single approach has comprehensively addressed all of these challenges at once. To this end, this paper proposes a comprehensive multisource data fusion framework for outage locations via probabilistic graph networks. The framework consists of three key phases. First, a novel method for reconstituting distribution networks with loops is developed, transforming looped networks into multiple radial subnetworks that retain all outage causalities of the original network. Second, Bayesian network (BN) models are established for each subnetwork, integrating multiple data sources and network structures. Finally, a joint Gibbs sampling mechanism, featuring forward and backward information flow, is designed to merge data from separate BN models and maximize the utilization of limited evidence, ensuring accurate outage location identification. The framework was validated on two modified public test systems, and comparative studies confirmed its effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>Synchro-Waveform-Based Event Identification Using Multi-Task Time-Frequency Transform Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10907975</link><description>Influenced by the transient dynamics and reduced inertia characteristics of high-penetration renewable energy systems, power system events frequently exhibit distinct characteristics such as high-frequency components including wide-band oscillations and hyper-harmonics. This makes standard systems face challenges including significant latency and reduced accuracy due to limited data resolution. However, current methods face significant limitations, including insufficient pattern capture ability, low noise immunity, limited feature learning, and restricted localization capabilities, thereby hindering real-time performance. To tackle this issue, this paper proposed a novel synchro-waveform-based event identification approach via a Multi-task Time-frequency Transform Network (MTTNet). Initially, a Time-frequency Transform Block (TTB) is developed to extract both local and global information. The TTB leverages both Fourier and S-transforms to derive comprehensive time-frequency information from synchro-waveforms. Subsequently, a multi-task learning strategy is employed to identify the type and distinguish localization of events. Integrating the TTB and multi-task learning, the MTTNet is designed for synchro-waveform-based event identification, incorporating an adaptive weighting strategy and simplified computation for the S-transform. Two different datasets, comprising simulated and actual synchro-waveforms, are collected from the IEEE 123 bus system and a real-world high-penetration renewable energy system using a universal grid analyzer. Extensive experiments on various conditions are carried out. Results demonstrated that the MTTNet consistently surpasses both basic and advanced baselines, with maximum improvements of 13.24% and 9.86%, respectively, while reducing the calculation burden by 15-19 times to achieve real-time event identification.</description></item><item><title>Spike Talk: Genesis and Neural Coding Scheme Translations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909727</link><description>Although digitalization of future power grids offer several coordination incentives, the reliability and security of information and communication technologies (ICT) hinders its overall performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture Spike Talk via a unified representation of power and information as a means of data normalization using spikes for coordinated control of microgrids. This grid-edge technology allows each distributed energy resource (DER) to execute decentralized secondary control philosophy independently by interacting among each other using power flow along the tie-lines. Inspired from the field of computational neuroscience, Spike Talk basically builds on a fine-grained parallelism on the information transfer theory in our brains, particularly when neurons (modeled as DERs) transmit information (inferred from power streams measurable at each DER) through synapses (modeled as tie-lines). Not only does Spike Talk simplify and address the current bottlenecks of the cyber-physical architectural operation by dismissing the ICT layer, it provides intrinsic operational and cost-effective opportunities in terms of infrastructure development, computations and modeling. Hence, this paper provides a pedagogic illustration of the key concepts and design theories. Since we focus on coordinated control of microgrids in this paper, the signaling accuracy and system performance is studied for several neural coding schemes responsible for converting the real-valued local measurements into spikes.</description></item><item><title>A Trustworthy Cloud-Edge Collaboration Framework for Scheduling Distributed Energy Resources in Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10902127</link><description>Integration of distributed energy resources, such as photovoltaics, has expanded rapidly within power distribution networks in recent years.

The nonlinearity inherent in ACC and EMS arises from complex interactions between vehicle dynamics system and composite energy sources, necessitating intricate real-time adjustments and resulting in high-dimensional dynamic optimization problems. This paper proposes a data-driven, model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) integrated optimization framework that emphasizes balancing multiple objectives&#8212;safety, comfort, energy saving, and energy source durability while addressing the challenges of policy convergence exacerbated by potentially sparse rewards in high-dimensional action-state spaces. Specifically, an ACC based on course learning DRL is proposed, with a featuring a staged reward mechanism for driving safety, comfort, and speed consistency to model human-like progressive learning. Then, adaptive equivalent consumption minimization is combined to design the DRL-based EMS that balances fuel economy and power source durability. Finally, the decision sets of the integration optimization framework are generated and verified.

The fair coverage is achieved by designing carefully AAVs' trajectories, which are established at each step by choosing the moving action and channel access for transmitting data. However, under the jamming environment, the problematic trajectories could lead to mutual interference and malicious jamming, such that the coverage service fails. The selections of moving action and channel access are usually coupled, and so far no work has addressed them jointly for planning trajectory. As such, this paper investigates the multi-AAV joint optimization of moving action and channel access for the energy-efficient detection coverage. To decouple the strongly-coupled moving action and channel access, we model the studied optimization problem as a hierarchical game, where the stochastic game (resp. potential game) is applied for selecting moving action (resp. channel access). Then, we propose a multi-agent hierarchical cooperative learning (MAHCL) algorithm to attain near-optimal solution for the joint optimization. It is proved that the proposed MAHCL algorithm can asymptotically converge to the near-optimal joint strategy with lower computational complexity. Finally, the simulation results show the higher energy efficiency of MAHCL algorithm compared with the benchmarks.</description></item><item><title>Energy Efficient Data Evacuation Path for Multi-UAV System Based on Multi-Objective Optimization Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10839300</link><description>To avoid the loss of data collected by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in multi-UAV system, the collected data should be transmitted to ground station for processing in time. Due to insufficient energy and computation resources of UAVs, an interactive multiple data evacuation paths problem of multi-UAV system is a challenge. In this paper, we study energy-saving and time-saving evacuation path for collected data. We formulate a Time and Energy Saving Multi-objective Path Optimization Problem (TESMPOP) to minimize the total transmission time of data and energy consumption of relay UAVs. Because of the NP-hardness of formulated TESMPOP, we propose a Data Temporary Staging Point Selection and Multiple Data Evacuation Paths Ant Colony System (DTSPS-MDEPACS) algorithm. Based on load balance of relay UAV and time constraints of data UAV, DTSPS algorithm is designed to select the suitable relay UAVs to temporarily store data to avoid the loss of data. Then, the MDEPACS algorithm is proposed to find the multiple data evacuation paths for data from the selected relay UAVs to base station. In MDEPACS algorithm, we design hybrid data transmission mode for relay UAV. Each relay UAV's transmission mode can be different. A novel solution construction which includes the mode and trajectory of relay UAVs is proposed. A new pheromone update rule based on nondominated solutions is designed to ensure that ant colony can quickly find the best evacuation paths. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed DTSPS-MDEPACS algorithm has better performance than some other benchmark methods.</description></item><item><title>Performance Analysis of Active RIS-Assisted Downlink NOMA With Transmit Antenna Selection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10839061</link><description>Active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) overcome the severe multiplicative fading effect observed in conventional passive RIS-assisted systems by amplifying the reflected signal. This paper investigates the performance of an active RIS-assisted downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network with transceiver hardware impairments and imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC). By employing the transmit antenna selection technique at the base station, closed-form expressions of the outage probability (OP) and ergodic capacity are derived in terms of the Meijer-G function. Regarding the former, we formulate the asymptotic OP and asymptotic ergodic capacity and obtain the diversity order of the system. Additionally, we explore higher-order modulation schemes such as rectangular quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), cross QAM, and hexagonal QAM, which are integral for achieving increased data rates while maintaining power and bandwidth efficiency. For these modulation schemes, we derive closed-form expressions of the average symbol error rate (ASER) and asymptotic ASER using the Gaussian Chebeyshev quadrature approximation. The performance of the considered NOMA network is compared with an orthogonal multiple access technique. In addition, the system performance is compared to that with a passive RIS. We show that the diversity order of the considered network scales with the number of transmit antennas, the number of REs, and fading mitigation parameters, and the hexagonal QAM outperforms several other QAM schemes. Finally, simulation results affirm the accuracy of the derived closed-form expressions.</description></item><item><title>Sum-Rate Maximization for Uplink Multi-User NOMA With Improper Gaussian Signaling: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10839139</link><description>This paper investigates the joint allocation of power and circularity coefficient for an uplink multi-user non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system employing improper Gaussian signaling (IGS) in the presence of imperfect successive interference cancellation. We propose two novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches to address the weighted sum-rate maximization problem under quality of service constraints in this context. Instead of using widely linear transformation to amalgamate power and circularity coefficient into a unified precoding matrix, the two proposed DRL methods, referred to as interdependent deep deterministic policy gradient (I-DDPG) and collaborative DDPG (C-DDPG), both explicitly incorporate the factor of circularity coefficient in the optimization process, thereby enabling full exploitation of the interference management capabilities offered by IGS in the considered uplink NOMA system. Compared to I-DDPG, C-DDPG facilitates both collaborative training and independent adjustments of both decision variables, leading to enhanced generalization ability. Simulation results validate that the proposed DRL approaches achieve significant sum-rate improvement over conventional model-based optimization techniques, in which C-DDPG pushes individual user rates closer to the optimal NOMA boundary. Furthermore, our findings highlight the fact that the sub-optimality of the model-based optimization technique stems from its inability to fully utilize the circularity coefficient, rather than the power.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing the Secrecy Rate With Direction-Range Focusing With FDA and RIS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10843324</link><description>One of the great potentials to improve the confidentiality in mmWave/THz at the physical layer of technical communication, measured by the secrecy rate, lies in the use of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). However, an important open problem arises when the eavesdropper is aligned with the legitimate user or near the RIS or legitimate user. The limitation stems from the high directional gain caused by the dominant line-of-sight (LOS) path in high-frequency transmission and the high energy leakage in the proximity of the RIS and the legitimate user. To address these issues, we employ frequency diverse arrays (FDA) at the base station (BS) associated with random inverted transmit beamforming and reflective element subset selection (RIBES). More specifically, we consider a passive eavesdropper with unknown location and design the transmit beamforming and RIS configuration based on the channel information of the legitimate user only. In this context, the secrecy rate with the proposed transmission technique is evaluated in the case of deterministic eavesdropper channel, demonstrating that we can ensure a secure transmission regarding both direction and range. Furthermore, assuming no prior information about the eavesdropper, we describe the wiretap region and derive the worst-case secrecy rate in closed form. The latter is further optimized by determining the optimal subset sizes of the transmit antennas and reflective elements. Simulations validate the closed-form expressions and demonstrate that we can effectively improve the secrecy rate, especially when the eavesdropper is near the RIS or the legitimate user.</description></item><item><title>Unnormalized Large-Scale Fading Precoding and Joint Power Control for User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10844564</link><description>Cell-free massive MIMO (mMIMO) stands out as a promising technology for delivering uniformly good wireless services. Prevailing solutions for downlink (DL) precoding are often derived from the uplink-downlink (UL-DL) duality, which correlates DL precoding with UL transmission parameters. Additionally, normalizing the DL precoding vector is a common practice for the sake of power control convenience. In this paper, we introduce a two-layer large-scale fading precoding (LSFP) purely from the perspective of DL transmission. We demonstrate that the optimal two-layer LSFP can be derived from two subsequent signal-to-leakage-interference ratio (SLIR) maximization problems, which is independent of UL transmission parameters. Furthermore, we reveal that normalizing the precoding vector diminishes spectral efficiency (SE) for worse-case UEs, whereas unnormalized precoding schemes, following specifically designed power control policies, ensure much higher SE for worst-case UEs by exploiting the channel diversity at both layers of precoding. We derive closed-form expressions for the proposed unnormalized LSFP scheme and achievable SE under local maximum ratio (MR) precoding and the proposed power control policies. Through analytical and simulation results, we demonstrate that the proposed unnormalized LSFP schemes significantly improve worst-case SE and ensure better fairness among users.</description></item><item><title>Multipath Parameter Optimization for Improving Accuracy of Ray-Tracing-Based Received Power Prediction in Industrial Environments</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10844579</link><description>Wireless propagation channel modeling plays a crucial role in the design and planning of wireless networks. Ray-tracing (RT) method is a widely used site-specific approach to calculate the propagation channel for a given geometry of an environment. Due to the high-frequency approximation used in RT, it suffers from errors in the calculated received power especially at low frequencies where objects may be on the same order or smaller than the wavelength. In this paper, we propose to reduce this error by attenuating the calculated received power depending on the size of the reflecting or diffracting object with respect to wavelength. We also propose two approaches to perform optimization of the algorithm parameters using measured training data. The proposed algorithms are trained and evaluated using measurement data taken in an actual factory environment at five different center frequencies in the sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands. Results showed that the proposed algorithm managed to significantly reduce the RMSE of received power from 11.6 dB to 5.9 dB for the 922 MHz band, and to below 3 dB for the 2.4 GHz and higher bands.</description></item><item><title>Radio Environment Map Reconstruction via Tensor Completion: Bayesian and Semantic Approaches</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856423</link><description>The radio environment map (REM) is one of the representations of the wireless environments, which consists of the spectrum data and enables the users to understand the electromagnetic situation in temporal, spectral and spatial domains. Generally, the observations of the spectrum data are incomplete due to the insufficient acquisition capability, and even the observed ones could be corrupted by some interferences and white noises. In this paper, we model the REM in all domains using the tensor notation, and propose a Bayesian and a deep-learning approaches to complete the spectrum map from the incomplete and corrupted observed spectrum data. In the first approach, by using the Tucker decomposition on the spectrum tensor, a hierarchical Bayesian framework is modeled to characterize the core tensor, the factor matrices, and the other nuisances. These nodes and their distribution parameters serve as the latent variables in the model. The variational Bayesian method is adopted to compute the posterior probabilities in an iterative manner. Regarding the low-rank property and the correlation of the spectrum, an adaptive compressed tensor decomposition algorithm is proposed to denoise the recovered spectral map in each iteration. In the second approach, the spectrum blanks are initialized by the linear interpolation to obtain the initial complete spectrum tensor. We use the Vision Transformer to solve a semantic segmentation problem in order to identify the semantic regions of the spectrum map in which the power of one emitter dominates. Then, the tensor completion is performed in the individual semantic tensor using the proposed compression algorithm. At last, the simulation results show that both the proposed approaches outperform the existing ones. We further observe that the semantic approach outperforms the Bayesian one for the sparse emitter scenarios while the Bayesian approach exhibits better recovery accuracy as the density of the emitters increases in the normalized mean square error.</description></item><item><title>Truthful Mechanism for Resource Allocation and Pricing in Vehicle-Assisted Mobile Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10892012</link><description>Mobile edge computing (MEC) provides stable and powerful computing services, and vehicle computing provides rich sensing services. Therefore, we develop vehicle-assisted mobile edge computing (VAMEC), integrating MEC and vehicle computing to maximize their advantages and broaden their applications. We address the resource allocation and pricing problem in VAMEC, in which the vehicle, as a resource provider, collaborates with the MEC servers to provide services to users. To enable MEC servers and vehicles to work in cooperation, we propose a mixed auction model that consists of two-step auctions: the first one-way auction and the second double auction. We consider three types of users based on their characteristics, where users participate in different auctions depending on the types. Users and vehicles are self-interested and may submit untrue values to harm the system's profits. Therefore, we propose the overall truthfulness for the mixed auction model, that is users or vehicles that cannot obtain higher utility by declaring untrue values regardless of which auction they participate in. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study proposing the overall truthfulness and showing how to design the mechanism that achieves it. We then propose an overall truthfulness mechanism and show it achieves individual rationality, budget balance, and consumer sovereignty. Simulation results indicate that the proposed mechanism can increase social welfare by at least 24%, compared with other mechanisms.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Battery Health Prognostics Using Time-Frequency Feature Maps and Spatial-Temporal Neural Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10839588</link><description>Lithium-ion batteries have been widely used in various application scenarios, acting as the heart of power storage systems. Reliable prognostics and health management (PHM) play essential roles in the safe operation and reliable maintenance of battery systems. Within this context, a data-driven method based on time-frequency feature maps and spatial-temporal neural networks is proposed for state-of-health estimation and cycle-to-knee prediction. First, raw data is acquired from partial charging curves of different fast-charging protocols to better align with real-world application scenarios. Second, to make full use of frequency domain information, the time-frequency feature maps are generated through continuous wavelet transformation. Then, spatial-temporal information is mapped to battery state-of-health and cycle-to-knee through a convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory network sequentially. The fusion of spatial-temporal features and the organization done by the attention mechanism contribute to improving battery PHM accuracy. Finally, experiments conducted on LFP/graphite A123 batteries under different fast-charging protocols indicate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. In addition, the ablation experiments are carried out to demonstrate the necessity of each model component. Experimental results show that using time-frequency feature images significantly enhances accuracy, and each component plays a pivotal role in enhancing the overall performance.</description></item><item><title>Energy-Efficient Power Control in D2D Networks: A Distributed ADMM Approach With Dynamic Penalty Coefficient</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10843323</link><description>Device-to-device (D2D) communication plays an important role in future networks due to the explosive growth in Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The surge of mobile devices necessitates higher data transmission rates and resource utilization efficiency. To address the requirements, developing effective power control algorithms is crucial to improve network performance and reduce energy consumption. In this work, we propose a distributed power control scheme based on the combination of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm and the successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm. With the aim of maximizing energy efficiency, the original problem is decomposed into multiple convex subproblems through SCA, and the distributed optimization of ADMM is used to solve each subproblem, thus making the solution of the problem more efficient. In particular, a dynamic penalty coefficient strategy is also developed to improve the convergence performance of the distributed algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that compared with centralized power control methods, the proposed method can achieve similar optimal values and effectively distribute the computational load to each device, which can support the optimization design and implementation of future D2D communication systems.</description></item><item><title>Fluid Antenna-Assisted Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10840319</link><description>This paper examines a fluid antenna (FA)-assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system. Unlike traditional SWIPT systems with fixed-position antennas (FPAs), our FA-assisted system enables dynamic reconfiguration of the radio propagation environment by adjusting the positions of FAs. This capability enhances both energy harvesting and communication performance. The system comprises a base station (BS) equipped with multiple FAs that transmit signals to an energy receiver (ER) and an information receiver (IR), both equipped with a single FA. Our objective is to maximize the communication rate between the BS and the IR while satisfying the harvested power requirement of the ER. This involves jointly optimizing the BS's transmit beamforming and the positions of all FAs. To address this complex convex optimization problem, we employ an alternating optimization (AO) approach, decomposing it into three sub-problems and solving them iteratively using first and second-order Taylor expansions. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed FA-assisted SWIPT system, demonstrating significant performance improvements over traditional FPA-based systems.</description></item><item><title>Covert Communications in Active-IOS Aided Uplink NOMA Systems With Full-Duplex Receiver</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10840245</link><description>In this paper, an active intelligent omni-surface (A-IOS) is deployed to aid uplink transmissions in a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system. In order to shelter the covert signal embedded in the superposition transmissions, a multi-antenna full-duplex (FD) receiver is utilized at the base-station to recover signal in addition to jamming the warden. With the aim of maximizing the covert rate, the FD transmit and receive beamforming, A-IOS refraction and reflection beamforming, NOMA transmit power, and FD jamming power are jointly optimized. To tackle the non-convex covert rate maximization problem subject to the highly coupled system parameters, an alternating optimization algorithm is designed to iteratively solve the decoupled sub-problems of optimizing the system parameters. The optimal solutions for the sub-problems of the NOMA transmit power and FD jamming power optimizations are derived in closed-form. To tackle the rank-one constrained non-convex fractional programming of the A-IOS beamforming and FD beamforming, a penalized Dinkelbach transformation approach is proposed to resort to the optimal solutions via semidefinite programming. Numerical results clarify that the deployment of the A-IOS significantly improves the covert rate compared with the passive-IOS aided uplink NOMA system. It is also found that the proposed scheme provides better covert communication performance with the optimized NOMA transmit power and FD jamming power compared with the benchmark schemes.</description></item><item><title>Max-Min Fairness for Uplink Rate-Splitting Multiple Access With Finite Blocklength</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10839617</link><description>In this letter, we investigate the performance of Max Minimum Fairness (MMF) for uplink Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) in short-packet communications.

To tackle this problem, we propose a Successive Convex Approximation (SCA)-based approach. Additionally, we introduce a low-complexity scheme to design the decoding order at the receiver. Numerical results show that RSMA outperforms conventional transmission schemes such as Non-orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) in terms of MMF.</description></item><item><title>Maximizing Energy Charging for UAV-Assisted MEC Systems With SWIPT</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10852192</link><description>A Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) scheme with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is proposed in this paper. Unlike existing MEC-WPT schemes that disregard the downlink period for returning computing results to the ground equipment (GEs), our proposed scheme actively considers and capitalizes on this period. By leveraging the SWIPT technique, the assistant UAV can simultaneously transmit energy and the computing results during the downlink period. In this scheme, our objective is to maximize the remaining energy among all GEs by jointly optimizing computing task scheduling, UAV transmit and receive beamforming, BS receive beamforming, GEs' transmit power and power splitting ratio for information decoding, time scheduling, and UAV trajectory. We propose an alternating optimization algorithm that utilizes the semidefinite relaxation (SDR), singular value decomposition (SVD), and fractional programming (FP) methods to effectively solve the non-convex problem. Numerous experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Hybrid NOMA-TDMA Scheme for Wireless Federated Learning Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10845191</link><description>To address the straggler problem in wireless federated learning (WFL) networks, a novel hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) - time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme is proposed, where not only local model training and uploading of different users are performed in parallel, but also the model uploading of different users is performed in a hybrid NOMA-TDMA manner. Particularly, users that complete their local training form dynamic NOMA groups across different time slots in a TDMA fashion to upload their models efficiently. The latency per training round minimization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the user scheduling, time allocation, computing frequency allocation, and energy allocation. An efficient algorithm, combining one-dimensional search and successive convex approximation, is developed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can outperform the state-of-the-art NOMA and TDMA schemes under various system parameter setups.</description></item><item><title>RIS-Aided Non-Cooperative Multi-Base Station Multi-User ISAC Scheme</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10839635</link><description>Multi-base station (MB) serving multi-user (MU) would be the most important scenario in the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scheme. However, removing MB interference (MBI) and MU interference (MUI) requires intricate MB cooperation, which results in a nontrivial overhead. In this paper, we propose to tackle MB and MU interference (MBMUI) by minimizing the sum of the received power at both communication and sensing receivers while keeping the amplitude of the signal of interest with a single reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). Specifically, we build the cell-free RIS-aided ISAC transmission model and then derive a closed-form RIS beamformer to minimize MBMUI. Simulation results show that a single RIS can significantly minimize MBMUI while maintaining multi-path phase alignment and achieving a better signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of sensing and communication than the existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Guard Ring Designs on Photovoltaic Energy Harvesting Silicon LSIs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10953864</link><description>This study explores strategies for safeguarding complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) field-effect-transistors (FETs) and PN-diode against bulk carrier contamination for energy harvesting applications. Energy harvesting processes can generate excessive carriers within the bulk region, which can penetrate the PMOS region from the p(P-Sub)/n(NWell) junction or nmosfet without triple-well. To address this problem, this study investigated the effectiveness of a guard ring structure in protecting cmosfets and PN-diode by recombining carriers in their vicinities. The formation of unpassivated metals around cmosfets serves as a catalyst for carrier elimination before they penetrate the NWell region of a pmosfet or the nmosfet itself, thereby improving the off states of both FETs. For a PN diode, the smaller off-current and lower threshold voltage obtained are advantageous for low-power consumption. However, such guard ring also degrades the performance of a photovoltaic (PV) cell by recombining the carriers needed by the cell to generate power. The experimental study of PV cells w/back-surface-field (BSF) and w/o BSF revealed that the former reduced the $V_{\text{OC}}$ of the cell with and that caution is required when forming a guard ring nearby the PV cell.</description></item><item><title>Improved Lead Halide Perovskite Films and Devices Using Hot-Flow-Assisted Annealing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10930950</link><description>Physical and chemical controlling of the lead halide perovskite films is crucial to minimize defects and improve overall performance and stability of perovskite solar cells.

A hot dry airflow of 15 L/min improves the power conversion efficiency from 13.56% to 15.31%, with approximately 4.3% and 10.4% enhancement of fill factor and short-circuit current density, respectively. However, increasing the rate of dry airflow leads to large voids, which is a critical concern for leakage current and performance degradation.</description></item><item><title>Power Rating of a Novel Micro-CPV Module Concept and Operational Influences</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10938951</link><description>Micro-concentrating photovoltaic (micro-CPV) technology has the potential to contribute to the energy transition, facilitating the shift toward more sustainable and renewable energy sources by combining minimal carbon footprint and energy demand with low levelized cost of electricity. Micro-CPV modules utilize direct normal irradiance to convert sunlight into electrical power, necessitating precise solar tracking. The performance of these modules is influenced by their alignment toward the sun and prevailing outdoor conditions during outdoor operation. The spectral conditions, along with the ambient temperature, irradiance, and wind speed, influence the current&#8211;voltage characteristics of multijunction solar cells and the optical behavior of the lens. We have developed a novel micro-CPV module concept, which is based on low-cost and high-throughput manufacturing processes. In this work, we present a prototype module in a 10 &#215; 6 array configuration (205-cm2 aperture area, submodule class). We discuss outdoor measurements recorded over one year and the influences of various outdoor conditions. In an IEC62670-3 power rating, efficiencies of 36.0 &#177; 0.4% and 33.0 &#177; 0.4% at concentrator standard test conditions and concentrator standard operating conditions, respectively, are determined. Highest efficiencies, about 0.4% higher than at standard conditions, were attained at a more red-rich spectrum, namely at a spectral matching ratio SMR12 of 0.94 &#177; 0.03. Using measurements at different temperatures, we show that the planoconvex silicone-on-glass primary lens has a negligible temperature dependence. Changes in the module performance over the course of one year are discussed. Despite employing commercially available low-cost components and high-throughput processes, no significant degradation was observed during the first year of operation.</description></item><item><title>Parameter Translation for Photovoltaic Single-Diode Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10893713</link><description>In this article, we recommend methods to translate parameters between the PVsyst and California Energy Commission (CEC) single-diode models.

We compare three approaches for translation and evaluate agreement between models using 21 unique modules of monocrystalline and polycrystalline silicon technologies and six climate datasets. The recommended approach yields the lowest normalized root-mean-square error for all module technologies, never exceeding 0.58% of rated power. Annual energy yields agree within 1.09% for all modules when using the optimization method. The recommended method will be proposed for inclusion in pvlib-python.</description></item><item><title>Photovoltaic Module Spectral Mismatch Losses Due to Cell-Level EQE Variation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10925465</link><description>Understanding the impact of variation in the solar spectrum on photovoltaic (PV) device output is critical for accurate and reliable PV performance modeling. While previous studies have examined these spectral effects extensively at the module level, this study examines the spectral impact at the cell level and how subsequent current mismatch can influence module-level output. Cell-level external quantum efficiency (EQE) data from 11 new commercial PV modules are analyzed. The module power output, as determined by the spectral mismatch factor of the module-limiting cell, is computed using the measured cell EQE data in conjunction with gridded meteorological and spectral irradiance data simulated at an approximately 20 $\mathbf{\mathrm{km}}$ resolution across the contiguous USA over one year. This study finds only a small variation in annualized module output of around 0.2% as a result of intramodule EQE variation. However, these losses exhibit significant seasonality, varying by up to around four times the annualized energy difference on a month-to-month basis. The seasonality of the energy loss has implications for subannual PV performance analysis applications such as capacity testing.</description></item><item><title>Hail Damage Investigation in Heterojunction Silicon Photovoltaic Modules: A Real-World Case Study</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10896611</link><description>Most photovoltaic (PV) modules are guaranteed for 25&#8211;30 years. However, severe climatic events, particularly hail, can lead premature damage. In this article, a residential PV system in Padova, Italy, was studied after exposure to a severe storm with hailstones up to 16 cm in diameter, which is more than two times larger than the standard size of test stones employed for module validation (7.5 cm, as per IEC 61215-2-2021). The goals are: 1) to demonstrate the relevance of hail testing beyond what currently required by the standards; 2) to demonstrate the presence of latent damage even in the absence of broken glass or of reduced performance; and 3) to discuss the associated risks. Forward bias electroluminescence (EL) and infrared (IR) radiation investigations were conducted in dark to minimize the impact of environmental influences. In the worst case, complete glass breakage results in solar cell fragmentation, which induces nonuniformity in current flow and thermal radiation, increasing losses, compromising electrical insulation, and requiring immediate replacement. In addition, dark and outdoor light current&#8211;voltage characteristics reveal significant decrease in output power, as well as increased leakage current. Remarkably, latent or invisible damage, detectable by reduced EL intensity and higher IR radiation, poses safety issues even in modules whose protective glass withstood the mechanical impact of hail. Modules with intact glass exhibit a decreased shunt resistance, with a negligible reduction in the output power with respect to a completely intact module. The results underline the necessity of inspecting the entire PV system following hailstorms, to detect any latent damages and promptly replace the damaged modules, even in the absence of glass breakage or reduction in the output power, to ensure long-term reliability.</description></item><item><title>Experimental and Simulated Performance Evaluation of Bifacial Photovoltaic Floating System With a Horizontal Single-Axial Tracker</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10944767</link><description>The rapid expansion of photovoltaics is driven by significant reduction in costs. However, given the surface requirements for photovoltaic development, utilizing water surfaces for floating photovoltaic (FPV) systems presents a promising solution. To enhance the cost-effectiveness of these systems, bifacial modules and tracking systems can be employed. While numerous experimental studies have evaluated the performance of fixed-configuration FPVs, floating tracking configurations remain underexplored. In addition, various simulation tools offer insights into different configurations, but their different assumptions often yield inconsistent results. This study focuses on the experimental evaluation of a horizontal axis tracking bifacial FPV (HT-bFPV) system. Over one year, the HT-bFPV system was monitored at the FPV test bed of &#8220;Enel Innovation Hub &amp; Lab&#8221; in Catania, Italy. The experimental results were compared with simulated outcomes using two software tools, to assess their precision in calculating the HT-bFPV performances. The results reveal that the module temperature of the HT-bFPV system is 3 &#176;C to 6 &#176;C lower than the temperatures calculated by System Advisor Model and Photovoltaic system software, respectively. The yearly reference yield of 2139 kWh/kW produced a final yield of 1801 kWh/kW. The yearly performance ratio of the HT-bFPV system was 0.86, which improved by 1.8% when adjusted for temperature. The simulation results closely matched the experimental data, validating the system's performance. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the HT-bFPV system can produce up to 13.3% more energy with more potential in sites with higher latitudes compared with a similar fixed system.</description></item><item><title>A Noniterative Method of Estimating Parameter Values for the PVsyst Version 6 Single-Diode Model From IEC 61853-1 Matrix Measurements</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10955246</link><description>Photovoltaic performance modeling accuracy depends heavily on the quality of the input parameters. When relying on generic PAN files and datasheets, the input parameters often fail to accurately capture the behavior of every module with the same model number. Therefore, there is a need for methods to generate more accurate input data. In this study, we present a method for determining parameter values for the PVsyst version 6 photovoltaic module performance model from performance test measurements following the IEC 61853-1:2011 standard. The method is intentionally noniterative to facilitate implementation and reproducibility. We apply the method to datasets from 15 modules of various photovoltaic technologies (SHJ, TOPCon, IBC, PERC, n-PERT, Al-BSF, and CdTe), reproducing the original maximum power measurements with root-mean-squared (RMS) accuracy within 0.5% in all cases.

Therefore, a novel hosting capacity evaluation method for distributed photovoltaics (PVs) connected in a power system based on the maximum likelihood estimation of harmonics (MLE) is proposed in this study. First, using the likelihood function from the MLE method, the harmonic parameters of distributed photovoltaic injections are optimally estimated, allowing for the accurate assessment of harmonic outputs during photovoltaic grid connections. Furthermore, a harmonic partitioning method is devised; it characterizes the connection degree between nodes in the grid-connected system, and it divides the distribution network into regions. The scenario number in the estimation of hosting capacities is effectively reduced. Finally, a comparison is carried out relative to the conventional hosting capacity. The assessment method proposed in this study considers the harmonic access in the actual distributed PV grid-connected system. An improved harmonic partitioning method is established based on the harmonic injection amount. The evaluation of PV hosting capacities in the region ensures accuracy and reduces calculation times. They provide references for the access capacity of the distribution network.</description></item><item><title>A Hierarchical 3-D Physical Design Method for Ultralarge-Scale Logic-on-Memory CGRA Chip</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10893709</link><description>Face-to-face bonded 3-D (F2F 3D) technology, with the potential to significantly reduce chip area while enhancing performance, stands as one of the most promising ways to extend Moore&#8217;s Law. However, current 3-D physical design flows are often modifications of 2-D design flows and rely on technical personnel to manually modify technical files. Furthermore, existing research on 3-D design flow primarily focuses on module implementation, with very few studies addressing hierarchical design methods for large-scale chips. In this article, we first introduce a 3-D physical design flow which concurrently optimizes the timing of both the logic tier and the memory tier, achieving synchronized physical design for both tiers. Then, we develop a bottom-up hierarchical 3-D physical design flow to extend the 3-D design flow to large-scale chip design. Through coordinated power planning, clock tree design, and interconnect unit design, we enhance the power, performance, and area (PPA) metrics of the entire chip. Using our RTL-to-GDS physical design flow, we successfully implemented a 28-nm CMOS logic-on-memory (LoM) 3-D coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture (CGRA) chip with over 50 million gates. Experimental results demonstrate that our 3-D flow improves timing by 16.1% while reducing voltage drop by 38.6% compared to the 2-D design. In addition, the power-delay product (PDP) of the 3-D chip decreases by 10.2%, showcasing better performance.</description></item><item><title>A Time-Domain Frequency Analyzer Based on Goertzel Algorithm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891958</link><description>This article presents a novel time-domain implementation of the second-order Goertzel frequency analyzer, which can be extended for use in infinite impulse response (IIR)/finite impulse response (FIR) filters. A set of time-domain arithmetic circuits, including a one-step time register (TR), time amplifier (TA), time adder, and unit delay operator ( ${z}^{-1}$ ), are introduced to overcome the limitations of conventional time-domain filters. The working principles and nonidealities of each block are analyzed and compared with the existing methods. The proposed filter is implemented in a 180-nm CMOS process with a 0.9-V supply voltage. The designed frequency analyzer is tunable to extract the amplitude and phase angle of signals up to 400 Hz. Simulation results, targeting a 280-Hz signal at a 19.88-kHz sampling frequency, demonstrate that the filter can detect the amplitude and phase of a voltage signal in the time domain with an error below 5%. The filter achieves a resolution of  $76.7~\text {dBV/s}$ , consumes less than  $24~\mu \text {W}$  of power, and the estimated silicon area is almost  $0.828~\mathrm {mm}^{2}$ .</description></item><item><title>A Nanopower EEG Low-Pass Filter Using Current-Sharing Vertical Differential Pairs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10900603</link><description>A follower-based  ${g}_{m} - C$  low-pass filter that employs CMOS vertical source-couple-pair (VSCP) transconductors is proposed for practical use in EEG acquisition systems. The VSCP transconductor operates as a  ${g}_{m}$  cell with current sharing and linearity enhancement features. It is applied in the first- and second-order  ${g}_{m} - C$  sections cascaded to form a third-order low-pass filter targeting a 150-Hz bandwidth. To mitigate the effects of biasing current source mismatch, dynamic element matching (DEM) is optionally applied to the relevant biasing current source pairs, resulting in second harmonic distortion (HD2) and noise suppression. Implemented in a 0.18- $\mu $ m process, the proposed filter consumes 16.3-nW power from a 1.2-V supply. Thanks to the DEM and VSCPs, the filter achieves a 150-mVP linear input range [measured at 1% total harmonic distortion (THD)], whereas the input-referred noise of  $43~\mu \text {V}_{\text {rms}}$  is obtained leading to a filter dynamic range (DR) of 65.15 dB. Overall performance comparisons with other recent nanopower filters indicate that the figure of merit (FoM) of this proposed filter is comparable, while the linear input range is larger.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Ripple DIDO DC&#8211;DC Hybrid Interface With Optimal-Hysteresis-Controlled MPPT for TEH</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10905040</link><description>This article proposes a dual-input-dual-output (DIDO) dc-dc hybrid interface for thermoelectric energy harvesting (TEH) applications with high efficiency and low output ripple. A load-first ordered power distributive control (OPDC) strategy is used to recycle the excess thermoelectric energy (TE) in time. Utilizing the digital adaptive on-time (DAOT) technique, the output ripple can be reduced during battery (BAT) power supply. A hysteresis-controlled maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technique is proposed to track the variation of the internal resistance  $\text {R}_{\text {TE}}$  of the thermoelectric generator (TEG), which achieves high tracking efficiency over a wide  $\text {R}_{\text {TE}}$  range. By trading the tracking efficiency and loss off in the MPPT, an optimization method for hysteresis window is proposed. In addition, an analog zero-crossing detector (ZCD) without calibration is adopted to improve the end-to-end efficiency. The proposed hybrid interface is realized by 0.18- $\mu $ m standard CMOS process with a core area of  $0.91 \times 0.61$  mm2. Measured results show that the proposed interface can harvest TE over the  $\text {R}_{\text {TE}}$  variation range of 1&#8211; $1000 \; \Omega $ , with a peak tracking efficiency of 99.6% and an output ripple as low as 35 mV. It also achieves a peak end-to-end efficiency of 87% and an output power range of  $1 \; \mu $ W &#8722;10 mW.</description></item><item><title>A 1-MS/s 64-Channel Data Acquisition System With Full-Scale Input Range for Area-Sensitive Application Achieved 165.3-dB FoMS/Ch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10905056</link><description>This article presents a novel data acquisition system (DAS) designed for area-sensitive applications, including automotive instrumentation, launch vehicles, and satellites, which require efficient area utilization and full-swing input/output capabilities for diverse sensors. Traditional approaches to achieving full swing, such as using CMOS input transistors or generating negative voltage via charge pumps, either result in high harmonic distortion (HD) or complicate chip design. To address these challenges, we propose a complementary analog front-end (CAFE) that shifts the input signal by a fixed voltage, enabling operation in a more linear region while employing feedback to minimize HD. The system incorporates two analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) that convert the input signal and subtract the digital output of the common mode voltage ( $V_{\text {CM}}$ ), facilitating effective data fusion for complete AD conversion. Fabricated using a 180-nm 1P5M BCD process, the DAS consumes 118.81 mW from a 5.0-V power supply, providing 64 channels in a compact area of  $4.0\times 3.2$  mm. At a sampling rate of 1 MS/s, it achieves an effective number of bits (ENoBs) of 13.16, with a power consumption of 1.856 mW per channel and a dynamic range of 83.3 dB, resulting in an impressive figure of merit per channel (FoMS/Ch) of 165.3 dB.</description></item><item><title>A 12-bit 2-GS/s Pipeline ADC in 28-nm CMOS With Linear-Error Self-Calibration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10929682</link><description>This article discusses a 12-bit 2-GS/s pipeline analog-to-digital converter (ADC). A self-calibration technique is employed to correct linear errors due to capacitor mismatches and interstage gain errors (IGEs). To counteract the effects of power supply and temperature variations, the first three stages of the ADC are equipped with least-mean-squares (LMS) IGE background calibrations, enhanced by the injection of a 1-bit dither into these stages. The computational engines designed for background calibration were reused for self-calibration, simplifying the overall design. An improved integrated input buffer drives the ADC, achieving a bandwidth of approximately 6.3 GHz, which is essential for high-speed data acquisition and processing. Moreover, a low-power operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) and reference buffer, both operating on a 1.0-V supply, are implemented to minimize the chip&#8217;s power consumption. The 12-bit pipeline prototype ADC, fabricated using a 28-nm CMOS process, operates at 2-GS/s with a 1.0-Vpp input signal. It delivers a signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) of 58.92 dB and a spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of 82.23 dB. The ADC core consumes only 180 mW, resulting in a Schreier figure of merits (FoMs) of 156.4 dB.</description></item><item><title>A 2-Lane DAC-/ADC-Based 2 &#215; 2 MIMO PAM-4 MMSE-DFE Wireline Transceiver With FEXT Cancellation on RFSoC Platform</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947618</link><description>This article presents a 2-lane  $2 \times 2$  multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) 4-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) minimum mean-squared-error (MMSE)-decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) with far-end crosstalk (FEXT) cancellation for digital-to-analog converter (DAC)-/analog-to-digital converter (ADC)-based high-speed serial links. The receiver (RX) datapath is designed with a 15-tap MIMO feedforward equalizer (FFE) and a one-tap MIMO DFE with the least mean square (LMS), enabling adaptation to channel variation while maintaining the MMSE setting. The RX digital signal processor (DSP) place and route (PnR) in a 28-nm CMOS is estimated to consume 201 mW/lane at a 56-Gb/s/lane data rate while occupying a 0.5-mm2/lane silicon area. We further implement a real-time evaluation platform to verify the functionality of the MIMO PAM-4 MMSE-DFE with rapid bit-error-rate (BER) testing on RFSoC. The measurement result demonstrates that the MIMO MMSE-DFE significantly improves BER performance from 2.75e&#8722;3 to 1.31e&#8722;7 compared with equalization without FEXT cancellation when communicating over a channel exhibiting 12.4-dB insertion loss (IL) and 13.2-dB IL-to-crosstalk ratio (ICR) at Nyquist.</description></item><item><title>An Area and Energy-Efficient Systolic Array Accelerator Architecture for Deep Neural Networks Using Stochastic Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10937936</link><description>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used to handle various intelligent tasks. With the increased model size, the DNNs&#8217; hardware accelerators are challenging the higher area overhead and energy consumption. Stochastic computing (SC) has recently been considered for implementing DNNs and reducing hardware consumption. However, many current SC-based DNN accelerators fail to balance accuracy, performance, and resource overhead. In addition, their limited scalability and flexibility restrict their use in edge devices. In this article, we design an area and energy-efficient DNN accelerator architecture using SC. We propose an SC-binary hybrid processing unit with piecewise shift compensation without significant additional hardware overhead increment to improve the SC accuracy. To balance performance and resource overhead, we conduct a design space exploration (DSE) from an overall architectural perspective. An experimental platform with both software and hardware for SC-based DNNs is established. The software simulation results demonstrate that the best accuracy of the designed SC-DNN on the CIFAR-10 is 91.9%, which is 3.2% higher than that of the previous SC-DNN work. The VLSI implementation of the hardware is synthesized using the TSMC 28-nm CMOS process. Results show that compared to the binary computing counterpart, our design achieves  $2.7\times $  area efficiency and  $3.4\times $  energy efficiency. Compared to other SC-DNN accelerator designs, our design can provide  $5.3\times $  area efficiency and  $7.3\times $  energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Xpikeformer: Hybrid Analog-Digital Hardware Acceleration for Spiking Transformers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10957839</link><description>The integration of neuromorphic computing and transformers through spiking neural networks (SNNs) offers a promising path to energy-efficient sequence modeling, with the potential to overcome the energy-intensive nature of the artificial neural network (ANN)-based transformers. However, the algorithmic efficiency of SNN-based transformers cannot be fully exploited on GPUs due to architectural incompatibility. This article introduces Xpikeformer, a hybrid analog-digital hardware architecture designed to accelerate SNN-based transformer models. The architecture integrates analog in-memory computing (AIMC) for feedforward and fully connected layers, and a stochastic spiking attention (SSA) engine for efficient attention mechanisms. We detail the design, implementation, and evaluation of Xpikeformer, demonstrating significant improvements in energy consumption and computational efficiency. Through image classification tasks and wireless communication symbol detection tasks, we show that Xpikeformer can achieve inference accuracy comparable to the GPU implementation of ANN-based transformers. Evaluations reveal that Xpikeformer achieves a  $13\times $  reduction in energy consumption at approximately the same throughput as the state-of-the-art (SOTA) digital accelerator for ANN-based transformers. In addition, Xpikeformer achieves up to  $1.9\times $  energy reduction compared to the optimal digital ASIC projection of SOTA SNN-based transformers.</description></item><item><title>Flex-PE: Flexible and SIMD Multiprecision Processing Element for AI Workloads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10950103</link><description>The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) models, from deep neural networks (DNNs) to transformers/large-language models (LLMs), demands flexible hardware solutions to meet diverse execution needs across edge and cloud platforms. Existing accelerators lack unified support for multiprecision arithmetic and runtime-configurable activation functions (AFs). This work proposes Flex-PE, a single instruction, multiple data (SIMD)-enabled multiprecision processing element that efficiently integrates multiply-and-accumulate operations with configurable AFs using unified hardware, including Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU, and SoftMax.

The proposed PHY is based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and can dynamically augment OFDM with a finite impulse response (FIR) low-pass filter to improve the out-of-band emissions (OOBE). To make these adaptations intelligently, we employ multiarmed bandit (MAB)-based online learning algorithms, specifically upper confidence bound with control variate (UCB-CV). UCB-CV enhances traditional UCB by incorporating additional information such as interference level and transmit power, allowing it to manage interference more effectively. These algorithms are integrated into the PHY of an FPGA-based OFDM transceiver on the Zynq system-on-chip (SoC), facilitating real-time decision-making based on side-channel interference and other parameters. Our comparative analysis highlights the enhanced performance of the UCB-CV algorithm over the traditional UCB in terms of reducing the bit-error rate (BER) and managing interference more effectively. Unlike the traditional UCB, UCB-CV leverages side information through a control variate approach, incorporating the coefficient of variation (CV) into reward estimation to better handle interference. Additionally, we underline the advantages of filtered-OFDM (FOFDM) compared to standard OFDM. Notably, FOFDM significantly reduces OOBE by 20&#8211;75 dBW/Hz and improves BER. In environments with high interference, UCB-CV achieves a throughput improvement of 29.54% compared to UCB.</description></item><item><title>A 25-GHz PLL Achieving 8-ns Phase-Shifting Time With Double-Path Modulation Scheme</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10876796</link><description>This article presents a reference phase-shifting architecture (PSA) based on a phase-locked loop (PLL) and a digital-to-time converter (DTC). The double-path phase modulation scheme (DPMS) is proposed to accelerate the settling time of the reference PSA. Off-chip calibration is added to mitigate the effects of nonlinearity in the DPMS process. Additionally, a DTC with improved retiming is proposed to reduce phase-shifting errors. The reference PSA with the DPMS is designed and fabricated in a commercial 22-nm CMOS technology. It occupies 0.048-mm2 active area and 12.8-mW dc power consumption. It achieves a 360&#176; phase tuning range with a resolution of 1.26&#176; at 24.75 GHz. The rms and peak phase errors are 1.38&#176; and 2.6&#176;, respectively. With the proposed DPMS, the settling time of reference PSA is significantly reduced from more than  $1~\mu $  s to less than 10 ns. Moreover, the PLL with DTC features a phase noise of &#8722;112.1 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset from 24.75 GHz and a 79.7-fs jitter integrated from 10 kHz to 30 MHz with 250-MHz reference clock.

However, it faces the problem of deteriorating read performance and energy consumption due to decreased reliability. Low-density parity-check code (LDPC) is typically adopted as an error correction code (ECC) to encode data and provide fault tolerance. To reduce the cost, LDPC with a high code rate is always adopted. However, LDPC will lead to read retry operations when the accessed data are not successfully decoded, and such retry-induced performance degradation is serious, especially for modern high-density flash memory. In this work, a reliability-aware differential ECC (READECC) approach is proposed to reduce redundancy protection and storage cost of LDPC with a low code rate and optimize the read performance. The basic idea is to adopt LDPC with a suitable code rate considering both data access characteristics and flash reliability characteristics. First, hot reads are identified based on the frequency of being accessed. Second, based on the reliability variation characteristics, the life of flash memory is divided into three reliability periods. As the reliability period shifts, the code rate of the LDPC adjusts adaptively to minimize redundancy protection. Third, an adaptive-sized logical page approach is further proposed to support LDPC with strong error correction capability (a low code rate) with a low storage cost. Through careful design and evaluation on 3-D triple-level-cell nand flash memory, READECC achieves encouraging optimizations with a negligible cost.</description></item><item><title>A Robust Computing-in-Memory Macro With 2T1R1C Cells and Reused Capacitors for Successive-Approximation ADC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10905048</link><description>Computing-in-memory (CIM) has emerged as a practical paradigm to bypass the von Neumann bottleneck. However, traditional CIM schemes face challenges due to the nonideal characteristics of nonvolatile memory (NVM). To address this issue, this work provides a resistive random access memory (RRAM)-based CIM macro employing two-transistor-one-RRAM&#8211;one-capacitor (2T1R1C) cells, with capacitors reused for the successive-approximation analog-to-digital converter (SAR ADC). Single-level RRAM is utilized to mitigate resistance variation. The multiply-accumulate (MAC) operation is performed via the charge and discharge of capacitors, enhancing robustness across different process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) corners. The capacitors in 2T1R1C cells are repurposed as sampling capacitors to integrate the ADC with the array. A precision-adjustable SAR (PA-SAR) logic is proposed to generate partial sums at varying precision levels aligned with different input bits, optimizing energy efficiency while maintaining reliability. Our proposed 2T1R1C array features an average area of  $3.403~\mu $ m2 for each cell, which accounts for 87.46% of the total macro area. The total macro area is 1.020 mm2 with a capacity of 256 Kb, achieving an energy density of 0.201 TOPS/mm2. The PA-SAR logic boosts energy efficiency to 44.71 TOPS/W, marking a 38.55% improvement over conventional full-precision schemes.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient FPGA Implementation of Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10922212</link><description>Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) plays an important role in modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems, being extensively utilized in search engines, advertising, and recommendation systems. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), ANNS is increasingly finding applications in edge scenarios such as personal assistants. The demand for efficient and fast ANNS solutions is, therefore, more pressing than ever. In this article, we propose a scalable and efficient field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation of ANNS based on the inverted file with product quantization (IVF-PQ) algorithm, thus marking the first hardware implementation supporting up to 1024-D datasets.

In this article, we introduce a novel side-channel vulnerability that leaks data-dependent power variations through physical layer supply voltage coupling (PSVC). Unlike traditional power side-channel attacks, the proposed vulnerability allows an adversary to mount an attack and extract information without modifying the device. In addition, unlike existing power-based remote attacks on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), the PSVC vulnerability applies to both on-chip and on-board attacks. We assess the effectiveness of the PSVC vulnerability through three case studies, demonstrating several end-to-end attacks on general-purpose microcontrollers with varying adversary capabilities. These case studies provide evidence for the existence of the PSVC vulnerability, its applicability to on-chip as well as on-board side-channel attacks, and how it can eliminate the need for physical access to the target device, making it applicable to any off-the-shelf hardware. Our experiments also reveal that designing devices to operate at the lowest operational voltage significantly reduces the risk of PSVC side-channel vulnerability.</description></item><item><title>Sense and React: Self-Destructive Polymorphic Mechanism Against Voltage Tampered Active Physical Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981798</link><description>Secrets such as cryptographic keys and obfuscation keys are used in modern computing systems to protect the sensitive and private information as well as intellectual property (IP). During typical operations, they are stored in volatile memories, e.g., registers and SRAMs, which are vulnerable to active physical attacks whereby environmental parameters such as temperature, system clock, and supply voltage, are manipulated to extract information. A common way to protect assets against such attacks are sensors that detect active physical attacks and trigger the destruction of secrets. Often, this requires several thousand clock cycles to accomplish. On top of that, the detection and destruction mechanisms are implemented as separate circuitry, which can be identified and disabled by an attacker. In this article, active physical attacks based on supply voltage manipulation are considered. Storage elements, specifically latches and registers, are designed to change their behavior with supply voltage manipulation and automatically destroy their stored data in an integrated sense and response countermeasure. The ability of an electronic circuit to change its behavior under different environmental conditions is known as polymorphism and such circuits are called polymorphic circuits. In the proposed designs, a genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize polymorphic gates designed using two separate approaches, namely, multithreshold null convention logic (MTNCL) and voltage-controlled polymorphism termed in this article as Non-MTNCL. These polymorphic gates are used to design polymorphic latches and registers and both approaches are compared using power, performance, area overhead, reliability criteria, and application in cryptographic benchmarks. It is observed that while the GA-optimized MTNCL-based implementation has 75% less area overhead, the GA-optimized Non-MTNCL implementation is 14% more reliable according to simulation results. Apart from the simulations, proof-of-concept is further provided with an FPGA implementation.</description></item><item><title>ResiLogic: Leveraging Composability and Diversity to Design Fault and Intrusion Resilient Chips</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10934979</link><description>A long-standing challenge is the design of chips resilient to faults and glitches. Both fine-grained gate diversity and coarse-grained modular redundancy have been used in the past. However, these approaches have not been well-studied under other threat models where some stakeholders in the supply chain are untrusted. Increasing digital sovereignty tensions raise concerns regarding the use of foreign off-the-shelf tools and intellectual property (IP), or off-sourcing fabrication, driving research into the design of resilient chips under this threat model. This article addresses a threat model considering three pertinent attacks to resilience: distribution, zonal, and compound attacks. To mitigate these attacks, we introduce the ResiLogic framework that exploits Diversity by Composability: constructing diverse circuits composed of smaller diverse ones by design. This approach enables designers to develop circuits in the early stages of design without the need for additional redundancy in terms of space or cost. To generate diverse circuits, we propose a technique using E-Graphs with new rewrite definitions for diversity. Using this approach at different levels of granularity is shown to improve the resilience of circuit design in ResiLogic up to  $\times 5$  against the three considered attacks.</description></item><item><title>An Energy-Efficient FPGA Accelerator for Swin Transformer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10900605</link><description>Recently, transformers have shown strong performance in tasks such as computer vision and natural language processing.

On system level, a delay-based load-adaptive V $_{\text {ON}}$  generator is exploited in LASM at ultralight load. When the output ripple is kept below its maximum restriction, the switching loss of the converter is further minimized in LASM compared with prior operation modes, including PFM, pulse-skip modulation (PSM), multiple-sawtooth PWM (MSPWM), and deep green mode (DGM). On circuit level, a dynamic-biased dual-offset hysteresis comparator is proposed. Together with other blocks that can be disabled, the quiescent consumption of controller in LASM is reduced to only 14  $\mu $ W. Fabricated in a 130-nm BCD process, the proposed converter can provide a 1.8-V output with a power density of 4.11 W/mm2. It achieves a 93.2% peak efficiency, while the efficiency can be maintained above 86.4% in 1 mW&#8211;10 W ( $\times 10~000$ ) load range.</description></item><item><title>Machine-Learning-Based Ranking of Cell Layout Delay Considering Layout-Dependent Effects</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10922735</link><description>Cell layout generation plays a crucial role in design automation. The generated layout must not only adhere to design rules but also exhibit optimized performance in terms of factors such as delay, power, area, and cost. However, prior works often rely on metrics that fail to consider the layout-dependent effects (LDEs). Furthermore, evaluating the actual performance using commercial tools can be excessively time-consuming, especially when iteratively optimizing cell layouts. Therefore, this work proposes a new machine-learning(ML)-based ranking model to enable rapid performance ranking between layout candidates of standard cells. This model incorporates all LDEs in feature extraction, generating an ordered list of cell layouts, and evaluating only the top-K candidates for performance. The experiments show that this approach successfully identifies the optimal layout from ten benchmark cells, which are most used in intellectual property (IP) cores, in a sub-5 nm fin field-effect transistor (FinFET) industrial standard cell library, achieving a  $348\times $  speedup over the conventional flow.</description></item><item><title>Metastable-Dither-Based Digital Background Calibration of Interstage Gain Nonlinearity in Pipelined SAR ADC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10929642</link><description>A digital background calibration technique is proposed in this brief, utilizing comparator metastability to correct conversion errors from interstage gain errors and higher order nonlinearities for the first time.

The feed-forward path employs a pre-amplifier, hysteresis-detector, and differential charge pumps, while the linear path includes a recycling folded-cascode amplifier. An analysis is performed to study the amplifier&#8217;s settling error with and without the feed-forward path, and also the trade-off between the dead-zone width of the hysteresis detector and the amplifier&#8217;s settling speed. The assisted feed-forward path has improved the slew rate  $\times 2.5$ &#8211;800 V/ $\mu $ s, effective GBW by 15%, and dc gain by 16 dB at the expense of adding  $187.5~\mu $ A extra current consumption and  $1.25~\mu $ m2 extra silicon area. To prove the concept, the proposed amplifier is used as a multiplying digital-to-analog converter (MDAC) amplifier of an 8-bit pipeline analog-to-digital converter (ADC), and the ADC is fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process. The results reveal that the spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) and signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) performances are improved by 6&#8211;7 dB in the presence of the feed-forward path.</description></item><item><title>Design of a Compact Low-Power Sub-2.4-GHz Transceiver for Medical Band Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10887323</link><description>This article proposes a compact low-power sub-2.4-GHz transceiver (TRX) with a all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL)-based transmitter (TX) and a single-path phase-tracking receiver (RX) in a 40-nm CMOS process. To meet the requirements for low output power in the medical band as well as to reduce power consumption, a single-ended class-E power amplifier (PA) with a duty-cycle-controlled strategy is proposed. A fully integrated on-chip matching network is designed to satisfy the impedance matching criteria for the class-E PA. The issues of the 2nd-order and the 3rd-order harmonic suppression are resolved by a series resonator and a capacitor in parallel with a segmented transformer, respectively. In the RX, the on-chip transformer also serves as an input impedance matching network for the low-noise transconductance amplifier (LNTA), reducing the required transconductance through passive reverse voltage gain. The transformer is capable of suppressing noise. The structure of the matching network only requires one transformer and one inductor, thereby reducing the count of passive components. Additionally, it features an embedded transmitter/receiver (T/R) switch function without insertion loss. The proposed 8-port transformer makes the layout more flexible and compact. The TX consumes 2.27 mW at &#8722;10-dBm output power and 5.45 mW at 0 dBm. A 2nd-order harmonic distortion of &#8722;52.36 dBm and a 3rd-order harmonic distortion of &#8722;50.67 dBm are measured, respectively. The RX consumes 2.25 mW and achieves a sensitivity of &#8722;93 dBm. The proposed TRX with reused matching networks results in an active silicon area of only 0.48 mm2.</description></item><item><title>A Polar Phase-Tracking Receiver With Two-Point Injection Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10858183</link><description>This article describes a polar phase-tracking receiver (PT-RX) architecture that can work with various modulations including differential phase shift keying (DPSK), amplitude phase shift keying (APSK), and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). By employing a two-point injection method in a wideband digital phase-locked loop (DPLL), the proposed polar PT-RX performs various demodulations without requiring quadrature signal generation or a multi-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Compared with existing PT-RXs, the proposed architecture not only overcomes the trade-off between frequency pulling and image rejection but also provides the equivalent constant gain of a digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) for robust demodulation. A prototype 5.8-mW 2.4-GHz polar PT-RX is implemented in 65-nm CMOS and performs demodulations of 8-DPSK at 1.5 Mb/s, 16-QAM at 2 Mb/s and 32-APSK at 2.5 Mb/s, achieving a sensitivity of &#8722;81, - 68, and &#8722;64 dBm, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Simultaneous Dual-Carrier Transformer-Coupled Passive Mixer-First Receiver Front-End Supporting Blocker Suppression</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10915566</link><description>A high dynamic range N-path passive mixer-first receiver architecture capable of simultaneously down-converting two arbitrary bands through a single RF port is presented. The architecture consists of two passive mixers arranged in a series configuration with a transformer front-end to minimize cross-loading between mixers while still providing impedance transparency and associated interference suppression for both bands. A four-phase demonstration in a 16-nm FinFET process operating from 2.8 to 4.3 GHz achieved 6.8&#8211;9.7-dB noise figure (NF), 8.9-dBm out-of-band (OOB) blocker compression (B1dB), and 18.6-dBm OOB input-referred third-order intercept point (IIP3) with 25&#8211;28 mW of power consumption per channel. When one of the mixers and the corresponding LO are configured to target a blocker, up to 14.4-dBm OOB-B1dB and 27.6-dBm OOB-IIP3 is achieved. This article elaborates on the analysis and design of the initial prototype and presents a new eight-phase prototype using the same general architecture but with improved performance. The new design operating from 2.6 to 3.9 GHz achieves 4.0&#8211;7.6-dB NF, 12.5-dBm OOB-B1dB, and 22.1-dBm OOB-IIP3 with 42&#8211;47 mW of power consumption per channel.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Power Blocker-Tolerant Wideband Receiver With Bias-Tunable Mixer and Effective Switch Resistance Compensation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10852167</link><description>This article presents a mixer-first blocker-tolerant receiver (RX) with effective switch resistance ( ${R} _{\text {SW}}$ ) compensation and high-Q selectivity. By analyzing the impact of non-ideal 1/N LO duty cycle and effective  ${R} _{\text {SW}}$  on mixer-first RX, an effective  ${R} _{\text {SW}}$  compensation technique is proposed to mitigate noise figure (NF) and out-of-band (OB) third-order intercept point (IIP3) performance degradation caused by reduced LO conduction duty cycle at high frequencies. A bias-tunable mixer is then designed, enabling dynamic adjustment of the mixer&#8217;s bias voltage and improvement of the effective  ${R} _{\text {SW}}$  over the entire frequency band. It improves NF and OB-IIP3 performance at high frequencies with extremely low power consumption of LO drivers. In addition, the proposed RX achieves high-Q selectivity by combining an auxiliary N-path filter at RF and an analog finite-impulse-response (AFIR) filter at baseband (BB). The RX prototype, fabricated in a 55-nm CMOS process, achieves wideband tunable high-Q selectivity from 0.4 to 2.6 GHz with the double sideband (DSB) NF from 2.4 to 3.5 dB. The RX achieves +15.4-/19.2-dBm OB-IIP3 at 10-/80-MHz offset. When the &#8722;10-/0-dBm continuous-waveform (CW) blockers were injected at a 40-MHz offset, the DSB-NF only increased to 5.4/11.6 dB. Over the frequency range of interest, the total RX power consumption is 5.4&#8211;11.8 mW, with the LO driver requiring only 2.9 mW/GHz. The active chip area is 0.29 mm2.</description></item><item><title>A 25&#8211;31-GHz Compact True Power Detector With &gt;33-dB Dynamic Range and Intrinsic Phase Offset Compensation in 40-nm Bulk CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10858173</link><description>This article presents a compact mixer-based true power detector integrated within a Ka-band power amplifier (PA). By performing capacitive voltage sensing and inductive current sensing at the primary coil, the compact power detector eliminates the need for additional area-consuming passive components while still allowing the PA to maintain a single-ended antenna output. The control of magnetic coupling with the secondary coil is achieved by exploiting magnetic flux cancellation rather than increasing the physical distance between coils. The active mixer multiplying the voltage and current uses current bleeding technique that simultaneously suppresses the flicker noise and enhances linearity, leading to a state-of-art dynamic range. Without phase shifters or resistor termination, the overall power detector achieves intrinsic phase compensation by matching the delays between the voltage and current sensing paths. Fabricated in a 40-nm CMOS process, the power detector occupies a core area of  $3520~\mu $ m2 and covers a detectable power range from &#8722;18 to +15 dBm across 25&#8211;31 GHz with 12.1-mW power consumption.</description></item><item><title>A Ka-Band Doherty-Like Non-Load Modulated Power Amplifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10870389</link><description>This article describes a three-way power amplifier (PA) topology that achieves broadband power back-off (PBO) efficiency enhancement without using active load modulation on the Main PA or supply modulation. This allows the PA to avoid the classic trade-off between load modulation and bandwidth that is typical among Doherty PAs. Unlike Doherty PAs, the proposed PA has both its voltage and current drive profiles reach a maximum at PBO, which causes the impedance of the Main PA to be constant across the entire input drive. This is achieved with a novel parallel-series output matching network (OMN) that primarily utilizes coupled-line baluns.

A novel four-way Wilkinson combiner balun (WCB), realized by two coupled line impedance inverting baluns (ZIBs) and isolation (ISO) resistors ( $R_{\text {ISO}}$ s), is proposed. The design procedure of the proposed four-way WCB, specifically focused on reducing electrical length ( ${\theta }~{\lt }~45{^{\circ }}$ ) and extending bandwidth (BW) of coupled line ZIBs, is revealed in detail and their associated design parameters are subsequently obtained using the so-called graphical extraction method. With this intuitive approach, the four-way WCB is synthesized fast to improve BW, passive efficiency, and signal balance simultaneously, within a compact chip size. Also, the impact of an on-chip ground (GND) parasitic inductance on the PA is studied, where a co-design of layout and schematic is explored to decide an optimal differential SiGe HBT cascode output stage. Fabricated in 0.13- $\mu $ m SiGe HBT BiCMOS, the PA obtains measured peak output power ( $P_{\text {out}}$ ), power added efficiency (PAE), and gain of 24.1 dBm, 35.3%, and 23.0 dB at 43.0 GHz, respectively, with a power density of 1295.6 mW/mm2. The 1-dB  $P_{\text {out}}$  BW ranges from 39 to 51 GHz, covering both up- and down-links of VLEO SATCOM.

Series-stacking and floating gate techniques are adopted to increase the mixer switch linearity in the off and on states. Furthermore, impedance step-down matching networks (MNs) are used to reduce the voltage swing around the switch, which enhances the mixer linearity and reduces the required number of series-stacked devices within the switch. Power-efficient stacked drivers with inter-stack LO coupling are used to drive the switching units. This modified design allows the driver to generate rail-to-rail swing at higher frequencies while maintaining high efficiency and low power consumption at low frequencies. The mixer prototype is fabricated in GlobalFoundries 45 nm CMOS SOI process and occupies an active area of 0.38 mm2. The mixer has a measured conversion loss of 8&#8211;11.7 dB at 7&#8211;20 GHz in down-conversion and up-conversion modes with an IP1dB of 19.7&#8211;25.1 dBm. The measured third-order input intercept point (IIP3) is 25.3&#8211;37 and 26.3&#8211;35.7 dBm at 7&#8211;20 GHz in down-conversion and up-conversion modes, respectively. The mixer operates at an LO input signal power of &#8722;1 dBm and consumes 25&#8211;74.4 mW from a 1.2-V supply (pre-drivers) and 46&#8211;355 mW from a 5-V supply (stacked drivers) at an LO frequency of 2&#8211;20 GHz.

To reject spillover from both TX-RX coupling and undesired reflections from radar assembly (such as bumper reflection), a spillover replication method based on frequency-delay translation through a single-sideband (SSB) modulator is introduced. To keep the RX performance immune from strong spillover, we propose an in-low-noise amplifier (LNA) common-mode voltage-domain canceller. It provides high isolation between the RX signal chain and cancellation path, minimizing noise figure (NF) degradation. Spillover is rejected in the input voltage domain before entering the critical LNA stage and inducing current, thereby preserving the linearity. Prototyped in 65-nm CMOS, the RX exhibits 5.7&#8211;7.2-dB NF and &#8722;11.4-dBm IP1 dB across 69&#8211;76.5-GHz range. It demonstrates that 38-dB rejection to spillover signals with offset frequency up to 3.6 MHz and power up to &#8722;10.4 dBm, while keeping the maximum NF degradation below 1&#8211;1.5 dB.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Jitter and Wide-Frequency-Range D-Band Frequency Synthesizer With a Subsampling PLL and a Harmonic-Boosting Frequency Multiplier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10836228</link><description>This work presents a D-band frequency synthesizer that can generate an ultra-low jitter output signal over a large frequency-tuning range (FTR). To overcome the structural limitations of conventional sub-terahertz (sub-THz) frequency synthesizers and concurrently achieve a low jitter and a large FTR, we designed a two-stage architecture, in which a 50-GHz band subsampling PLL (SSPLL) with a 3rd-harmonic (HM)-rich class-F voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) in the first stage interoperated with an HM-boosting frequency multiplier (FM) in the second stage. Designed with a 40-nm CMOS process, this D-band frequency synthesizer exhibited a wide FTR of 11.8%, i.e., 144&#8211;162 GHz. Due to its high-gain subsampling phase detector (PD), which can suppress in-band phase noise (PN), and its class-F VCO, which can achieve low out-of-band (OOB) PN, the proposed frequency synthesizer achieved the lowest rms jitter (i.e., 39 fsrms). Since the combination of the 3rd-HM-rich class-F VCO and the HM-boosting FM generated a D-band output signal in a power-efficient manner, this work also achieved the best jitter figure-of-merit (FOM) among the state-of-the-art W/D-band frequency synthesizers with an FTR more than 5%.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Core Series-Resonance CMOS Oscillator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10851422</link><description>Multi-core and series-resonance (SR) techniques have been proposed to achieve ultra-low phase noise (PN) performance.

To the best of our knowledge, this work reports the oscillator with the lowest PN using CMOS technology in open literature so far, albeit with tradeoffs in power and area.</description></item><item><title>An Octave Tuning-Range Frequency Generator Integrating a Quad-Core VCO Using Quad-Mode Coupled Dual-Path Inductor With a Wideband ILFD</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10816680</link><description>This article presents an octave frequency generator that integrates a quad-core voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) using a quad-mode resonator with a wideband injection locked-frequency divider (ILFD). The quad-core VCO incorporates a resonator based on a quad-mode coupled dual-path inductor (CDPI), enabling wide frequency operation without additional switch loss. This design improves phase noise (PN) performance and supports four distinct inductor mode operations through mode switching between the cores. The VCO is followed by a wide locking range (LR) ILFD which can divide all the VCO output frequencies. The ILFD employs techniques for frequency tracking and inductive peaking to achieve a wide LR. Both the VCO and ILFD are fabricated using a 28-nm CMOS technology. The VCO exhibits a measured tuning range (TR) of 72.6%, spanning from 17 to 36.4 GHz, and consumes 9.7&#8211;13.3 mW at a 0.6-V supply voltage. With a compact core area of 0.065 mm2, the VCO achieves peak figure of merit for tuning (FoMT) and FoM for tuning and area (FoMTA) of 196.3 and 208.1 dBc/Hz, respectively. The ILFD achieves an LR of 90.2%, spanning from 14 to 37 GHz, and consumes 3 mW at a 0.6-V supply voltage. Finally, a prototype octave-TR frequency generator, integrating the proposed quad-core VCO and wideband ILFD, is demonstrated. This frequency generator exhibits octave TR performance and shows promising potential for PLL integration.</description></item><item><title>AM&#8211;AM and AM&#8211;PM Distortion in D-Band BiCMOS Vector-Interpolation Phase Shifters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10702612</link><description>Sub-THz phased-array transceivers need phase shifters for a coherent combination of the transmitted and received signals. Vector-interpolation phase shifters demonstrate wide bandwidth, low loss, and compact footprint, but may suffer from poor linearity, restrained by the need of high dynamic range variable gain amplifiers (VGAs). This article investigates the role of VGA impairments in a vector-interpolation phase shifter, with primary focus on the AM&#8211;AM and AM&#8211;PM distortions. Then, three common VGA structures are analyzed and compared, revealing a best candidate to optimize linearity. A single-ended input/output phase shifter is finally implemented in 55nm SiGe BiCMOS technology. The test chip allows experimental validation of the theoretical results by using the VGAs in different operating modes. It is also shown that, in a single-ended phase shifter, the common-mode current generated by the VGAs may compromise gain and linearity. Solutions to the problem are introduced in the design, including a novel current-mode balun that provides large (4:1) impedance transformation and high common-mode rejection with equal primary and secondary inductors. Experimental results prove wideband operation, from 130 to 175 GHz, with 3.5 dB gain. The phase shift is programmable in 10&#176; steps with rms phase and amplitude errors across frequency &lt; 5&#176; and &lt;0.8 dB, respectively. With the optimal VGA operation mode, the output power at 1 dB gain compression (OP1dB) is above 1.8 dBm with &lt;10&#176; AM&#8211;PM distortion. Experiments compare favorably against previous works in the same band and in similar technologies.</description></item><item><title>A Dual-Alternating-Slope Digital-to-Time Converter Leveraging Mismatch to Improve Delay Step Size</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10705095</link><description>This article introduces a dual-alternating-slope digital-to-time converter (DASDTC) topology that reduces the dependency of DTC delay on component values and power supply.

The TMR readout circuit utilizes a current-balancing instrumentation amplifier (CBIA) with ping-pong auto-zeroing (PPAZ), achieving an integrated magnetic noise of 206 nTrms in a wide bandwidth of 2 MHz. Compared with chopping amplifiers, an auto-zeroed CBIA provides a ripple-free output, not only extending the available bandwidth but also ensuring a system linearity of 0.24%. In the gain configuration of 42 dB, the input magnetic field range is &#177;0.08 mT, corresponding to a dynamic range (DR) of 58 dB. The maximum offset of the TMR sensor is reduced to 311 nT (ten samples) through an SAR-assisted offset calibration scheme. Moreover, after compensating the temperature coefficient (TC) of the TMR bias generator, the sensitivity drift of the TMR sensor is reduced by  $18{\times }$ . Overall, the proposed TMR sensor readout, including the sensor bias circuit, achieves a state-of-the-art power efficiency in terms of figure-of-merit (FoM) of 2.5 fW/Hz or 146 dB. As a general bridge sensor readout, this work achieves 5.4 nV/ $\surd $ Hz input-referred noise (IRN),  $1~{\mu }$ V input offset, and bandwidth efficiency of  $I_{\text {supply}}$ /bandwidth  $ {=} 0.44$ .</description></item><item><title>A Three-Fine-Level Buck&#8211;Boost Hybrid Converter Achieving Half-VIN-Stress on All Switches and Fast Transient Response</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10681460</link><description>This article presents a non-inverting three-fine-level buck-boost (3FLBB) hybrid converter suitable for lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. With seven power switches and two flying capacitors, the proposed 3FLBB converter produces the voltage of switching node between  $V_{\mathrm {IN}}$ /2,  $V_{\mathrm {IN}}$ , and  $3{V_{\mathrm {IN}}}$ /2, which supports buck, boost, and buck-boost modes, and with smooth mode changes. Here, one of the two flying capacitors is used to drive the inductor (L), while another one is used to ensure that  $V_{\mathrm {DS}}$  of each power switch is within 1/ $2{V_{\mathrm {IN}}}$  in all phases. Hence, the voltage stress of all the power switches is reduced to half- $V_{\mathrm {IN}}$ , and the normalized equivalent resistance and switching losses are greatly reduced by using two 1.8-V switches instead of two 5-V switches. Since the three modes all have buck-like operation, the average inductor current is reduced to always equal to the output current. Meanwhile, they all have continuous output current, similar complex pole pairs, and no right half-plane (RHP) zero, which enables fast load transient response. This design is implemented by only 1.8-V devices of a standard 0.18- $\mu $ m CMOS process, covering an input voltage range from 2.8 to 4.2 V. A 98.2% peak efficiency is measured at 2-MHz switching frequency with 2.2- $\mu $ H L, two 10- $\mu $ F flying capacitors, and one 10- $\mu $ F output capacitor. It can deliver an output current of 50&#8211;1000 mA at a 3.3-V regulated output voltage. Moreover, the measured results show that this design achieves a significant improvement on undershoot and overshoot voltage than the previous works.</description></item><item><title>A High-Efficiency 12/1-V Dual-Path Series-Capacitor Converter With Low V&#8901;A Metric and Full Duty Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10701036</link><description>This article presents a dual-path series-capacitor (DPSC) converter with a voltage range of  $9~{\sim }~16$ -V input to 1-V output.

In medium and heavy load conditions, the valley-current mode (VCM) with adaptive on-time (AOT) is employed to guarantee loop stability and seamless transition between pulsewidth modulation (PWM) and pulse-frequency modulation (PFM). A hiccup mode (HM) is proposed to minimize the power consumption of control circuits in light load conditions.

A super-pixel structure is proposed with diagonally arranged  $2 \times 2$  MONO and NIR sub-pixels. To enhance visible light sensitivity, large and small non-uniform micro-lenses are formed on the MONO and NIR sub-pixels, respectively. Each floating diffusion (FD) shared super-pixel is connected to an in-pixel analog-to-digital converter and two banks of 10-bit static random access memories (SRAMs) to enable the dual-channel GS operation. To achieve high dynamic range (DR) in the MONO channel, a triple-quantization (3Q) operation is performed. Furthermore, a single-channel digital-correlated double sampling (D-CDS) 3Q operation is implemented. The fabricated sensor achieved 6.2-mW low power consumption at 30 frames/s with dual-channel capture. The MONO channel achieved 124-dB DR in the 3Q operation and 60 dB for the NIR channel.

Traditional von Neumann computing architectures often incur high energy costs and prolonged computational latencies when tackling COPs. Recently, researchers have used continuous-time (CT) Ising machines as low-cost COP solvers due to their attractive solving speed. However, prior CT works suffer from inadequate coefficient precision, the lack of annealing mechanisms, and susceptibility to variations. In light of this, this work presents an in-eDRAM mixed-signal CT Ising machine featuring eDRAM-based compute-in-memory (CIM) architecture. It introduces a current-based multi-level interaction topology for updating spins and presents a CT annealing mechanism to access the ground energy landscape. To enhance its process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) robustness, the two-step current-programming technique is used to eliminate mismatches caused by PVT variations. The prototype chip with a  $32\times 33$  spin array is fabricated using a 65-nm CMOS process. Each spin occupies an area of 848  $\mu $ m2, including 20 3T1C current-programmed eDRAMs and eight 1T1C eDRAMs. Measurement results demonstrate that the proposed CT Ising machine has excellent PVT robustness, the lowest normalized spin area ( $13.6~\mu $ m2), and the highest coefficient level of 15. It can solve multi-level max-cut problems on a nanosecond timescale and consumes only 0.33&#8211;1.05 nJ at a 1.0&#8211;1.2-V core supply voltage.</description></item><item><title>A 394-TOPS/W Matched Filter With Charge-Domain Computing for GPS Signal Acquisition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10702595</link><description>As the most compute-intensive signal processing task in the global positioning system (GPS) receiver, signal acquisition accounts for most of the power budget, which is a key bottleneck in extending the battery life of edge devices. To improve the energy efficiency of GPS signal acquisition, we present charge-domain computing for GPS signal acquisition (CCSA), a matched filter with CCSA. It employs a  $64 {\times } 64$  mixed-signal processing element (PE) array, a 2.8-b flash analog-to-digital converter (ADC), and a digital controller. Each PE handles the element-wise multiplication with a mixed-signal multiplier (MSMUL), which can perform the multiplication and digital-to-charge conversion simultaneously with a two-phase operation scheme. We develop the two-phase digital-to-charge mapping method for the MSMUL, where the digital multiplication result is converted into the charge difference stored in a capacitor between the charge reset phase and the charge evaluation phase. The charge-domain outputs of all MSMULs are dumped and redistributed on a global output wire for the accumulation operation. Compared to prior charge-domain works, the proposed design reduces the number of capacitors or additional voltage levels by half, thereby leading to better energy efficiency and lower circuit complexity. The 28-nm test chip achieves 114&#8211;394-TOPS/W energy efficiency across 0.34&#8211;0.9-V supply voltage, which is  $8.2{\times }$  higher than state-of-the-art at the same throughput.</description></item><item><title>A 44.3-mW 62.4-fps Hyperspectral Image Processor for Spectral Unmixing in MAV Remote Sensing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10682804</link><description>This article presents the first dedicated processor designed to support the complete spectral unmixing workflow for hyperspectral image (HSI) processing, including rank reduction, endmember extraction, and abundance estimation.

Transformers, in particular, demand higher precision compared to CNNs. Existing analog compute-in-memory (ACIM) solutions primarily cater to CNNs and struggle to achieve the high precision necessary for Transformers, despite their promise in addressing the memory bottleneck. To bridge this gap, we propose a capacitor-reconfigured CIM (CR-CIM) macro that introduces dual-mode operation, dynamically switching between high-precision and high-efficiency modes based on the active DNN layer. In the CNN mode, the CR-CIM employs bit-parallel computation and an 8-bit ADC to maximize power efficiency, exploiting the inherent error tolerance of CNNs. In contrast, for the Transformer mode, the CR-CIM switches to bit-serial computation and a 10-bit ADC to boost the compute signal-to-noise ratio (CSNR), ensuring the higher precision required by Transformers. This dual-mode functionality of the proposed CR-CIM is enabled by three key technologies: 1) a novel CR-CIM architecture and cell structure; 2) a resource-efficient multi-bit driver for bit-parallel computation; and 3) a software-analog co-design (SAC) strategy for enhanced Transformer computation. Our CR-CIM prototype is the first ACIM design to enable optimized operation for both Transformers and CNNs. CR-CIM achieves 45-dB signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR) and 31-dB CSNR (8-bit input and 8-bit weight bit-serial MAC) in the Transformer mode and a peak-power efficiency of 4094 TOPS/W (normalized to 1-bit  ${\times } 1$ -bit MAC) in the CNN mode.</description></item><item><title>A Fully Row/Column-Parallel MRAM in-Memory Computing Macro With Memory-Resistance Boosting and Weighted Multi-Column ADC Readout</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10801203</link><description>This work demonstrates a 256(row) ${\times } 512$ (col.) fully row/column-parallel in-memory computing (IMC) macro employing foundry MRAM in 22-nm FD-SOI CMOS. Embedded nonvolatile memory (eNVM) offers advantages in density, nonvolatility, and scalability in advanced technology nodes compared to SRAM, but incurs worse signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) challenges which restrict row parallelism and exacerbate readout overheads, thus limiting achievable IMC throughput and energy efficiency. The presented prototype enables high row parallelism, as well as high-sensitivity and power/area-efficient readout, via a cascode-based feedback architecture. The feedback architecture performs linear conductance-to-current conversion, which enables signal weighting and summation to feed a single multi-column ADC.

In order to obtain the broadband impedance matching and low noise figure, the entire limiter is treated as the  $\pi $ -type equivalent input matching network of the LNA. Meanwhile, the RC energy storage network located at the transistor&#8217;s drain is employed to improve the input return loss. Adaptive bias networks and tapered topology are employed to ameliorate the linearity of the LNA. As the input power increases, the nonlinear behavior of the LNA is optimized by maintaining a stable gate bias voltage. A three-stage cascaded topology and an R-L-C feedback structure are employed to compensate for frequency-dependent losses, resulting in enhanced gain flatness of the LNA. The filtering characteristic is introduced by multiple transmission zeros through the DC bias circuit and parallel resonant branch. The measured results show that the proposed limiting LNA obtains a flat gain of 23 dB and a noise figure of 1.82 dB from 5-20 GHz with a rejection level greater than 38 dB. The output third-order intercept point of LNA reaches 20 dBm, while it can handle an input power of 40 dBm and occupies an area of  $2.4\times 0.9$  mm2.</description></item><item><title>First Demonstration of Power-Linear Regulator for Thermo-Optic Phase Tuning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10931148</link><description>This paper presents a power-linear regulator (PLR) using a voltage-squaring feedback loop designed for linear thermo-optic tuning. Nonlinear phase tuning occurs when conventional digital-to-analog converters (DACs) or low-dropout regulators (LDOs) are used to drive the thermo-optic phase shifter since the introduced phase change is proportional to the square of the voltage. The nonlinear phase tuning introduces the distortion and non-uniform resolution which degrades the system performance. We propose a PLR to achieve linear thermo-optic phase tuning, where the phase change is proportional to the input voltage. By adopting a voltage-squaring feedback loop, the output voltage is proportional to the square-root of the input voltage under fixed resistive heater and a linear mapping between the input voltage and phase change is established. This design is fabricated in a standard CMOS 65 nm process with an active area of 0.014 mm2. Under 2.5 V supply voltage, the proposed design achieves an input range of  $0\sim 1$  V and corresponding output range of  $0\sim 2$  V. The maximum delivered power is up to 40 mW while driving a  $100~\Omega $  load. The measured power linearity error is  $3.5~\%$ . Additionally, the design demonstrates rapid transient behavior under a  $100~\Omega $  load, with  $0.2~\mu $ s rise time and  $0.7~\mu $ s fall time between 0 mW output power and 40 mW output power. The line regulation is 6 mV/V under  $100~\Omega $  load. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first PLR demonstrated in the literature.</description></item><item><title>Theory and Design of Pseudo-Doherty Load-Modulated Double Balanced Amplifier With Intrinsic Insensitivity to Antenna VSWR</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10902511</link><description>This paper presents a novel Double-Balanced power amplifier (PA) architecture with an intrinsic load isolation. Derived from the generic load modulated balanced amplifier (LMBA), by designing the single-ended control amplifier (CA) as another balanced PA, the Pseudo-Doherty load-modulated double-balanced amplifier (PD-LMDBA) can inherit the intrinsic load-mismatch tolerance of balanced amplifier without any reconfiguration and load-impedance sensing. Theoretical analysis reveals that both the control amplifier (CA, as carrier) and primary balanced amplifier (BA, as peaking) exhibit complementary load modulation trajectories for their sub-amplifiers (CA1 and CA2, BA1 and BA2) under mismatch. This allows the PA to inherit the intrinsic load insensitivity from the generic quadrature-balanced amplifier and sustain nearly constant performance against arbitrary load variations. A prototype is implemented at 2.1 GHz, achieving 76.2% efficiency at peak power and 69.5% at 10-dB OBO with matched load. Under a  $2:1$  voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) of load mismatch, an efficiency up to 72.5% at peak power and 64.1% at 10-dB OBO are measured. In modulated evaluation with a 20-MHz OFDM signal, the PA maintains linearity against  $2:1$  VSWR, with 2.1% of error vector magnitude (EVM) and down to -39.5 dB adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR), closely approximating the matched condition.</description></item><item><title>Hysteresis-Dependent Synchronized Load Shift Keying and Reconfigurable Class-D Power Amplifier-Based Fully Integrated Adaptive Control in Wireless Power Transfer System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947494</link><description>A 13.56-MHz wireless power transfer (WPT) system with fully integrated transmitter ( ${\mathrm {T}}_{\mathrm {X}}$ ) and receiver ( ${\mathrm {R}}_{\mathrm {X}}$ ) chips is presented.

Synchronized load-shift keying at the receiver improves the relative change in the primary current of the transmitter by &gt;15%. The adaptive digitally controlled active rectifier achieves a voltage conversion ratio (VCR) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.92 and 92.4%, respectively, for a  $200~\Omega $  load resistance.

This system achieves a greater operating distance, higher output power, and faster load-transient response while significantly reducing circuit and system design complexity.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive Beam-Steering dToF LiDAR System Using Addressable Multi-Channel VCSEL Transmitter, 128 &#215; 80 SPAD Sensor, and ML-Based Edge-Computing Object Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10949488</link><description>In this work, a solid-state direct time-of-flight (dToF) and adaptive beam-steering Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) system is proposed for machine learning (ML) based object detection. To leverage the capabilities of software and hardware, a co-optimization design from a neural network based algorithm to the architecture of transmitter, receiver and optical components is realized. Firstly, an object detection neural network is proposed for the depth-only input algorithm, which indicates the Region of Interest (ROI) in the illuminating field and gives hints of opened scan channels in the next two frames to decrease the total cost of the laser driver and sensor array. Next, the proposed network utilizes the Cross-Stage-Patrial (CSP) block to replace the residual structure in the backbone to achieve a lightweight performance and is implemented on the NVIDIA-Jetson to verify the system-level adaptive beam steering feature. To realize the smart working mode, a customized multi-channel and addressable TX is designed for adaptive and optical control to save power consumption and extend the ranging distance. At the same time, a  $128\times 80$  resolution RX which consists of Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) and column-wise Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) is incorporated to capture the returned photons for combining sub-regions into an entire depth map. Next, to customize the specific scanning mechanism, for the optical setup, a cylindrical lens array is designed to reshape the laser beam, which matches the pattern of the transmitter to illuminate different targeted objects. Both the laser driver chip and the sensor chip with a  $128\times 80$  SPAD array are fabricated in the 180-nm Bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD) process. Finally, the laser driver chip realizes the power of 5 W with an adjustable pulse width of 1.5 ns and the SPAD array integrates the depth accuracy of 5 cm at 15 m. Due to that the neural network realizes an accuracy up to 0.8, a low-power solid-state LiDAR prototype with adaptive beam steering is demonstrated.</description></item><item><title>A Variation-Robust 20-Gb/s Wireline Transceiver With Real-Time Calibration in 28-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10804880</link><description>This paper describes a variation-robust transceiver with four-tap feed-forward equalization (FFE) and real-time calibration techniques.

However, the proliferation of DNNs has led to a surge in computational intensity and data traffic, thereby imposing substantial demands on the power capacity and battery life of computing systems. Computing-in-memory (CIM) is considered a promising architecture to resolve or mitigate the memory wall challenge by integrating computational elements within memory arrays. Yet prior studies on CIM have seldom capitalized on sparsity in both activations and weights simultaneously. Furthermore, the exploitation of two-sided sparsity&#8212;sparsity in both activations and weights&#8212;presents new challenges, such as imbalanced workload and low hardware substrate utilization. To harness the full potential of two-sided sparsity for acceleration, we present Dyn-Bitpool, an accelerator that introduces innovations on two fronts: 1) a balanced workload scheme, &#8220;pool first and cross lane sharing&#8221;, which maximizes performance gains enabled by the bit-level sparsity in activations; and 2) a dynamic topology for CIM arrays to effectively address the low CIM macro utilization issue caused by the value-level sparsity in weights.

However, most existing ACIM accelerators are highly customized for specific precision formats, lacking the generality to support efficiently arbitrary precision in both integer (INT) and floating-point (FP) formats. In this work, we present an arbitrary precision analog computing-in-memory (ArPCIM) accelerator with unified INT/FP arithmetic to address this limitation. We introduce a CIM-friendly INT/FP arithmetic to convert FP numbers into INT numbers for efficient execution on CIM, minimizing precision loss through local pre-alignment and dynamic bit-weight slicing methods. In addition, we implement multi-level reconfigurable precision circuits, featuring both intra- and inter-processing element (PE) reconfigurability, which supports precision ranging from 1-bit to 47-bit. Experimental results show that our ArPCIM accelerator achieves up to  $4.09\times $  and  $5.37\times $  improvement in energy efficiency and area efficiency, respectively, compared with state-of-the-art arbitrary precision digital CIM. Our ArPCIM accelerator offers the flexibility to meet diverse computational needs while maintaining high energy efficiency and accuracy, paving the way for versatile CIM acceleration across various fields.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Design and Implementation of Scale-Free CORDIC With Mutually Exclusive Micro-Rotations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10934813</link><description>In this paper, a new approach to the design of a micro-rotation set for scale-free CORDIC is proposed. The sine and cosine functions of all the micro-rotation angles are realized by a simple shift or a shift-add operations which significantly reduces the hardware complexity. Besides, the micro-rotation set (except the first one) is designed to form mutually exclusive pairs. As a result of mutually exclusive micro-rotations, it is possible to reduce the required number of iterations to almost half for a given precision. Apart from that, the latency, as well as, the hardware complexity are also significantly reduced. A 9-bit fractional accuracy is obtained with just 5 iterations as against 13 iterations required by the conventional CORDIC. Suitable threshold angles are proposed to decide, using low-complexity comparators, whether a micro-rotation should be executed in a given iteration or can be skipped. The proposed circuits to determine the rotation conditions for different iterations involve either 2-bit or 3-bit comparators. The CORDIC circuit based on the proposed set of micro-rotations is shown to converge for any given angle of rotation. Furthermore, the proposed design involves significantly less logic, computation time, and latency than the best of the scale-free CORDIC circuits. When implemented on Xilinx FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays), it requires 20% less area, offers higher operating frequency, and saves close to 19% power and 20% energy per computation over the latter.</description></item><item><title>TrIM, Triangular Input Movement Systolic Array for Convolutional Neural Networks: Architecture and Hardware Implementation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10819996</link><description>Modern hardware architectures for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), other than targeting high performance, aim at dissipating limited energy. Reducing the data movement cost between the computing cores and the memory is a way to mitigate the energy consumption. Systolic arrays are suitable architectures to achieve this objective: they use multiple processing elements that communicate each other to maximize data utilization, based on proper dataflows like the weight stationary and row stationary. Motivated by this, we have proposed TrIM, an innovative dataflow based on a triangular movement of inputs, and capable to reduce the number of memory accesses by one order of magnitude when compared to state-of-the-art systolic arrays.

A predictor-based continuous emotional self-structuring neural network (NN) is proposed to approximate unknown nonlinearities of NMAPSs. Flexible structure and emotion-based approaches not only can balance the contradiction between computational burden and control performance but also keep a fast response property of NN approximate. The predictor can improve the approximation accuracy and interpretability of NN approximate by introducing a prediction error to update NN&#8217;s weights. Next, a dynamic ET mechanism is presented, which introduces a dynamic self-regulation variable to prolong the ET interval. On this basis, the designed control protocol is sent to actuator only at the ET instant to further reduce the network burden. Then, a distributed composite learning control protocol is developed for NMAPSs by utilizing the Lyapunov stability theorem. It can guarantee that all signals in the closed-loop system are bounded under a class of switching topologies with the average dwell time, and the Zeno phenomenon is avoided ultimately. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.</description></item><item><title>Robust Practical Stability Region Partition Considering Parameter Uncertainty and Volatility for Direct-Drive Wind Power System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10722880</link><description>A power system is a strongly nonlinear dynamic system, and traditional small disturbance stability analysis cannot reflect the dynamic characteristics of the system under uncertain disturbances. This paper proposes a robust practical stability region (RPSR) partitioning method that considers uncertain disturbances to address the uncertainty of wind power injections and load volatility in wind power systems. First, a disturbance model of the wind turbine generator access system is constructed on the basis of perturbation theory to investigate the effects of uncertainty disturbances on the dynamic characteristics of the system. Second, through bifurcation analysis and limit cycle (L-cycle) tracking, a comprehensive bifurcation diagram that considers the variation trend of the L-cycle amplitude is drawn. Combined with the variation trend of the L-cycle, the RPSR of the system under uncertain disturbances is partitioned. Case studies of dual-machine system and multimachine system explore the new concept of the RPSR.

Compared with conventional CE algorithms, deep learning (DL)-based approach becomes a promising alternative, due to its capability of offering enhanced performance and robustness across diverse scenarios. However, efficient DL-based CE algorithms have two key properties that make them challenging for implementation in existing architectures at the edge side: the diversity of deep neural networks (DNNs) and CE strategies, and the involvements of multiple computation-intensive tasks that compass conventional signal processing, artificial intelligence (AI) inference, and online learning. To address these challenges, a domain-specific processor based on an extended RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) is proposed to perform these DL-based CE algorithms.

Optimization procedures followed by PV inverter designers result in static circuit designs, with respective efficiency curves that exhibit their maxima in a narrow range of PV array voltage and power. Nevertheless, the individual PV array characteristics, the solar irradiance and ambient temperature conditions with their daily and seasonal variations, as well as possible partial shading of the PV array, normally shift the operating point of PV inverters away from their maximum-efficiency range.

The OTB-SA with  $T_{\mathrm { RISE}}$  leverages body biasing and  $T_{\mathrm { RISE}}$  control to enhance the differential signal injection (DSI) effect, thereby reducing both  $V_{\mathrm { OS}}$  and energy consumption. Post-layout HSPICE simulation results using a 28 nm technology model indicate that, when target  $V_{\mathrm { OS}}$  standard deviation  $({\sigma }_{\mathrm { OS}})$  is 5 mV, the OTB-SA with  $T_{\mathrm { RISE}}$  achieves a 49.6% reduction in area and a 60.1% decrease in energy consumption compared to a voltage-latched SA (VLSA) without  $T_{\mathrm { RISE}}$ .

The BP stage is conceived to be embedded in the RB-COT modulator located within the converter feedback loop, and only intervening when the minimum OFF time condition is reached. The latter implies that the COT modulator saturates, and consequently, the output voltage regulation of the converter is no longer guaranteed. Conversely, the BP stage does not affect the behavior of the circuit when it operates in normal regulating condition. The effectiveness of the proposed BP stage is confirmed through both transistor-level simulation results derived from the SPICE platform and experimental measurements on a integrated circuit prototype implemented in a 0.18 um Bipolar-CMOS-DMOS process.</description></item><item><title>A Current-Mode Multiply-Accumulate Macro in Sensing-Computing Fusion System for Feature Extraction and Redundancy Reduction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891698</link><description>This brief presents a current-mode sensing-computing fusion system for advanced Internet of Things (IoT) machine vision.

The proposed TT-CNN reduces the model size by sharing the first two convolutional layers with all the keywords with a transferred training approach. Hence, the power budget for memory and computation is largely reduced. The TT-CNN supports flexible keyword demand in different scenes by selecting different kernels in the custom-designed 5T-SRAM. The time-domain feature of the proposed TT-CNN avoids the power-hungry feature extractor (FEx), further reducing the overall power consumption.

It reduces circuit area, power, and delay at the cost of introducing errors. This article proposes a powerful technique, termed approximate resubstitution (AppResub), to approximately simplify the circuit. AppResub replaces a node&#8217;s function with a simpler approximate function on existing nodes in the circuit to reduce the hardware cost. Leveraging AppResub, an efficient flow for approximate logic synthesis (ALS) is developed by iteratively applying a set of promising AppResubs for circuit simplification. To evaluate errors caused by a set of AppResubs, a novel error model capable of efficiently computing an error upper bound is used to smartly apply AppResubs in the ALS flow. The experimental results demonstrate that compared to a state-of-the-art method, the proposed flow further reduces 20.9% area and 21.7% delay under the mean error distance constraint, while being  $400\times $  faster.

In current deployments of FL, devices that do not fulfill certain hardware requirements are often dropped from the collaborative training. However, dropping devices in FL can degrade training accuracy and introduce bias or unfairness. Several works have tackled this problem on an algorithm level, e.g., by letting constrained devices train a subset of the server neural network (NN) model. However, it has been observed that these techniques are not effective w.r.t. accuracy. Importantly, they make simplistic assumptions about devices&#8217; resources via indirect metrics, such as multiply accumulate (MAC) operations or peak memory requirements. We observe that memory access costs (that are currently not considered in simplistic metrics) have a significant impact on the energy consumption. In this work, for the first time, we consider on-device accelerator design for FL with heterogeneous devices. We utilize compressed arithmetic formats and approximate computing, targeting to satisfy limited energy budgets. Using a hardware-aware energy model, we observe that, contrary to the state of the art&#8217;s moderate energy reduction, our technique allows for lowering the energy requirements (by  $4\times $ ) while maintaining higher accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Less Traces Are All It Takes: Efficient Side-Channel Analysis on AES</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10802966</link><description>In cryptography, side-channel analysis (SCA) is a technique used to recover cryptographic keys by examining the physical leakages that occur during the operation of cryptographic devices. Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) have greatly enhanced the extraction of crucial information from intricate leakage patterns. A considerable amount of research is dedicated to studying the SubByte (SB) operations of the advanced encryption standard (AES). This is because the SB process, which generates numerous transitions between 0s and 1s during encryption, results in significant energy leakage. However, traditional analysis models primarily focus on the initial round of SB operations in AES, which are less effective on mobile terminals where it is difficult to collect enough signals. These models often neglect additional operations and subsequent rounds, thus providing limited insights from small datasets. Consequently, this limitation has a direct impact on the accuracy and efficiency of key recovery. Our study uses  $\rho $ -test analysis to show that significant leakage occurs not only during the S-box operation but also during the AddRoundKey (AR) phase of AES. To address these challenges, we propose a new SCA method, that is, optimized for small sample sizes. This method includes a new comprehensive round trace labeling algorithm, which simultaneously analyzes the SB and AR stages of each AES round. Additionally, we introduce the peak precise localization algorithm to accurately identify the points of energy leakage during each encryption round. Our experiments, conducted with power and electromagnetic (EM) datasets from the STM32F303 microcontroller, demonstrate that our method can reliably recover keys with as few as 20 traces. These results highlight the enhanced capability of our method in handling the complexities of small sample datasets in cryptographic analysis.</description></item><item><title>iSAFE: Enabling Evenness of Data Freshness in Multipriority Networked Intermittent Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10812996</link><description>Environmental monitoring applications use energy harvesting to cover wide-range deployment, where devices are powered by ambient energy and operate intermittently when energy is sufficient. In such an intermittent networked system (NIS), a sink node is used to forward the environmental data collected by sensors to a central controller to reflect the physical environment status. Nevertheless, existing data forwarding algorithms for NISs cannot fulfill modern application requirements, where multiple types of data with different timeliness requirements (i.e., multipriorities) are desired to report real-time environmental data for monitoring critical situations. Without considering the multipriorities, we show in this article that it introduces a new problem: unevenness of data freshness. We then propose the sink node-based evenness-aware update forwarding (iSAFE) algorithm to provide evenness among different priorities of data sources in NISs. iSAFE consists of three important components: 1) a theoretical analysis to derive the optimal data forwarding interval between two adjacent status updates from the sensor; 2) an evenness-aware forwarding algorithm to adaptively adjust the forwarding interval based on the runtime status; and 3) a fresh-aware energy preservation algorithm to maintain the freshness of collected data. The experimental results show that iSAFE can achieve up to 682% evenness (94.47% close to the ideal) and 53.3% data freshness compared to the state of the art while being energy-efficient and scalable, suitable for modern applications.</description></item><item><title>A Recursive Partition-Based In-Memory SIMD Computation Scheduler for Memory Footprint Minimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10777068</link><description>In-memory computing (IMC) is a technique that enables memory to perform computation so that data transfer between processor and memory can be reduced, improving energy efficiency. A popular IMC design style is based on the single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) concept. The SIMD IMC can implement a high-level function by two steps: 1) synthesis and 2) scheduling. The former converts the high-level function into a netlist of the supported primitive logic operations, while the latter determines the execution sequence of the operations. To fully exploit the advantage of SIMD IMC, it is crucial to find a schedule for the given netlist with less memory usage, known as memory footprint (MF). In this work, we first propose an optimal scheduler that can minimize the MF for small netlists. It is at least  $8\times $  faster than the state-of-the-art optimal method. For large netlists, we propose a recursive partition-based scheduler consisting of a scheduling-friendly bipartition algorithm and our optimal scheduler. Compared to four state-of-the-art heuristic methods, ours reduces the MF by 54.7%, 48.9%, 44.0%, and 25.5%, respectively, under the same runtime. Our experiments also demonstrate that our scheduler achieves good end-to-end performance when applied to various IMC architectures. The code of our scheduler is made open-source.</description></item><item><title>Energy-Efficient DNN Inferencing on ReRAM-Based PIM Accelerators Using Heterogeneous Operation Units</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10787259</link><description>Operation unit (OU)-based configurations enable the design of energy-efficient and reliable ReRAM crossbar-based processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures for deep neural network (DNN) inferencing. To exploit sparsity and tackle crossbar nonidealities, matrix-vector-multiplication (MVM) operations are computed at a much smaller level of granularity than a full crossbar, referred to as OUs. However, determining the suitable OU size for a given DNN workload presents a nontrivial challenge as the DNN layers exhibit different levels of sparsity and have varying impact on overall predictive accuracy. In this article, we propose a framework for designing heterogeneous OU-based PIM accelerators. The OU configurations vary based on the characteristics of the neural layers and the time-dependent conductance drift of PIM devices due to repeated inference runs. Overall, our experimental results demonstrate that the sparsity-aware layer-wise heterogeneous OU-based PIM computation reduces latency and energy by 34% and 73% on average, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art homogeneous OU-based architectures without compromising the predictive accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Realization of Early-Exit Dynamic Neural Networks on Reconfigurable Hardware</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10804199</link><description>Early-exiting is a strategy that is becoming popular in deep neural networks (DNNs), as it can lead to faster execution and a reduction in the computational intensity of inference. To achieve this, intermediate classifiers abstract information from the input samples to strategically stop forward propagation and generate an output at an earlier stage. Confidence criteria are used to identify easier-to-recognize samples over the ones that need further filtering. However, such dynamic DNNs have only been realized in conventional computing systems (CPU+GPU) using libraries designed for static networks. In this article, we first explore the feasibility and benefits of realizing early-exit dynamic DNNs on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), a platform already proven to be highly effective for neural network applications. We consider two approaches for implementing and executing the intermediate classifiers: 1) pipeline, which uses existing hardware and 2) parallel, which uses additional dedicated modules. We model their energy needs and execution time and explore their performance using the BranchyNet early-exit approach on LeNet-5, AlexNet, VGG19, and ResNet32, and a Xilinx ZCU106 Evaluation Board. We found that the dynamic approaches are at least 24% faster than a static network executed on an FPGA, consuming a minimum of  $1.32\times $  lower energy. We further observe that FPGAs can enhance the performance of early-exit dynamic DNNs by minimizing the complexities introduced by the decision intermediate classifiers through parallel execution. Finally, we compare the two approaches and identify which is best for different network types and confidence levels.</description></item><item><title>Enabling Efficient Sparse Multiplications on GPUs With Heuristic Adaptability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10802949</link><description>Sparse matrix-vector/matrix multiplication, namely SpMMul, has become a fundamental operation during model inference in various domains. Previous studies have explored numerous optimizations to accelerate it. However, to enable efficient end-to-end inference, the following challenges remain unsolved: 1) incomplete design space and time-consuming preprocessing. Previous methods optimize SpMMul in limited loops and neglect the potential space exploration for further optimization, resulting in &gt;30% waste of computing power. In addition, the preprocessing overhead in SparseTIR and DTC-SpMM is  $1000\times $  larger than sparse computing; 2) incompatibility between static dataflow and dynamic input. A static dataflow can not always be efficient to all input, leading to &gt;80% performance loss; and 3) simplistic algorithm performance analysis. Previous studies primarily analyze performance from algorithmic advantages, without considering other aspects like hardware and data features. To tackle the above challenges, we present DA-SpMMul, a Data-Aware heuristic GPU implementation for SpMMul in multiplatforms. DA-SpMMul creatively proposes: 1) complete design space based on theoretical computations and nontrivial implementations without preprocessing. We propose three orthogonal design principles based on theoretical computations and provide nontrivial implementations on standard formats, eliminating the complex preprocessing; 2) feature-enabled adaptive algorithm selection mechanism. We design a heuristic model to enable algorithm selection considering various features; and 3) comprehensive algorithm performance analysis. We extract the features from multiple perspectives and present a comprehensive performance analysis of all algorithms. DA-SpMMul supports PyTorch on both NVIDIA and AMD and achieves an average speedup of  $3.33\times $  and  $3.02\times $  over NVIDIA cuSPARSE, and  $12.05\times $  and  $8.32\times $  over AMD rocSPARSE for sparse matrix-vector multiplication and sparse matrix-matrix multiplication, and up to  $1.48\times $  speedup against the state-of-the-art open-source algorithm. Integrated with graph neural network framework, PyG, DA-SpMMul achieves up to  $1.22\times $  speedup on GCN inference.</description></item><item><title>PDNNet: PDN-Aware GNN-CNN Heterogeneous Network for Dynamic IR Drop Prediction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10771986</link><description>IR drop on the power delivery network (PDN) is closely related to PDN&#8217;s configuration and cell current consumption. As the integrated circuit (IC) design is growing larger, dynamic IR drop simulation becomes computationally unaffordable and machine learning-based IR drop prediction has been explored as a promising solution. Although convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods have been adapted to IR drop prediction task in several works, the shortcomings of overlooking PDN configuration is non-negligible. In this article, we consider not only how to properly represent cell-PDN relation, but also how to model IR drop following its physical nature in the feature aggregation procedure. Thus, we propose a novel graph structure, PDNGraph, to unify the representations of the PDN structure and the fine-grained cell-PDN relation. We further propose a dual-branch heterogeneous network, PDNNet, incorporating two parallel GNN-CNN branches to favorably capture the above features during the learning process. Several key designs are presented to make the dynamic IR drop prediction highly effective and interpretable. We are the first work to apply graph structure to deep-learning-based dynamic IR drop prediction method. Experiments show that PDNNet outperforms the state-of-the-art CNN-based methods and achieves  $545\times $  speedup compared to the commercial tool, which demonstrates the superiority of our method.</description></item><item><title>Improving DNN Accuracy on MLC PIM via Non-Ideal PIM Device Fine-Tuning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10811964</link><description>Resistive random access memory (RRAM) emerges as a promising technology for developing energy-efficient deep neural network (DNN) accelerators, owing to its analog computing paradigm for matrix-vector multiplication. However, the inherent nonideal device features of RRAM cells, such as device variation, read disturbances, and limited on/off ratio, present challenges for model deployment. Therefore, to ensure accurate storage and computing precision for RRAM-based accelerators, a widely used practice is encoding a DNN weight by multiple cells, resulting in significant memory overhead and underutilization. This challenge is further exacerbated by the rapid increases in model size witnessed in recent years. While the one-to-one weight-cell mapping strategy can improve memory utilization, it inevitably introduces deviations in the mapped DNN weight from the desired value due to RRAM variation issues, leading to model accuracy degradation. In response to this challenge, we abstract the model optimization on RRAM chips as a non-ideal PIM device optimization problem, aimed at optimizing model accuracy without the requirement of precise weight programming. We systematically analyze the model optimization behavior on multilevel RRAM devices by investigating the accuracy recovery process of various fine-tuning strategies in recovering model performance under the non-ideal PIM device setting. Based on the analysis, we propose a non-ideal PIM device finetune scheme to recover the model performance for multilevel RRAM under the non-ideal PIM device setting. Our proposed scheme leverages knowledge distillation and exploits input/output information of the model on RRAM to guide the fine-tuning process, finally restoring its accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our non-ideal PIM device fine-tuning scheme, achieving nearly complete recovery of model performance. Our approach yields over a 3% improvement in model accuracy compared to variation-aware training approaches.</description></item><item><title>HALTRAV: Design of a High-Performance and Area-Efficient Latch With Triple-Node-Upset Recovery and Algorithm-Based Verifications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10777016</link><description>With the rapid advancement of semiconductor technologies, latches become increasingly sensitive to soft errors, especially triple node upsets (TNUs), in harsh radiation environments. In this article, we first propose a high-performance and area-efficient latch, namely, HALTRAV, featuring complete TNU-recovery. The storage portion of HALTRAV consists of 28 interlocked source-drain cross-coupled inverters (SCIs) for complete TNU-recovery with area efficiency and low delay. To mitigate the issue that node-upset-recovery verifications for existing latches highly relies on electronic design automation tools, we further propose an algorithm-based verification method that can automatically verify the node-upset-recovery of latches, which greatly simplifies the reliability-verification flow. Simulation results demonstrate the TNU-recovery of HALTRAV and also show that HALTRAV achieves 40.38%, 8.17%, and 31.89% reduction in delay, area, and delay-power&#8211;area product (DPAP) on average, respectively; however; it is at the cost of power as compared to typical latches that are TNU-recoverable. Comparison results also demonstrate the moderate sensitivity of HALTRAV to the impacts of the process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations.</description></item><item><title>ILRM: Imitation Learning-Based Resource Management for Integrated CPU&#8211;GPU Edge Systems With Renewable Energy Sources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10786322</link><description>This letter focuses on integrated CPU-GPU edge systems with renewable energy sources and studies the resource management problem to minimize the energy consumption of real-time tasks while ensuring temperature and reliability constraints. We propose an imitation learning (IL)-based resource management scheme, ILRM, implemented in two phases: 1) offline Oracle generation and 2) online IL. In the offline phase, we design a fast-converging heuristic to generate near-optimal solutions (i.e., Oracles) for training an online prediction model. In the online phase, we realize IL using the trained model that predicts the resource configuration policies for the incoming task sets to be scheduled. A data aggregation method is also developed to enhance the robustness of the prediction model. We validate ILRM through extensive experiments on both simulated and real integrated CPU-GPU edge platforms.</description></item><item><title>Vision Transformer Acceleration via a Versatile Attention Optimization Framework</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10782988</link><description>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success across various tasks. However, their deployment is hindered by challenges, such as high memory requirements, long inference latency, and significant power consumption. To address these challenges, existing works optimize one of the two key stages on ViT&#8217;s critical path: linear projection or self-attention. Regrettably, we have noticed that both linear projection and self-attention can potentially become bottlenecks as the input image resolution varies, which makes the existing approaches lack generality. Accordingly, in this article, we propose a versatile attention optimization framework. On the algorithm side, we present a SpQuant algorithm that sparsifies weight matrices offline and input matrices online during linear projection as well as tunes the bit-width of the probabilities matrix according to their importance. On the hardware side, we design SQArch architectures to improve the performance of the SpQuant algorithm. The proposed SQArch architecture offers a low-cost preprocess module that predicts and prunes nonkey elements of the input matrix on the fly. Moreover, we design a compute module that supports sparse-sparse matrix multiplications (SpMSpM) and multiple precision computations on a single systolic array for generality. Furthermore, we can address the underutilization and workload imbalance problems by 1) decoupling the rows in the systolic array for enough flexibility and 2) proposing a workload balance scheme for SpMSpM that allows the array to accept data of similar sparsity, thereby reducing synchronization between computing units. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that SQArch can achieve satisfactory performance speedups and energy saving compared to state-of-the-art designs.</description></item><item><title>SPLIM: Bridging the Gap Between Unstructured SpGEMM and Structured In-Situ Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10816181</link><description>Sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) is a critical kernel widely employed in machine learning and graph algorithms. However, high sparsity of real-world matrices makes SpGEMM memory-intensive. In-situ computing offers the potential to accelerate memory-intensive applications through high bandwidth and parallelism. Nevertheless, the irregular distribution of nonzeros renders software SpGEMM computation unstructured. In contrast, in-situ hardware platforms follow a fixed computation pattern, making them structured. The mismatch between unstructured software and structured hardware leads to suboptimal performance of current solutions. In this article, we propose SPLIM, a novel in-situ computing SpGEMM accelerator. SPLIM involves two innovations. First, we present a novel computation paradigm that converts SpGEMM into structured in-situ multiplication and unstructured accumulation. Second, we develop a unique coordinates alignment method utilizing in-situ search operations, effectively transforming unstructured accumulation into highly parallel search operations. Our experimental results demonstrate that SPLIM achieves  $276\times $  performance improvement and  $687\times $  energy saving compared to NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU.</description></item></channel></rss>
