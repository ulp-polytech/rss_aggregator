In full-Si-based VSIs, PWM-induced high-frequency electromagnetic noise is an inherent limitation in motor drive applications. Although increasing PWM frequency can mitigate these noises for inductive loads, it also leads to higher switching power loss. To reduce the ratio of switching power loss to PWM frequency, the proposed two-stage VSI, comprising eight insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) and utilizing the specialized modulation strategy, creates zero-voltage-switching and zero-current-switching conditions without relying on resonant circuits. The effectiveness of this approach has been verified through experiments conducted on a prototype driving a 5.0 kW sensorless interior permanent magnet synchronous motor. For conventional space vector PWM, increasing the PWM frequency by 1 kHz adds 16.8 W of inverter power loss. In contrast, for the specialized modulation strategy in the proposed two-stage VSI, increasing the PWM frequency by 1 kHz only adds 9.1 W of inverter power loss. Experiments verify a significant reduction in the ratio of switching power loss to PWM frequency, enabling higher PWM frequency to effectively suppress harmonic distortion and acoustic noise in inductive loads.</description></item><item><title>State-of-Charge Estimation of Automotive Lithium-Ion Batteries during Lack of Input Data Update</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10817521</link><description>Accurate states monitoring and timely diagnosis of energy storage device for electric vehicles are important, and they depend on the data collected by a large number of sensors. High-frequency vibration and loose connectors make the local sensors fail in the long term, which causes the abnormal collection of data and states monitoring. In this article, a state estimation method based on the bidirectional long-short term memory (Bi-LSTM) and least square support vector regression (LSSVR) is proposed to correct the abnormal data when measured data are missing or stagnant. The simultaneous input and state estimation (SISE) algorithm is used in state monitoring. This method combines SISE algorithm and the dual data-driven correction mechanism based on Bi-LSTM and LSSVR, and SISE algorithm is used to solve the problem of input data anomaly in state-of-charge estimation, which enables simultaneous estimation and correction of both system input and state. In experiments, the error of the proposed method is kept at about 5% at six cases of mixed abnormal test conditions, thus it is proved to be effective.</description></item><item><title>Synchronous Operation Analysis and Control for Single-Converter Dual-Switched Reluctance Motor System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10839623</link><description>To reduce the space and the cost of multiple power converters in multimotor systems, this article focuses on the single-converter dual-switched reluctance motor (SRM) system. Based on the mathematical model of SRM and the inductance characteristics relationship of the dual SRMs, the inherent behavior of phase current self-regulation in a single-converter dual-SRM system is introduced, where the dual SRMs can spontaneously regulate their phase current to overcome the unbalanced load. However, when the unbalanced load is further expanded, the dual-SRM system is prone to collapse due to its expanded position difference. For this, several synchronous control strategies are proposed based on the behavior of phase current self-regulation. The proposed average position signal control (APSC) strategy adopts the average position of SRM1 and SRM2 as the feedback position signal, effectively promoting the synchronous operation of the dual-SRM system under the expanded unbalanced load. In addition, the proposed switching position signal control (SPSC) strategy can also achieve it by switching the position signals from those of SRM1 and SRM2. Comparing these two strategies, when the system enters a stable operating state, the APSC strategy is wiser one due to its lower speed fluctuation. When the working condition is changed and the system is in a dynamic state, the SPSC strategy is wiser one because it greatly accelerates the synchronization process of the dual SRMs, enabling them to reach the stable operating state faster. Comprehensively considering their advantages, a synchronous control strategy combining these two strategies (APSC+SPSC) is proposed, which can achieve a better synchronous operation performance of the single-converter dual-SRM system. Finally, experiments are conducted to observe the behavior of phase current self-regulation in the dual-SRM system and to verify the effectiveness of the proposed synchronous control strategies.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Induction Motor Drive for Variable Speed Industrial Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10850729</link><description>Integration of motor and power converter while leveraging wide-bandgap devices represents an emerging trend in motor drive systems, offering reduction in complexity, compactness, and cost savings. However, the integration of power converters into motors poses several challenges including limited space, high temperatures, and exposure to leaking magnetic flux within electric machines. This study presents a gallium nitride high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT)-based integrated motor drive (IMD) system, where the printed circuit board (PCB) layout of the power stage is optimized and the thermal dissipation is enhanced through a redesign of the endcap. Additionally, a single-phase power factor correction front-end with a power pulsation buffer is proposed to integrate a rectifier into the motor. Experimental tests validate the variable frequency operation of the integrated system. This article addresses remedies to challenges in design of integrated power converter, electromagnetic compatibility, and thermal management. The proposed solution includes a power pulsation buffer to reduce dc-link capacitance and an optimal half-bridge layout to minimize stray inductance, thereby enhancing the performance of the IMD system.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Single-Phase Transformerless TC-UPQC With Reduced DC-Link Voltage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829738</link><description>A novel single-phase transformerless three-capacitor unified power quality conditioner (TC-UPQC) is proposed to manage grid current and stabilize load voltage. It consists of two active capacitors and one buffer capacitor. One active capacitor is applied for resisting grid voltage fluctuations and the other is connected in series with a buffer capacitor to supply current compensating. The voltages of active capacitors are regulated by internal half-bridge voltage-source converters (VSCs) and the buffer capacitor bears the remaining voltage imposed by load voltage. Thus, the magnitude difference between the two active capacitor voltages could be decreased and superior modulation degrees could be obtained. Besides, dc-link voltage could be greatly reduced by decreasing the magnitude of active capacitor voltages. Correspondingly, power balance control is proposed for the coordinate operations of VSCs and the regulation of dc-link voltage. In this regard, active power is embedded in voltage and current compensating to improve the flexibility of operation even without an external bi-directional dc power supply. Simulation platform and laboratorial prototype are established to validate the effectiveness of the proposed TC-UPQC.</description></item><item><title>High-Frequency Current Transformer Design and Analysis for Partial Discharge Detection of Power Electronic Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829543</link><description>In medium-voltage applications, silicon carbide has a promising future due to its higher switching speed, higher thermal conductivity, and higher voltage levels. Meanwhile, higher voltage levels and higher power density put severe stress on the insulation structure. Partial discharge (PD) is an important characterization for the performance of insulation structure. However, there is limited research on dedicated design for PD current sensing systems, and there is also a lack of analysis of the frequency-domain characteristics of PD and system noise. In view of this situation, first, the high-frequency current transformer (HFCT) system is proposed, and the circuit model is established to analyze the influence of parameters on the frequency response and gain. Second, based on the analysis, a special HFCT system was designed for the characteristics of PD of power electronic power modules, including signal front-end circuits, and the correctness of the theoretical analysis was verified by a vector network analyzer. The system was calibrated and proved to capture the 10-pC charge with relative accuracy. Finally, the PD detection experiment of the power module is carried out, and the proposed system can effectively detect the PD signal in the time domain.</description></item><item><title>On the Sensitivity Analysis in Reliability Evaluation for Power Electronic Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10842466</link><description>Power electronic converters are essential in modern electrical and electronic applications, necessitating the study on power electronic reliability for dependable design and operation. In earlier research on power electronic reliability, the mission profiles have been mapped to thermal stresses and lifetimes, while its applications are generally focused on steady-state scenarios. It turns out to be time-consuming and inefficient to repeat the entire procedures for addressing the impact of stress variances or model uncertainties. In this context, this article defines the sensitivity for power electronic reliability and provides a sensitivity-based perspective on system optimization, where the concept is formulated through two steps, accounting for thermal stresses and lifetime, respectively. The applications of sensitivities for thermal stresses and lifetime are demonstrated, which serve as identifiers of critical factors and quantitative metrics of marginal performances. Upon this, possibilities are also emerging for enhancing the cost-effectiveness of reliability validations and encompassing model robustness into reliability analysis and prediction.</description></item><item><title>Investigation on Creep-Fatigue Interaction Failure of Die-Attach Solder Layers in IGBTs Under Power Cycling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10844329</link><description>Creep plays a significant role in the deterioration of solder layers particularly over extended periods of heating, even though numerous existing studies focused on the mechanism of fatigue failure. In this article, the creep-fatigue interaction failure mechanism of the solder layer under power cycling test (PCT) is investigated. The microstructure of solder layer was successively scanned using an ultrahigh resolution computed tomography scanner to observe the degradation of the microstructure. It is found that the microstructure of the solder layer had obvious changes even when the thermal resistance remains unchanged. The initial voids in the solder layer are constantly collapsing and new voids are constantly growing out. This is different from the previous finding that the solder layer degrades by cracks initiating and propagating under short heating in PCT. The reason for this result is that creep becomes the dominant factor in the degradation of solder layer. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) scanning of the solder layer after failure showed that microcracks also existed, but their distribution was more dispersed, making it difficult to determine their crack initiation locations and propagation paths. Therefore, the failure of the solder layer under longer heating period and higher temperatures is considered to be a complex creep-fatigue interaction failure process. Finally, a thermal resistance degradation model is proposed, which can accurately predict the change of the thermal resistance during module degradation.</description></item><item><title>Trends and Influencing Factors in Power-Converter Reliability of Wind Turbines: A Deepened Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10848244</link><description>Based on comprehensive field data covering more than 22&#8201;000 operating years of onshore and offshore wind turbines on five different continents, we present failure rates for the main components of the converter system, investigate their failure behavior with respect to trends and identify both design-related and site-specific factors having a significant effect on converter reliability. All converter components show prominent early failure behavior followed by a transition straight to degradation failures. Several design factors are identified as significant reliability drivers: Namely the cooling concept of the converter, its position inside the wind turbine, its rated capacity, as well as the IGBT-module manufacturer. In addition, a susceptibility to the environmental influences of mean absolute ambient humidity, mean ambient temperature, installation height and mean capacity factor is identified and quantified.</description></item><item><title>Transient Synchronous Stability Analysis of PMSG Grid-Connected System Considering Transient Switching Control Under Severe Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10824830</link><description>Transient switching control (TSC) of renewable equipment under severe faults makes transient characteristics of new-type power systems much more complicated. Although most of recent studies focused on the during-fault stage under low voltage ride through of grid-connected converters or detailed electromagnetic transient simulations, a unified understanding of entire transient process of permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) grid-connected system is still lacking. Therefore, based on the TSC schemes of PMSG, this article considers the switching dynamical effects in detail, divides the transient process into four distinctive stages: prefault, during-fault, early postfault, and late postfault, and establishes the corresponding mechanism models with the associated machine&#8211;network interface relations for each stage. Furthermore, the influence of major parameters on the transient stability is studied, including the infinite-bus voltage dip depth and grid-side converter active current on the during-fault stage, and the active current climbing rate on the early postfault stage. It is also found that the large-disturbance stability on the sole during-fault stage is only a sufficient condition, but not a necessary condition, and actually the system after all four sequential stages can be stable under wider parameter regions. These findings are supported by wide numerical and experimental verification, and could provide a theoretical basis for transient synchronous stability analysis of PMSG grid-connected system.</description></item><item><title>Leakage Current Suppression for Dual-DC-Port DC&#8211;AC Converter in PV-Battery Hybrid System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10838316</link><description>Since the high efficiency and low cost of single-stage power conversion, dual-dc-port dc&#8211;ac converters have been used in photovoltaic (PV)-battery hybrid systems. However, achieving leakage current suppression in this configuration is challenging due to its coupling characteristics in terms of common-mode voltage (CMV) reduction and power distribution. To deal with this issue, a method using unbalanced large, medium, and small vector modulation with CMV transition reduction is proposed in this article. First, the CMV of voltage vectors is calculated and sorted under different voltage conditions. Then, for the purpose of reducing CMV transition, the switching interval between vectors is at most one vector in a switching sequence according to sorting relations. In addition, high CMV small vector sequences and medium vector sequences can be used as independent power control sequences to help achieve battery charging and discharging. Finally, to realize flexible power regulation, a new power control scheme is proposed to balance the PV power fluctuation by the battery power exchanged, which can provide the discharge/charge sequences with different control capabilities. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the experiment at the end of this article.</description></item><item><title>Accuracy Evaluation and Enhancement Method for Measuring Frequency Coupling Characteristics Based on Generalized Signal-to-Noise Ratio Index</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10839130</link><description>Impedance measurement is an effective method to obtain the dynamic characteristics of a renewable energy generator. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is an important index to analyze the noise resistance of measurement and to ensure measurement accuracy. Existing research on SNR primarily focuses on single-input single-output impedance models. Frequency coupling characteristics make the impedance multiple-input multiple-output models. Measuring frequency coupling characteristics involves the intertwinement of eight measurement signals. As a result, solely relying on the SNR of each individual measurement signal cannot accurately reflect measurement accuracy, nor can it provide a theoretical basis for improving measurement accuracy. In this article, considering the intertwinement of eight measurement signals and frequency coupling characteristics, a generalized-SNR (GSNR) index is proposed to evaluate the accuracy and depicted as error bars in Bode diagram. Moreover, a GSNR-based accuracy enhancement method, including quantitative design of perturbation amplitudes and overlap extraction of multiple error bars, are proposed to realize the broadband accurate measurement. Finally, control-hardware-in-loop experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Power Management for Off-Grid Hydrogen-Electric Coupling System Considering Electrolyzer Temperature-Varying Characteristics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10855506</link><description>Off-grid hydrogen production by alkaline water electrolyzers (AWEs) is a promising way to consume renewable energy sources (RESs). However, restricted by the slow electrolyzer temperature-rising process, the AWEs cannot start in a short time. The utilization of RESs is greatly curtailed during the temperature-rising period of AWEs. In this article, a power management method for an off-grid hydrogen-electric coupling system is proposed to solve this problem. First, the thermal-electric model of AWEs is established. The model depicts the relationship between the electrolyzer temperature and electrolyzer maximum power. Second, a power management method is developed. The core of the method is that the AWE will be preheated in advance by the battery (BAT). When the power of RESs rises, the AWEs can start in a short time and consume more power. Finally, the proposed method is verified on a photovoltaic-AWE-BAT experimental platform. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can achieve power sharing among different units. For the 2.5-kW AWE, the maximum power that the electrolyzer can consume is raised from 59.12% to 96.56% rated power before the RES power rises. Thus, the power regulation flexibility of AWEs can be improved greatly.</description></item><item><title>Quasi-Transformer Mode Control of Interlinking Converter for Multivoltage Levels DC Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856813</link><description>In this article, the concept of quasi-transformer (Quasi-T) mode control is proposed for dc&#8211;dc interlinking converter. In multivoltage level dc systems, the interlinking converter serves for voltage conversion and mutual power support. The traditional operating modes for converters can be classified into constant voltage, current, power, or a mix of them. In the duality of dc&#8211;dc converter in dc grid, the ac transformers in the traditional ac grid maintain the proportional relationship between the input and output voltage. By combining constant voltage mode with equivalent transformer mode, system stability can be enhanced through the design of compensator and weight coefficients. The small-signal model of the interlinking converter with Quasi-T mode control is first established, and the control design method is analyzed according to the passivity-based stability criterion. The Quasi-T mode control design ensures steady-state voltage regulation and improves the dynamic response of the dc system. The steady-state operation, control design process, and influencing factors are comparatively evaluated through numerical simulations and experimental results, in verification of the enhanced system stability.</description></item><item><title>Water Failure Diagnosis of PEMFC in Actual Operating Conditions With High-Frequency Impedance Features</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10815612</link><description>The water failures decline the performance of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system remarkably in practical applications. Nevertheless, precise diagnosis of water faults remains challenging due to their intricate nature and the difficulty in distinguishing similar water states. This complexity is further enlarged for diagnosing the high-power stacks. Motivated by this, a water fault diagnostic method is proposed in this article based on the high-frequency electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) features. This approach employs 6 EIS features within the 157 Hz to 2 kHz frequency band. The sensitivity of each feature to water state is elucidated utilizing the entropy-weight method, thereby enhancing the discrimination capability to similar water states. Furthermore, a novel autonomous fuzzy clustering algorithm is exploited for clustering analysis of the water failures from practical experiments. The proposed method achieves 93.10% fault recognition accuracy during the application on the commercial PEMFC system under a varying-load condition. By narrowing down the frequency range, the proposed method reduces the diagnostic time by 84.86% while improving the accuracy of diagnosis significantly.</description></item><item><title>Analysis of Cogging Torque in a Series Hybrid Variable Flux Machine for EV Using Lumped Magnetic Circuit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10839085</link><description>One of the major problems in the series hybrid variable flux machine (SVFM) is cogging torque. This article tries to compute cogging torque in a 36-slot 6-pole SVFM where the higher coercive force N48SH magnet is in series with the lower coercive force AlNiCo9 magnet. A lumped magnetic circuit for the SVFM including magnetic saturation is proposed and the analytical equations are developed to compute the air-gap flux density in an equivalent slot-less machine. The parameters of the lumped magnetic circuit are computed based on the magnetic flux lines in a slot-less machine obtained using the finite-element analysis (FEA) method. The air-gap flux density in the slot-less six-pole SVFM is calculated using the developed lumped magnetic circuit model at different magnetization levels of the AlNiCo9 magnet. The error between the analytical and FEA results of air-gap flux density is less than 4% at lower magnetization levels. Thus, the lumped magnetic circuit can be validated. The relative air-gap permeance function for the SVFM with the series magnets (N48SH and AlNiCo9) is defined. By utilizing the air-gap flux density in an equivalent slot-less machine and the relative air-gap permeance function, the cogging torque of the 36-slot 6-pole SVFM is computed and compared to the analytical and experimental results at different magnetization levels of the AlNiCo9 magnet. The results show that the computed cogging torque of the 36-slot 6-pole SVFM follows the FEA and experimental results at different magnetization levels of AlNiCo9 magnet. The back electromotive force, power factor, efficiency, and electromagnetic torque are analyzed including magnetic saturation in FEA and compared with analytically computed results at different magnetization levels of AlNiCo9 magnet.</description></item><item><title>A Three-Phase Unfolding-Based Solid-State Traction Transformer for Railway Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10839619</link><description>In this article, a solid-state transformer-based three-phase unfolding powertrain is proposed for railway traction applications. Solid-state transformers are being explored as viable alternatives to line-frequency transformers in railway drivetrains. Conventionally, their back-end employs a low-frequency, two-level pulsewidth modulation (PWM) inverter to drive the motor, which is prone to generating high pulsating torques due to switching frequency constraints. The proposed system, however, eliminates the need for PWM switching in the inverter stage and produces balanced three-phase sinusoidal voltages at the output to drive the motor. This effectively eliminates low-frequency harmonics and reduces torque pulsations. These sinusoidal voltages are achieved by generating pulsating dc voltages at the output of the dc&#8211;dc stage, minimizing the need for large dc-link capacitors. The varying voltages are then unfolded by a fundamental frequency switching inverter, which, combined with zero-voltage switching in the dc&#8211;dc stage, reduces the switching losses. This article details the operational principle and control strategy of the proposed converter, offering comprehensive insights into its functionality. To validate the effectiveness of the topology, extensive simulations are conducted at a 5-MW power level using MATLAB/Simulink. In addition, the practicality of the proposed topology is demonstrated on a scaled-down experimental prototype with a 5-hp induction motor load.</description></item><item><title>Problem Analysis and Improvement of Traditional Efficiency Optimization Method for Inductive Power Transfer Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10621648</link><description>Due to the wide range of battery terminal voltage variations caused by the different states of charge of power batteries in electric vehicles, and due to the consideration of interoperability among different vehicle models, inductive wireless charging systems are required to be able to cope with a wide range of voltage conditions to realize high efficiency. Phase shift control is often considered to be an effective means to fulfill this goal. However, traditional optimization methods exclude the zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) constraints from the optimization objective, leading to non-optimal solutions under some operating conditions. Therefore, an optimization method based on the optimal numerical solution, which further exploits the efficiency potential of the system by disregarding the presuppositions about the ac voltage gain in the traditional optimization methods is proposed in this article. As an adjunct, a ZVS realization method considering higher harmonics based on two hybrid phase-shift regulation strategies is also proposed that can be adapted to any reasonable ZVS current setting and achieve more accurate tracking. Afterward, the applicability of the traditional and improved methods is analyzed accordingly, followed by a comparison verification based on a small-scale experimental platform.</description></item><item><title>Phase Synchronization Method Based on Self-Oscillation Mode for Bidirectional EC-WPT System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10757369</link><description>Bidirectional electric-field coupled wireless power transfer (EC-WPT) technology with bilateral physical isolation enables energy interaction between electrical devices. Phase desynchronization of the output voltages generated by the primary and secondary converters causes issues such as periodic variations in the relative phase difference and continuous oscillations in the output power. Therefore, this article proposes a phase synchronization method based on self-oscillation mode that can tolerate misalignment of coupling plates in the bidirectional EC-WPT system. The method analyzes the effect of coupling capacitances variation on the soft-switching operating points by establishing a stroboscopic mapping model of the system, and provides a stable resonant frequency operating at the maximum amplitude-frequency gain. Based on the principle of self-oscillation, the system autonomously drives the bilateral converters by tracking the zero-crossing points of the resonant currents and ultimately operates at a stable resonant frequency for precise phase synchronization. It operates without the need for complicated computation, additional complex analog circuits, and is not affected by the variation of coupling capacitances. The experimental results show good agreement with the simulation results, validating that the effectiveness of the proposed phase synchronization method for the bidirectional EC-WPT system.</description></item><item><title>Dual-Band Rectifier Using Coupled Inductor for Wireless Power Transfer Receivers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10812676</link><description>This article proposes a dual-band wireless power receiver capable of both kHz-band and MHz-band wireless charging.

This mode change requires no active elements, additional sensing circuits, or external control signals. Therefore, the proposed circuit can be utilized as a low-cost, high-power-density dual-band wireless power receiver. The proposed circuit is verified through a prototype supporting 45 W low-frequency charging and 20 W high-frequency charging.</description></item><item><title>Tuning Control Against Coupler Parameter Variations Due to Misalignment in an Optimal-Efficiency-Tracking and Constant-Power-Output IPT System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10820831</link><description>In inductive power transfer (IPT) systems, air gap variations can cause fluctuations in the parameters of the loosely coupled transformers (LCT), potentially compromising resonant tank performance, output stability, and transfer efficiency. To address this issue, this article introduces a novel multiloop control strategy for a single-stage power-source IPT system. Specifically, the proposed system replaces traditional compensation capacitors with switch-controlled capacitors on both sides and incorporates a semiactive rectifier on the secondary side. On this basis, a control strategy is identified and implemented with three loops, including a secondary tuning loop using a gradient descent method to counteract coupler parameter variations due to misalignment, a load matching loop for tracking optimal efficiency and a primary-side input impedance tuning loop for maintaining constant power output. This strategy maintains optimal efficiency and constant power output despite dynamic variations in LCT parameters, coupling coefficients, and load conditions. Notably, it eliminates the need for direct detection of LCT self-inductance and mutual inductance parameter variations. Furthermore, the system operates at a fixed frequency and achieves zero-voltage switching, enhancing overall efficiency. Finally, a 500 W experimental setup is established to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system.</description></item><item><title>Interoperability and Misalignment Tolerance of Electric Vehicle Wireless Charging System Based on Multiple Self-Decoupled Transmitting Coils and Vector Synthesis Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829741</link><description>In wireless power transfer (WPT) systems for electric vehicles (EVs), interoperability and misalignment tolerance for different receiving charging terminals meet great demands. In this article, a hybrid topology with a vector synthesis strategy and highly integrated magnetic couplers are proposed to achieve misalignment tolerance and interoperability for unipolar (Q), bipolar (DD), and quadrupolar (QUA) coils over the X and Y misalignments.

To overcome this problem, the current phase of the domino coils is first analyzed so that the impedance relationship of cross-coupling in its corresponding coil loop is found. The analytical formula for computing the resonant compensation capacitance is then derived according to the current phase configuration with 90 degrees of decline gradient. It can achieve the load-independent zero phase angle and constant outputs simultaneously in a single-energy flow transmission mode. Then the domino coils are further extended to the transmission mode with multienergy flow paths that can be planned by configuring the current phase. Finally, a general capacitance calculation method is proposed for different energy flow path planning. Prototypes of seven-coil domino system and six-coil domino system are constructed. Experimental results show that seven-coil domino system with the single energy flow path achieves the constant voltage of 29.55 V and a dc&#8211;dc efficiency of 83.69%.

Specifically, the magnetic field generated by the transmitter coil and receiver coil is analytically studied, and an improved compensation parameter design is presented to achieve a lower magnetic field distribution. Besides, it also compares the stray magnetic field distribution characteristics of the improved design described in this article with that of the conventional design widely used for the parallel coupler. Finally, a system is implemented to verify the low stray magnetic field distribution characteristics.

The proposed PPC-WiOBC can operate in two modes: 1) charging mode and 2) driving mode. During charging mode, a dual decoupled four-coil system is utilized to charge the HVB with a constant-current or constant-voltage charging profile and provide a constant dc voltage for AS. The surplus power will flow through the AS to the HVB via an auxiliary dc&#8211;dc converter. In driving mode, the auxiliary dc&#8211;dc converter operates backwards and the HVB supplies power to the AS. To meet high-efficiency and bidirectional operation requirements, an auxiliary LC-LLC multiresonant dc&#8211;dc converter, incorporating an additional inductor is introduced. A power ratio &#948; of the PPC is also introduced to ensure high efficiency. Finally, a comprehensive system parameter design of the PPC-WiOBC is proposed. Experimental results from a scale-down 1 kW experimental platform verify the performance of the proposed PPC-WiOBC, with output voltage ranges from 264 V to 402 V, a peak efficiency of 94.1%, and efficiency &gt;87.1% throughout the whole charging profile, which is superior to the conventional wireless OBC solutions.</description></item><item><title>Magnetic Field Energy Harvesting and Power Management With Transfer Window Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10836874</link><description>Magnetic field energy harvesters (MEHs) are widely used to supply wireless monitoring devices in power systems. Shorting the MEH to move the energy transfer window is proven to be efficient in enhancing the harvested power. However, magnetizing current losses in a short-circuiting phase were usually ignored, making the maximum power harvesting dependent on approximate calculation and empirical design. Additionally, a practical power management system has not yet been developed. This article proposes a novel power management system for MEHs based on transfer window modulation (TWM). The output characteristic of MEH is analyzed with magnetizing current losses considered. It guides a more accurate estimation of the transfer window and allows the optimal transfer window to be designed through numerical calculation. Furthermore, a TWM approach is proposed to achieve voltage regulation by modulating the length of the transfer window. Finally, a self-powered MEH system is designed with an active rectifier and bidirectional dc&#8211;dc converter. Experiments show the root mean squared error of the calculated window length is 3.6% for the proposed model and 10.3% for the traditional model. By designing the number of coil turns, the transfer window is optimized through numerical calculation rather than empirical design. The harvested power reaches 80.9% of the maximum potential of MEH. Voltage regulation is also achieved in the long-term operation test, with a voltage ripple of less than 0.15 V.</description></item><item><title>A Switchable Dual-Frequency LCC-S-S Compensated Three-Coil WPT System for Mobile Desktop Charging With Constant Current and Constant Voltage Outputs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10848333</link><description>Wireless power transfer (WPT) system with three-coil has potential application prospect in mobile desktop charging, since it can effectively increase the transmission distance. In practical applications, the typical constant current (CC) and constant voltage (CV) two-stage charging mode for batteries is widely utilized. However, the batteries&#8217; equivalent resistance remarkably varies during the charging process, to realize both CC and CV outputs with different load conditions is a confronting problem for WPT system. To address the issue, a hybrid LCC-S-S compensation topology with an ac switch is proposed in this article. The CC/CV output characteristics can be fulfilled through the alternation of two fixed system operation frequencies and the switching of an ac switch at the receiver side. Besides, the zero phase angle (ZPA) conditions are also been met at the same time. A 50 W output experimental prototype is implemented to validate relevant theoretical analysis. The experimental results show that the CC/CV output characteristics are well maintained while the load resistance undergoes widely variation. Moreover, the ZPA operation can be achieved when receiver coil is misaligned. During the whole charging procedure, the peak power transfer efficiency can reach 91.9%.</description></item><item><title>A Three-Phase AC Input Induction Heating System With Heat Distribution Control Capability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643990</link><description>This article proposes a new three-phase ac input induction heating (IH) system for plate heating. The proposed system consists of three sets of a direct ac&#8211;ac converter and a pancake-shaped work coil. Each phase uses the set of the converter and the coil. In the proposed system, the three work coils are arranged in a triangular shape with a certain distance to eliminate mutual induction between them. Therefore, each converter can operate independently. The proposed system uses this independence to realize a power factor correction (PFC) operation of ac-line currents. Also, the proposed system can control heat generation on a workpiece above a center of the three coils by using the independence. The proposed system with heat distribution control capability is theoretically considered, and it is also validated experimentally. As a result, the proposed system demonstrates both the PFC operation of the ac-line currents and heat distribution control at the rated power of 3 kW.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Model Predictive SHM Control for Zero CMV in Three-Phase Five-/Nine-Level Packed E-Cell Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10649585</link><description>This article proposes a hybrid model predictive selective harmonic mitigation (SHM) to design a multiobjective switching control where zero common mode voltage (CMV), harmonic distortion mitigation, capacitor voltage balancing, and switching voltage-level operation are aimed in three-phase packed E-cell (PEC) inverter. SHM is developed for low frequency five-/nine-level voltages to improve power quality and achieve zero CMV. Afterward, SHM is hybridized with model predictive control (MPC) to select switching states in an online procedure and then actively balance PEC capacitor voltages. Due to MPC-based implementation of SHM, the switching voltage-level is acquired where both five-/nine-level voltages can be generated in three-phase PEC inverter to demonstrate its capability in dealing with faulty switch conditions. Hybrid model predictive SHM switching control is proven through both hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) using OPAL-RT simulator and experimental implementation using DS1202 and the results illustrate that all targeted objectives are attained for low frequency five-/nine-level three-phase PEC inverter.</description></item><item><title>Characteristics Analysis of Resonant Topology in Three-Phase Wireless Power Transfer Systems Considering Star-Delta and Neutral Point Connections</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10646389</link><description>Three-phase wireless power transfer (WPT) systems have the advantages of higher power density and low power fluctuations. However, increasing the number of phases complicates the resonant topology structure of the system. Existing research lacks analysis of the unique electrical characteristics of three-phase resonant topologies, particularly regarding the star-delta and different connections of inductor and capacitor neutral points. This article derives the expressions for the resonant capacitance of first-order and second-order topologies under star-delta connections. After contrasting the voltage stresses on resonant components and system transmission characteristics under different star-delta connections, the suitable application scenarios for each connection method are provided. Utilizing the symmetrical component method, expressions for the voltage of inductor and capacitor neutral points under star connection are derived, and then the optimal neutral point connection topology for both balanced current control and independent current control scenarios is proposed. Finally, an experimental prototype is constructed to validate the theoretical analysis presented in this article.</description></item><item><title>Three-Dimensional Vector Multimapping-Based Power Split for Single-Stage Multiport Inverter-Fed Motor Drives</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10666911</link><description>Single-stage multiport inverter (SSMI) is an attractive solution for hybrid electric vehicles. However, it is challenging to design the modulation scheme for the SSMI since flexible power split between sources on the dc side together with satisfactory stator current control on the ac side should be achieved simultaneously. To this end, a three-dimensional vector multimapping (3DVM)-based power split strategy is proposed in this article to realize flexible power split while guaranteeing the stator current regulation under unbalanced dc links. In the proposed 3DVM scheme, the asymmetrical 3-D vector space is divided into two symmetrical subspaces to simplify the modulation scheme design under unbalanced dc links, and the reference vector decomposed process provides an additional degree of freedom for power split by regulating the decomposed factors. Subsequently, a direct power control model with respect to decomposing factors is put forward to realize power split between dc-port sources without affecting the stator current control. Moreover, by mapping the decomposed reference vectors to the edges and planes of the subspaces, the switching actions are reduced, which increases the power conversion efficiency. Experiments are carried out to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>A Communication-Free Fast Constant Current and Voltage Control Method for Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10644045</link><description>In this article, a communication-free constant current (CC) and constant voltage (CV) Li-ion charging control method for dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) systems is proposed. The key challenge of traditional control schemes is the coupled mutual inductance and battery equivalent resistance, which leads them to solely allow either dynamic coupling condition or varying load resistance. In the proposed control method, by adopting an inductive secondary resonator, the mutual inductance and load resistance are decoupled in CV mode. The output current and voltage are controlled by estimating the bias between the real-time state and the reference steady state. The CC and CV modes are switched automatically without bidirectional communication. Hence, the proposed control method is featured with less time delay, fast dynamic performance, and low implementation cost. Both the simulation and experimental results prove that the proposed control scheme has high control precision (less than 4% steady-state error) and short settling time (less than 40 ms) in the CC/CV charging mode.</description></item><item><title>Exploring a Controlled Permeability Bypass-Based and Simple Contact Mechanism for MPD System With Single Input and Multiple Outputs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654650</link><description>This article investigates a novel magnetic power distribution (MPD) system that utilizes conductive magnetic power transfer and wireless power transfer methods. The proposed system employs U- and I-type magnetic cores to form a single-input and multiple-output system, where the U-type magnetic core serves as the transmitter or receiver, and the I-type magnetic core acts as the flux conduction path. By inserting low relative permeability (LRP) I cores between two high relative permeability (HRP) I cores and placing additional U magnetic cores in parallel with the LRP I cores, multiple outputs with different power ratings can therefore be realized. Analysis of operating frequency and the effect of LRP I core on power distribution is presented in detail through theory and simulation. Finally, a prototype with a wide range output power of 200W-550W is tested to evaluate the performance of the proposed MPD system with one- and two-receiver modes, in which the system with a single receiver achieves 329W with a system efficiency of 82.77%, while the system with two receivers obtained a total output power of 422.73W with 86.98% system efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Accurate Design of Very-High-Frequency Resonant Converter Based on Gradient Descent and Considering Multiple Harmonics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10649017</link><description>Due to the inherent strong coupling and nonlinearity in typical very-high-frequency (VHF, 30&#8211;300&#160;MHz) resonant converters, conventional design methods face challenges in considering multiple harmonics and identifying their complex coupling relationships, which limits the design accuracy of resonant parameters. In order to solve this issue, this article presents a new design method, which involves considering multiple harmonics for the separate design of the inverter and rectifier stages and identify their coupling relationships by using the gradient descent algorithm. The simulation result shows that the output power, particularly the soft-switching feature are very consistent with the design requirement. Compared to the conventional design methods, the proposed one in theoretical design has higher accuracy and reduces dependence on simulation tools, which helps to guide the further consideration of parasitic parameters in practical design and develop it into a computer program for easier application. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are experimentally verified by a 30&#160;MHz prototype with a rated input power of 20W.</description></item><item><title>A Solenoid Magnetic Coupler and Its Control Method for Omnidirectional Wireless Charging of UAVs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10660634</link><description>This article proposes a solenoid magnetic coupler for omnidirectional wireless charging of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which has a compact structure, high rotational and lateral misalignment tolerance, and low-leakage magnetic flux interference. The transmitter consists of two groups of orthogonal and mutually decoupled solenoid coils, which mainly generate horizontal (x-, y-direction) magnetic flux, and almost no vertical (z-direction) magnetic flux is generated. Hence, it can significantly reduce the leakage magnetic flux interference on UAV equipment. The solenoid receiver is attached to the UAV landing gear, which is lightweight and does not require additional installation space. To achieve maximum efficiency tracking under arbitrary angles and positions, a targeted omnidirectional wireless power transfer (WPT) method consisting of mutual inductance identification, phase difference configuration, and duty cycle optimization is presented. The experimental results show that the system output power and efficiency are maintained at 130&#8211;176 W and 84.1%&#8211;86.1% under arbitrary rotational and lateral misalignments.</description></item><item><title>Asymmetrical Low-Voltage Ride-Through Control Strategy Based-on PBC With Virtual Voltage Compensation for Voltage-Controlled VSG</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10644048</link><description>Grid-forming (GFM) inverters have the advantages of voltage and frequency support in weak grid. However, unlike grid-following inverters, GFM inverters present a more challenging picture during asymmetrical voltage sag. The voltage-controlled virtual synchronous generator (VVSG) is the typical control method of GFM inverter. However, the problem of large inrush, slow response speed, and negative-sequence current control need to be carefully considered. In the existing low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) control strategies, these issues cannot be decently coped with while maintaining the ability to support the grid. In this situation, system instability and deterioration of power quality may occur. To overcome these limitations, an asymmetrical LVRT control strategy is proposed. First, the positive and negative-sequence models are established and the asymmetrical instantaneous currents are calculated. Based on this, the influences of the VVSG control method on the instantaneous negative-sequence currents are analyzed, which reveals the role of negative-sequence virtual voltage amplitude, grid phase angle, and response speed. Then, the double closed-loop control based on VVSG control method is further improved. The negative-sequence virtual voltage is compensated in the outer-loop to achieve control of negative-sequence current and inrush current. A novel passivity-based control (PBC) strategy is extended into innerloop which has fast transient response and strong robustness. Furthermore, through the transient power angle stability analysis, the improvement of the transient margin is proved. Finally, simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>DC-Link Zero Power Fluctuation of Grid-Tied Inverters: Implementation With Two-Phase Virtual Phase-Current Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654638</link><description>Unbalanced grid conditions caused by asymmetrical faults or voltage distortions extremely deteriorate the grid reliability, resulting in power fluctuation of three-phase grid-tied inverters at dc link. A virtual phase-current regulation (VPCR) method is introduced in previous research to solve the power quality problem depending on controller feedback current regulation. With VPCR, the dc-link power fluctuation can be suppressed, whereas cannot be completely removed. To fulfill this gap, a novel two-phase VPCR method is proposed in this article, in which an additional virtual phase current gain in the non-fault phase has been introduced into the current loop. Since more VPCR parameter adjustments can be realized, a complete smoothing of dc-link power fluctuation is achieved by the proposed method. Accordingly, based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, a parameter tuning method of two-phase VPCR is designed to achieve a fast and convenient parameter optimization. The proposed two-phase VPCR method as an emerging tool of dc-link power quality governance is verified by simulation and experiment.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Multilayer Master-Slave Control Strategy for Power Management in Autonomous DC Microgrid Clusters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10665922</link><description>DC microgrid clusters are effective solutions for integrating multiple autonomous subgrids at the same and different voltage levels. In such a system, global power management is an essential concern, but it is always degraded by system structures and line impedances of distributed generation units (DGUs). To solve this problem, a decentralized multilayer master-slave control strategy is proposed. In the selected master DGU, an ac signal is injected into the output voltage, and power information is carried by its frequency and consequently broadcast to other slave DGUs via power lines. In slave DGUs, the output power is regulated to track the demodulated power information, which generates voltage offset to realize power sharing in a single subgrid. The interlinking converter is exploited for interconnection between two subgrids, it is also used to transmit the broadcast power information from one subgrid to another one, which therefore ensures global power management throughout the dc microgrid cluster. All the control algorithms rely on only local measurement, and information transmission is implemented via existing power lines, no dedicated communication network is required. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated by hardware-in-loop and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>A Sigmoid-Weighted-Consensus for Balancing Multiple Battery Energy Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10665931</link><description>In this article, a weighted-consensus strategy for state-of-charge (SoC) balancing, voltage regulation and accurate current sharing in a dc microgrid (MG) composed of battery energy storage systems (BESSs) is presented. The&#160;consensus strategy is applied in association with a S-shape function known as sigmoid function, a common activation function in neural networks. By a neighbor-to-neighbor communication, each BESS exchange its SoC information to achieve faster SoC balancing and uses only its capacity for accurate current sharing. The&#160;sigmoid functions ensure continuity and differentiability of the system around the charging/discharging of the BESSs and guarantee the SoC balancing even if the graph becomes disconnected by communication failures or if the consensus is switched-off. As each BESS uses its own information in the weighted-consensus, the resilience against attacks and communication time-delays is increased. When all SoCs are within operational limits, the strategy avoids circulating currents in the MG by forcing all BESSs either charge or discharge simultaneously. However, if the SoC limits are violated, simultaneous charge and discharge among BESSs in a low rate is allowed to satisfy the limits. Experimental tests show the feasibility of the proposed approach and its faster SoC balancing in relation to advanced methods in the literature.</description></item><item><title>A Three Coordinated Power Channels LLC Converter With Ultrawide Voltage Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10662954</link><description>To achieve ultrawide output voltage range, this paper proposes a novel isolated LLC resonant converter with three coordinated power channels. The proposed converter features three working conditions and encompasses five operation patterns, allowing for the adjustment of quality factor for a wider gain range. With more power channels, the converter can reduce the stress of the resonant tank and switches to further improve the higher power level and achieve the soft switching. To ensure smooth gain transition and a wider gain range, the turns ratio of the transformer is designed by considering three different conditions. Finally, a 1 kW prototype was built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed topology. The results confirm the eight times output voltage range of the converter and a peak efficiency of 96%.</description></item><item><title>An Electromagnetically Integrated LCL-EMI Filter for V2G Power Converters: Topology, Analysis, and Implementation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10660635</link><description>High-frequency grid-tied inverters in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) systems often produce lots of high-frequency harmonics and electromagnetic interference (EMI) noise. Therefore, a filtering module, which consists of a harmonic filter and an additional EMI choke, is typically required to effectively restrain the aforementioned noises, but this passive module will inevitably raise size and cost of the converter, which goes against high-power density demand of electric vehicles (EVs). To address this issue without impairing the filter&#8217;s performance, this article proposes a decoupled electromagnetically integrated structure of a symmetrical LCL-EMI filter for grid-tied converters in V2G applications. EE-shape magnetic core and flexible multilayer foil (FMLF) technique are employed in the integration design, the FMLF windings for achieving a symmetrical LCL filter are wound on side limbs of the EE core, and the EMI choke windings are arranged on the central limb. The used proper terminal configuration of the windings can almost realize function-decoupling between the LCL unit and EMI choke. Moreover, magnetic decoupling can be achieved between converter- and grid-side inductors of the LCL unit through air-gap design in the EE core&#8217;s side limbs, which can preserve the LCL unit&#8217;s satisfactory harmonic attenuation performance. Performance analysis and design principles of the integrated module are introduced, and the experimental results from a 1-kW SiC-MOSFET high-frequency grid-tied converter confirm the feasibility and validity of the approach.</description></item><item><title>Reinforcement Learning to Stabilize Singularly Perturbed DC-Side Dynamics of Grid-Connected Voltage-Source Converters in Modern AC&#8211;DC Grids Using Singular Perturbation Theory and Adaptive Dynamic Programming</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10666842</link><description>The stability and performance of ac&#8211;dc systems in grid modernization heavily rely on the rectification mode of grid-connected voltage-source converters (GC-VSCs). Being considered as the heart of the system, its impact is significant. The current-controlled GC-VSC based on the cascade control using a pulsewidth modulation approach is commonly deployed in the smart grid paradigm. This article discusses how the dynamics induced by that type of GC-VSC control structure can be regarded as singularly perturbed systems in modern ac&#8211;dc grids. As a result, it proposes a novel optimal control strategy for the voltage control problem with uncertain dynamics using reinforcement learning (RL) via the adaptive (or approximate) dynamic programming method and the singular perturbation theory (SPT). First, by means of SPT, the original optimal control problem is decomposed into two optimal problems with respect to an unknown slow time-scale subsystem and a known fast time-scale subsystem. Second, for the slow subsystem with unmeasurable states, an output-feedback-based off-policy RL algorithm with a guaranteed convergence is given in order to learn the optimal controller in terms of measurement data. Third, a composite controller is established in terms of the obtained fast&#8211;slow controllers; its optimality and closed-loop stability are rigorously proved. Unlike the direct full-order design, not only does the proposed decomposition composite design framework bypass the numerical stiffness, but it also alleviates the high dimensionality in the control synthesis. Comparative experiments using testing based on power hardware-in-the-loop simulations and rapid control prototyping methodology reveal the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Observer-Based Online Parameter Identification of Series&#8211;Series Tuned Inductive Power Transfer System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654636</link><description>Recently, many studies have investigated controller design methodologies for inductive power transfer (IPT) systems, relying on preidentified circuit parameters for determining controller gains. However, controllers based on such parameters are vulnerable to identification errors. Additionally, IPT systems exhibit unpredictable mutual inductances depending on coil alignments, necessitating a parameter identification process to enhance system reliability. This article proposes observer-based, online parameter identification methods for series&#8211;series tuned IPT (SS-IPT) systems. Self-inductances of transmitter and receiver coils, load resistance, and mutual inductance are identified using disturbance observers and rotating reference frame circuit models of the SS-IPT system. The proposed self-inductance and load resistance observers feature identification bandwidths of 500 Hz, whereas the mutual inductance observer has an estimation bandwidth of 50 Hz, concluding the parameter identification processes within 10 ms. Moreover, the proposed observers demonstrate robustness to initial parameter errors. Given their reliance on measured states and observers, the proposed parameter identification methods are suitable for dynamic IPT systems. The effectiveness of these observer-based parameter identification methods is assessed through a comparison of theoretical and simulated frequency responses, as well as simulated and experimental time-domain responses.</description></item><item><title>Discontinuous PWM Operation of a Single-Phase PV Generator With Low-Voltage Energy Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10660638</link><description>Using energy storage (ES) in grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) generators is an efficient solution to deliver regulated power to the grid despite fluctuations in solar irradiance. The article analyses a single-phase grid-connected PV generators with ES, where the ES has a low voltage, namely without too many series-connected storing cells. The PV generator consists of three subsystems connected by a common dc-link capacitor: a PV unit, an ES unit, and an inverter. Furthermore, in the proposed solution, the inverter does not switch for a significant portion of the grid period, resulting in lower switching losses. The single-phase inverter discontinuous operation implies the need of an appropriate control strategy in the boost dc&#8211;dc converter of the ES unit. The proposed control employs an augmented state model that accounts for resonant variables. The proposed PV solution with low-voltage ES, including its control, is validated in a 350-VA experimental prototype to verify the novel approach.</description></item><item><title>Resilient Distributed Secondary Control for Bidirectional Interlinking Converters in Hybrid AC/DC Microgrids Against FDI Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654574</link><description>In this article, we investigate the resilient distributed secondary control problems of the ac bus frequency and ac main bus voltage regulation, along with active/reactive power sharing among bidirectional interlinking converters (BICs) under false data injection (FDI) attacks in hybrid ac/dc microgrids (MGs). To solve these problems, the distributed iterative observers are first proposed, which incorporate the dynamic characteristics of the previous observation into the present FDI attack observation to achieve the accurate observation of the ac bus frequency and ac main bus voltage, as well as active power, reactive power, and injected FDI attacks of each BIC. Afterward, based on the average FDI attack estimation, a resilient distributed secondary controller is introduced to eliminate the impact of FDI attacks on BICs, achieving accurate recovery of ac bus frequency and ac main bus voltage, as well as the sharing of active/reactive power among BICs under FDI attacks. Compared with existing resilient control strategies in hybrid ac/dc MGs under FDI attacks, the proposed resilient control strategy can enable hybrid ac/dc MGs to exhibit better transient performance during FDI attack injection and disappearance. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed observers and controller is confirmed through a real-time controller-hardware-in-the-loop experiment in OPAL-RT.</description></item><item><title>Optimized Ripple Prelearning Process for Phase-Shift Control of Interleaved Multiphase DC&#8211;DC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10669117</link><description>Minimizing ripples and harmonics is an important criterion in multiphase dc&#8211;dc converters. In&#160;case of physical parameters degradation, nonidentical phases, or fault occurrence, the symmetrical interleaved mode ceases to be the optimum mode, and a supervising system is required. This article proposes a novel method for optimizing the current ripples and harmonics in multiphase dc&#8211;dc converters based on asymmetrical phase shifting using only the sensed variables by the control loops. The&#160;proposed method uses a developed online phases current shape-factors (PCSFs) calculation algorithm based on the currents derivative with an artificial neural network (ANN), offline trained, using an enhanced particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique on a high-fidelity model of the converter. The&#160;goal is to meet the desired current requirements by adapting phases shifting dynamically during the converter's operation at each period. Moreover, in the case of an open circuit fault (OCF), the proposed method can successfully adapt the phase shifting between the remaining healthy phases, reducing the current ripples caused by the fault. The&#160;proposed technique is validated experimentally using a three-phase interleaved boost converter, illustrating the current improvement in various scenarios such as OCFs and nonidentical parameters, proving an effective phase-shifting adaptation against uncertainties and variations in the parameters.</description></item><item><title>A New Perspective for Frequency and DC Voltage Stability Comprehension in Two-Terminal VSC-HVDC Systems With Virtual Inertia Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10665988</link><description>This letter proposes a new perspective for the interactive stability mechanism between frequency and dc voltage in a voltage-source converter-based high-voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) system with virtual inertia control. The system model is first established, providing a new physical insight into dc voltage and frequency stability. It is found that the frequency instability may be caused by the control loop of virtual inertia or the oscillation transfer of dc voltage. Similarly, the dc voltage oscillation can be induced by the inappropriate design of dc voltage control loop or the transfer of the frequency. The complex oscillation coupling mechanism as well as the oscillation transfer essence is clarified physically. Finally, the correctness as well as the feasibility of the theoretical analysis is verified by the hardware-in-loop experiment.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Short-Term Wind Power Forecasting Based on the Strategy of &#8220;Dynamic Matching and Online Modeling&#8221;</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10620613</link><description>Ultra-short-term wind power forecasting plays a vital role in real-time scheduling, frequency regulation, and intraday market transactions. Due to the complexity of weather systems, unit aging, wind farm control strategies, etc., the temporal dependency relationship in wind power series changes from time to time (known as concept drift), which leads to the low forecasting accuracy of the commonly used offline modeling methods. Online modeling can effectively deal with concept drift by utilizing the latest information in the flow data and capturing the latest concepts during the modeling process. However, the existing online modeling methods cannot meet the timeliness requirements of the power grid for ultra-short-term wind power forecasting. Therefore, a strategy of &#8220;dynamic matching and online modeling&#8221; for ultra-short-term wind power forecasting is proposed in this paper. Training samples are dynamically selected according to the characteristic similarity of amplitude and fluctuation, aiming to improve the representativeness of samples and reduce the training time simultaneously. In addition to historical power, Numerical Weather Prediction wind speed is also introduced in the process of &#8220;dynamic matching&#8221; to improve the forecasting accuracy. Operation data from three wind farms in China is used to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. The results show that the forecasting accuracy can be improved by 1.18%&#8211;4.32% for 4 hours in advance.</description></item><item><title>Resilience-Oriented Two-Stage Restoration Considering Coordinated Maintenance and Reconfiguration in Integrated Power Distribution and Heating Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10620409</link><description>The inherent linkage between a power distribution system (PDS) and a district heating system (DHS) necessitates coordinated load restoration after natural disasters. To guarantee optimal load restoration during a recovery process, a coordinated dispatch strategy of the maintenance crew for the PDS/DHS considering the optimal reconfiguration of their respective networks is proposed in this paper. The proposed solution focuses on the intricate mutual interaction of the DHS and PDS and coordinates the fault isolation and service restoration stages. The proposed optimization is modeled as a mixed-integer second-order cone problem (MISOCP), which contains numerous integer variables. To lessen the computational burden, a two-stage acceleration algorithm is proposed, which divides the solution procedure into two stages based on two types of integer variables: load status variables and variables associated with the maintenance path and network topology. Then, the acceleration principles are proposed to determine the load status variables. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed model are validated by extensive cases, which demonstrate the performance of the coordinated maintenance and reconfiguration in integrated energy systems for fault recovery.</description></item><item><title>A Comprehensive Control Strategy for F-SOP Considering Three-Phase Imbalance and Economic Operation in ISLDN</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638221</link><description>With the increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RES) and single-phase loads, three-phase imbalance and transformer lightly/heavily loaded operation issues has become more prominent in low-voltage distribution networks (LDN). However, existing research on interconnected systems of LDN (ISLDN) rarely addresses the comprehensive management of both three-phase imbalance and lightly/heavily loaded operation issues. To this end, a comprehensive control strategy for three-phase imbalance and lightly/heavily loaded operation in ISLDN based on a four-leg soft open point (F-SOP) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the comprehensive loss characteristics model of ISLDN including the F-SOP and the transformer are established, revealing that both imbalance and load rate can affect the equipment efficiency. Secondly, considering the objective of minimizing power loss, an optimization dispatch strategy with constraints of three-phase imbalance and the optimal economic operation area is proposed to obtain the dispatch power commands for the F-SOP. Furthermore, an improved peer-to-peer control for F-SOP is proposed to ensure the conduct of the optimization dispatch strategy and enhance stability performance of system. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed comprehensive control strategy are validated by the simulations and experiments. The results show that comprehensive control of lightly/heavily loaded operation and three-phase imbalance in the ISLDN can significantly reduce daily power loss by 62%, improving system operation reliability and economy.</description></item><item><title>Graph-Based Large Scale Probabilistic PV Power Forecasting Insensitive to Space-Time Missing Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643410</link><description>In recent years, power systems integrated with distributed energy resources (DERs) have been considered to mitigate climate change. However, this makes power systems even more uncertain and complex, so uncertainty-aware accurate forecasting needs to be considered for the massive penetration of renewable energy. To this end, we propose a scalable and missing-insensitive framework for probabilistic multi-site photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting, specifically focused on large-scale PV sites and space-time missing data. By leveraging the graph neural network (GNN), the proposed scalable graph learning mechanism with random coarse graph attention and probabilistic spatio-temporal learning performs efficiently for large-scale PV sites in terms of forecasting accuracy and model training complexity.

Initially, the strategy assesses electric energy interactions between microgrids and distribution networks to establish a foundation for collaborative scheduling. The two-stage pricing mechanism initiates with a leader-follower game, wherein the microgrid operator acts as the leader and users as followers. Subsequently, it adjusts EV tariffs based on the game's equilibrium, taking into account factors such as battery degradation and travel needs to optimize EVs' electricity consumption. Furthermore, a bi-level optimization model refines power interactions and pricing strategies across the network, significantly enhancing demand response capabilities and economic outcomes. Simulation results demonstrate that this strategy not only increases renewable energy consumption but also reduces energy costs, thereby improving the overall efficiency and sustainability of the system.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Optimization Operation of Improved Power-to-Hydrogen-and-Heat Method at Low Temperature for Reducing Carbon Emissions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654708</link><description>The power-to-hydrogen-and-heat (P2HH) method is a potential means of improving energy efficiency while reducing carbon emissions. However, existing P2HH methods are ineffective at low temperatures, and do not consider physical constraints on heat exchange between the electrolyzer and heating network. Hence, this paper proposes an improved P2HH (IP2HH) method to overcome these shortcomings. First, this paper proposes a novel collaborative mechanism between the electrolyzer and the heating network. In this system, the electrolyzer can not only transfer excess heat to the heating network when at high temperatures, but can also be heated by the heating network when at low temperatures. Second, this paper takes the physical limitations of heat exchange between electrolyzer and heating network into consideration, and models the regulating valve of heat exchanger. These considerations allow produce simulation results that better approximate real-world scenarios. Finally, a convex model integrated with the IP2HH approach is established. Compared with the existing P2HH method, the IP2HH method may allow electrolyzer to work intermittently based on fluctuations in renewables supplies while maintaining high hydrogen production efficiency. Such improvements could reduce carbon emissions by 35.5%, costs by 10.7%, and renewables curtailment by 26.4% at ambient temperature of 1 $^{\circ }$C.</description></item><item><title>Scheduling Multiple Industrial Electrolyzers in Renewable P2H Systems: A Coordinated Active-Reactive Power Management Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654460</link><description>Utility-scale renewable power-to-hydrogen (ReP2H) systems typically consist of multiple electrolyzers (ELZs), many of which are powered by thyristor rectifiers (TRs). A TR-powered ELZ has a nonlinear and nondecouplable relation between its active and reactive loads. The on-off switching and load allocation across multiple ELZs impact the efficiency of P2H energy conversion and the active and reactive power flows in the electrical network. Improper scheduling may result in an excessive reactive load from the hydrogen plant, causing voltage violations and increased network losses, which compromise both safety and profitability. To address these issues, this paper first explores the tradeoffs between the energy efficiency and reactive loads of ELZs. Then, we propose a joint active-reactive power management method to coordinate the loads and thermal properties of the ELZs, renewables, energy storage, and var compensation to improve the overall productivity and profitability. Mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) is established to achieve these goals, and a decomposition algorithm enables its applicability in large-scale systems. Case studies show that the proposed method, at best, increases the hydrogen yield by 2.49% while reducing network losses by 3.12% compared to the state-of-the-art strategies based on wind and solar power data from Inner Mongolia, China. The optimal var resource configuration for ReP2H systems is also briefly discussed.</description></item><item><title>Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning for Real-Time Optimal Power Flow With Renewable Energy Resources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10660524</link><description>The serious uncertainties from the extensive integration of renewable energy generations put forward a higher real-time requirement for power system dispatching. To provide economic and feasible generation operations in real-time, a physics-informed reinforcement learning (PIRL) method based on constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) for optimal power flow (OPF) is presented in this paper. In the proposed method, a physics-informed actor based on the power flow equations is designed to generate generation operations that satisfy the equality constraints of OPF. To specify inequality constraints in actor optimization, the policy gradient is augmented with the constraints to correct unfeasible generation operations. In particular, the cost functions related to inequality constraints can be directly calculated based on the output of the actor, which is more accurate than using networks to approximate in general CRL methods. The proposed method is tested on the IEEE 118-bus system, and the simulation result shows that the proposed method achieves a significant improvement in computation speed compared with the traditional interior point method while obtaining a similar generation cost.</description></item><item><title>Exploiting the Flexibility of District Heating System for Distribution System Operation: Set-Based Characterization and Temporal Decomposition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10660566</link><description>The proliferation of distributed renewable resources increases the uncertainty in distribution systems. Coupling the distribution system and district heating system helps leverage the flexibility of thermal storage and thus supports the operation of the electrical grid. This paper proposes a method to characterize flexibility from district heating system via polyhedral sets. First, a recursive robust feasibility condition that ensures heat supply adequacy under uncertain demand is established. Then, stagewise robust feasible sets of thermal storage levels are calculated using a customized projection algorithm. Finally, dynamic bounds of electric heaters are computed by a further projection step. With those dynamic bounds, the electric heaters behave like reducible loads, and the demands in each period are decoupled over time, although the dispatch of thermal storage units must comply with inter-temporal constraints. The proposed method allows the two coupled systems to be operated in a distributed way without forecasts and extensive communications. Numerical simulations on small and practically sized testing systems validate the advantage of the proposed method. On average, the set calculation takes about 8 minutes for the day-ahead problem and 11 seconds for real-time dispatch on a portable laptop, and the prediction-free operation policy has an average optimality gap of 3.6% compared to the hindsight optimum.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Volt-VAR Coordinated Scheduling With Mobile Energy Storage System for Active Distribution Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10664000</link><description>In order to improve the voltage distribution and operation cost for ADN, A scheduling strategy is designed to integrate flexible resources, particularly mobile energy storage systems, within the coupling of ADN and TN, under an uncertain environment. A day-ahead Volt-VAR coordinated scheduling framework for ADN and TN can be proposed through incorporating a data-driven day-ahead scenario generation method based on denoising diffusion probabilistic model. First, the historical data may be employed to learn the error relationship between real power curves and predicted power curves for generating RES scenarios. The probability distribution for prediction error is constructed which can describe the day-ahead output power curve of RES. Subsequently, a SCCO approach is employed to measure voltage operating risk in uncertain environment, which can effectively utilize the controllability of different resource at timescale and spatial scale in ADN to fulfill the anticipated operational requirement. Finally, The ADN coupled with TN model can be linearized and converted into the mixed-integer linear programming method. Numerical simulations based on the IEEE 33-bus distribution system coupled with 15-node transportation network may verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Photovoltaic-Grid Integrated System for the Residential Power Management</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10663696</link><description>This paper proposes a photovoltaic (PV)-Utility integrated system with inductive power transfer (IPT) for electric vehicle (EV) charging applications in residential management applications. To realize this objective, a buck boost-interleaved H-bridge (BBIHB) configuration is proposed to integrate the PV source with the DC link of the front end converter (FEC) while achieving maximum power from the PV and power delivery to the IPT simultaneously. The DC bus of the IPT in the proposed system is obtained through the additive connection of the PV and FEC DC-link, which results in inherent boost of the DC bus voltage for the IPT system thus enhances the transmission power for the EV charging. Furthermore, the FEC allows bidirectional power flow between the utility and BBIHB converter by sharing the deficient or excess power in the system based on PV power availability. The complete modeling of the system and a control algorithm to achieve the above mentioned objectives is presented in this paper. Other features of the proposed system include inherent voltage boosting, a simple control strategy, and the absence of a separate converter for the PV to extract maximum power. Finally, an experimental hardware setup is developed in the laboratory and tested up to 4 kW of output power to validate the proposed system's performance, achieving a maximum DC-to-DC efficiency of 94% at this condition.</description></item><item><title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Dynamic Droop Control Strategy for Real-Time Optimal Operation and Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10664502</link><description>The optimal operation of an islanded AC microgrid system is achieved by proper power sharing among generators. The conventional distributed cost optimization strategies use a communication system to converge incremental costs. However, these methods are dependent on the distributed communication network and do not consider frequency deviations for real-time load variability. Thus, this paper proposes a DRL-based dynamic droop control strategy. The proposed twin delayed DDPG-based DRL interacts with the environment to learn the optimal droop gain for reducing generation cost and frequency deviation. The trained agent uses local information to transmit dynamic droop gains to the primary controller as demand load changes. It can simplify the control structure by omitting the secondary layer for optimal operation and power quality. The proposed control strategy is designed with a centralized DRL training process and distributed execution, enabling real-time distributed optimal operation. The comparison results with conventional distributed strategy confirms better control performance of the proposed strategy. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed strategy was verified by experiment on AC microgrid testbed.</description></item><item><title>Cross-Timescale Interaction Analysis Between Current Control and Rotor Speed Control Timescale Dynamics in a High-Proportion DFIG-WT System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10665985</link><description>Power electronics (PE) equipment contains multiple timescale energy storage components and control loops. As a result, the dynamic process presents multiple timescale characteristics in PE-dominated power systems. For simplicity, single timescale dynamics are often the focus of corresponding analysis, and the influence of different timescales (i.e., cross-timescale analysis) is rarely considered. However, there is an interaction effect between multiple timescale controls and energy storage components, which complicates system dynamics. In this study, the cross-timescale impact of current control on the dynamics of rotor speed control timescale are evaluated. First, based on a two-machine two-area system comprising a phase-locked loop (PLL)-synchronized doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbine (WT), the influence of the PLL on cross-timescale interactions is revealed via modal analysis. Then, a current control equivalent circuit is derived for analyzing its cross-timescale influence on rotor motion, and the LC resonance mechanism related to the current control is revealed. Moreover, the impact of the PLL on cross-timescale interactions is elucidated. Finally, the cross-timescale influence phenomena and mechanisms are verified via real-time digital simulations.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Short-Term Prediction of Wind Farm Cluster Power Based on Embedded Graph Structure Learning With Spatiotemporal Information Gain</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10669105</link><description>Ultra-short-term prediction of wind farm cluster power (UPWFCP) is of great significance for the development of intra-day power generation plan, and the power prediction accuracy is difficult to be further improved due to the chaotic effect of the weather system and the incompleteness of the information. In this regard, this paper proposes an embedded graph structure learning method for wind farm cluster (WFC) that incorporates spatiotemporal information gain (STIG) theory. The graph structure describing the spatiotemporal evolution relationship of information between wind farms (WFs) is constructed based on the spatiotemporal transfer relationship of power waveforms between WFs. An embedded graph attention network (EGAN) is proposed to learn STIG adjacency relationship among WFs, and a dynamic grouping scheme of redundant nodes in WFs based on STIG distance is constructed to reduce the modeling complexity. The proposed method is applied to the WFC of Inner Mongolia, China, and the results show that the NRMSE, NMAE, and MAPE of the proposed method are on average 2.63%, 2.09%, and 20.95% lower, and the R2 and Pr are on average 7.66% and 6.64% higher, respectively, compared with the rest of the comparison methods at all time scales.</description></item><item><title>Integrating Air-Source Heat Pumps into the Demand-Side Fast Frequency Response Service: A Study Based on Thermal Dynamic Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10669175</link><description>Fast frequency response services, designed to quickly balance the electrical grid within seconds, have a critical importance for managing sudden anomalies in low-inertia power systems. Battery systems often serve as versatile prosumers on the demand side to facilitate fast frequency response services. However, the nature of fast frequency response services leads to a highly fluctuating power profile for batteries, which can shorten their lifetime. In contrast, distributed air-source heat pumps in residential areas have a substantial untapped potential to support fast frequency response services. This paper seeks to integrate them into the existing services through a controller upgrade. We analyze the influence of air-source heat pumps' inherent complex thermal dynamics on fast frequency response services, revealing control challenges posed by unpredictable operating condition changes. Such a challenge is tackled with a standard droop control structure which is tuned through ${{H}_\infty }$ method, guaranteeing practical and stable operations within the permitted operating condition range. Finally, the proposed fast frequency response service scheme is tested through multiphysics simulations on a small-size low-inertia residential microgrid. The obtained results strongly supported the proposed new service.</description></item><item><title>Globally Optimal Distributed Operation of Integrated Electric and Heating Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10677480</link><description>Unit commitment (UC) is a key player in the coordinated operation of integrated energy systems. However, the participation of multiple market entities with widely different characteristics in large-scale energy systems has urged the critical need for the application of a distributed scheme to the UC problem. The NP-hard UC problem is a challenging mixed-integer programming problem. The presence of a large number of binary variables in the UC subproblems, which are solved by each participating entity after implementing the UC decomposition, fails to guarantee the convergence and the optimality of existing solution methods. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a distributed method, using logic-based Benders decomposition (LBBD), for the UC problem in a typical multi-entity system, i.e., integrated electric and heating system (IEHS). By searching the branch and bound tree of the district heating system (DHS) subproblem, the lower bound of its objective function is rigorously derived as a valid Benders cut to ensure the convergence to global optimal results. This distributed method is suitable for both deterministic and robust UC solutions. Numerical simulations are conducted on two test systems to demonstrate the performance of the proposed model and its distributed solution method.</description></item><item><title>Set-Valued Regression of Wind Power Curve</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10678875</link><description>Precise wind power curves are pivotal for monitoring the status of wind turbines and predicting wind power, which are important parts of utilizing wind energy in power systems. However, the data sets for training wind power curve models have a critical issue. A considerable proportion of the data sets is abnormal due to communication failure and other factors. Using the data sets with abnormal data will significantly deteriorate the fitting performance. This paper resolves the above issue by proposing a unified way to achieve abnormal data detection and curve fitting. Instead of regression with scalar output, set-valued regression of the wind power curve is considered, giving a set of wind power for a given wind speed. Interval neural network is adopted as the model for set-valued regression. A chance-constrained optimization problem is formulated to train an interval neural network. The obtained interval neural network can specify a subset with the normal data area, which can be used to give the threshold for abnormal data detection. Besides, the center points of the interval can be used as the fitted wind power curve. Since the formulated chance-constrained optimization problem is intractable, a sample-based sigmoidal approximation method is proposed to approximately solve it. The convergence and probabilistic feasibility of the approximation are given. Finally, experimental validations have been conducted to compare the proposed method with several existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Preserving Normal Power Curve Data With Sparse Density via Wind Speed-Power Correlation Trend Cleaning Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10678883</link><description>Stochastic wind conditions and curtailment lead to a sparse distribution of normal data compared to outliers on the Wind Power Curve (WPC). This results in the removal of sparse normal data during the data cleaning process, hampering short-term wind power assessment and forecasting. To address this issue, this paper proposes a decision boundary construction method that utilizes the wind speed-power correlation trend to retain normal WPC data. First, leveraging the positive correlation between wind speed and power, an incremental trend search strategy is used to obtain the trend curve. Building on this curve, a scatter motion trend algorithm is introduced to eliminate densely clustered curtailed power data. Finally, a kernel function-based 3-sigma boundary construction method is suggested to further reduce the influence of remaining clustered outliers on decision boundaries. The proposed method is compared to eight advanced algorithms using data from 17 wind turbines across three wind farms, demonstrating superior performance, especially in scenarios with sparse normal data.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Inertial Control for Wind Turbine Generators in Fast Frequency Response Based on the Power Reduction Period Assessment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10678806</link><description>Fast frequency response of wind turbine generators (WTGs) is achieved by injecting incremental power to the grid followed by power reductions to avoid over-deceleration and ensure secure rotor speed recovery. Second frequency deeps (SFDs) are the results of such power reductions that are challenging during abrupt frequency transients that may lead to under-frequency load shedding, or cascading events leading to blackouts. To address this issue, this paper presents an adaptive inertial control (AIC) scheme for WTGs designed to maximize the improvement in frequency nadir without causing SFD. The proposed method is developed through an assessment of power reduction period of WTGs during fast frequency response. This analysis investigates the impacts on the system frequency of a) injecting different shares of disturbance size (SoDSs) by WTGs and b) latency/delay in power injection. Derived from this analysis, the AIC is proposed to inject the maximum possible SoDS during the over-production period and successfully stabilize and recover the rotor speed during the assigned optimal power reduction period with SFDs disabled. This is achieved by adaptively adjusting the AIC in the reduction period based on the SoDS injected by WTGs during the over-production stage. Also, the AIC is modified to adapt against wind speed deviations. To evaluate the performance of the AIC, a comprehensive verification is carried out by comparing AIC with thirteen existing inertial control schemes and maximum power point tracking control in various cases using wind-integrated IEEE 39-bus system in Digsilent PowerFactory and real-time experimental tests. The results confirm the effectiveness of AIC in terms of achieving maximum improvement in frequency nadir without generating SFD.</description></item><item><title>Causal Mechanism-Enabled Zero-Label Learning for Power Generation Forecasting of Newly-Built PV Sites</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10679087</link><description>Power forecasting of newly built photovoltaic (PV) sites faces huge challenges owing to the lack of sufficient training samples. To this end, this paper proposes an unsupervised zero-label learning method for power generation forecasting of newly built PV sites without relying on any historical power output data. The main idea is to extract invariant causal structures across different PV sites and leverage this causality to enhance the power forecasting performance on the newly built ones. In particular, a causality-enabled domain adaptation network (CEDAN) is designed to capture the causal mechanism of PV generation from the multiple fine-grain segments of time-lagged data. It relaxes the causal relationships to an associative structure which is further concretized as attention score vectors through the designed intra- and inter-variable attention mechanisms. To quantify the distribution discrepancies between source and target domain causal structures, a specific domain adaptation loss function is designed for the optimization of CEDAN. It is further extended to a domain adaptation quantile loss to handle the uncertainties of PV power output. By jointly minimizing the domain adaptation loss and power forecasting error/conditional quantile loss, an invariant power generation causal mechanism across data domains for a newly built PV site can be learned. This allows the proposed method to achieve accurate and highly generalized power generation forecasting for newly built PV sites without relying on labeled data. Extensive experiments utilizing real PV generation data demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art transfer learning methods by 7.57% at least in deterministic forecasting and 8.37% at least in probabilistic forecasting.</description></item><item><title>Startup Control of Grid-Forming Offshore Wind Turbines Connected to the Diode-Rectifier-Based HVDC Link</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10680154</link><description>The Diode-Rectifier (DR) based HVDC has been considered as an economical solution to connect remote offshore wind turbines (WTs) to the onshore power grid. However, the DR is a passive device and cannot support the startup of the WTs. Therefore, it is worth finding an appropriate and cost-effective startup strategy for the DR-connected WTs. This paper investigates to use of wind energy to startup those WTs to avoid the need for additional grid support or the energy storage system, which can reduce the overall cost of such transmission system. The first challenge for this strategy is that the output active power of WTs can be extremely low during the startup process, which puts the WT rotor at a high risk of overspeed. Another challenge is to prevent power surges between synchronizing WTs. To address those issues, the pitch control has been innovated for the DR-connected WTs. In addition, a seamless synchronization control of the DR-connected WTs is proposed, which does not need the phase-locked-loop and can facilitate the whole startup process of the DR-connected WTs. The feasibility of these proposed control strategies for the startup of the DR-connected WTs is verified by comprehensive simulation studies.</description></item><item><title>Reliability-Based Planning of Cable Layout for Offshore Wind Farm Electrical Collector System Considering Post-Fault Network Reconfiguration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10681539</link><description>The electrical collector system (ECS) plays a crucial role in determining the performance of offshore wind farms (OWFs). Existing research has predominantly restricted ECS cable layouts to conventional radial or ring structures and employed graph theory heuristics for solutions. However, both economic efficiency and reliability of the OWFs heavily depend on their ECS structure, and the optimal ECS cable layout often deviates from typical configurations. In this context, this paper introduces a novel reliability-based ECS cable layout planning method for large-scale OWFs, employing a two-stage stochastic programming approach to address uncertainties of wind power and contingencies. To enhance reliability, the model incorporates optimal post-fault network reconfiguration strategies by adjusting wind turbine power supply paths through link cables. To tackle computation challenges arising from numerous contingency scenarios, a customized progressive contingency incorporation (CPCI) framework is developed to solve the model with higher efficiency by iteratively identifying non-trivial scenarios and solving the simplified problems. The convergence and optimality are theoretically proven. Numerical tests on several real-world OWFs validate the necessity of fully optimizing ECS structures and demonstrate the efficiency of the CPCI algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Transient Interaction Mechanism Analysis and Stability Control of Multi-Paralleled DFIG-Based WTs During Asymmetrical Grid Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10681307</link><description>In this article, from the perspective of DC-link voltage (DCV) control, the transient interaction mechanism of multi-paralleled doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbines (WTs) is investigated during asymmetrical grid faults. Firstly, considering the coupling characteristics of positive and negative sequence (PNS) components and the interaction characteristics between the rotor side converter (RSC) and grid side converter (GSC), a large-signal nonlinear model of multiple-parallel DFIG-based WTs in DC-link voltage control time-scale is obtained. Furthermore, by using the energy function method, the dynamic interaction mechanism of multiple-parallel DFIG-based WTs is analyzed. The influence of different parameters on the transient characteristics of DC-link voltage is analyzed by using phase trajectory diagram. The dominant factors affecting the transient stability of the WTs and stability level of DC-link voltage are obtained. In addition, considering the interaction among WTs, the dynamic interaction between RSC and GSC, as well as the requirement of grid codes, a transient stability optimization strategy during asymmetrical grid faults is proposed to improve the transient stability level of the DC-link voltage and the transient stability of multiple-parallel DFIG-based WTs. Finally, simulation and experimental results validate the correctness of theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Reactive Power Optimization for Flexible Distribution Networks With Successive Relaxation Iteration Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10682812</link><description>The flexible soft open point (SOP) connected to active distribution networks (ADNs) offers a promising manner of improving voltage and VAR control (VVC) by providing flexible power regulation. Due to the expansion of interconnective networks, the centralized optimization method has recently faced various challenges. This paper thus proposes a novel distributed coordinated reactive power optimization strategy for SOP-based multiregional ADNs based on local model decoupling and iterative interactions. By applying the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), the centralized VVC optimization problem is divided into several subproblems, allowing each area to optimize its local subproblem in a fully distributed manner. Multiple resources are thereby coordinated by the VVC, including both discrete and continuous devices. To ensure computability of both integer and non-convex problems, the relaxation iteration and successive linear approximation methods are nested to the ADMM framework, within this approach to allow ready solution to the distributed VVC optimization problem to be generated using a relaxation iterative algorithm, which significantly improves algorithm convergence and computational efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in this work using a modified IEEE standard interconnection system.</description></item><item><title>Fast Power Regulation Method During System Restoration for D-PMSG-Based Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10685139</link><description>The speed of the pitch action is one of the primary constraints that limit the power ramp rate of wind turbines (WTs). By storing kinetic energy (KE) within the wind wheel, blades, and generator rotor, the output power of the WT can be regulated more rapidly with less pitch action. This capability is beneficial in specific situations where additional power injection is required by the external system, such as during the system restoration process after a blackout. In this paper, a novel fast power regulation method for direct-drive PMSG-based (D-PMSG-based) WTs is proposed. This method allows for the early completion of the most time-consuming pitch reduction process and ensures that KE can be stored within the WT before the external system becomes available. As a result, the WT will be able to achieve maximum power output before the system restoration is fully completed. The potential operation boundary and the maximum external power support capability of D-PMSG-based WTs are analyzed. By following the operation boundary, converter modulation problem caused by high KE reserve can be avoided. The proposed fast power regulation method can significantly reduce the power increase speed and maximize the output power capability of D-PMSG-base WTs.</description></item><item><title>Research on PV Hosting Capacity of Distribution Networks Based on Data-Driven and Nonlinear Sensitivity Functions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693542</link><description>Voltage calculations are critical for assessing photovoltaic hosting capacity; however, acquiring precise parameters and the topology of the medium voltage distribution networks poses a significant challenge, thereby rendering traditional power flow computational methods ineffective. To address this issue, this paper introduces a hybrid method that utilizes a data-driven approach in conjunction with nonlinear functions to determine node voltages. Firstly, a deep neural network model for distribution network's power flow and voltage-power sensitivity analysis is established using historical data. This model captures the data-driven error, which reduces time consumption and increases accuracy. Secondly, a fourth-order Taylor expansion of power to voltage is derived based on the power flow mathematical equation to extrapolate voltage. This is necessary because when photovoltaic generators are connected to the nodes, the load data often exceeds the historical data range, rendering neural networks inapplicable. Finally, the sparrow search algorithm is employed to determine the hosting capacity. The proposed methods are validated using IEEE 33 and IEEE 69 case systems, demonstrating that the data-driven approach, combined with nonlinear functions, can ensure the accuracy in obtaining node voltage and the hosting capacity.</description></item><item><title>Analytical Evaluation to Power System Oscillation Damping Capability of DFIG-POD Based on Path Damping Torque Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693531</link><description>The increasing wind power decreases power system damping and may intensify low-frequency oscillation (LFO). The LFO are usually damped by the power system stabilizer (PSS) at synchronous generator (SG), and now by the power oscillation damper (POD) at doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG). The existing damping torque analysis (DTA) sets the parameters of the PSS and evaluates its damping capability, but can not be applied to the POD due to the difficulty of finding the damping path related to the DFIG and the coupling between the POD and the DFIG, which are studied in this paper. At first, the analytical expression of the coupling between the POD and DFIG is newly derived with linear fractional transformation (LFT) technique. Then the path damping torque analysis (PDTA) is proposed to reconstruct the damping path of the POD. Thirdly, the damping indicator based on the return difference matrix is proposed to evaluate the contribution of damping path to the LFO. Finally, numerical results of test system are given to validate effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed model, and parameter optimization to the multi-input POD (MIPOD) is performed to show the application value of the proposed model.</description></item><item><title>Spatiotemporal Adversarial Domain Generalization for Locating Subsynchronous Oscillation Sources Under Unseen Conditions in Large-Scale Renewable Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693450</link><description>Subsynchronous oscillations (SSOs) in renewable power systems have emerged as a major challenge, jeopardizing the stability and safety of power system operations. Thus, it is essential to accurately and timely locate SSO sources. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods for locating SSO sources have become increasingly popular, existing AI-based methods usually fail in practical applications due to unavailable or insufficient real-world SSO data for model training, and significant distribution gaps in samples under different operational conditions. They also fail to fully utilize the temporal characteristics of oscillations and the spatial topology of the system. Moreover, these methods only focus on locating either negative-damping-SSO or forced-SSO sources. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel strategy termed Spatiotemporal-Adversarial-Domain-Generalization (STADG) to locate oscillation sources in both SSO scenarios of real power systems. This method allows the model to train on multi-source domains (simplified-simulation power systems) with sufficient labeled samples, and to be directly applied to an unseen test target domain (real power system) under unknow operating conditions. The proposed approach employs a graph-attention network and a long-short-term-memory network to fully leverage spatial and temporal features of SSOs. Extensive experiments on the modified IEEE-39 and WECC-179 bus systems confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Two-Level Distributed Consensus Control of Multiple Wind Farms for Fast Frequency Support</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10694712</link><description>The neighboring wind farms have great frequency support potential. The wind turbine generators (WTGs) in these wind farms are influenced by wake effects and have different frequency support capabilities. In order to fully utilize the WTGs' support capabilities under different operating states, this paper proposes a two-level distributed consensus (TLDC) control to cooperate all the WTGs. Level I is leader-follower control, which is equipped within the wind farms. Level II is leaderless control which is used among the wind farms. This method is able to assign different values of power commands to different WTGs in the system to achieve better frequency support effect and stability. Based on MATLAB/Simulink and Opal-RT real-time simulation platforms, the two-area power system and Guangshui system (100% renewable energy power system) are analyzed, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed TLDC method has a better effect compared with other frequency support methods. It can also flexibly respond to communication interruptions and delays.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Stage Integrated Transmission and Distribution Expansion Planning Under Uncertainties With Smart Investment Options</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10694803</link><description>The shift towards a decentralized paradigm in power systems in response to decarbonization and deregulation efforts necessitates stronger coordination between transmission and distribution operators for cost-effective operation and planning. However, long-term uncertainties in the transition to net-zero are posing major challenges for decision-making. Moreover, literature has traditionally focused on the transmission and distribution expansion planning problems independently, as is customary in industry, leading to a lack of sophisticated integrated planning methods and inefficient expansion decisions in practice. This paper proposes a novel multi-stage stochastic programming framework for the integrated transmission and active distribution networks expansion planning under multi-dimensional uncertainties. Infrastructure investments are co-optimized with non-network alternatives with diverse techno-economic characteristics to support flexible planning. To manage the increased computational complexities, a machine learning-assisted multi-cut Benders decomposition approach is implemented. The case studies firstly highlight the strategic and economic advantages of the proposed multi-stage formulation, and then demonstrate the significant role and value of smart investment options in managing uncertainty. Lastly, the application of the proposed model on a study involving a 229-bus test system and 18 long-term scenarios validates its scalability and practical applicability.</description></item><item><title>Interaction Modeling and Stability Analysis of Grid-Forming Energy Storage System Based on SISO Transfer Functions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10700987</link><description>With the rapid expansion of photovoltaic (PV), grid-forming energy storage systems (GFM-ESS) have been widely employed for inertia response and voltage support to enhance the dynamic characteristics. Converters with different synchronization methods represent significant differences in dynamic behavior. The interactions between grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) devices with multi-time scale control may lead to small-signal instability in hybrid systems. This paper investigates a grid-connected system comprising a grid-forming energy storage system and a grid-following PV system (GFL-PV). Based on single-input-single-output (SISO) transfer functions, a dynamic interaction model for the PV-ESS system is established. Combining the open-loop transfer functions of full-loop and sub-loop, the proposed model reveals how GFM-ESS modifies the dynamic characteristics of GFL-PV under weak grid conditions. Subsequently, the impact of different control loops and parameters on the small-signal stability of the system is analyzed. The stability margins of both devices are also compared through the SISO model. Electromagnetic transient simulation results in MATLAB/Simulink and experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed models and analyses.</description></item><item><title>Impedance Characteristic Analysis and Phase-Locked Angle Feedforward-Based Stability Improvement for LCC-HVDC in Sending AC Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10704965</link><description>With the increasing penetration of wind power, the line-commutated converter-based high-voltage direct-current (LCC-HVDC) system in sending AC grid faces a potential risk of sub/super-synchronous oscillations (SSSOs), which threatens the stability of the power system. The impedance-based method is an effective way to analyze and suppress the SSSOs. However, since the effects of each control part in LCC-HVDC on the stability of sending AC grid are not yet well-investigated, there is a lack of theoretical guidance for implementing the impedance reshaping strategy for LCC-HVDC. Therefore, this paper establishes and analyzes the modular impedance model of LCC-HVDC, to elucidate the contribution of each control part and the interaction between different control loops. On this basis, an impedance reshaping strategy based on phase-locked angle feedforward (PAF) is proposed to improve system stability by attenuating the interaction. Compared to the existing virtual impedance-based method, the proposed PAF-based method addresses its possible failure in suppressing the SSSOs of sending AC grid. The theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the aforementioned conclusions and the effectiveness of the proposed impedance reshaping strategy.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Operation Flexibility in Modular Power to Hydrogen Based Ammonia Industries</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10706701</link><description>Modularization of Hydrogen Electrolyzers (HEs) is projected to be immediate, resilient, and efficient for load management in large-scale Hydrogen Consuming Industries (HCIs). It offers a scalable and flexible solution that can adapt to changes in hydrogen and power system demands. However, Modular HEs are studied primarily as small-scale wind hydrogen systems only, converting excess Renewable Energy (RE) into hydrogen without the integration of rigid downstream operations. Downstream constraints in HCIs, like rigid hydrogen demands, device operational/ramping limits, and storage constraints, can limit or regulate modular HE's use for power system services. Furthermore, oversimplified HE operational modeling within HCIs leads to suboptimal outcomes for integrated modular HCI and RE-rich power system (RPS) operations, resulting in RE curtailments and inaccurate flexibility estimations. This happens due to improper loading rates arising from unrealistic inter and intra-modular HE operations. This work proposes a comprehensive model for modular HE management in integrated ammonia (HCI) and power systems for flexibility in sector-coupled scenarios. The work considers and demonstrates how downstream constraints regulate HEs flexibility through a unit commitment problem framework. HE operations with detailed and extended electrochemical dynamics are considered to improve and enhance operational flexibility calculations of growing RPS-based modular HCIs. This allows for better sectoral integration and estimation of power system services.</description></item><item><title>An Overvoltage-Averse Model for Renewable-Rich AC/DC Distribution Networks Considering the Sensitivity of Voltage Violation Probability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10709908</link><description>The increasing renewable generation increase the probability of voltage violation. The spatial and temporal power transfer can be achieved in AC/DC distribution networks based on voltage source converters (VSCs) and energy storage (ES), which can effectively avoid system voltage violation. However, the existing voltage violation mitigation methods in uncertain scenarios are either limited by the long solution time or complex modeling, which are difficult to meet the overvoltage probability reduction requirements of intra-day dispatch. In addition, the power transfer will simultaneously affect interconnected systems because the power is coupled through the VSCs. Overvoltage probability reduction on one line may lead to an increase on the other. This paper proposes a two-stage overvoltage-averse model considering the sensitivity of voltage violation probability. The proposed method analytically depicts the impact of power adjustment on the system overvoltage probability. The day-ahead optimization model is established as chance-constrained model. The intra-day optimization model is established as a quadratic convex model, which can be efficiently solved. Simulation results verify that the method proposed can effectively achieve the overvoltage probability reduction of renewable-rich AC/DC distribution networks.</description></item><item><title>A Mimicking-Avoiding Short-Term Probabilistic Power Forecasting Method for Wave Energies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10709879</link><description>Wave energy is essential for sustainable marine development. However, complex marine weather conditions cause fluctuating wave power outputs, resulting in a mimicking phenomenon in predictions. Moreover, the lack of accurate numerical weather prediction (NWP) data sources aggravates the prediction inaccuracy. To address these obstacles, a series characteristic perception (SCP) method coordinated with an advanced hybrid model, the quantile liberty loss gated recurrent unit kernel density estimation (QLB-GRU-KDE), is proposed for the floating point absorber wave energy system. In the first stage, the SCP method gains prior knowledge via ensemble approaches. In the second stage, a liberty loss function is used to mitigate the mimicking phenomenon. Furthermore, a hybrid model that integrates a GRU and KDE is adopted for the probabilistic forecasting of wave energy generation. In addition, a metric is proposed to evaluate the severity of the mimicking. A case study based on a real-world wave dataset is conducted, where both deterministic and probabilistic prediction approaches are examined. Comparisons with the cutting-edge counterparts reveal that the designed liberty loss effectively mitigates the mimicking issue. The comprehensive performance of the proposed model, including the accuracy, stability, reliability and sharpness in wave power prediction, is validated by multiple metrics.</description></item><item><title>Approximate Optimal Energy Management of Thermal-HESS System for MIMO Fuzzy Logic Controller Based AGC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10710156</link><description>Compared to one-type of energy storage device, hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) offer benefits for Auto generation control (AGC) command tracking and can reduce investment in energy storage. Traditional control method, although effective in meeting the matching of AGC commands at a specific moment, often lacks coordination across multiple time intervals, resulting in frequent and irregular charging/ discharging which reduces the overall lifetime. To address this, this paper presents an approximate optimal operation strategy for Thermal-HESS system, aiming to enhance the AGC performance of the generating unit and improve the energy management capability of the HESSs. Firstly, an auto-adjust Markov Chain prediction method is proposed to forecast the power demand of the AGC command tracking to determine power demand's tendency. Secondly, a stochastic model predictive control (SMPC)-based optimal model, which considers the current step and cost-to-go function, is proposed. However, the SMPC based model is multiple-step optimal operational problem, which will increase the computational burden of the controller. Therefore, this paper further designs a Multiple-Input-Multiple-output (MIMO) fuzzy logic controller to approximate the optimal alternative to the cost-to-go function of SMPC model, meeting the computational and application requirements more effectively. Finally, numerical case studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in AGC command tracking and HESSs energy management.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Resilience of Urban Electric-Road-Metro Interdependent Network Considering Electric Bus Scheduling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10711253</link><description>With the increasing electrification of urban transportation, urban power and traffic systems are highly coupled and influence each other, leading to a challenge for the post-event resilience enhancement of urban electric-traffic interdependent network (ETIN). In this context, we propose a multi-layer electric-metro-road interdependent network where the metro network (MN) depends on the distribution power network (DPN) and interacts with the road traffic network (RTN) synchronously. Electric buses (EBs), as one public dispatchable resource, are considered and explored to provide bridging routes for disabled MNs and supply power for failed DPNs, with consideration of three different service trips, i.e., the original trip, bridging trip, and charge-discharge trip. On this basis, a spatio-temporal network-based EB route schedule model is constructed. To consider the evacuation demand of affected MN routes, a fast DPN restoration strategy is proposed to minimize the time cost of lost load by integrating the network reconfiguration with the collaborative allocation of repair crews (RCs) and EBs. Finally, a distributed method is further devised for the coordination among different stakeholders. The proposed method is verified on two electric-traffic systems to show that the collaborative scheduling of RCs and EBs can effectively enhance the resilience of ETIN under metro service disruptions.</description></item><item><title>An Integrated Sparse Gated Graph Density Network Based on Transfer Learning for Multi-Site Probabilistic Forecasting of Renewable Energy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10714034</link><description>Large-scale new energy grid-connected poses significant challenges to the safe and efficient operation of smart grids. Renewable energy probabilistic forecasting (REPF) technology can analyze uncertainties in power generation, quantitatively balance risks, and prevent the breakdown of the grid. However, current REPF methods reliant on spatio-temporal maps fail to accurately estimate the probability density function (PDF) of renewable energy, resulting lacking comprehensive uncertainty analysis for distributed power generation systems (DPGS). To fill this gap, in this study, an integrated sparse gated graph density network (ISGGDN) that incorporates transfer learning to tackle the REPF challenge. A sparse gated graph dynamic convolutional network based on cross attention and residual connection is developed, which can effectively extract spatial features and spatio-temporal interactions between sites and improve the accuracy of probabilistic prediction. Furthermore, to effectively identify the types of features lost during the transfer process and to enhance the transfer learning (TL) capability, we developed an integrated approach involving multiple fine-tuning strategies based on TL. We evaluated the proposed model using wind and photovoltaic (PV) power generation data from two neighboring multi-sites, and the experimental results demonstrate that ISGGDN outperforms other existing solutions in terms of accuracy and effectiveness in REPF.</description></item><item><title>Aggregating Large-Scale Residential Users for Regulation Reserve Provision: Truthful Combinatorial Auction Based Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10715698</link><description>The proliferation of flexible loads has empowered residential users in contributing both upward and downward frequency regulation reserves to the power grid. Due to barriers like minimum bid size, residential users with relatively small power consumption must be aggregated before they can enter the reserve market. However, the large number of residential users renders the aggregation mechanism design problem a challenging task. In particular, the cost for reserve provision of each user is not only highly heterogeneous, but also coupled through both the temporal dimension and the up/down regulation direction. In order to allow the users to fully express their costs, in this paper, we propose a combinatorial reverse auction (CRA) framework as the market mechanism for user aggregation. In this auction, the aggregator is the auctioneer and procures reserves from residential users. The users submit package bids consisting of combinations of both upward and downward reserves over multiple time-slots, capturing the coupling in the user cost. Furthermore, to address the infamous computational challenges of large-scale combinatorial auctions, we develop a novel fast combinatorial auction (FCA) mechanism that can be solved in polynomial time. It includes an approximate winner determination algorithm and a critical payment scheme. Notably, our proposed mechanism is rigorously proved to possess desirable economic properties such as truthfulness and individual rationality. Extensive simulations have validated the theoretic properties of the proposed CRA mechanism and its advantages over existing methods. In particular, compared with the widely employed truthful Vickery-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, CRA can be $10^{4}$ times faster than VCG when the user number is above 1000. Meanwhile, it is able to achieve near-optimal social cost, where the average optimality loss is 2.92%.</description></item><item><title>Coordinated Planning for Stability Enhancement in High IBR-Penetrated Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10716464</link><description>Security and stability challenges in future power systems with high penetration Inverter-Based Resources (IBR) have been anticipated as one of the main barriers to decarbonization. Grid-following IBRs may become unstable under small disturbances in weak grids, while during transient processes, system stability and protection may be jeopardized due to the lack of sufficient Short-Circuit Current (SCC). To solve these challenges and achieve decarbonization, the future system has to be carefully planned. However, it remains unclear how both small-signal and transient stabilities can be considered during the system planning stage. In this context, this paper proposes a coordinated planning model of different resources in the transmission system, namely the synchronous condensers and GFM IBRs to enhance system stability. The system strength and SCC constraints are analytically derived by considering the different characteristics of synchronous units and IBRs, which are further effectively linearized through a novel data-driven approach, where an active sampling method is proposed to generate a representative data set. The significant economic value of the proposed coordinated planning framework in both system asset investment and system operation is demonstrated through detailed case studies.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Swing PLL Synchronization Transient Stability of Grid-Connected Paralleled Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10720168</link><description>During grid faults, the grid-connected paralleled converter systems is susceptible to a phase-locked loop (PLL) synchronization transient instability. Most existing studies focus on first-swing transient stability analysis using the equal-area criterion. However, achieving first-swing transient stability does not guarantee overall stability, as the system may still experience multi-swing transient instability. This paper analyzes the type of multi-swing transient instability issue from two aspects: transient instability mechanism and transient stability assessment. Firstly, the mechanism of multi-swing transient instability is revealed from the transient energy conversion point of view. Then, considering transient interactions between converters, the largest estimated domain of attraction (LEDA) is constructed utilizing the Takagi-Sugeno method. Using the LEDA, the multi-swing transient instability problem of the grid-connected paralleled converter systems is quantitatively analyzed. Finally, the theoretical results are verified based on the RT-LAB hardware-in-the-loop experimental platform.</description></item><item><title>Peak Shaving Control for a Virtual Synchronous Generator in Island Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10749988</link><description>A virtual synchronous generator (VSG) can be considered a voltage source with an emulated inertial response. Depending on the grid condition, however, it is necessary to limit the output current, which renders the inverter dynamics and makes the inverter prone to losing synchronism with the grid. To address this well-known challenge, in this article, we propose a novel control method for a VSG that can achieve current limiting with stability. We describe the proposed VSG with block diagrams and validate its control responses with transfer functions. The proposed VSG can be useful to enhance the frequency stability of an island grid, which is more vulnerable to disturbances by nature than a large interconnected system. We use a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) setup for further validation. Using the HIL environment, we test the proposed VSG in an island system operating with diesel generators for generator trips, low-frequency oscillations, and voltage sags. We also test the VSG in a single-inverter-infinite-bus setup to evaluate its transient stability and compare it to ones with conventional current-limiting methods. Although the current limiting shaves the peak power of the VSG, it ensures continuous inertial and damping responses without compromising stability.</description></item><item><title>Performance-Guaranteed Finite-Time Secondary Control for Islanded AC Microgrids With Time-Varying Disturbances</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829834</link><description>This paper investigates distributed finite-time secondary control of islanded AC microgrids with prescribed performance subject to time-varying disturbances. By specifying the desired performance function, the transient and steady-state performances (including the convergence rate, the maximum overshoot, and the maximum steady-state error) of both the voltage and frequency restoration processes are considered in the design phase. Given the microgrid modeling inaccuracies and load-switching effects, the time-varying disturbances lump unmodeled dynamics, parameter perturbations, and exogenous load disturbances. A novel control scheme, which consists of two main parts, is established. In the first part, reference signal generators are constructed to produce the restoration references in a finite time for each power unit. In the second part, with the observer-based disturbance rejection technique and the prescribed performance control philosophy, performance-guaranteed finite-time secondary controllers are designed such that the finite-time restoration task with the prescribed performance is fulfilled, and the time-varying disturbance rejection is achieved. Rigorous stability analysis and case studies are conducted to verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.</description></item><item><title>Coordination of Smart Hybrid Transformers in Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10770240</link><description>A hybrid transformer is a combination of a conventional transformer and power electronics, which can be used to help alleviate power quality issues in distribution networks at lower costs than solid-state transformers. This paper proposes a novel method of coordinating multiple hybrid transformers in 3-phase distribution networks in order to reduce the curtailment of distributed generators. This is accomplished through the use of sequential linear programming, key features of which include accounting for the nonlinear voltage control capabilities of hybrid transformers, and managing the nonlinear constraints of hybrid transformer power electronics. Test cases were carried out in a modified unbalanced version of the IEEE 69-Bus network and a reduced version of the European Low Voltage test feeder. Test case results demonstrate that hybrid transformers can substantially increase the utilisation of distributed generators.</description></item><item><title>Frequency Constrained Proactive Scheduling for Secure Microgrid Formation in Wind Power Penetrated Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10819485</link><description>Microgrid formation (MF) is a core solution for increasing the resilience of distribution systems in extreme situations. However, a significant power imbalance at the MF onset will result in the violation of dynamic frequency constraints, especially in low-inertia wind power penetrated distribution systems (WPP-DSs). To ensure the secure MF after emergencies, this paper proposes a frequency constrained proactive scheduling method for WPP-DSs. The primary frequency response (PFR) model is proposed to describe the microgrid frequency dynamics after islanding, where wind turbines are deloaded to provide a primary reserve. Then the PFR model is incorporated into the scheduling model to ensure frequency security during MF process. The proposed method proactively dispatches controllable units to mitigate the power imbalance and to reserve power for frequency regulation. After emergencies, the primary reserve is released, and adaptive microgrids are securely formed to sustain critical services. The PFR model is formulated as algebraic differential equations (ADEs), which makes it difficult to solve the model directly. Thus, the PFR model is discretized into difference equations and further linearized to facilitate solution. Simulation results validate the merits of the proposed method in reducing the conservatism of proactive scheduling strategies and improving the microgrid security during MF process.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Timescale Security Evaluation and Regulation of Integrated Electricity and Heating System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10747833</link><description>The ability to operate across multiple timescales is vital for the flexibility enhancement of integrated electricity and heating systems (IEHS). Nonetheless, the common dependence on numerical solvers operating in discrete spaces poses a challenge in accurately representing their inherent multi-timescale properties, thereby compromising system security. In response, this paper proposes a novel multi-timescale matching method in continuous space to get rid of resolution constraints, circumventing discretization issues while deriving an explicit formulation for thermal dynamics. This forms the groundwork for establishing the global sensitivity factors to quantify the interdependencies within the IEHS. On this basis, a rolling security evaluation and regulation strategy that is cognizant of the asynchronous behaviors in power and heating systems is tailored. Case studies validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method to ensure the IEHS&#8217;s security.</description></item><item><title>Two-Stage Coordinated Robust Planning of Multi-Energy Ship Microgrids Considering Thermal Inertia and Ship Navigation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10834446</link><description>As maritime technology advances, multi-energy ship microgrids (MESMs) are widely used in large cruise tourism. In this context, studying cost-effective and highly reliable energy system planning methods for MESMs in their whole lifespan becomes paramount. Therefore, this paper proposes a joint planning method for a MESM during its lifespan. Firstly, a long timescale coordinated planning and operation scheme is formulated with the aim of maximizing the Net Present Value (NPV) value, thereby reducing both project investment and energy supply cost. In addition, this paper introduces novel operation models that incorporate customer thermal comfort levels, considering thermal inertia, and ship navigation, accounting for the effects of waves and wind. These models enhance the flexibility and practicality of the planning process. Finally, to ensure the safe operation of vessel and alleviate the negative effects of uncertain wind and waves during ship navigation, a robust optimization (RO) approach is employed. A case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method, with several comparison analyses further highlighting its advantages.</description></item><item><title>Two-Stage Robust Planning for Park-Level Integrated Energy System Considering Uncertain Equipment Contingency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10834468</link><description>To enhance the reliability of Integrated Energy Systems (IESs) and address the research gap in reliability-based planning methods, this paper proposes a two-stage robust planning model specifically for park-level IESs. The proposed planning model considers uncertainties like load demand fluctuations and equipment contingencies, and provides a reliable scheme of equipment selection and sizing for IES investors. Inspired by the unit commitment problem, we formulate an equipment contingency uncertainty set to accurately describe the potential equipment contingencies which happen and can be repaired within a day. Then, a modified nested column-and-constraint generation algorithm is applied to solve this two-stage robust planning model with integer recourse efficiently. In the case study, the role of energy storage system for IES reliability enhancement is analyzed in detail. Computational results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed model over other planning models in terms of improving reliability.</description></item><item><title>Resilient Preparation and Restoration Strategy for Integrated Electric-Gas Distribution Systems Considering Mobile Energy Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10835752</link><description>Extreme events can interrupt both electricity and gas supply in an integrated electric-gas distribution system (IEGDS). This work proposes a two-stage resilient preparation and restoration strategy to efficiently restore both electric and gas load services in IEGDS after extreme events considering the utilization of mobile energy storage (MES). To minimize the load loss under the damage uncertainty and limited MES resources, a unified MES assigning and dispatching strategy is proposed to optimally coordinate the numbers and locations of pre-event and post-event MES dispatching. To address the MES assigning and pre-event dispatching problems under the damage uncertainty, a two-stage stochastic optimization model is developed, which is efficiently solved by a proposed selective progressive hedging (PH) algorithm. The out-of-sample analysis indicates that the proposed methods can achieve a 53.10% reduction in average load loss compared to scenarios without MES. In addition, the proposed unified MES assigning and dispatching strategy outperforms the preparation-only and restoration-only MES dispatching strategies by reducing 2.65% and 7.13% of average load loss, respectively. Moreover, the proposed selective algorithm can reduce 7.23% to 30.53% of the computational burden compared to the conventional PH algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Time Scale Model Predictive Control-Based Demand Side Management for a Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10750304</link><description>The microgrid (MG) integrating clean renewable energy has increasingly emerged as a critical solution for addressing energy challenges and promoting sustainable energy development. However, the inherent uncertainties in renewable energy output and load consumption present significant challenges to the economic and stable operation of the MG. This paper investigates a multi-time model predictive control (MSMPC) strategy for the optimal scheduling of grid-connected MG. The proposed method can dynamically update the optimal scheduling of the MG on two-time scales based on real-time measurement data. The dispatchable thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) are incorporated into the demand side management (DSM) system to enhance flexibility and satisfy the future trend of a larger proportion of controllable TCLs. Furthermore, the TCL model considers the aging problem associated with excessive compressor cycling and the satisfaction of end users. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the economic performance and robustness of the MG system. Moreover, a real-time experiment conducted using RT-LAB further verifies the feasibility of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Enhanced Privacy-Preservation in Smart Grid Power Charging Coordination</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10759805</link><description>With the significant growth in the industry of energy storage units (ESUs) and plug-in electric vehicles, charging coordination becomes critical to avoid electric grid overload. However, without effective methods to secure the charging requests, malicious users can eavesdrop on the communication between the ESUs and the grid to extract sensitive users&#8217; information. Therefore, privacy preservation is a must in the design of charging coordination schemes. To address this critical issue, in this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving charging coordination scheme that allows the aggregator to allocate optimized amounts of charging power to all available ESUs in the community without knowing their individual charging requests details. In particular, based on aggregated secret key communication, best-effort, and cooperative power allocation schemes, the proposed coordination scheme totally hides the sensitive data from all the nodes in the network and performs the power allocation in a semi-blind fashion. Using extensive simulations, we show that our proposed scheme can achieve almost the same performance as that of charging coordination schemes in the literature based on full knowledge of the charging requests while outperforming them by an enhanced level of security. In particular, numerical results confirm that the proposed scheme can allocate 95% of what traditional schemes allocate while keeping ESU information private. Despite the anonymity and collaborative nature of the algorithm, the average convergence time is around 2.7 iterations, with 50% to 100% of cases converging in one iteration.</description></item><item><title>Production Scheduling Identification: An Inverse Optimization Approach for Industrial Load Modeling Using Smart Meter Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10769532</link><description>To cost-effectively manage the supply-demand balance of the power system, the flexibility of industrial users could be harnessed through demand-side response. To minimize the negative impact on the production of industrial users during demand-side response, general-purpose models such as the state-task network (STN) are widely used to model the energy-consuming constraints of industrial production processes. However, the required model parameters cannot be set because the required data are privately owned by industrial users and are not directly available, hindering the accurate modeling of industrial loads. In this paper, we propose production scheduling identification (PSI), an inverse-optimization-based approach for industrial load modeling under incomplete information. In PSI, industrial users&#8217; smart meter data are used to identify production scheduling parameters, thus addressing the problem of accurate load modeling when private data are unavailable. We implemented PSI with a modified STN and proposed a practical algorithm to obtain an effective solution. Numerical tests showed that PSI can identify the model parameters of a steel powder plant and a cement plant with acceptable accuracy, using only 21 days of hourly smart meter data. Compared with accurate models established with direct access to private data, the modeling error does not exceed 8.5% and 5.2%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Controlling Air Conditioners for Frequency Regulation: A Real-World Example</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10783092</link><description>Even though thermostatically controlled loads like air conditioners present a great potential for providing ancillary services to the electric power grid, the practical challenges associated with their real-time coordination have not received the necessary attention. In this work, we present a nondisruptive load control application, specifically, we demonstrate how real residential air conditioners can provide frequency regulation. Aggregate power adjustment is achieved by modifying the ON/OFF modes of the air conditioners. To account for both single and multi-zone houses, we extend the currently available techniques and develop an approach that can be used for controlling aggregations that include both types of houses. A discussion of the practical challenges encountered in our field experiments is provided, along with the hardware and software approaches we developed to circumvent them. We argue that limitations of current thermostat APIs introduce significant challenges and are an impediment to widespread adoption of fast load control applications.</description></item><item><title>Carbon-Aware Scheduling of Thermostatically Controlled Loads: A Bilevel DRCC Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10820107</link><description>Thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs), including air conditioners, heat pumps, water heaters, and refrigerators, play a pivotal role in demand response due to their thermal inertia and inherent flexibility. TCLs also substantially impact energy consumption and emissions within commercial and residential buildings, which makes them critical for the low-/zero-carbon transition that the building sector is undergoing to meet global climate objectives. To aid in this process, this paper proposes a carbon-aware robust scheduling approach for TCLs. The proposed approach precisely models carbon emissions attributed to TCLs, and formulates TCL scheduling as a distributionally robust chance-constrained (DRCC) optimization problem to ensure robust decision-making. We then develop a novel bilevel optimization reformulation strategy to address challenges such as over-conservatism and computational intractability that often arise from solving DRCC problems using conventional approaches. Real-world data evaluation demonstrates significant reductions in costs and carbon emissions compared to state-of-the-art methods, showcasing the effectiveness of our approach in potentially decarbonizing the building sector.</description></item><item><title>Optimizing Hydrogen Systems and Demand Response for Enhanced Integration of RES and EVs in Smart Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10746543</link><description>Global interest in maximizing the hosting capacity (HC) of renewable energy sources (RES) while avoiding high energy curtailment has lately grown in smart grids (SGs). This trend has been associated with the empowerment of hydrogen systems (HS) and demand response (DR). In this regard, this article proposes a new approach to optimally synergize HS and DR for elevated integration of intermittent RES in SGs. The proposed approach is predicated on a coordinated management scheme for various SG control devices, including: a complete HS (hydrogen tank, water electrolyzer, and fuel cell), hydrogen load DR, RES energy curtailment, DSTATCOM functionality of the RES inverters, storage charging rates, and electrical DR. Additionally, the flexibility of electric vehicles (EVs) with G2V/V2G functionalities has been considered to support RES and HS expansion. The proposed approach is formulated as a multi-objective optimization model that aims to optimize two competing objective functions, i.e., total costs and HC capacity of RESs. The simulation results reveal the superiority of the proposed approach which resulted in a notable HC increase of up to 17.24%, accompanied by a significant cost reduction. The proposed approach is also applied to define the optimal number of HS to maximize RES capacity.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Coordinated Automatic Generation Control Involving Distributed Energy Resources: An Aggregation Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10746554</link><description>The distributed energy resources (DERs) need to provide ancillary services due to their increasing penetration level in distribution networks (DNs). This paper proposes a hierarchically coordinated automatic generation control (AGC) scheme for the multi-level power grids, to facilitate the DERs to provide AGC service, while ensuring the operational security of the host DNs. Each DN is formulated as an individual AGC participating entity to reduce the computational and communication burden of the transmission system operator (TSO). The distribution system operator (DSO) aggregates its managed DER clusters as a whole, and evaluates the equivalent aggregation dynamic model as well as the regulation capacity. The regulation capacity is evaluated using an optimization program that consider device and network constraints, and prediction uncertainties. The aggregation dynamic model is estimated based on the curve-fitting, which represents the external power response characteristics of the DN as a second-order state-space model. In addition, P-Q affine regulation strategy is employed to coordinate frequency and voltage control. The active and reactive power commands are simultaneously allocated to DER clusters to eliminate voltage violations arising from providing AGC services. Case studies conducted on a multi-level power grid verify the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Attack-Resilient Distributed Fixed-Time Consensus Control for HBESSs and Circuit Implementation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10772734</link><description>This paper investigates the consensus control problem for heterogeneous battery energy storage systems (HBESSs) with switching topologies. An attack-resilient distributed control scheme is proposed to realize active/reactive power sharing, energy level balancing and frequency/voltage restoration within fixed-time. Rigorous proofs derive the convergence time upper bound for each objective, which is independent on the HBESSs&#8217; initial states and tighter than previous bounds. It is also shown that under bounded actuator attacks, above three control objectives can still be realized in fixed-time. Moreover, analog circuits are firstly constructed to physically implement this new control strategy, which provides a new insight to deploy advanced control schemes on HBESSs. Several simulation examples validate those conclusions from both numerical and circuital perspectives.</description></item><item><title>Near-Optimal Energy Management Strategy for a Grid-Forming PV and Hybrid Energy Storage System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10771975</link><description>Integration of Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors (SCs) into PV plants enables a hybrid PV system with more grid functions like power filtering and frequency regulation. Above that, an energy management system (EMS) plays a key role in achieving grid functions and economic performance. However, previous efforts focused on advanced forecast methods without considering real-time EMS. This paper thus aims to develop a practical real-time EMS with near-optimal performance for the degradation of the hybrid energy storage system (HESS). Firstly, a variational mode decomposition (VMD) method is combined with a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to decompose and learn feature parameters of typical historical weather data, improving forecast accuracy and shifting the operation mode periodically. Then, the mixed integer linear programming approach is utilized to find out the optimal control mode in different operation scenarios, and three-segment rules are extracted from the optimization results. Finally, the deep learning-based real-time EMS is developed. Numeric simulations validate that the proposed EMS can achieve near-optimal performance with a low computation burden. Besides, the proposed strategy can reduce the degradation cost by up to 80% compared with competitive rule-based strategies.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Area Architecture for Real-Time Feedback-Based Optimization of Distribution Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10819497</link><description>A challenge in transmission-distribution coordination is how to quickly and reliably coordinate Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) across large multi-stakeholder Distribution Networks (DNs) to support the Transmission Network (TN), while ensuring operational constraints continue to be met within the DN. Here we propose a hierarchical feedback-based control architecture for coordination of DERs in DNs, enabling the DN to quickly respond to power set-point requests from the Transmission System Operator (TSO) while maintaining local DN constraints. Our scheme allows for multiple independently-managed areas within the DN to optimize their local resources while coordinating to support the TN, and while maintaining data privacy; the only required inter-area communication is between physically adjacent areas within the DN control hierarchy. We conduct a rigorous stability analysis, establishing intuitive conditions for closed-loop stability, and provide detailed tuning recommendations. The proposal is validated via case studies on multiple feeders, including IEEE-123 and IEEE-8500, using a custom MATLAB&#174;-based application which integrates with OpenDSS&#169;. The simulation results show that the proposed structure is highly scalable and can quickly coordinate DERs in response to TSO commands, while responding to local disturbances within the DN and maintaining DN operational limits.</description></item><item><title>Lyapunov Method-Based Coherent Aggregation of Grid-Forming Converters for Transient Stability Equivalents</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10819501</link><description>Paralleled grid-forming converters (GFMs) system suffers from transient instability issues while accurate model is complicated and unsuitable to give stability analysis. Existing aggregation method requires either extensive computation or linearized model assumption to realize coherent identification, which might not distinguish unstable units from stable clusters. In this paper, a two-step algorithm is proposed to realize coherent recognition for multi-GFMs system based on Lyapunov energy function: 1) unstable GFMs are distinguished from stable clusters based on Lyapunov&#8217;s function, 2) stable GFMs are further divided into different clusters using stored potential energy as a criterion. First, large-signal model considering transient interactions and virtual impedance-based fault ride through (VI-FRT) control is derived in transient stability time-scale. Then, Lyapunov energy function (LEF) is constructed for multi-GFMs system taking virtual damping coefficients and voltage dynamics into account. Compared with existing methods, the constructed LEF presents higher stability prediction accuracy and lower computational burden. Moreover, it is found that the relative potential energy among different GFMs can be adopted to identify coherent clusters, which is proved to be mathematically equivalent to coherency recognition using power angle deviation as the indicator. Finally, parameters aggregation is realized using the concept of center of inertia (COI). Based on the proposed method, equivalent reduced model has good accuracy in transient stability prediction compared with full-order model. Both numerical simulations and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments are provided to validate the feasibility of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Equitable Active-Reactive Power Envelopes for Distributed Energy Resources in Power Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829662</link><description>The operating envelope (OE) provides an effective method to manage distributed energy resources (DERs) in power distribution systems (DSs) by offering allowable regions of nodal power injections. The active-reactive power envelope (P-Q envelope) is a desirable type of OE that would increase the allowable active power range and release the reactive power flexibility. However, existing OE studies have not established P-Q envelopes with guaranteed equitableness. This paper proposes an equitable P-Q envelope calculation and optimization method. First, we model the P-Q envelopes as convex polygons on active-reactive power planes of nodal power injections. Second, we define the proportional equitableness of P-Q envelopes and establish two equitable conditions, under which the equitableness of P-Q envelopes is proved mathematically. Third, we propose the P-Q envelope calculation method. Specifically, the P-Q envelopes are initially established considering the security constraints of DSs and then modified by a geometric method to satisfy two equitable conditions. Finally, we develop the optimization method to increase the maximum active power export and import provided by P-Q envelopes by coordinating the on-load tap changer, capacitor banks, and distributed generators. The proposed methods are tested on the 33-bus, real-world 135-bus and 455-bus DSs. Numerical results show that the proposed method efficiently obtains the P-Q envelopes with strict proportional equitableness and remarkably enlarges the size of P-Q envelopes by optimizing the control strategies of DS devices. Compared with existing OE calculation methods, the proposed method obtains the largest allowable power range using the shortest computation time.</description></item><item><title>Coordination of Multi-Agent Orderly Charging via an Incentive-Compatible Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10750297</link><description>As the cyber-physical system is developed into cyber-physical-social system, the importance of social factors is growing in the interaction between electric vehicle (EV) and power system. This paper aims to develop an incentive-compatible mechanism to coordinate multi-agent orderly charging. Firstly, the travel behaviors of EV cluster are simulated based on Monte Carlo sampling, and the load transfer model considering various social factors is constructed. Then, an orderly charging mechanism involving multiple agents based on Nash bargaining theory is proposed. In the first stage, the total profit of electric vehicle user, power grid company (PGC), and charge station operator is maximized. In the second stage, the revenue of each agent after participating in the cooperation is improved by transfer payment. Next, the carbon trading mechanism is applied in the incentive compatibility model, and the revenue of PGC participating in the carbon market under different scenarios and constraints are calculated. Finally, by comparing with the existing model, the simulation results show that the proposed multi-agent coordinated orderly charging model can reduce the pressure on the power grid caused by the randomness of EV travel, and through a fair profit distribution mechanism, it can maximize the social benefits of the coalition while increasing the revenue of each agent.</description></item><item><title>Joint Energy-Computation Management for Electric Vehicles Under Coordination of Power Distribution Networks and Computing Power Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10753461</link><description>This paper explores the integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into the power distribution network (PDN) and computing power network (CPN), leveraging EVs&#8217; inherent energy storage and computing resources. A conceptual hub called a charging and computing station (CCS) is introduced, enabling parked EVs to interact with the PDN and CPN simultaneously. The CPN is composed of the EVs and edge servers, whose computing resources are collectively utilized for processing computation tasks from various applications. The EVs and edge servers in CCSs consume energy at different nodes of the PDN. A two-stage framework is proposed for joint energy and computation management in the EV-PDN-CPN coordination. In Stage 1, a day-ahead system cost minimization problem is formulated with decisions on EV charging/discharging energy scheduling and computation task reallocation among edge servers. A fast algorithm based on the convex-concave procedure is developed to solve the Stage-1 problem whose nonconvexity stems from network constraints of both the PDN and CPN. In Stage 2, EV computing resources are utilized to achieve real-time task offloading, coping with the prediction errors of computation tasks in Stage 1 and minimizing the use of extra energy and computing resources. A linear search algorithm is proposed to solve the nonconvex Stage-2 problem. Results show that the proposed algorithms are more computationally efficient than off-the-shelf solvers, and the proposed EV-PDN-CPN coordination model can save 4.7% and 91.9% of costs in the two stages, respectively, compared to uncoordinated models.</description></item><item><title>Consensus Algorithm-Based Two-Stage Frequency Regulation Strategy With EVs Participating as VSMs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10771824</link><description>Isolated grids, with large-scale intermittent renewable energy sources (RESs), face more severe frequency stability issues. Fortunately, grid-connected electric vehicles (EVs) present an opportunity to provide frequency services. In this paper, a two-stage frequency regulation strategy, in which EVs participate in the form of a virtual synchronous machine (VSM), is proposed. First, a frequency response (FR) model is established for both charging stations (CSs) and battery swapping stations (BSSs) using VSM control. On this basis, a two-stage strategy is proposed to consider both frequency regulation performance and system economy. Specifically, in the day-ahead stage (DAS), a multi-unit economic dispatch (ED) model is designed to formulate the operation plan; in the real-time stage (RTS), a consensus-based power allocation strategy is designed for multi-units, responsive to real-time market prices. Case studies involving real-world data of load, RES, and CS illustrate the key benefits of the proposed method, including (i) decreasing frequency deviation, (ii) providing extra rotational inertia, and (iii) reducing dispatch costs.</description></item><item><title>Grid-Aware Scheduling and Control of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations for Dispatching Active Distribution Networks: Theory and Experimental Validation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829625</link><description>This paper proposes and experimentally validates a grid-aware scheduling and control framework for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs) for dispatching the operation of active distribution networks (ADNs). The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage (day-ahead), we determine an optimal 24-hour power schedule at the grid connection point (GCP), referred to as the dispatch plan. Then, in the second stage, a real-time model predictive control (RT-MPC) is proposed to track the day-ahead dispatch plan using flexibility from EVCSs and other controllable resources (e.g., batteries). The dispatch plan accounts for the uncertainties of vehicles connected to the EVCS along with other uncontrollable power injections, by day-ahead predicted scenarios. The RT-MPC accounts for the uncertainty of the power injections of stochastic resources (such as demand and generation from photovoltaic &#8211; PV plants) by short-term forecasts. The framework ensures that the grid is operated within its nodal voltage and branches power-flow operational bounds, modeled by a linearized optimal power-flow model, maintaining the tractability of the problem formulation. The scheme is numerically and experimentally validated on a real-life ADN at the EPFL hosting two controllable EVCSs (172 kWp and 32 kWp), multiple PV plants (aggregated generation of 42 kWp), uncontrollable demand from office buildings (20 kWp), and two controllable BESSs (150kW/300kWh and 25kW/25kWh).</description></item><item><title>Peer-to-Peer Multi-Energy Trading Among Heterogeneous Building Prosumers via Asynchronous Distributed Algorithm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10877846</link><description>Smart buildings in the integrated community energy system (ICES) are normally equipped with distributed energy resources (DERs), thereby creating building prosumers with both energy production and consumption. Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading among building prosumers can bring higher economic benefits for them. Therefore, a P2P multi-energy trading scheme among building prosumers is proposed, which fully explores the flexibility of buildings&#8217; heating loads based on the thermal dynamics of buildings with different thermal insulation properties. Each building prosumer is heterogeneous in terms of its computation and communication infrastructures. This results in a heavy computation burden with the traditional centralized method. To improve the computational efficiency for P2P trading among heterogeneous building prosumers, an asynchronous distributed algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is developed to enable each prosumer to trade energy asynchronously instead of waiting for the trading information from others with poor infrastructure. This asynchronous procedure integrated with the prediction and anomaly detection steps can further accelerate the convergence speed of P2P trading. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed trading scheme and the feasibility and solution optimality of the proposed algorithm.</description></item><item><title>A Joint Power and Renewable Energy Certificate Trading Method in the Peer-to-Peer Market</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10777014</link><description>A novel peer-to-peer joint power &amp; renewable energy certificate trading method is proposed to reflect the power &amp; environment values of renewable power simultaneously, as well as promote the on-site utilization. Firstly, the P2P power trading and Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) trading market models are proposed respectively considering their coupling relationships. Secondly, the P2P joint power and REC trading market model is formulated as a centralized optimization problem from the perspective of social welfare maximization in the distribution network level. Thirdly, the centralized optimization model is decomposed into local optimization problems and a distributed interactive algorithm based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers is proposed to clear the joint power and REC market, as well as protect the privacy of each participant. Lastly, case studies are performed on the modified IEEE 15-node and 69-node distribution networks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, in terms of improvement of social welfare, promotion of renewable power local consumption, and environmental value expression of renewable power.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Level Frequency Control, Resilience Enhancement and Cyber-Attack Identification in Multi-Area LCC-HVDC Interconnected Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745279</link><description>The utilization of LCC-HVDC lines is one of the methods for transferring bulk-scale power and interconnecting systems with different frequencies. Various control methods have been previously proposed to manage and control LCC-HVDC systems, but none have provided a multi-level control system capable of operating in multiple areas simultaneously. This article presents a comprehensive and multi-task control system for wide-area HVDC systems. In the proposed control systems, multi-level frequency control is conducted in multi-area LCC-HVDC interconnected grids. Additionally, various control strategies are implemented to enhance the network&#8217;s resilience during three-phase fault conditions. Furthermore, the proposed control system can detect and distinguish intelligent false data injection (FDI) cyber-attacks. Nonlinear time domain simulations conducted in MATLAB/SIMULINK demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively balance the frequency of weaker areas, enhance network resilience in critical conditions, and identify FDI cyber-attacks.</description></item><item><title>Detection-Triggered Recursive Impact Mitigation Against Secondary False Data Injection Attacks in Cyber-Physical Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10746504</link><description>The cybersecurity of microgrid has received widespread attentions due to the frequently reported attack accidents against distributed energy resource (DER) manufactures. Numerous impact mitigation schemes have been proposed to reduce or eliminate the impacts of false data injection attacks (FDIAs). Nevertheless, the existing methods either requires at least one neighboring trustworthy agent or may bring in unacceptable cost burdens. This paper aims to propose a detection-triggered recursive impact mitigation scheme that can timely and precisely counter the secondary FDIAs (SFDIAs) against the communication links among DERs. Once triggering attack alarms, the power line current readings will be utilised to observe the voltage bias injections through the physical interconnections among DERs, based on which the current bias injections can be recursively reconstructed from the residuals generated by unknown input observers (UIOs). The attack impacts are eliminated by subtracting the reconstructed bias from the incoming compromised data. The proposed mitigation method can work even in the worst case where all communication links are under SFDIAs and only require extra current sensors. The bias reconstruction performance under initial errors and system noises is theoretically analysed and the reconstruction error is proved to be bounded regardless of the electrical parameters. To avoid deploying current sensors on all power lines, a cost-effective deployment strategy is presented to secure a spanning tree set of communication links that can guarantee the secondary control performance. Extensive validation studies are conducted in MATLAB/Simulink and cyber-physical microgrid testbeds to validate the proposed method&#8217;s effectiveness against single/multiple and continuous/discrete SFDIAs.</description></item><item><title>Consecutive Load Redistribution Attack Without Line Admittance Information</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10756615</link><description>This paper develops a novel method for launching a stealthy Load Redistribution Attack (LRA) without requiring knowledge of the power network&#8217;s admittance matrix. Initially, equations involving the admittance matrix in the conventional LRA model are substituted with equivalent conditions utilizing the Power Transfer Distribution Factor (PTDF) matrix. Subsequently, a ridge regression approach is applied to estimate the PTDF matrix based on the hijacked Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data. To maximize the damage inflicted by the proposed LRA, a consecutively small-scale attack strategy is designed to gather more informative data, and the PTDF matrix estimation is then updated accordingly to enhance its accuracy. Ultimately, a stealthy LRA is completed using the final PTDF matrix estimation. The rationale behind employing the PTDF matrix estimation in the proposed method, as opposed to the estimation of the admittance matrix, is that the latter requires information on bus voltage phase angles not supplied by the SCADA system. Simulations on the IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus system, without admittance information for grid transmission lines, demonstrate the accuracy and efficacy of the proposed attack.</description></item><item><title>Infinitesimal-Attack-High-Impact Phenomena: Cyber-Attack Bifurcation in Two-Terminal HVDC Power Delivery Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10772379</link><description>Voltage-source converters (VSC) and current-source converters (CSC) are two predominant techniques in high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) power delivery systems. They are crucial for inter-regional power exchange. The cyber vulnerabilities of HVDC systems have been physically demonstrated, threatening their secure operation. To this end, this study investigates the closed-form bifurcation hyperplanes in the cyber-attack injection space of both the VSC HVDC system and the CSC HVDC system. By considering the inherent nonlinearity in intra-station switching control and inter-station coordination control, this study formulates different clusters of attack-induced equilibrium points in HVDC systems. Closed-form sufficient conditions are then derived for triggering small-attack-high-impact and even infinitesimal-attack-high-impact phenomena, in which an infinitesimal cyber-attack can activate rapid power reversal by altering the DC current polarity in VSC HVDC systems or DC voltage polarity in CSC HVDC systems. These attack-induced properties are experimentally validated by establishing a hardware-in-the-loop HVDC cybersecurity testbed, incorporating a Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) and a STM32F429-based cyber-attack prototype. The video demonstration and the first-of-its-kind open-source HVDC cybersecurity testbed are attached.</description></item><item><title>LPPMM-DA: Lightweight Privacy-Preserving Multi-Dimensional and Multi-Subset Data Aggregation for Smart Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10776781</link><description>The smart grid facilitates data centers in collecting real-time power consumption data from users, which is essential for effective power management. Such real-time data may inadvertently disclose the identities and activities of power users. Data aggregation has been identified as a viable solution to this challenge, enabling data centers to obtain only the aggregate power consumption data without accessing individual user information. However, most existing aggregation methodologies are limited to multi-dimensional data aggregation and fail to ensure user privacy, data integrity, and authentication. In this study, we propose a ring signature based multi-dimensional and multi-subset aggregation (LPPMM-DA) scheme. This proposed method allows the data center to compute both the total power consumption and the number of users within each subset across various dimensions. Based on the hardness assumption of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP), the ring signature utilized in our scheme is demonstrably unforgeable against adaptive chosen message attacks within the random oracle model. A comprehensive analysis indicates that the proposed scheme meets the security requirements for data aggregation in the smart grid context. Furthermore, performance evaluations reveal that the implementation of this scheme results in lower computational and communication overhead compared to existing related approaches.</description></item><item><title>Securing FACTS-Based Wide Area Damping Controllers Using Modified Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10772252</link><description>The performance of wide-area damping controllers (WADCs) heavily depends on the accuracy and authenticity of the measurements received from phasor measurement units (PMUs). These controllers receive PMU data and send the control commands back to grid actuators, e.g., flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) devices. The use of cyber systems required for transferring PMU measurements, however, makes the controller and entire power system prone to a variety of cyber attacks, e.g., false data injection attacks (FDIAs). On this basis, this paper (i) proposes an FDIA model against FACTS-based WADCs and (ii) develops detection and mitigation methods for the proposed attacks. First, FDIAs are designed to destabilize the system, considering realistic limitations on the power grids. Then, a modified conditional generative adversarial network (MCGAN) is utilized for the detection and mitigation of these FDIAs. To detect this attack, a detector is developed from the discriminator of MCGAN, using the fine-tuning technique. The use of this proposed method enhances detection performance in imbalanced datasets and effectively identifies unseen high-risk attacks. Following the detection, a mitigation method is implemented based on the coordination of a graph-based interpolation and the tuned generator of the developed MCGAN. This method effectively mitigates the impact of the FDIAs on the FACTS-based WADCs. The effectiveness of the attack model, as well as the detection and mitigation methods, is assessed using the two-area Kundur and New England 39-Bus test systems.</description></item><item><title>Power Distribution Network Topology Detection Using Dual-Graph Structure Graph Neural Network Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10779459</link><description>Topology detection (TD) in the context of power distribution networks (PDNs) is a fundamental requirement for a wide range of applications, such as fault localization and load management. PDNs suffer from a lack of real-time topological information due to insufficient data on switch statuses and an increasing number of switching actions caused by reconfigurations and the control of distributed energy resources (DERs). On this basis, in this paper, a novel near real-time TD method for PDNs is proposed. This method is built on a specialized graph neural network (GNN) design using data from micro-phasor measurement units ( $\mu $ PMUs), leveraging the strengths of both graph-based learning and conventional deep learning (DL) approaches. More specifically, the developed TD method implements a novel dual-graph structure GNN (DGS-GNN) model to transform the TD problem into an inductive link prediction task for a multi-graph dataset. During the training phase, a node attribute similarity graph is created, and the resulting node embeddings are aligned with the actual topology graph (ATG) using a structure-aware loss function. In the inference phase, however, unlike standard GNN models that require structural information as input, the ATG is recovered based solely on node attributes. The developed method enables TD using a limited number of phasor measurements with low inference time and superior generalization capability for unseen scenarios. Its strong performance in large-scale PDNs with varying configurations, as well as its robustness to uncertainties from DERs and noisy environments, is demonstrated on the IEEE 33- and 123-Bus benchmarks and a standard 240-Bus test system. The proposed method outperforms its DL-based counterparts in scenarios where full or partial system topology should be detected.</description></item><item><title>Detection of FDIA in Power Grid Based on Hypergraph and Attention Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10819489</link><description>False data injection attack (FDIA) is posing a threat to the security of power grids. Detection technology is an effective means to defend against FDIA, but the existing mainstream methods have insufficient detection capabilities for large-scale power grids. This study proposes a novel method that combines subgraph partitioning strategy and hypergraph model to detect FDIA. According to the principle the attack principle, the power grid is partitioned into subgraphs. Each subgraph is constructed as the hypergraph and then input into the hypergraph convolutional neural network (HGCNN). The hypergraph attention mechanism (HGAT) is adopted to pay attention to the hyperedge, where the attention score is calculated through the similarity between the node and the hyperedge. Simulations were conducted on IEEE 14-, 118-, and 300-bus systems. At the 10% attack intensity, the proposed method achieved 1.62%, 2.05%, and 2.18% higher accuracy than the optimal results of the comparison methods on three test systems, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Fostering Trust in Smart Inverters: A Framework for Firmware Update Management and Tracking in VPP Context</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829643</link><description>Ensuring the reliability and security of smart inverters that provide the interface between distributed energy resources (DERs) and the power grid becomes paramount with the surge in integrating DERs into the (smart) power grid.

This paper introduces a novel framework to manage and track firmware update history, leveraging verifiable credentials. By tracking the update history and implementing a trust cycle based on these verifiable updates, we aim to improve grid resilience, enhance cybersecurity, and increase transparency for stakeholders.</description></item><item><title>Toward Value-Oriented Renewable Energy Forecasting: An Iterative Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10771620</link><description>Energy forecasting is an essential task in power system operations. Operators usually issue forecasts and use them to schedule energy dispatch in advance. However, forecasting models are typically developed in a way that overlooks the decision value of forecasts. To bridge the gap, we design a value-oriented point forecasting approach for sequential energy dispatch problems with renewable energy sources. At the training phase, we align the training objective with the decision value, i.e., minimizing the overall operating cost. The forecasting model parameter estimation is formulated as a bilevel program. Under mild assumptions, we convert the upper-level objective into an equivalent form using the dual solutions obtained from the lower-level operation problems. In addition, a novel iterative solution strategy is proposed for the newly formulated bilevel program. Under such an iterative scheme, we show that the upper-level objective is locally linear with respect to the forecasting model output and can act as the loss function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, compared to commonly used forecasts predicting expected realization, forecasts obtained by the proposed approach result in lower operating costs. Meanwhile, the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to that of two-stage stochastic programs, but is more computationally efficient.</description></item><item><title>On the Solution Uniqueness of Data-Driven Modeling of Flexible Loads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10803001</link><description>This letter first explores the solution uniqueness of the data-driven modeling of price-responsive flexible loads (PFL).

The EMS enables power sharing among the ICE and the HESS under a fully active topology to improve control flexibility, considering that the ICE-generator set and HESS efficiencies are limited to a specific power injection operating range and transient responses. In this context, power sharing is performed using S-shaped functions that focus on maximizing supercapacitor usability to reduce fuel consumption and battery current stress. The advantage of the S-shaped function lies on its easy configuration and reduced number of control parameters. Additionally, meta-heuristic optimization is used to tune the S-shaped functions according to the sources requirements for optimal performance in standard driving cycles, while Lyapunov&#8217;s indirect method performs the stability analysis of the control strategy. Finally, experimental and computational simulations are accomplished to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed EMS compared with traditional methods and an optimal approach.</description></item><item><title>Predictive Beamforming in Integrated Sensing and Communication-Enabled Vehicular Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10753082</link><description>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has recently attracted significant research attention. This paper develops the deep learning-based predictive beamforming method for the ISAC-enabled vehicular networks. Traditional deep learning (DL) is a data-driven approach, which means that numerous training samples are required to improve system performance. In addition, embedded devices are not able to provide sufficient computing power, which hinders the application of DL solutions. Motivated by this, the dynamic self-attention mechanism is proposed to reduce the dependence of DL on training samples. Aiming for the optimal trade-off between sensing performance and computational complexity, the efficient model design, Self-Attention Channel Shuffle Mobile Network (SACSMN), is formulated. Experimental results demonstrate that SACSMN achieves similar sensing performance to that based on the full training set under the condition of few samples, the dependence of SACSMN on training samples is significantly reduced. Furthermore, SACSMN significantly reduces the computational complexity while achieving the same level of sensing performance as the benchmarks, realizing the optimal trade-off between system sensing performance and computational complexity. Benefiting from the robust sensing performance of SACSMN, the system achieves the same level of communication performance as that based on full training samples in the case of few samples.</description></item><item><title>OFDM-Based Waveform Design for MIMO DFRC Systems With Reduced Range Sidelobes: A Majorization-Minimization Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10753570</link><description>This paper focuses on waveform design for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) systems, particularly tailored for environments with multiple single-antenna downlink user equipments (UEs). Our approach leverages orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology to address the challenges of frequency-selective fading. To mitigate the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) issues inherent in OFDM signals, the desired low-PAPR property is also incorporated into the design of the waveforms. For enhanced radar sensing functionality, we introduce an advanced metric, the weighted peak or integrated sidelobe level (WPISL), meticulously crafted to measure and minimize low-range sidelobes. On the communication front, we integrate constructive interference (CI) techniques to significantly enhance quality of service (QoS) in data transmission. To address the intricate optimization challenges presented by our design objectives, we have developed an efficient algorithm anchored in the majorization-minimization (MM) framework. The numerical experiments demonstrate that this algorithm notably surpasses existing state-of-the-art benchmarks in reducing range sidelobe interference. Furthermore, our CI-based approach yields enhanced performance compared to traditional least squares (LS) methods, achieving lower symbol error rates (SER) and higher average achievable sum rates.</description></item><item><title>On the Capacity Region of Optical Mobile Communication Systems With Spatial Light Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10753637</link><description>Optical Mobile Communication (OMC) is a newly raised optical wireless communication system, where a novel device called Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) is applied. With the deploying of SLM units, OMC systems can split one light beam to multiple beams directing to different receivers, and hence bring in a new design freedom on the energy allocation for each sub-beam. In this paper, we study a general model of the OMC systems that the transmitter wants to broadcast multiple messages to multiple users, and some of the users may request a same message. We focus on characterizing the capacity region of such OMC systems, in order to assess the benefits on capacity by deploying SLM units. For the general cases, numerical solutions of the capacity region are raised, and for special cases that the system is symmetric or the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is rather low, closed form results of the capacity region are proposed. We also study the OMC system which broadcasts two different messages, and give out a partial closed form result of the capacity region. From this case, we can find that characterizing the capacity region for OMC systems is equivalent to optimizing high order polynomial, which is doable but impossible to find closed form results in general. Key words: Optical Mobile Communication, Spatial Light Modulator, capacity region.</description></item><item><title>Deep Learning Based Energy-Efficient Hybird RSMA for UAV-Assisted mmWave Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10759308</link><description>This paper investigates hybrid rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication network (RSMA-UAV-MMWCN), where a UAV transmits messages to multiple ground user equipment under the influence of an external jammer. We formulate a non-convex joint optimization problem involving hybrid RSMA matrices and a common rate allocation vector, with the objective of maximizing energy efficiency while approaching the performance of ideal hybrid RSMA. Departing from traditional non-convex problem-solving methods, we introduce a hybrid RSMA optimization scheme based on deep residual networks to enhance the feasibility of hybrid precoding and decoding. Initially, due to the absence of standardized and universal datasets, we propose a dataset generation algorithm to create training and testing datasets for subsequent communication model training. Subsequently, we construct a loss function that integrates the objective function with the constraints of the optimization problem. Lastly, to ensure that the optimization variables strictly comply with the constraints, we design a mandatory constraint module comprising modulus, power, and rate constraint sub-modules. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm surpasses traditional optimization methods, and RSMA shows significant advantages over conventional multiple access (MA) schemes.</description></item><item><title>Latency Minimization for MEC-V2X Assisted Autonomous Vehicles Task Offloading</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752420</link><description>Delay-sensitive applications for autonomous vehicles (AVs) require a substantial amount of computational resources. However, the onboard computation resources may be insufficient, resulting in long processing latencies. To deal with this critical issue, we jointly consider roadside unit (RSU) and assistant vehicle offloading, along with resource allocation, to minimize latency for vehicular tasks. This approach also takes into account frequency reuse among sub-areas for assistant vehicle offloading. The latency minimization problem can be formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. Given the inherent complexity of the MINLP problem, we propose a two-step solution. The first step focuses on the combined decision of assistant vehicle offloading and transmit power allocation. To solve this problem, we propose a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with low complexity and low average transmit power. The second step deals with RSU offloading/local computation decision, bandwidth allocation, and computation resource allocation. An iterative algorithm is proposed to achieve the optimal solution. Without adding additional computation resources, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed vehicular task offloading approach improves overall delay performance than the adaptive MEC offloading scheme and the pure MEC computing scheme.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Prioritization and Task Offloading in Vehicular Edge Computing Through Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10755183</link><description>Vehicular edge computing enables real-time decision-making by offloading vehicular computation tasks to edge servers along roadways. This paper focuses on optimizing offloading and scheduling these tasks, with an emphasis on task prioritization to maximize task completion within deadlines while minimizing latency and energy consumption across all priority levels. We propose a prioritized Deep Q-Network (DQNP) that optimizes long-term rewards through a priority-scaled reward system for each priority level, guiding the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent to select optimal actions. The model dynamically adjusts task selection based on environmental conditions, such as prioritizing tasks with higher deadlines in poor channel states, ensuring balanced and efficient offloading across all priority levels. Simulation results demonstrate that DQNP outperforms existing baseline algorithms, increasing task completion by 14%, particularly for high-priority tasks, while reducing energy consumption by 8% and maintaining similar latency. Additionally, the model mitigates resource starvation for lower-priority tasks, achieving task selection rates of 27%, 32%, and 42% for low-, medium-, and high-priority tasks, with completion ratios of 88%, 87%, and 86%, respectively, reflecting balanced resource allocation across priority classes.</description></item><item><title>Covert Beamforming Design for Cooperative NOMA-Assisted Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752409</link><description>In this paper, we consider covert communication in a cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where the ISAC relay can communicate with the covert user under the cover of probing waveforms and public communication waveforms without detection by the warden. For the proposed scheme, a closed-form expression for the minimum average detection error probability of warden is derived, where the detection threshold can be dynamically adjusted by the warden. Besides, we jointly design the covert transmission beamforming, target beamforming, and public transmission beamforming for maximizing the covert rate, subject to satisfying the successive interference cancellation decoding order, the quality of service requirement constraint at the public user, the sensing constraint, the covert constraint, and the total transimt power constraint. The sub-optimal solutions can be derived by employing semidefinite relaxation and the Charnes-Cooper transformation, which are provided to solve the proposed non-convex covert rate maximization problem. Simulation results demostrate that the covert rate of the proposed scheme can be effectively enhanced, compared to the ISAC systems assisted by orthogonal multiple access.</description></item><item><title>Design of STAR-RIS Assisted Uplink NOMA for Maximum Fairness</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10753571</link><description>To support massive connectivity with full service coverage, this paper integrates a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) into uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). In particular, the energy splitting (ES) protocol of STAR-RIS is considered, leading to two types of NOMA: ES/NOMA, which simultaneously supports all users in the transmitting and reflecting spaces of the STAR-RIS and ES/hybrid NOMA (H-NOMA), which supports multiple ES/NOMA pairs in time division multiple access (TDMA). To maximize rate fairness, we develop STAR-RIS beamforming and resource allocation algorithms for ES/NOMA and ES/H-NOMA, along with a globally optimal solution and a closed-form solution for two-user ES/NOMA. The proposed ES/NOMA algorithm achieves faster computation than conventional alternating optimization. The proposed ES/H-NOMA algorithm significantly reduces the complexity of ES/NOMA by using a closed-form solution for two-user ES/NOMA and designing a faster user assignment algorithm with optimal time allocation. The simulation results validate the algorithms and analysis for ES/NOMA and ES/H-NOMA and demonstrate their superiority over the time-switching NOMA and TDMA protocols.</description></item><item><title>Joint Beamforming and Power Allocation Design for Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10756670</link><description>Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) is considered a revolutionary technology that enables powerful signal processing directly in the electromagnetic (EM) wave domain and has significant energy-saving advantages. In this work, we explore the performance of a SIM-aided cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) system that incorporates joint beamforming and power allocation. Specifically, we jointly design the transmit power allocation at access points (APs) and the wave-based beamforming at SIMs for maximizing the system sum rate. An alternating optimization (AO)-based iterative algorithm is proposed for solving the complex non-convex problem, which is decomposed into two subproblems. For the transmit power allocation subproblem, maximum ratio transmission (MRT) is employed to maximize signal receiving power. For the optimization subproblem of SIM phase shifts, a proficient gradient ascent algorithm is deployed to ensure convergence to a local optimum. Simulation results show an enhancement in the performance of the proposed AO algorithm compared to baseline methods. Additionally, numerical results contrast with those of RIS-aided CF-mMIMO systems, highlighting the advantages of SIMs in CF networks and demonstrating the efficacy of SIM-enabled wave-based beamforming design, where increasing the number of meta-atoms and layers of SIMs is beneficial for improving the sum rate.</description></item><item><title>User Selection With Effective Channel Quality Feedback for PMI-Based MU-MIMO</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10755985</link><description>This paper addresses user selection for precoding matrix indicator (PMI)-based multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. Under a scenario where channel information can only be obtained through PMI, we formulate a problem to find a user set that maximizes the sum-rate of MU-MIMO with maximum ratio transmission precoding. We then analyze that the user set can be determined by solely considering the effective signal power, which is achieved by the convergence of the sum of interference as the numbers of users and antennas go to infinity. Based on the analysis, we propose a user selection algorithm that utilizes the effective signal power. To this end, we introduce feedback of the effective channel quality representing the effective signal power, which is then employed in choosing users. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed user selection algorithm outperforms existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Optimal AAV 3D Trajectory Design and Resource Allocation for Secure Mobile Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10755161</link><description>In this paper, we consider a secure mobile edge computing (MEC) in both uplink and downlink communication with the help of autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV), whereby offloading for terrestrial users (TUs) is performed at AAV equipped with an MEC server by secure communication between multiple TUs and AAV in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers (Eves). In order to establish a secure communication link, we propose the joint optimal design of 3D AAV trajectory and resource allocation with the aim of minimizing total user energy consumption (UEC) under the AAV constraints including the limited energy budget, computation resources, and mobility. Especially, for 3D AAV trajectory, Rician fading is considered by including the vertical domain of AAV leading to higher AAV flight freedom. To tackle the optimization problem, the proposed algorithmic solutions leverage iterative algorithms for AAV trajectory, offloading data, and both uplink and downlink transmit power. Via numerical results, it is shown that the proposed joint design significantly outperforms the conventional scheme with a separate design.</description></item><item><title>Global Progress Toward Renewable Electricity: Tracking the Role of Solar (Version 4)</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10673798</link><description>Photovoltaics (PV) represented &#8764;61% of newly installed global electricity generating capacity for 2023. The amount of electricity generated by nonhydro renewables (wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass) reached another record high and exceeded generation by global hydropower for the first time in history. Fractional year-to-year growth in both PV installations and PV-generated electricity continued at remarkable levels (&#8764;35% and &#8764;24%, respectively), while grid scale battery storage grew even faster (&#8764;120%). Combined fractional electricity generation from all low carbon sources (hydro, nuclear, and renewables) reached &#8764;39%.

Despite targets to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, fossil fuels still dominate the energy industry systems in the USA and Canada. Transition pathways are developed and analyzed comparing a complete defossilization of both energy and nonenergy demands with business-as-usual conditions based on government projections. The results demonstrate the benefits of transitioning to 100% renewable energy for all sectors, as excess low-cost electricity from solar PV can be used for power-to-X solutions to produce electricity-based fuels, chemicals, and materials. By 2050, the power sector will only consume 20% of generated electricity, with the remaining used to electrify the heat, transport, and industry sectors. Thus, 86% of all primary energy in the system comes from renewable electricity, as total electricity generation increases from 4394 TWh in 2020 to 20 795 TWh in 2050. Solar PV reaches 78% of all electricity generation, leading to 10.6 TW of installed capacity. The full energy industry sector transition leads to reductions in both levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and levelized cost of final energy (LCOFE). The LCOE sees massive reductions from 72 &#8364;/MWh in 2020 to 25 &#8364;/MWh in 2050, and the LCOFE decreases from the current 50 to 41 &#8364;/MWh in 2050. The strong operational synergies between solar PV and flexible electrolysis enable a transition pathway that demonstrates the viability of a Power-to-X Economy in achieving climate targets of net-zero emissions. The high share of solar PV indicates a Solar-to-X Economy characteristic.</description></item><item><title>Development of an Optical Library for Coevaporated CdSexTe1&#8722;x</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10777397</link><description>The conversion efficiency of CdTe solar cells may be improved by bandgap engineering, i.e., changing the bandgap value through the addition of Se in the absorber. The Se alloying enables a short-circuit current density improvement, as it leads to a bandgap energy value decrease. Furthermore, it has been associated with increased minority carrier lifetimes, assuring high open-circuit voltage values. An Se gradient profile control can further optimize the solar cell performance. Thus, an optical model baseline of the CdSexTe1&#8722;x (CST) compound was developed. Spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements were conducted to accurately extract the optical constants of ten CST layers deposited through coevaporation with x varying from 0 to 1. Using the measured dielectric function spectra from the discrete CST layers with varying x, and considering the composition-induced shift in the critical point energies, an energy-shift model was employed to develop the accurate optical library for the CST compound for any x value to provide data for future modeling and optimization. The library accuracy was validated through optical simulations of the quantum efficiency of a graded CST solar cell using the finite-difference time-domain method by replicating the Se profile in the absorber layer measured through secondary ion mass spectrometry.</description></item><item><title>Impact of Encapsulation Processing Conditions on Degradation Mechanisms of Carbon-Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10876559</link><description>Perovskite photovoltaic (PV) cells have achieved a record 26.7% efficiency, but improvements in stability against humidity, temperature shifts, and light exposure remain crucial. In this work, we explored mesoporous carbon-based perovskite (c-PSC) devices because of carbon's stability and the elimination of a heat-sensitive hole transport layer. Encapsulation materials exhibiting promising properties with silicon PV, including a thermoplastic polyolefin encapsulant, were applied under different lamination conditions to investigate the impact on c-PSC devices&#8217; durability, which is a novel study for this specific combination of materials. Inadequate curing can compromise adhesion, reduce moisture resistance, and accelerate perovskite decomposition under light exposure. Increasing the lamination temperature by 20&#8201;&#176;C allowed samples to withstand 1000 h of damp-heat conditions, with a 30% reduction in efficiency, while lower temperature lamination caused immediate performance drops. While light exposure remained highly degrading, higher lamination temperatures delayed damage, preserving 2.5% of the initial power conversion efficiency after 400 h of aging and slowing perovskite decomposition.</description></item><item><title>A Spot-Area Method to Evaluate the Incidence Angle Modifier of Photovoltaic Devices-Part 2: Modules (Differential Method)</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10835743</link><description>In Part 1 of our article, we presented a method to quantify the incidence angle modifier (IAM) of photovoltaic (PV) devices, which differs from the methods proposed in IEC 61853-2 through the following: it utilizes a spot-area irradiation, delivered by an optical fiber system, a customized angle probe holder, and a current-to-voltage converter. Part 1 focused on single-cell devices and presented the validation of the new method on two different cell architectures. In Part 2, we generalize that method to commercial-size silicon PV modules, mirroring by the approach already used for module-level spectral responsivity measurements described in IEC 60904-8:2014. The proposed method is motivated by inclusion in the currently ongoing revision of IEC 61853-2, providing research centers and testing laboratories with an additional option to perform IAM measurements indoors. The reproducibility of the proposed method is addressed in this work via interlaboratory comparison with a different measurement method for the same quantity and with a detailed uncertainty analysis.</description></item><item><title>Effect of Encapsulant Degradation on Photovoltaic Modules Performances Installed in Different Climates</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10835212</link><description>A damage analysis was conducted on photovoltaic modules with identical bill of materials exposed to different climates: Cfb moderate and Af tropical, according to the K&#246;ppen-Geiger climate classification. The combination of high temperature, relative humidity, and high ultraviolet (UV) radiation was the cause of severe degradation for the modules exposed to tropical climates (TR), whereas the module exposed to a moderate climate did not experience a significant loss in performance. The modules installed in TR, on the contrary, showed significant power degradation after approximately 8 years of exposure, primarily attributed to acetic acid-related degradation modes. Encapsulant samples were extracted from the selected modules and characterized to determine changes in chemical structure, thermal stability, and consumption of additives and stabilizers. The results of qualitative additive analysis showed that the UV absorber was no longer detectable in the front encapsulant extracted from modules exposed in TR. The consumption of the stabilizers was considered as the main cause of reduction of molar mass. The presence of acetic acid was evident in both electroluminescence images and ion chromatography results. While differential scanning calorimetry successfully detected a reduction in molar mass, thermogravimetric analysis, and infrared spectroscopy proved unsuitable for identifying chain scission phenomena.</description></item><item><title>Growing Panes: Investigating the PV Technology Trends Behind Frequent Early Failures in Modern Glass&#8211;Glass Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10847304</link><description>Photovoltaic (PV) module materials and technologies continue to evolve as module manufacturers and buyers try to minimize costs, maximize performance, and speed deployment. Both silicon and thin film modules are converging toward similar &#8764;3 $\text{m}^{2}$ glass&#8211;glass designs with thinner glass sheets to increase power output while reducing module weight, and both types are increasingly mounted on single-axis trackers. At the same time, an increasing number of PV sites have been reporting spontaneous glass breakage in early life systems deployed with these &#8220;big, floppy modules.&#8221; In this article, we identify the concurrent module changes that may be contributing to increased early failure, explain the trends, and discuss their reliability implications. We suggest that larger, thinner glass sheets along with variations in heat treatment and quality may be contributing to glass vulnerability. We note that trends toward weaker or back-mounted frames may also be contributing to module failures, especially for &#8220;extra-extra-large&#8221; modules mounted on trackers. Combinations of these trends may have pushed modules to a threshold at which increasing early failures are causing the front edge of the &#8220;bathtub curve&#8221; to re-emerge. Current qualification testing appears to be ineffective for catching these early failures in new module designs, and module buyers do not have enough reliability information&#8212;or cannot prioritize such information&#8212;during module procurement. Additional research is needed to identify the field conditions leading to glass breakage and if there is one or multiple limiting flaws in new module designs causing glass breakage. Early failures may be mitigated by returning to more robust designs or ensuring better module testing and quality assurance.</description></item><item><title>Investigating the Crosslinking, Degradation, and Adhesion Behavior of Photovoltaic Encapsulants Under Thermal Accelerated Aging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10804171</link><description>Degradation of photovoltaic (PV) module encapsulant characteristics that lead to mechanical embrittlement and delamination remains a cause of failure in solar installations. A multiscale reliability model connecting the encapsulant mechanical and fracture properties to the degraded molecular structure and interfacial bonding to adjacent solar cell and glass substrates was previously published. The model, developed primarily for poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) acetate (EVA) encapsulants, remains to be experimentally validated. Determining the degradation and crosslinking kinetics of alternative encapsulants, such as polyolefin elastomer (POE) and EVA/POE/EVA composites (EPE), can generalize the model. In this work, we subject fully cured EVA, POE, and EPE encapsulants to accelerated thermal aging to determine how high temperatures impact reaction kinetics. An increase in gel content (crosslinking) and decrease in crystallinity of the encapsulants under hot-aerobic (90 &#176;C, 22% RH) and hot-anaerobic (90 &#176;C, sealed in N2 air) aging were observed, even in the absence of UV and crosslinking initiators. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)-attenuated total reflectance analysis showed insignificant encapsulant degradation, demonstrating the critical role of UV and moisture in accelerating degradation. Adhesion testing performed on coupon-level specimens (cell/encapsulant/glass laminates) showed decreases in adhesion energy, Gc, from 5000 h of hot-dry (90 &#176;C, &#8764;1% RH) and hot-humid (90 &#176;C, 60% RH) aging. POE coupons demonstrated the best stability, followed by EPE then EVA. For EVA and POE, hot-humid aged coupons experienced a larger decrease in Gc due to enhanced hydrolytic degradation. Hot-dry aging condition demonstrated that thermal degradation of the interface could be significant even if the encapsulant experiences negligible degradation in the absence of UV and elevated humidity.</description></item><item><title>Comparison of Reflector Materials for a Vertical Bifacial Solar Canal</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829584</link><description>In this article, we assessed five reflector materials for hypothetical vertical bifacial arrays as a solar canal technology option. We screened the materials (CoverMax, CoverTuff, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) Poly, polyester canvas, and Vivosun aluminized Mylar) for reflectivity, tensile strength to minimum mounting load, vapor barrier performance to reduce evaporation, and energy production. Vivosun had the highest reflectivity (albedo of 0.87&#8211;0.93) and increased annual energy production more than 40% compared with a system without reflector, but plastically deformed under tensile strength testing. All materials reduced evaporation at least fivefold compared with the control. Following our preliminary assessment, we calculated the levelized cost of electricity of a hypothetical vertical bifacial array with two height configurations (short system at 2 m and tall system at 3 m) and four hybrid reflectors (fabricated from strong base layer materials with a top layer of Vivosun) and compared these results with systems with single-material reflectors and with systems without reflectors. We found that the tall system with a hybrid reflector made from PVC Poly had the lowest levelized cost of electricity. However, when considering other performance metrics, such as tensile strength and vapor barrier performance, a hybrid reflector made from CoverMax emerged as the best candidate of the options considered.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Soiling Estimation and Optimized Cleaning Strategies for Industrial Rooftop PV Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10847915</link><description>The accumulation of dust and dirt on solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, known as soiling, reduces energy generation and conversion efficiency of a PV plant. Therefore, regular cleaning is essential to maintain optimal plant performance and economic viability. Fixed-interval cleaning schedules become uneconomical during periods such as low-insolation, rainy, or cloudy events. This study proposes a data-driven method to estimate the soiling ratio (SR) for a 504-kWp rooftop PV plant in India using power, temperature, and irradiance data. A PV panel temperature estimation model is employed, based on ambient temperature and solar irradiance, which simplifies the process by eliminating the need for direct temperature measurements. The analysis reveals that regular cleaning is essential despite rainfall, with energy losses due to soiling ranging from 32% to 47% across inverters, with soiling rates of 4.6&#8211;5.5% per day. A dynamic cleaning schedule, considering weather and soiling conditions, was developed to reduce these losses. Economic evaluation demonstrated that manual cleaning following the proposed dynamic schedule is cost effective, with profit margins of 48&#8211;77%, comparing energy gain and cleaning cost. Compared with fixed-interval cleaning, the proposed method maintained the same average SR but yielded 25&#8211;49% higher profitability across inverters.</description></item><item><title>A Single Voltage Sensor Bypass Switch-Based Photovoltaic Fault Localization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10877760</link><description>Photovoltaic (PV) energy systems are becoming an important source of sustainable energy. However, undiscovered faults within these systems may cause significant efficiency reduction. Localizing these faults to the module level is important for a quick fault diagnosis and maintaining the overall system efficiency. This article presents a novel method to localize intrastring, line-ground, cross-string, and partial shading faults in an $N$ &#215; $M$ PV system down to the module level. The approach utilizes a single voltage sensor in the combiner box of the PV system and $\lceil N/2 \rceil$ bypass switches per string to bypass the connected PV modules during faults. The technique initially relies on identifying the faulty string. Once this string is determined, the voltage associated with each module in that string is found. Each module's voltage in that string is obtained by measuring the string voltage after bypassing each module corresponding to an activated switch. Subsequently, the resulting linear equations are solved to obtain the voltage of each module in the faulty string. The technique is verified using simulation and an experimental setup for a 5 x 4 small-size PV system. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate that the technique can accurately localize faulty modules with only $N$ voltage samples of the faulty string. The proposed method is robust to variations in the maximum power point tracking algorithm, ensuring faults are localized effectively in real-time.</description></item><item><title>Electrical and Thermal Characteristics Optimization in Interposer-Based 2.5-D Integrated Circuits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10735253</link><description>In this work, a comprehensive analysis and optimization method of electrical and thermal characteristics in 2.5-D integrated circuits (ICs) is performed, including rapid heat distribution modeling, integrated voltage regulator (IVR) chip modeling, and power delivery network (PDN) modeling. Based on the proposed method, chiplet placement, decoupling placement, and IVR parameter settings that compromise the total PDN impedance, IVR impedance, and thermal distribution characteristics can be obtained. First, a rapid thermal analysis method for multiple heat sources is proposed by integrating the equivalent thermal resistance method and commercial tools. The thermal method significantly improves the computational efficiency and reduces the memory usage. Then, we analyze the electrical characteristics of a typical low dropout (LDO) and model the complete 2.5-D PDN, including interposers, chiplets, IVRs, through-silicon vias (TSVs), bumps, decoupling capacitors, and other components. The electrical and thermal problems in the 2.5-D system are formulated and a Metropolis rule-based algorithm is used to derive optimal solutions. Finally, the optimal placement schemes and parameter settings are iterated under different constraints. This method allows for the adjustment of target impedance, noise current, thermal limit, and other constraints based on varying practical situations. In the time-domain analysis, it can be found that the capacitance value is reduced while maintaining the power supply performance. With high accuracy in thermal and electrical modeling, this work provides an in-depth reference for the co-design of chiplet-based 2.5-D ICs.</description></item><item><title>A Single-Ended High-Voltage-Compliant 11-bit Current-Steering Digital-to-Analog Converter for Adaptive Noise Cancellation in Power Over Data Line Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10769052</link><description>Automotive Ethernet is considered to be the backbone of future in-vehicle data communication. One main feature is its ability to simultaneously transmit data and energy via power over data lines (PoDL). This article proposes the design of a single-ended high-voltage (HV)-compliant 11-bit current-steering digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The converter is tailored for the utilization as digitally controlled current source in an adaptive noise-cancellation filter for PoDL networks. Designed in an HV-compliant 180-nm bipolar complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (BiCMOS) semiconductor technology, the DAC features a monolithically combined topology of two identical 10-bit low-voltage (LV) current-steering DACs supplied at 1.8 V and two complementary HV-compliant output current stages. Main design features of the segmented LV DAC are the utilization of single-ended current cells with an optimized switching logic, proposed to enhance the cells transient performance and energy efficiency. Furthermore, a newly derived  $Q^{4}$  asymmetric rotated walk switching scheme is investigated. At a maximum output voltage of 60 V, the proposed DAC can deliver a bidirectional output current with the amplitudes of up to 500 mA. The proposed DAC exhibits the highest voltage compliance combined with the highest output current compared with related works. It also features the second highest resolution. Operated at a sample rate of 10 MS/s with a resolution of 11 bit, a spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of 57.8 dB could be measured for a synthesized single tone at 100 kHz, as well as a maximum integral nonlinearity (INL) error of 1.61 LSB and a differential nonlinearity (DNL) error of 1.05 LSB.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Parallel Feed-Forward Current Ripple Rejection (PFFCRR) Technique for High Load Current High PSRR nMOS LDOs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10769013</link><description>There is a significant demand in systems-on-chip (SoCs) for a high-power efficiency low-dropout regulator (LDO) that provides lower dropout voltage, higher load current, and low quiescent current. A high-power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) at the mid-to-high frequency band (0.1&#8211;10 MHz) is crucial for LDO to generate low-noise power supplies when driven by switching power converters. However, this presents a significant challenge to enhancing the PSRR since the pass field-effect transistor (FET) operates in the deep triode region at high-current and dropout conditions. In this article, a parallel feed-forward current ripple rejection (PFFCRR) technique is proposed to improve the PSRR performance regardless of the operation region of the nMOS pass FET. The proposed approach senses the supply-induced current ripple and cancels the original ripple through a current path that runs parallel to the nMOS pass FET. The proposed LDO is fabricated in a 180-nm BCD process. The proposed LDO achieves a PSRR better than &#8722;35 dB up to 10 MHz at 300-mV dropout voltage with 0.5-A load current and a load capacitor of  $2.2~\mu $ F. The PFFCRR approach achieves a PSRR improvement of 18 dB at 1 MHz at 100-mV dropout voltage with a 2.15-A load current when the pass FET operates in the deep triode region. Moreover, the proposed LDO enhances the transient performance with an overshoot and an undershoot of 40.54 and 36.45 mV, respectively, against  $\Delta {I}_{\text {LOAD}}$  of 1 A with a slew rate of 1 A/ $\mu $ s.</description></item><item><title>A 28-Gb/s Single-Ended PAM-4 Transceiver With Active-Inductor Equalizer and Amplitude- Detection LSB Decoder for Memory Interfaces</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10767360</link><description>This study proposes a power-efficient 28-Gb/s single-ended four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) transceiver (TRX) for next-generation memory interfaces. In the transmitter (TX), an active-inductor equalizer (EQAI) is utilized, while in the receiver (RX), an amplitude-detection least significant bit (LSB) decoder is employed. In the TX, conventional equalization techniques consume substantial power owing to the inclusion of additional components and strong driving power required to mitigate channel-induced intersymbol interference (ISI). However, the proposed EQAI achieves a bandwidth extension up to the Nyquist frequency through gain boosting while reducing hardware costs and minimizing the driving strength. This results in a simple structure with operational efficiency, facilitating low power consumption and a compact area compared with conventional TX equalizers. In PAM-4 RX, the power dissipation is proportional to the clock buffer and the number of comparators used for data decoding. To improve the hardware cost and the power usage in the RX, the proposed RX design utilizes an amplitude-detection LSB decoder, which reduces the number of comparators and comprises a one-stage structure by detecting the amplitude differences between the reference and input voltages during LSB decoding. This ensures the hardware cost and power consumption improvement while implementing a one-tap direct decision feedback equalizer (DFE). The TRX for memory interfaces is optimized for low-power performance by employing these methods, resulting in a notable energy efficiency of 0.96 pJ/bit. This structure is fabricated using a 28-nm CMOS technology, and the core area of the TRX occupies 0.0053 mm2.</description></item><item><title>Design and Analysis of a 26&#8211;32-GHz 6-bit Passive Vector Modulation Phase Shifter for CMOS Bidirectional Transceiver</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10753092</link><description>This article presents a 26&#8211;32-GHz 6-bit bidirectional passive vector modulation phase shifter (PVM-PS) in 40-nm CMOS for phased array systems.

This work presents a low-power 0.031 mm $^{2}~3$ -MHz bandwidth noise-shaping (NS) successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) tailored for implantable biosensor applications. A highly energy- and area-efficient reset-free residue-processing scheme is proposed. This scheme facilitates noise transfer function (NTF) optimization by enabling control over complex poles. It establishes a unique auxiliary feedback path from the infinite impulse response (IIR) back to the finite impulse response (FIR) by eliminating the need for the FIR filter&#8217;s reset phase. This auxiliary feedback loop, which could not be achieved in previous FIR-IIR structures, is a key enabler for achieving high energy efficiency and design flexibility. The in-band quantization noise suppression is boosted by the proposed complex conjugate poles optimization technique, while a low  $kT/C$  input-referred noise has resulted. The prototype, fabricated in 65-nm CMOS technology with a 7-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC), consumes  $370~\mu $ W from a 1-V supply and occupies an active area of only  $0.17\times 0.18$  mm (0.031-mm2). Operating at an 80-MHz oversampling frequency, the proposed ADC achieves a signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) of 70.2 dB over a 3 MHz bandwidth, demonstrating its small area, high efficiency, and high performance for implantable biosensor applications that require high data rates.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Design of Ripple-Free Bandgap Reference Circuit With p-n-p Bipolars</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10706624</link><description>This article presents a chopperless ripple-free low-noise bandgap reference (BGR) circuit in a traditional CMOS process that uses only p-n-p bipolars. Almost all chopperless bandgap structures require the use of n-p-n bipolars in special twin well processes, and they are prone to substrate and power supply noise. This work has targeted the &#8220;chopperless&#8221; scenario in p-n-p bipolar-based bandgap architecture by presenting a low offset temperature coefficient (TC) preamplifier design in the error amplifier. Notably, the design&#8217;s worst case power supply rejection (PSR) was &#8220;derived, simulated, and experimentally measured&#8221; to be &#8722;35 dB at 7.5 MHz, which is above par with any previously designed circuits. Furthermore, for the first time, an extensive mathematical analysis is provided for the self-bias loop, which is traditionally used to suppress the systematic offset. The prototype implemented in the TSMC 65-nm low-power (LP) process is untrimmed and occupies an active area of 0.0226 mm2 while drawing a current of  $48.36~\mu $ A from 0.9-V supply. Measurement results of 28 chips and 10 chips in two different wafers show that the achieved nominal reference voltage of 500 mV has an average accuracy of 27 ppm/&#176;C, similar to the curvature uncompensated BGR that uses chopping. Furthermore, the measured noise spectral density at 1-Hz offset is  $10~\mu $ V/ $\sqrt {(}\text {Hz})$ , which is the state of the art among chopperless bandgap structures.</description></item><item><title>MASL-AFU: A High Memory Access Efficiency 2-D Scalable LUT-Based Activation Function Unit for On-Device DNN Training</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10766892</link><description>On-device deep neural network (DNN) training faces constraints in storage capacity and energy supply. Existing works primarily focus on optimizing the training of convolutional and batch normalization (BN) layers to improve the compute-to-communication (CTC) ratio and reduce the energy cost of off-chip memory access (MA). However, the training of activation layers remains challenging due to the additional off-chip MA required for derivative calculations. This article proposes MASL-AFU, an architecture designed to accelerate the activation layer in on-device DNN training. MASL-AFU leverages nonuniform piecewise linear (NUPWL) functions to speed up the forward propagation (FP) in the activation layer. During the error propagation (EP) process, retrieving derivatives from a lookup table (LUT) eliminates the need for redundant retrieval of the input data used in FP. By storing LUT indices instead of the original activation inputs, MASL-AFU significantly reduces and accelerates MA. Compared to other activation function units, MASL-AFU offers up to a  $5.8\times $  increase in computational and off-chip MA efficiency. In addition, MASL-AFU incorporates two dimensions of scalability: data precision and the number of LUT entries. These scalable, hardware-friendly methods enhance MASL-AFU&#8217;s area efficiency by up to  $3.24\times $  and energy efficiency by up to  $3.85\times $ .</description></item><item><title>Falcon: A Fused-Layer Accelerator With Layer-Wise Hybrid Inference Flow for Computational Imaging CNNs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745739</link><description>Computational imaging (CI) has advanced significantly due to the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Its edge deployment relies on layer fusion to offload the monstrous external memory access (EMA) of feature maps, necessitating the handling of overlapped features either through reusing or recomputing them. Depending on how the boundary-handling strategy is organized, the induced computing complexity and EMA can be optimized. However, state-of-the-art CI accelerators primarily apply homogeneous inference flows, which employ a single overlap-handling strategy throughout the fused layers, limiting their ability to balance computation and data access. In this article, we explore layer-wise optimization in fused-layer CNNs by exploiting hybrid-strategy inference flows and devising a corresponding computing architecture. We categorize layer-wise strategies and put forward a layer-wise hybrid inference flow (LHIF) to integrate their advantages, and we propose an optimization procedure that explicitly analyzes essential figures of merit (FoMs), including throughput, EMA, and energy efficiency. Furthermore, we develop a high-throughput accelerator&#8212;Falcon&#8212;to efficiently support LHIF under massive parallelism, especially with a time-division-multiplexing (TDM) buffer interface that enables seamless access to feature maps stored in an interleaved manner. Layout results show that the accelerator, delivering 41 TOPS with 1.5 MB of feature-map buffers, supports LHIF while increasing the die area by only 1.4% and power consumption by only 0.7%. Extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the versatility of LHIF in working scenarios at operational, design, and system levels. Compared with using homogeneous inference flows, the proposed LHIF achieves Pareto optimality with up to  $2.28\times $  higher throughput and  $3.5\times $  lower EMA.</description></item><item><title>RCU- 2m: A VLSI Radix- 2m Cubic Unit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10747396</link><description>Cubic operations are among the most used arithmetic operations in many applications that demand higher order simultaneous operand computation, such as cryptography and bicubic polynomial interpolation. This article proposes a novel VLSI radix- $2^{m}$  cubic unit (RCU- $2^{m}$ ) capable of processing cubic operations at m bits simultaneously, with m values of 2 (RCU-4), 3 (RCU-8), and 4 (RCU-16). RCU-16 emerges as the most area-efficient configuration, surpassing RCU-8 and notably outperforming RCU-4. In the 8-bit scenario, RCU-16 achieves remarkable area savings, surpassing the literature&#8217;s proposed cubic unit by  $11.58\times $ . Across all configurations, RCU- $2^{m}$  consistently outperforms the automatically selected cube unit, with energy savings ranging from  $1.04\times $  to  $2\times $ . In application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based analyses, RCU-16 consistently exhibits superior performance in both area and energy savings compared with RCU-4, RCU-8, and solutions from the literature. These findings emphasize the importance of adopting radix- $2^{m}$  configurations, particularly RCU-16, for optimal energy-constrained VLSI applications.</description></item><item><title>A Methodology for Datapath Energy Prediction and Optimization in Near Threshold Voltage Regime</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10788034</link><description>In this article, we propose a method for sizing an arbitrary combinational datapath to minimize its energy consumption. Our method involves deriving expressions for the components of energy consumption at both the stage and path levels. In this work, we identify overshoot energy ( $E_{\text {OS}}$ ) consumption as a previously unreported component contributing to energy consumption, particularly significant in the near/sub-threshold voltage regime. We determine that this  $E_{\text {OS}}$  consumption is proportional to the input and output transition times and size of a logic gate at a particular stage of a datapath. We also observe that, for a given number of stages (N) and path effort, the total energy consumption is optimized when the stage effort (f) in a datapath is kept constant. Based on our observations and derivations of all the energy components and the requirement for a constant &#8220;f&#8221; in the datapath, we develop a method to minimize the energies of a logic circuit while maintaining the timing closure requirement. We determine that the non-critical paths (NCPs) must be sized to a minimum &#8220;f&#8221; while maintaining the timing requirements. We verified our models on several ISCAS and EPFL benchmark circuits with an average reduction of 28.1% (41.2%) and 19.2% (28.4%) in energy consumption [figure of merit (FoM)], respectively. The proposed methodology predicts the total energy consumption at a stage and path level of N-stage logic, with only one-time SPICE simulation on a single stage, with a maximum error of 1.3% and 1.62%, respectively, against SPICE simulations. The simulations are performed in Synopsys HSPICE environment with ST Microelectronics 65 nm CMOS and 28 nm FDSOI technology nodes, resulting in a very good agreement with the developed methodology.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Hardware Accelerator Based on Medium Granularity Dataflow for SpTRSV</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10759529</link><description>Sparse triangular solve (SpTRSV) is widely used in various domains. Numerous studies have been conducted using CPUs, GPUs, and specific hardware accelerators, where dataflows can be categorized into coarse and fine granularity. Coarse dataflows offer good spatial locality but suffer from low parallelism, while fine dataflows provide high parallelism but disrupt the spatial structure, leading to increased nodes and poor data reuse. This article proposes a novel hardware accelerator for SpTRSV or SpTRSV-like directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). The accelerator implements a medium granularity dataflow through hardware-software codesign and achieves both excellent spatial locality and high parallelism. In addition, a partial sum caching mechanism is introduced to reduce the blocking frequency of processing elements (PEs), and a reordering algorithm of intranode edges&#8217; computation is developed to enhance data reuse. Experimental results on 245 benchmarks with node counts reaching up to 85392 demonstrate that this work achieves average performance improvements of  $7.0\times $  (up to  $27.8\times $ ) over CPUs and  $5.8\times $  (up to  $98.8\times $ ) over GPUs. Compared with the state-of-the-art technique (DPU-v2), this work shows a  $2.5\times $  (up to  $5.9\times $ ) average performance improvement and  $1.7\times $  (up to  $4.1\times $ ) average energy efficiency enhancement.</description></item><item><title>A Programmable and Reconfigurable CMOS Analog Hopfield Network for NP-Hard Problems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10737881</link><description>Analog Hopfield networks perform continuous energy minimization, leading to efficient and near-optimal solutions to nonpolynomial (NP)-hard problems.

A programmable and reconfigurable analog Hopfield network is presented that addresses these challenges through a reconfigurable Manhattan architecture with a high-precision 14-bit floating-gate (FG) compute-in-memory (CiM) fabric. The network is implemented on a field programmable analog array (FPAA) and experimentally tested on three different NP-hard problems with different scaling challenges: Weighted Max-Cut (high connectivity and weight precision), traveling salesman problem (TSP) (high connectivity and medium weight precision), and Boolean Satisfiability/3SAT (low connectivity and weight precision) where it solved each problem optimally in microseconds.</description></item><item><title>Cost-Effective Analytical Models of Resistive Opens Defects in FinFET Technology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10750047</link><description>FinFET technology has become an attractive candidate for high-performance and power-efficient applications. However, its susceptibility to defects increases due to the complexity of the process fabrications and smaller feature sizes. This article proposes compact and low-cost analytical models to evaluate the delay increase in FinFET-based circuits due to resistive open defects. The models rely on electrical simulations to precharacterize the circuit library. Analytical expressions are developed for the three types of resistive opens that may occur in FinFET-based logic cells using multifin and multifinger structures. These types of resistive opens include: a resistive open at the drain or source of the transistors (RODS), a resistive open affecting the gate of a single transistor, and a resistive open affecting the gates of both nMOS and pMOS transistors. Compact analytical models are also developed to evaluate the delay increase due to the resistive open defects under process variations. Independent and correlated process variations are taken into account. The analytical models have been validated against SPICE electrical simulations. The proposed analytical models can be used to evaluate the detectability of resistive open defects, significantly reducing the cost of dealing with different defect sizes. Potential applications of the developed analytical models are delineated. This work allows us to have higher quality and reliable electronic products.</description></item><item><title>A Histogram-Based Calibration Algorithm of Capacitor Mismatch for SAR ADCs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10737885</link><description>The conversion accuracy of successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is mainly affected by the capacitor mismatch. In this brief, a histogram-based calibration technique is proposed, which does not require any additional analog circuitry. In this work, the method of partial fitting is used to detect irregular code densities, and construct a cost function to update the weight recursively. The prototype of the calibration is verified with a 12-bit SAR ADC manufactured in 28-nm standard CMOS process. At the sampling rate 50 MS/s, the measurement results indicate that the maximum spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) can be improved from 77.26 to 88.26 dB, using 10.6 fJ/conversion-step, including reference voltage buffer, with a low-frequency input signal.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive Maintain Power Signature (MPS) Scheme With Reusable Current Generator for Powered Device (PD)</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10736935</link><description>The power over Ethernet (PoE) technology has gained intensive attention in networking market owing to the advantages of compactness, flexibility, and cost in application. The automatic maintain power signature (MPS) function specified by IEEE standard extracts the periodic pulsed current to enable applications requiring low power modes. However, a large driving capacity is required due to a large MPS current above 10 mA, sacrificing a certain area. This brief proposes an adaptive MPS scheme, which reuses existing class regulator and delay timer to source a pulsed MPS current to meet the MPS requirements, saving an area of 0.0104 mm2. The proposed MPS scheme has been fabricated in 0.18- $\mu $ m 120-V BCD process and the area is  $1.37\times 1.00$  mm2.

Capacitively and inductively coupled resonators are used for impedance matching to achieve a flat in-band power gain and a high out-of-band rejection. Meanwhile, the output matching network provides a second-harmonic suppression to improve the average efficiency within the bandwidth of the PA. The measurements show that the proposed PA exhibits an output power of 31&#8211;32.5 dBm and a power gain of more than 10.5 dB from 11.5 to 17.5 GHz. Due to the matching networks providing convenient dc feed and dc block, the chip dimension is only  $2.1\times 1.1$  mm2, corresponding to a power density of 0.77 W/mm2. The proposed PA demonstrates a competitive fractional bandwidth and power density in GaN PA monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs).</description></item><item><title>A 10-Gb/s/lane, Energy-Efficient Transceiver With Reference-Less Hybrid CDR for Mobile Display Link Interfaces</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10718328</link><description>This brief presents an energy-efficient transceiver supporting a 10-Gb/s/lane display link interface between the application processor (AP) integrated circuits (IC) and timing controller (TCON)-embedded source driver IC for mobile applications. An embedded clocking scheme is adopted to save clock distribution power, which also reduces the required number of off-chip I/O channels. A transmitter (TX) sends 20-Gb/s aggregate data through two differential data lanes, and a receiver recovers a 5-GHz half-rate clock. The TX employs a latch-less serializer using divided clocks in a staggered phase, achieving energy efficiency of 0.43 pJ/b/lane. In the RX, a hybrid clock and data recovery (CDR) tracks a half-data rate with a digital loop filter (DLF) and subsequently locks the frequency and phase with an analog loop filter (ALF). By deactivating the DLF and edge deserializer once a coarse frequency lock is acquired, the RX achieves an energy efficiency of 0.53 pJ/b/lane. The prototype transceiver, fabricated using a 28-nm CMOS technology, occupies an active area of 0.196 mm2 and achieves an energy efficiency of 1.23 pJ/b/lane, including a charge-pump phase-locked loop (CP-PLL) with clock distribution.</description></item><item><title>A Combo EMI Suppression Scheme for Multimode PSR Flyback Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10715998</link><description>Electromagnetic interference (EMI) is an inevitable issue in power electronics applications. Although many kinds of solutions have been presented to attenuate EMI noise, there is still little research about the EMI suppression scheme utilized in multimode primary-side regulation (PSR) flyback converters.

By leveraging auto-rotation calibration and self-compensation strategies in the analog domain, the proposed technique demonstrates robust performance across PVT variations. Two additional sub-channels are involved in the TI quantization mechanism, where the continuous rotation of the sampling clock distribution ensures their operation in calibration mode. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed calibration, an  $8\times 8$  bit 8 GS/s TI-SAR ADC is designed and implemented in a 28-nm process and occupies an active area of 0.273 mm2, with each sub-channel SAR ADC covering only  $86\times 23~\mu $ m. Extensive simulation results validate the efficacy of RRC, demonstrating significant improvements in dynamic performance.

For applications featuring a large number of RXs, the deployment of a shared wireless LO can enhance the energy efficiency of the system. The proposed ET mixer retrieves phase-following (PF) LO pulses from the wireless LO, aligning them, respectively, with the peak and valley of the radio frequency (RF) input signal. This allows the RX to track the target peak and valley envelopes of the RF input signal, improving mixer gain and conversion quality (Q). Moreover, eliminating the integrated LO conserves system power and reduces area. The RX also employs intermediate-frequency (IF) calibration to derive an adaptive IF1 LO based on the uncertain frequency of the wireless LO, thus creating a known IF2 with a narrow bandwidth to enhance sensitivity, interference tolerance, and channel selectivity. Fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, the RX achieves a sensitivity of -104 dBm with a -50-dBm wireless LO, while occupying 0.2-mm2 active area and consuming  $225~{\mu }$ W at a 10-kb/s data rate. The achieved RX figure-of-merit (FOM) is 180 dB. The sensitivity loss is within 10 dB with the wireless LO power ranging from -69 to -30 dBm. With the -50-dBm wireless LO, the RX exhibits 44- and 32-dB tolerances to 100-kb/s and 5-Mb/s on-off-keying (OOK) interference with 5-MHz offset.</description></item><item><title>An Ultra-Low-Jitter Fast-Hopping Fractional-N PLL With LC DTC and Hybrid-Proportional Paths</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10843985</link><description>This work presents an ultra-low-jitter fractional-N PLL capable of wideband fast hopping. There is an analog proportional path and a digital proportional/integral path in the PLL. The PLL is digital-path-dominant during settling and analog-path-dominant after settles; therefore, the fast-lock characteristic of the digital PLLs and the low-jitter characteristic of the analog PLLs are achieved. The frequency switching algorithm does not rely on the linearity of DCO&#8217;s tuning curve, nor rely on the hopping step between the previously locked frequency and the target frequency. The frequency detection is based on a high-speed counter, which uses the quadruple timing margin selection and can operate up to 20 GHz. The counter is integrated with a feedback clock generator, which is functionally the same as a multi-modulus divider. In addition, this work proposes an LC delay circuit as the coarse digital-to-time converter (DTC), which has better potential than the RC-based counterparts to reduce the phase noise of DTC and thereby reduce the jitter of fractional-N PLLs. The prototype is implemented in 28-nm CMOS process and occupies 0.21-mm2 core area. The measured hopping time is  $0.52~{\mu }$ s across a 3.5-GHz step with 80-ppm settling accuracy. The measured rms jitter (integrated from 1 kHz to 100 MHz) is 36.8 fs for the integer-N channel, 41.3 fs for the far-integer fractional-N channel, and 61.7 fs for the near-integer fractional-N channel. The measured near-integer fractional spur is -62.4 dBc. The measured power consumption is 34 mW.</description></item><item><title>A 5-MS/s 16-bit Low-Noise and Low-Power Split Sampling SAR ADC With Eased Driving Burden</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10843815</link><description>This article presents a 16-bit 5-MS/s successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with the proposed split sampling (SS) technique. The SS decouples the sampling and conversion operations of the ADC, effectively addressing the tradeoff among the driving burden of the digital-to-analog converter (DAC), sampling noise, power, and bit-cycling speed. The SS consists of 2 20-pF sampling capacitors and a 1-pF DAC. The sampling capacitors sample the input with low noise and cancel the kT/C noise of the DAC, avoiding the preamplifier saturation issue and easing the noise aliasing. As the sampling capacitors track the input when the DAC is performing bit-cycling, the input driving is eased with the extended tracking time. The small DAC guarantees fast speed and low power. Moreover, statistical residue measurement (SRM) is employed to reduce the preamplifier&#8217;s noise and the quantization noise, efficiently improving the signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) and the bit weight calibration accuracy. The ADC is fabricated in a 180-nm process and occupies an active area of 0.57 mm2. With the SS and SRM, the ADC samples at 5 MS/s and achieves a 93.7-dB SNDR with a 5.31-mW power consumption, yielding a high Schreier-figure-of-merit (FoM) of 180.4 dB.</description></item><item><title>A 140 dB-DR Light-to-Digital Converter Using Current-Domain Hybrid Zoom for Baseline Cancellation and Interference Compensation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10777019</link><description>Noninvasive optical sensing techniques, such as photoplethysmography (PPG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), provide great user comfort and obtain rich hemodynamic information in term of pulse oximetry, blood flow velocity, and blood vessel stiffness. Conventional optical sensor readouts have evolved toward higher dynamic range (DR) and power-efficiency. In addition to quasi-static baseline input signals, fast-varying interferences due to motion artifacts (MAs) or environment changes can also cause saturation. How to compensate or tolerate these disturbances efficiently is one of the prominent properties required in emerging optical sensors. This article presents a high DR, energy-efficient light-to-digital converter (LDC). The proposed LDC utilizes a second-order incremental delta-sigma modulator (I-DSM) for high resolution, while a power-scaling OTA is utilized to reduce power consumption of the main integrator. The current-domain static zoom (SZ) is exploited to cancel baseline currents for high DR, while the dynamic zoom (DZ) tracks and compensates the residual ac input current to prevent fast-varying interference from saturating the analog-front-end (AFE) during fine quantization. Fabricated in a standard  $0.18~\mu $ m CMOS process, the LDC achieves a very high DR of 140 dB in a 2 kHz bandwidth. Thanks to the power-scaling OTA, the signal-to-noise and distortion-ratio (SNDR) of the ac path reaches 94.55 dB with only  $44~\mu $ W from a 1.2 V supply. The benefits of SZ and DZ have been validated by chest PPG measurement with significant MAs.</description></item><item><title>A 160-MHz BW 68-dB SNDR 36.2 mW Continuous-Time Pipelined &#916;&#931; ADC With DAC Image Prefiltering</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10817558</link><description>This article reports a continuous-time (CT) pipelined delta-sigma ( $\Delta \Sigma $ ) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) featuring a proposed prefiltering scheme to tackle the DAC image issue. We introduce a fast-shunting route for high-speed DAC image current with a passive RC low-pass filter (LPF) on the quantization (QTZ) path. Together with another LPF on the signal path to align the delay, the CT front-end stage provides a residue signal with a small amplitude and smooth edges, relaxing the linearity requirements on the residue amplifier (RA) and the back-end stage. Specifically, the RC delay in the two LPFs is tracked over process variation, relaxing the signal leakage to the back end. For the back-end stage, we use an all-pass filter (APF) analog delay in a second-order CT cascade of integrators with feedforward (CIFF)  $\Delta \Sigma $  modulator (DSM) with an input feedforward path. Such an APF can restore the unity signal transfer function (STF) under the influence of excess loop delay (ELD), thus simplifying the matching requirement between analog and digital domains&#8217; transfer functions. Prototyped in a 28-nm CMOS process, the proposed ADC operates with a clock of 3.2GHz, occupying an active area of 0.104 mm2. It exhibits a 72-dB dynamic range (DR) and a 68.5-dB peak signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) over a 160-MHz bandwidth (BW). The modulator consumes 36.2 mW, yielding 165-dB Schreier figure-of-merit (FOMs) based on the SNDR.</description></item><item><title>A Single-Stage Bias-Flip Regulating Rectifier With Fully Digital Duty-Cycle-Based MPPT for Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10758432</link><description>Piezoelectric energy harvesting (PEH) has been considered a promising solution for replacing conventional batteries to power wireless sensors. A complete PEH system typically includes three stages: ac-dc rectification, maximum power point tracking (MPPT), and output voltage regulation to power the load circuits. Unfortunately, most prior works focus only on the first one or two stages. A few employ three, but unfortunately, they are in cascaded stages, which results in cascaded power efficiency loss. This article proposes a single-stage bias-flip MPPT regulating rectifier (BMRR), which integrates the active bias-flip rectification, MPPT, and output voltage regulation into one stage. The proposed BMRR transfers energy from the piezoelectric transducer (PT) directly to the output capacitor by employing fewer switches, removing the conventional bridge rectifier, and eliminating cascaded energy loss. In addition, the design was implemented in a fully digital fast-MPPT technique based on an improved duty-cycle-based (DCB) algorithm to let the PT voltage jump to the maximum power point (MPP) in only one step. The proposed BMRR rectifier was fabricated in a 180-nm BCD process. The measured results show 930% power enhancement compared to a full bridge rectifier (FBR) and 92.5% end-to-end (E2E) efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Pseudo Hysteretic Controlled Gap Time Modulated Isolated DC-DC Converter With Common-Mode Transient Immunity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10787447</link><description>A pseudo hysteretic controlled gap time modulated isolated dc-dc converter is presented. A pseudo hysteretic controller is designed to bound the output voltage with fast load transient and small output voltage ripple. It implements gap time modulation based on the load current and is used to adjust the power delivered by a Class-D power amplifier (PA) with high efficiency. A high-impedance load shift keying (LSK) scheme is also proposed with common-mode transient immunity (CMTI) to complete the global feedback loop without requiring an additional transformer or capacitor. The prototype is implemented in a standard 65-nm CMOS process. With an input voltage of 2.5 V, the proposed converter generates an isolated output voltage that ranges from 1.8 to 2.2 V with a peak efficiency of 73.3% and an output voltage ripple of only 20 mV. With a load current transient step of 40&#8211;150 mA, this converter demonstrates unobservable overshoot and undershoot.

The fabricated chip prototype in 0.18- $\mu $ m silicon on insulator (SOI) CMOS process can adapt to both PZT5A (nominal  ${C_{\text {P}}}~{\sim }~114$  pF) and PZT5H (nominal  ${C_{\text {P}}}~{\sim }~190$  pF) and is capable of operating over a wide temperature range from  ${-} 25~{^{\circ }}$ C to  $85~{^{\circ }}$ C. The proposed  $C_{\text {P}}$  auto-calibration and CR bootstrapping driver can improve the  $\eta _{\text {flip}}$  to as high as 93.6% at an output power of  $496.6~{\mu }$ W. With the proposed coarse detection and fine calibration technique, this work demonstrates a high measured peak power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 94.5%, corresponding to a ~23% improvement when compared with the prior ultrasound energy harvesting interface while achieving a favorable figure of merit (FoM) of  $8.13{\times }$ .</description></item><item><title>A Closed-Loop EMI Regulated GaN Power Converter With In Situ EMI Sensing and Global Excess-Spectrum Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10843842</link><description>As electromagnetic interference (EMI) standards evolve from the rules-based approach to the risk-based alternate, online EMI assessment and control become critical for lifetime risk management. With such a trend, this article presents an online closed-loop EMI regulation for gallium-nitride (GaN) power converter. Specifically, a wide-bandwidth in situ EMI sensor is integrated to characterize the noise through autocovariance-based spectrum analysis. A stepwise random space sampling (SRSS) significantly compresses the sensing time without sacrificing the accuracy for real-time EMI spectral characterization. Based on the online measured noise, a global excess-spectrum modulator is devised to adaptively track, and hence, continuously regulate the maximum excess noise. A prototype chip was fabricated in a 180-nm BCD process, commanding two enhancement-mode GaN power switches at a nominal frequency of 2.8 MHz. The measurement results show that the integrated in situ EMI sensor can capture the EMI spectra with a 500-MHz sampling bandwidth and 1-mV sensing accuracy while reducing the sensing time by over 25 times. Compared to the commercial spectrum analyzer, it demonstrates a maximum discrepancy of 3 dB. The embedded global excess-spectrum modulator accomplishes a 9-kHz-resolution EMI regulation, dynamically optimizing the EMI control.</description></item><item><title>A 2.5&#8211;20 kS/s In-Pixel Direct Digitization ECoG Front End With Submillisecond Stimulation Artifact Recovery</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10807162</link><description>Neural stimulation is used routinely to diagnose and treat neurological disorders. The stimulation artifacts are, however, problematic for closed-loop neuromodulation therapy, which dynamically adjusts the electrical stimulation parameters based on real-time feedback from the recorded neural activity because they can cause saturation or prolonged recovery times in traditional recording front ends. This article presents a per-pixel second-order  $\Delta \Sigma $  analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for direct digitization of neural signals, which addresses the stimulation artifact recovery time in voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)-based quantizers with a fast-recovery, overrange-detecting phase quantizer. The ADC uses a pseudo-virtual ground feedforwarding (PVG FF) technique and a complementary input  ${G} _{\text {m}}$ -C filter with per-pixel decimation. It supports four recording modes covering 2.5&#8211;20 kS/s through a power-efficient, bandwidth-scalable continuous time  $\Delta \Sigma $  modulator. Fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS process, this  $300\times 300~\mu $ m2 ADC achieves  $\gt 250\times $  faster (0.05&#8211;0.4 ms) stimulation artifact recovery time, enabling in-stimulation recording. Recording with artifact tolerance was demonstrated through an in vivo whisker barrel rat experiment.</description></item><item><title>Modular DR- and CMR-Boosted Artifact-Resilient EEG Headset With Distributed Pulse-Based Feature Extraction and Neuro-Inspired Boosted-SVM Classifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10767693</link><description>This article presents the design, development, and experimental testing of a flexible, modular electroencephalography (EEG) headset for long-term epilepsy monitoring and individualized treatment. System- and circuit-level techniques are employed to improve energy efficiency while ensuring high-quality EEG recordings and accurate seizure detection. The wearable prototype includes digital active electrodes (DAEs) for high-dynamic-range (DR) recording, motion artifact removal (MAR), and feature extraction (FE), along with a central backend (BE) for patient-specific classification, wireless connectivity, and common-mode rejection (CMR) boosting. DAEs communicate through a time-shared data bus, minimizing wires and enabling flexible electrode placement, maximizing system scalability. Each DAE enhances recording quality with: 1) calibrated CMR boosting (&gt;80-dB common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) with 1- $M\Omega $  AE-to-AE mismatch); 2) SC notch filtering for power-line noise; 3) real-time electrode-tissue impedance (ETI) measurement for MAR and dc correction; and 4) an autoranging mechanism with 17-dB DR enhancement. In-AE FE cuts AE-to-BE communication power by 99.1%, while pulse-based frequency sampling reduces FE power by 92.1%. A neuromorphic multiplier-less adaptively boosted support vector machine (SVM) maintains high detection accuracy with 97.6% less classification power than conventional designs. The chip was implemented in 180-nm CMOS, and the wearable system components (DAE, wireless, and CMR boards) were miniaturized. Experimental testing showed IIRN ( $0.64~\mu V_{\text {rms}}$ , 0.5&#8211;100 Hz), adjustable gain/bandwidth, DR (80 dB), SNDR (74.5 dB), and CMRR (89.2 dB without mismatch, &gt;80 dB with mismatch). Measurement results also confirm the system&#8217;s effectiveness in motion artifact estimation and removal. In vivo measurements demonstrate the system&#8217;s efficacy and latency in detecting neurologically relevant events. Seizure detection results (96.4% sensitivity, 0.41 FPR, 1-s latency, zero SRAM usage) on prerecorded EEG data from 21 patients are also reported. The system is compared to state-of-the-art EEG recording and seizure detection systems, highlighting its advantages.</description></item><item><title>MANTIS: A Mixed-Signal Near-Sensor Convolutional Imager SoC Using Charge-Domain 4b-Weighted 5-to-84-TOPS/W MAC Operations for Feature Extraction and Region-of-Interest Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10750406</link><description>Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have prompted the search for enhanced algorithms and hardware to support the deployment of machine learning (ML) at the edge. More specifically, in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), vision chips must be able to fulfill the tasks of low to medium complexity, such as feature extraction (FE) or region-of-interest (RoI) detection, with a sub-mW power budget imposed by the use of small batteries or energy harvesting. Mixed-signal vision chips relying on in- or near-sensor processing have emerged as an interesting candidate because of their favorable tradeoff between energy efficiency (EE) and computational accuracy compared with digital systems for these specific tasks. In this article, we introduce a mixed-signal convolutional imager system-on-chip (SoC) codenamed MANTIS, featuring a unique combination of large  $16{\times }16~4$ b-weighted filters, operation at multiple scales, and double sampling, well suited to the requirements of medium-complexity tasks. The main contributions are (i) circuits called DS3 units combining delta-reset sampling (DRS), image downsampling (DS), and voltage downshifting and (ii) charge-domain multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations based on switched-capacitor (SC) amplifiers and charge sharing in the capacitive DAC of the successive-approximation (SAR) ADCs, MANTIS achieves peak EEs normalized to 1b operations of 4.6 and 84.1 TOPS/W at the accelerator and SoC levels, while computing feature maps (fmaps) with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) ranging from 3 to 11.3%. It also demonstrates a face RoI detection with a false negative rate (FNR) of 11.5%, while discarding 81.3% of image patches and reducing the data transmitted off chip by  $13{\times }$  compared with the raw image.</description></item><item><title>A 28-nm 16-kb Aggregation and Combination Computing-in-Memory Macro With Dual-Level Sparsity Modulation and Sparse-Tracking ADCs for GCNs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10720191</link><description>Computing-in-memory (CIM) architectures have demonstrated remarkable potential in addressing the memory wall. However, previous CIMs were often designed for multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations, which presents a myriad of challenges when deploying graph convolutional networks (GCNs) on CIM macros. This work presents a compact 6T SRAM-based aggregation and combination CIM macro (ACCIM) using: 1) a cell array with compact 6T bitcells, local jump and computing cells (LJCCs), and sparse-tracking analog-to-digital converters (STADCs) to improve energy efficiency in both input sparsity and weight bit sparsity; 2) an LJCC and STADC to improve the signal margin; 3) a CIM macro architecture with an aggregation input unit (AGINU) to support both GCN aggregation and GCN combination/convolutional neural network (CNN) MAC; 4) a graph pruning algorithm that divides the graph data into memory-friendly subgraphs; and 5) an error modeling-based pre-training method to improve the inference accuracy. A fabricated 28-nm 16-kb charge-domain SRAM-CIM macro achieved an energy efficiency of 86.87 TOPS/W and an area efficiency of 2344 GOPS/mm2 for GCNs with 4-bit degree input, 8-bit features, and 15-bit output.</description></item><item><title>BEE-SLAM: A 65-nm 17.96-TOPS/W Location-Sharing-Based Multi-Agent Neuromorphic SLAM Accelerator for Swarm Robotics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10786265</link><description>Multi-agent (MA) simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) has been rigorously explored to enhance map accuracy in swarm robotics. Although centralized MA SLAM systems, which depend on a server for complex computations in map optimization, have been extensively studied, the circuit-domain approaches to decentralized MA SLAM systems are still limited due to challenges such as limited memory capacity and security vulnerabilities in wireless inter-agent data transmission. Thus, we propose a BEE-SLAM accelerator, a location-sharing MA neuromorphic SLAM accelerator inspired by bee communication for decentralized MA SLAM systems. The location-sharing-based MA error correction (MAEC) is employed to attain accurate map results without loop closure with a 94.81% reduced number of operations compared to the global map-based MA SLAM. In addition, a  $7 {\times } 7$  pulsewidth modulation (PWM)-based hybrid mixed-signal/digital pose-cell (HY-PC) array with pseudo pose cells (PPCs) achieves  $2.04{\times }$  energy efficiency compared to the oscillatory pose-cell array. The test chip fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS technology achieves a peak energy efficiency of 17.96 TOPS/W under  $350 {\times } 450$  m outdoor exploration.</description></item><item><title>An Energy-Efficient Unstructured Sparsity-Aware Deep SNN Accelerator With 3-D Computation Array</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10777513</link><description>Deep spiking neural networks (DSNNs), such as spiking transformers, have demonstrated comparable performance to artificial neural networks (ANNs). With higher spike input sparsity and the utilization of accumulation (AC)-only operations, DSNNs have great potential for achieving high energy efficiency. Many researchers have proposed neuromorphic processors to accelerate spiking neural networks (SNNs) with dedicated architectures. However, three problems still exist when processing DSNNs, including redundant memory access among timesteps, inefficiency in exploiting unstructured sparsity in spikes, and the lack of optimizations for new operators involved in DSNNs. In this work, an accelerator for deep and sparse SNNs is proposed with three design features: a 3-D computation array that allows parallel computation of multiple timesteps to maximize weight data reuse and reduce external memory access; a parallel non-zero data fetcher that efficiently searches non-zero spike positions and fetches corresponding weights to reduce computation latency; and a multimode unified computation scheduler that can be configured to maximize energy efficiency for spiking convolution (SCONV), spiking  $Q, K,~\text {and}~V$  matrix generation, and spiking self-attention (SSA). The accelerator is implemented and fabricated using 40-nm CMOS technology. When compared with state-of-the-art sparse processors, it achieves the best energy efficiency of 0.078 pJ/SOP and the highest recognition accuracy of 77.6% on ImageNet using the spiking transformer algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Hawkeye: A Point Cloud Neural Network Processor With Virtual Pillar and Quadtree-Based Workload Management for Real-Time Outdoor BEV Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10807164</link><description>Large-scale 3-D processing using the point cloud neural network (PNN) has become essential for applications such as an autonomous driving system. Among the various methods, pillar-based PNN is widely utilized for processing large-scale outdoor environments. However, due to the irregular and sparse nature of the point cloud compared to the regular and dense image, achieving high efficiency has been challenging in previous works. Inspired by the LiDAR mechanism that generates point clouds, this article proposes Hawkeye, a large-scale bird&#8217;s-eye-view (BEV) detection processor designed for end-to-end processing of pillar-based PNN. Hawkeye incorporates three key features: 1) a feature encoding core (FEC) that introduces virtual pillars (VPs), dynamically generating temporal pillars to facilitate continuous processing; 2) a map management core (MMC) that utilizes a quadtree-based workload management system, enabling region-of-interest (ROI)-based skipping to optimize computational efficiency; and 3) a low-precision neural engine (LPNE) that employs a bit-slice compute architecture with sign-magnitude (SM) representation, enhancing slice-level skipping (SLS) capabilities. Fabricated in Samsung&#8217;s 28-nm CMOS technology, Hawkeye achieves a performance of 44.2 frames per second (FPS) at 320 MHz on the PointPillars with the KITTI dataset. Furthermore, with the aid of ROI-based skipping and SM-based SLS, Hawkeye demonstrates an effective energy efficiency of 38.5 TOPS/W under 0.74 V and 40 MHz.</description></item><item><title>A Scalable BEV Perception Processor for Image/Point Cloud Fusion Applications Using CAM-Based Universal Mapping Unit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10807165</link><description>The integration of multi-sensor data like image and point cloud for information complementarity is crucial for 3-D perception scenarios like autonomous driving. Recently, bird&#8217;s eye view (BEV)-based sensor fusion is attracting more and more attention but the significant computational overhead constrains their widespread application at the edge. First, there are numerous irregular memory access operations in BEV fusion networks. For example, sparse convolutions (SCONVs) in the point cloud branch and irregular BEV plane mapping result in significant memory addressing and mapping overhead. Furthermore, multi-sensor fusion leads to rapid expansion of model size, making it difficult and expensive for single-chip solutions to meet the demands. Based on the above challenges, this work proposes an image and point cloud fusion processor with two highlights: a content addressable memory (CAM)-based deep fusion core to accelerate a variety of irregular BEV operations and chip-level parallelism design supporting flexible interconnect topology. The proposed chip is fabricated in 28-nm CMOS technology. Compared with existing image or point cloud accelerators, the proposed chip achieves higher frequency,  $2\times $  higher area efficiency, and  $2.61\times $  higher energy efficiency for sparse point cloud processing. To the best of authors&#8217; knowledge, this work is the first accelerator for BEV-based multi-modal fusion networks.</description></item><item><title>A 70&#8211;86-GHz Deep-Noise-Canceling LNA With Dual-Stage Noise Cancellation Using Asymmetric Compensation Transformer and 4-to-1 Hybrid-Phase Combiner</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10637256</link><description>In this article, a 70&#8211;86-GHz deep-noise-canceling low noise amplifier (LNA) is presented to reduce the noise contributions from the multi-stage amplifiers under low transistor  $g_{m}$  at mm-wave. Such an LNA consists of dual-stage noise-canceling topology, i.e., an asymmetric common-gate (CG)-based noise-canceling stage and a resistive feedback noise-canceling stage. The asymmetric compensation transformer (ACT) is utilized in the CG-based noise-canceling stage to compensate the amplitude and phase imbalances, thereby enhancing the noise-canceling ratio. In addition, the second stage based on resistive feedback noise-canceling operation with a 4-to-1 hybrid-phase combiner (HPC) is introduced to reduce the transistor noise contribution, especially improving noise performance at mm-wave band. Based on the aforementioned mechanism, a deep-noise-canceling LNA is implemented and fabricated using a conventional 40-nm CMOS technology. The proposed LNA exhibits a 4.8&#8211;6.5-dB noise figure (NF) within the operation frequency range of 70&#8211;86-GHz. The peak gain is 16.5 dB, while the peak input 1-dB compression point (IP $_{1\,\text {dB}}$ ) is &#8722;8.5 dBm. The power consumption is 25 mW under a 1.1-V supply, which occupies a compact core area of 0.085 mm2.</description></item><item><title>A 6.5-to-8-GHz Cascaded Dual-Fractional-N Digital PLL Achieving &#8722;52.79-dBc Fractional Spur With 50-MHz Reference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10659739</link><description>This work presents a 6.5-to-8-GHz cascaded dual-fractional-N digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) that avoids fractional spur degradation in near-integer channels by utilizing two PLLs with fractional frequency control words (FCWs). The FCWs of the two PLLs are carefully selected to achieve the optimal fractional spur performance at the output. A 14-bit segmented digital-to-time converter (DTC) with a background nonlinearity calibration achieving a 0.05% integral nonlinearity (INL) is proposed for further fractional spur suppression. This work achieves an integrated jitter of 154.4 fs in integer-N mode and an integrated jitter of 190.8 fs in fractional-N mode, respectively. It consumes 14.2 mW with a 50-MHz reference, leading to a figure of merit (FoM) of &#8722;242.9 dB. The fractional spur at near-integer channel is as low as &#8722;52.79 dBc, and the reference spur is &#8722;72.4 dBc. This PLL is implemented in a 65-nm CMOS process, occupying 0.48-mm2 core area.</description></item><item><title>A 0.69-Noise-Efficiency-Factor 55&#215; -Preamp-Gain Dynamic Comparator With a Stacking FIA</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10659080</link><description>This article presents a fully dynamic, low-noise, low-power comparator. Its key highlight is the four-times current-reuse factor, which improves the pre-amplifier gain by at least two times without increasing the power consumption. This causes the proposed design to have a two-times smaller input-referred noise and a two-times better noise-efficiency factor (energy  $\times $  noise power). In prior comparators, the maximum current-reuse factor of the pre-amplifier was only two times. This small current-reuse factor limits the pre-amplifier gain to 30 times, which restricts the further improvement in the noise-efficiency factor. By contrast, this work stacks two floating inverter amplifiers (FIAs) in order to greatly increase the current-reuse factor to as large as four times. As a result, the pre-amplifier gain is increased by 55 times, which is helpful for improving the noise-efficiency factor. Implemented in a 28 nm CMOS process, the prototype comparator achieves a  $38~{\mu }$ V input-referred noise and a 0.48 pJ energy consumption per comparison under a 0.9 V supply. The noise-efficiency factor is as good as 0.69 nJ $\cdot \mu $ V2, which is three times better than the prior FIA-based comparator and 23 times better than the classic StrongArm latch (SA latch). This noise-efficiency factor is the best among all reported works so far.</description></item><item><title>An Isolated DC-DC Converter With Full-Duplex Communication Using a Single Pair of Transformers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10645969</link><description>This article presents a 200-MHz isolated dc-dc converter for simultaneous power and full-duplex data transfer using a single pair of transformers, for the applications of low-cost galvanic isolation.

However, contemporary decoder designs encounter challenges due to the demanding hardware resources required by their high processing complexity. In this work, we propose a novel column-wise trellis min-max (CW-TMM) algorithm, which significantly reduces the sorter overheads in the existing TMM method without degrading the error-correcting power. We also deploy the message compression to the trellis-based algorithm for effectively reducing hardware costs, even allowing the storage-aware long codes by accommodating large-sized on-chip memories. Through the integration of advanced low-cost optimization schemes together, the prototype CW-TMM decoder in a 28-nm CMOS technology for 4-kB 0.9-rate NB-LDPC codes demonstrates a 54% reduction in on-chip memory size and a 63% decrease in decoding complexity, enhancing the area efficiency by more than 2.4 times than the state-of-the-art approaches.</description></item><item><title>Compute SNDR-Boosted 22-nm MRAM-Based In-Memory Computing Macro Using Statistical Error Compensation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10642976</link><description>The accuracy of embedded non-volatile memory (eNVM) in-memory computing (IMC) designs is primarily limited by analog non-idealities. This article introduces a magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) IMC macro in 22-nm featuring offset-compensating current sensing (OCCS) to reduce the static analog-to-digital converter (ADC) column mismatch and a low-overhead statistical error compensation (SEC) block compensating for non-linearity arising due to bitline/source-line (BL/SL) wire parasitics. Both assist in enhancing the bank-level compute signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio (SNDR). As the inner dimension of the matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) increases, the compute SNDR reduces due to increased location-dependent non-linearity arising from BL/SL wire parasitics. An SEC-enabled SNDR boost of 2.7&#8211;6 dB is obtained over different operating points. This boost can be balanced to achieve a substantial  $5\times $  reduction in energy per 1-b operation while incurring a modest SEC energy overhead of 0.8% and area overhead of 12.2%. Finally, the study demonstrates an SEC-enabled increase in neural network (NN) accuracy from 74.8% to 82.0% for CIFAR-10 by last layer mapping of ResNet-20, without resorting to noise-aware training.</description></item><item><title>A 1.8% FAR, 2 ms Decision Latency, 1.73 nJ/Decision Keywords-Spotting (KWS) Chip Incorporating Transfer-Computing Speaker Verification, Hybrid-IF-Domain Computing and Scalable 5T-SRAM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638323</link><description>This article reports a keyword-spotting (KWS) chip with a significantly reduced false alarm rate (FAR) for voice-control edge devices. The key techniques are threefold: 1) transfer-computing speaker verification (SV)-assisted KWS that compresses the required parameters and enhances the KWS+SV computation efficiency while maintaining the KWS accuracy and reducing the overall FAR; 2) hybrid-IF-domain computing that handles both the analog and digital input features (IFs), alleviating the tradeoff between the computation power and system accuracy of the first layer; and 3) scalable 5T-SRAM array that sustains the leakage and read power when it is upscaled.

The proposed circuits achieve a 71% reduction in leakage power. Additionally, a detailed discussion on the trade-off between switching current increase and leakage current reduction is presented. The overhead of switching power is 0.3% and 1.9% for read and write operations, respectively. Simulation results show that our static random-access memory (SRAM) has actual power reduction when active rate is lower than 21% at  $25~^{\circ }$  C, 81% at  $75~^{\circ }$  C, and 100% at  $85~^{\circ }$  C or higher.

While variability dominates the failure probability, noise-induced bit flips in weakened bitcells lead to dynamic instability. We study both effects jointly in a unified SPICE simulation framework. Starting from a synthetic representation of process variations introduced in a previous work, we identify the cases of poor noise immunity that require thorough noise analyses. Relying on a rigorous and systematic methodology, we simulate them in the time domain so as to emulate a true data retention operation. Short times to failure, unacceptable for a practical ultra-low-power memory system application, are recorded. The transient bit-flip mechanism is analyzed and a dynamic failure criterion involving the unstable steady state is established. We conclude that, beyond static variability, the dynamic noise inflates defectiveness among SRAM bitcells. Then, a stochastic nonlinear model, fully characterizable from conventional deterministic SPICE simulations, is presented. We then leverage it to efficiently and accurately predict the mean time to failure with an analytical Eyring-Kramers formula, recently extended to account for the varying-noise behavior of nonlinear systems.</description></item><item><title>Compact Reconfigurable Dual-Band MMIC SPDT/SP4T Switches With On-Chip Coupled-Line Structure in GaN-on-SiC HEMT Technology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10767850</link><description>This paper presents the design and analysis of dual-band monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) switches, including a single pole double throw (SPDT) and a single pole four throw (SP4T). With a novel on-chip coupled-line (OCL) topology, the input signal can be switched into low- or high-band paths to create dual-band characteristics. By carefully selecting the electrical lengths of OCLs and device size for corresponding shunt-FETs, the operating frequencies for low- and high-bands can be determined. This brings about improved insertion loss (IL) and isolation (ISO) in a compact structure. With the proposed techniques, two switch prototypes have been designed and fabricated in a 0.25- $\mu $ m GaN-on-SiC process for high-power capability. The SPDT consists of a low-band path and a high-band path. It achieves an average IL/ISO of 1.0/32 dB with the best input 1-dB compression points (IP1dB) of 37.2 dBm at a low-band of DC-15 GHz; and an average IL/ISO of 2.0/28.5 dB with the best IP1dB of 32.8 dBm at a high-band of 20-40 GHz, respectively. The return loss is better than 11 dB for each port. The SP4T achieves a fully integrated dual-band transmit/receive (T/R) switch with doubled low-/high-band paths.

Unfortunately, the inherent quantization behavior and integral nonlinearity associated with the DTC mean that the aforementioned QE cannot be canceled exactly; inevitably, the residual error gives rise to additional PN and spurious tonal phenomena. This tutorial paper uses DTC macromodels to analyze and distinguish the DTC&#8217;s sources of nonideality and the distinct adverse spectral responses induced by them. Different DTC enhancement techniques are shown to mitigate certain types of nonideality. A comprehensive design strategy incorporating these techniques is proposed, which mitigates the revealed excess PN and spurs introduced by the DTC&#8217;s nonidealities. The enhanced DTC enables the fractional-N DPLL to approach the fractional-spur-free integer-N PN performance limit. Behavioral simulations at both DTC-block and PLL-system levels confirm our analysis.</description></item><item><title>A High-Frequency CMOS Meminductor Emulator for Spiking Neuron</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10681228</link><description>This research introduces a high-frequency CMOS meminductor, utilizing operational transconductance amplifiers and two grounded capacitors, thereby avoiding traditional components such as memristors, multipliers, and resistors.

The overall signal chain consists of a capacitively-coupled instrumentation amplifier (CCIA) and a 16-bit delta-sigma ( $\Delta $  $\Sigma $ ) ADC. The ADC is directly driven by the CCIA without a traditional driver stage. The folded path of the first stage in CCIA is sliced for reconfigurable noise levels. In addition, a single-stage floating inverter amplifier (FIA) assisted by the correlated-level-shifting (CLS) technique is employed in the switched-capacitor (SC)  $\Delta $  $\Sigma $  modulator for fully dynamic operation with sufficient DC gain. Fabricated in 180-nm CMOS, the CCIA achieves an input-referred noise level ranging from 35.8 to 67 nV/ $\surd $ Hz with a best noise-efficiency factor (NEF) of 5.54. It corresponds to an integrated noise ranging from 0.63 to 1.16  $\mu $  $\text {V}_{\text {rms}}$  (0.5-100 Hz) and 1.93 to 3.51  $\mu $  $\text {V}_{\text {rms}}$  (0.1-3 kHz), respectively. The ADC achieves a peak SNDR of 92.6 dB for a 2.3- $\text {V}_{\text {pp}}$  differential input and can support 16 $\times $  power/BW reconfigurability with ENOB&gt;15 bit. The complete system occupies an active area of 0.56 mm2 and achieves 85.7-dB system SNDR over a 500 Hz BW with an OSR of 128.

To achieve this, event-driven SoCs that exploit the time-sparse nature of biosignals such as the electrocardiogram (ECG) have been proposed; they only process the signal when it shows activity. Such SoCs convert time-sparse biosignals into spike trains, on which spiking neural networks (SNNs) can perform event-driven signal classification. State-of-the-art event-driven SoCs, however, still suffer from poor area and power efficiency and use inflexible, hard-coded spike-encoding schemes. To improve on these challenges, this paper presents FREYA, an 8-channel event-driven SoC for end-to-end sensing of time-sparse biosignals. The proposed SoC consists of the following key contributions: 1) an 8-channel time-division-multiplexed level-crossing sampling (LCS) analog-to-spike converter (ASC) that encodes analog input signals into input spikes for an on-chip SNN; 2) an ASC spike-encoding algorithm that is fully programmable in resolution (4 to 8 bits) and conversion algorithm (offset and decay parameters); 3) an on-chip integrated, flexible SNN processor based on a programmable crossbar architecture, that allows for efficient event-driven processing, and that can be reconfigured towards multiple sensing applications; 4) a custom offline end-to-end training framework for the fast retraining of the spike-encoding algorithm and SNN architecture towards new applications or patient-dependent signal variations. A prototype IC has been fabricated in a 40nm CMOS technology. It has a per-channel active area of 0.023 mm2 (0.184 mm2 in total), a  $7\times $  improvement over the state of the art. For the use case of ECG-based QRS-labeling, a detection accuracy of 98.67% is achieved, while the system consumes  $20.8~\mu $ W per channel and achieves a latency of only 80 ms, thus paving the way for multi-channel, high-fidelity, event-driven SoCs in biomedical applications.</description></item><item><title>An 840-to-970 MHz Multimodal Wake-Up Receiver With a Q-Equalized Antenna-ED Interface and 2-Dimensional Wake-Up Identification</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10695452</link><description>The article introduces an antenna-envelope detector (ED) co-designed wake-up receiver (WuRX) that can automatically detect the frequency-hopping sequence from 840 to 970 MHz. Prototyped in 65nm CMOS, the WuRX supports three modes: 1) low-power mode that achieves &#8722;68 dBm sensitivity with 9.9nW power consumption, 2) Q-enhanced mode that provides 22 dB rejection to an on-off-keying (OOK) modulated pseudo-random-bit-sequence blocker at 10 MHz offset and 41 dB rejection to a continuous-wave one at 10 MHz offset, with a power consumption of  $39.6~\mu $ W and 3) 2-stage wake-up mode that combines the advantages of both the low-power mode and Q-enhanced mode, with a power consumption of 33.7 nW. These characteristics are achieved by exploiting 1) an antenna-ED interface where the Q-factor of the antenna is equal to the Q-factor of the capacitor to ensure a conjugate matching condition for the maximum available power transfer from the antenna to the ED, 2) a frequency tuner connected to the antenna-ED interface calibrated by a frequency-locked loop, and 3) a Q-booster reconfigured from the frequency tuner for boosting the passive gain and narrowing the bandwidth of the interface.</description></item><item><title>IIP2-Calibration-Free 5G NR Cellular Receiver Front-End With Mixer-Sharing Global N-Path Notch Filter Feedback Achieving +72 dBm IIP2</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10689721</link><description>In this article, a new input-referred second-order intercept point (IIP2)-calibration-free receiver (RX) front-end employing mixer-sharing N-path notch filter feedback is proposed for 5G new radio (NR) cellular applications. An RX front-end architecture with a high-Q N-path RF filtering low-noise amplifier (LNA) enhances the overall IIP2 performance of the RX via the blocker filtering. However, the local oscillator (LO) chain burden increases with the number of switches in the N-path filter. The main down-conversion mixers are reused as part of switches for the N-path notch filter, reducing the LO chain burden and current consumption. The RX front-end comprises a balun-LNA, main down-conversion passive mixers driven by 25% duty-cycle LO signals, isolation resistors, and transimpedance amplifiers. Additional high-pass filters, up-conversion mixers, and reused down-conversion mixers form the global N-path notch filter feedback. Fabricated using a 65 nm CMOS process, the RX front-end was primarily characterized for the mid band of 5G NR sub-6 GHz cellular applications. It achieved a noise figure of 3.67 dB, a conversion gain of 44.7 dB, and an out-of-band input-referred third-order intercept point of 15.35 dBm. Additionally, an IIP2 of &gt;72 dBm was obtained without calibration. The RX front-end drew a 13.83 mA bias current from a 1 V nominal supply voltage, with a 0.45 mm2 active die area.</description></item><item><title>A 0.0375-pJ/bit Charge-Steering Based Hybrid for 8-Gb/s/pin Full-Duplex Chip-to-Chip Interconnects in 65-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10707596</link><description>This paper presents an energy-efficient, half-rate charge-steering logic (HR-CSL) based echo cancellation hybrid (ECH) circuit topology for full-duplex(FD) signaling across chip-to-chip interconnects. The proposed charge-steering logic (CSL) based hybrid has much lower power consumption compared to conventional current-mode logic (CML) and voltage-mode logic (VML) based hybrid implementations, thanks to the discrete nature of CSL hybrid topology avoiding direct current path between  $V_{DD}$  and ground.

The measurement results show that the proposed hybrid circuit has a differential received signal voltage swing of 110 mV at 8 Gb/s data rate with a timing jitter of 20 ps. The proposed hybrid has a clock phase margin of 25% UI at bit-error-rate (BER) less than  $10^{-12}$ . The active area of the hybrid is 0.0007 mm2.</description></item><item><title>Phase Modulated Bistatic Radar With an Analog Correlator: A Systematic Study</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854689</link><description>This work presents a phase-modulated radar based on an analog correlator.

The rectifying efficiency can be boosted by the hybrid power source excitation, thereby increasing DC output power compared to standalone power source. A fan-shaped omnidirectional antenna and a hybrid single shunt-diode rectifier are designed to realize energy receiving and rectifying, respectively. A prototype is implemented and measured. The receiving part can achieve 2.29-dBi peak gain and 0.92-dB non-roundness at 1.85 GHz. It can also work smoothly when the wind speed varies from 0 to 12 m/s. The RF-DC conversion efficiency at -20 dBm and AC-DC output voltage at 12 m/s are measured as 20% and 79 mV, respectively. When both RF and wind power sources are accessible, the hybrid DC output power of 1.0 uW can be obtained with -30-dBm RF power and 10m/s wind speed. Moreover, the output power at hybrid rectifying mode is higher than that of simply superimposed RF and wind energy. Efficiency gain of up to 182% can be achieved.

Carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CN-MOSFETs) with high scalability, energy-efficiency, and low process thermal budget are attractive to realize high-dense monolithic three-dimensional (M3D) SRAM-CIM. However, CN-MOSFETs possess unique process variations with asymmetric spatial correlations which can significantly influence the performance and reliability of carbon-based SRAM-CIM. In this paper, new M3D-4N4P SRAM-CIM cells with CN-MOSFETs are proposed with optimized profiles for achieving ultra-high integration density while preserving robustness of data-access and computation. Furthermore, the variation-aware bit-wise data-mapping method is proposed for enhancing the performance of carbon-based SRAM-CIM by leveraging the spatial correlations of CN-MOSFETs. By minimizing the area skew of vertically-stacked layers, the areas of proposed M3D-4N4P SRAM-CIM cells are reduced by up to 50.32% compared to the previous 6N2P SRAM-CIM cells assuming carbon nanotube transistor technology. The proposed M3D-4N4P SRAM-CIM array also achieves by up to  $2.17\times $  higher throughput on arithmetic operations and 18.34% lower computing latency with 25.36% reduced energy consumptions on MAC-based benchmarks, respectively, compared to the previous 2D-6N2P SRAM-CIM array.</description></item><item><title>A 2.793 &#956;W Near-Threshold Neuronal Population Dynamics Trajectory Filter for Reliable Simultaneous Localization and Mapping</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10767866</link><description>This work presents an algorithm hardware co-design implementing a digital neuronal population dynamics simulator intended for the trajectory error correction task within a simultaneous localization and mapping workflow.

Transformer-based IR methods have significantly improved the visual effects of the restored images. However, deploying complex IR models on edge devices is challenging due to massive parameters and intensive computations. Moreover, existing accelerators are typically customized for a single task, resulting in severe resource underutilization when executing multiple tasks. Therefore, this paper develops an algorithm-hardware co-design framework to accelerate a novel CNN-Transformer cooperative model for multiple IR tasks. Firstly, on the algorithm level, an Efficient Restoration Foundational Model (ERFM) is proposed to recover corrupted images from various degradations with low model complexity. Secondly, to guide adaptive corruption removal, a novel prompt learning scheme is introduced to fuse context-related degradation cues and boost high-quality reconstruction. Thirdly, on the hardware level, an integer approximation method is proposed to avoid expensive hardware overhead caused by complex nonlinear operations, such as layer normalization and softmax while maintaining comparable IR quality. Moreover, a head stationary dataflow and softmax fusion mechanism are designed to reduce data movement and enhance on-chip resource utilization. Finally, an overall hardware architecture is developed and implemented in TSMC 28 nm CMOS technology. Experimental results show that our ERFM achieves better visual perception than other baselines on seven challenging IR tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. Moreover, compared to other accelerators for vision Transformers, our design can achieve  $3.3\times $  and  $3.7\times $  improvements in throughput and energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>HAST: A Hardware-Efficient Spatio-Temporal Correlation Near-Sensor Noise Filter for Dynamic Vision Sensors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10812040</link><description>The Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) is a bio-inspired image sensor which has many advantages such as high dynamic range, high bandwidth, high temporal resolution and low power consumption for Internet of Video Things and Edge Computing applications. However, spuriously generated Background Activity (BA) noise events can significantly degrade the quality of DVS output and cause unnecessary computations throughout the image processing chain, reducing its energy efficiency. Near-sensor filters can mitigate this problem by preventing the BA noise events from reaching downstream stages. In this paper, we propose a novel, hardware-efficient, spatio-temporal correlation filter (HAST) for near-sensor BA noise filtering. It uses compact two-dimensional binary arrays along with simple, arithmetic-free hash-based functions for storage and retrieval operations. This approach eliminates the need to use timestamps for determining the chronological order of events. HAST uses much lower memory and energy compared to other hardware-friendly filters (BAF/STCF) while matching their performance in simulations with standard datasets; for a sensor of resolution  $346\times 260$  pixels, it requires only 5&#8211;18% of their memory, and about 15% of their energy per event for correlation time  $\tau $  ranging from 1 to 50 ms. The memory and energy gains of the filter increase with sensor resolution. In FPGA implementation, HAST achieves about 29% higher throughput than BAF/STCF while utilizing only about 5% of their memory. The filter parameter values can be chosen by Design Space Exploration (DSE) for optimized performance-resource trade-offs based on application requirements.</description></item><item><title>A Graph-Based Accelerator of Retinex Model With Bit-Serial Computing for Image Enhancements</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10857689</link><description>This work proposes the Poisson equation formulation of the Retinex model for image enhancements using a low-power graph hardware accelerator performing finite difference updates on a lattice graph processing element (PE) array. By encapsulating the underlying algorithm in a graph hardware structure, a highly localized dataflow that takes advantage of the physical placement of the PEs is enabled to minimize data movement and maximize data reuse. The on-chip dataflow that achieves data sharing, and reuse among neighboring PEs during massively parallel updates is generated in each PE driven by two external control signals. Using a custom accumulator design intended for bit-serial computing, this work enables precision on demand and extensive on-chip data reuse with minimal area overhead, accommodating a non-overlap image mapping scheme in which a  $20\times 20$  image tile can be processed without external memory access at a time.

At this stage, it is difficult for a single silicon-based chip to reach the density of the human brain, so it is important to improve the area efficiency of neuromorphic chips. We present a novel neuromorphic hardware that employs high area-efficiency chain RRAM synaptic array, and compact RRAM-based neurons. The proposed chain RRAM structure achieves a small cell size of 41.5F2 at 28 nm logic process. Compared to the conventional 1T1R structure, the chain structure has a 22.2% area reduction and a 58.8% parasitic capacitance reduction.

However, this method consumes a significant amount of energy, and the power consumption increases under higher currents, limiting its applicability. To address this vital problem, a wide-range self-powered current measurement method is proposed in this work. The dual-core structure-based self-powered current measurement system integrates a magnetic field energy harvester (MFEH) and a current measurer (CM). In this system, the windings of the MFEH and the CM are connected in series, and the induced current of the MFEH is multiplexed. On one hand, it flows through the load for energy harvesting. Simultaneously, it flows into the CM, reducing the magnetic field within the air gap, and thereby broadening the range of current measurements. Besides, the equivalent circuit model of the dual-core structure is established to analyze the principles of current measurement and energy harvesting. Subsequently, a voltage regulation circuit based on an active rectifier is implemented, which can mitigate the saturation of the magnetic core over a wide current range. A laboratory prototype is built to verify the effectiveness of the proposal. The results show that the output voltage can be maintained at 3.3 V, ensuring stable voltage output. At 300 Arms, the maximum harvesting power reaches 1.83 W. Additionally, the upper limit of the measured current can reach 600 Arms, with a maximum error of 0.54%.</description></item><item><title>On the Effect of Memory Error in a Time-Interleaved Pipeline ADC With a Shared Residue Amplifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10833849</link><description>Compared to traditional time-interleaved (TI) pipeline ADC, shared residue amplifier (RA) architecture is potentially more power efficient and requires simpler calibration. However, the shared RA architecture suffers from memory error, which severely degrades its linearity. Typically, a reset phase is needed at the RA&#8217;s input to avoid this memory error. The reset phase is particularly problematic for high-speed ADCs as it shortens the amplification time, leading to higher power consumption in the RA.

Based on the analysis, the saved power consumption from the XO buffer can be utilized to improve the PN of the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), which compensates for the in-band PN degradation induced by the  $C_{\mathrm { S}}$  reduction. Based on this theme, we can reduce the total power consumption of the RS-PLL and the XO buffer without degrading the output root-mean-square (RMS) jitter by reducing  $C_{\mathrm { S}}$  if a VCO with a high figure-of-merit (FoM) and a low  $1/{f}^{3}$  PN corner frequency is available.

The proposed curvature correction is advantageous, since it is insensitive to process variations and reduces chip area, when compared to existing solutions. Additionally, the differential amplifiers are no longer needed in the proposed circuit, and thus it no longer has the problems of offset voltage and increased energy consumption. Besides, a compact output driver is incorporated to accommodate large load currents while ensuring a good load regulation. Additionally, an over-temperature shutdown scheme is realized to save energy at elevated temperatures. This brief is designed with a 180 nm BCD process. It realizes a temperature coefficient (TC) of smaller than 3 ppm/&#176;C (typical) across a temperature range of  $- 40\sim 85~^{\circ }$ C and at a supply voltage of 7 V. Meanwhile, a 2.2 ppm/mA load regulation is obtained for load currents varying from 0 to 100 mA at a supply voltage of 11 V. A &#8722;98.3 dB power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) is also achieved at 1 Hz. When compared with other works, the highlight of this brief is a compact output driver, an over-temperature shutdown scheme, 2 times larger range of supply voltage of 5 to 11 V, and a good TC  $\leq 3$  ppm/&#176;C (typical).</description></item><item><title>A 0.2-3 GHz Inductor-Less LNA Using Noise-Canceling and Dual-Resistor Feedback Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10847882</link><description>In this brief, an inductor-less low-noise amplifier (LNA) that utilizes a noise-canceling technique along with dual-resistor feedback is proposed. The conventional single-resistor feedback structure exhibits a performance constraint that limits the relationship between power gain and input matching. In contrast, the dual-resistor feedback structure proposed in this brief overcomes this limitation, enabling both high gain and low noise while maintaining good input matching. The dual-resistor feedback configuration includes a local feedback resistor which enhances the gain. Additionally, the global feedback resistor directly connect the inputs and outputs of the circuit, thereby breaking the constraints between the properties through feedback. The proposed LNA fabricated in 65-nm CMOS technology exhibiting a minimal NF of 2.08 dB within a 3-dB bandwidth that spans from 0.25 to 2.83 GHz, along with a peak power gain of 16.53 dB.

It has a dual-loop structure for frequency and phase locking while using a VCO based on a ring oscillator to support a wide operating range. The VCO calibration circuitry ensures that the VCO&#8217;s gain, kVCO, is set within a consistent range over a wide data rate by adaptively setting the operating frequency range of the VCO based on the frequency of the incoming training pattern. The proposed CDR is implemented by using a 40-nm CMOS process with a voltage supply of 1.2 V. It occupies the area of 0.08mm2 while having power efficiency of 2.5 pJ/bit. The proposed CDR improved the peak-to-peak time jitter of the recovered clock from 51.1ps to 31.25ps at the data rate of 8.1 Gbps by using the VCO calibration circuit. The proposed VCO calibration for the CDR also reduced the distribution of the peak-to-peak time jitter of the recovered clocks between the evaluated chips by 44%.</description></item><item><title>Constraint-Aware Annealing for CMOS-Based Ising Machine LDPC Decoder</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10849655</link><description>Ising machines are efficient hardware solvers for combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). In CMOS-based Ising machines, the annealing process is crucial for efficiently navigating complex energy landscapes in mapped COPs such as Max-Cut and low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoding. QuBRIM, a CMOS-based Ising machine, has recently been utilized to solve LDPC decoding problems using multi-body interactions.

However, the side-channel attacks (SCAs) on its implementation are still needed to be well considered for the upcoming migration. In this brief, we propose a secure and efficient hardware implementation for Kyber by incorporating a novel compact shuffling architecture. First of all, we modify the Fisher-Yates shuffle to make it more hardware-friendly. We then design an optimized shuffling architecture for the well-known open-source Kyber hardware implementation to enhance the security of all known and potential side-channel leakage points. Finally, we implement the modified Kyber design on FPGA and evaluate its security and performance. The security is verified by conducting correlation power analysis (CPA) and test vector leakage assessment (TVLA) on the hardware. Meanwhile, FPGA place-and-route results show that the proposed design reports only 8.7% degradation on the hardware efficiency compared with the original unprotected version, much better than existing hardware hiding schemes.</description></item><item><title>An Edge Neuromorphic Processor With High-Accuracy On-Chip Aggregate-Label Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10841405</link><description>Neuromorphic computing with bio-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) offers an energy-efficient paradigm for edge intelligence. But, achieving practically high on-chip SNN learning accuracy with limited hardware resources still remains challenging. To tackle this issue, this brief proposes an edge neuromorphic processor architecture enabling computationally-simple optimized aggregate-label (AL) algorithm to realize high-accuracy on-chip learning. To maximize utilization of multicore resources and minimize processing latency, our processor adopts techniques including uniform neuron-core mapping, layer-alternating workflow, time-step pipeline and event-driven scheme.

In view of time-varying transition probability, a nonhomogeneous semi-Markov chain is introduced to accurately model transient faults of power lines and dynamic switching of circuit breakers. Due to the random nature of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, Bernoulli process is adopted to characterize the attacks behavior. Based on the semi-Markov kernel and Lyapunov function depending on the current system mode and dwell time, sufficient conditions for the existence of the controller are derived to ensure the mean-square stability of the closed-loop system. Finally, the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed control strategy are verified by a numerical case.</description></item><item><title>Matching Critical Analog Circuit Components Up To Third-Order Gradients for All Possible Exact Matching Ratios</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10644102</link><description>This article presents a systematic approach to generate layouts for two devices, with an arbitrary integer ratio of device sizes, that cancels up to at least third-order gradient effects. A new analysis leads to mathematical constraints on 1-D layouts that meet the required integer ratio and cancel second-order gradients. From those layouts, we apply reflection and rotation symmetries to generate 2-D layouts that cancel higher-order gradients. We demonstrate our proposed methodology on current sense transistors interspersed in active power transistors. Legato electrothermal simulation show our proposed approach, respectively, improves worst-case matching accuracy about a factor of 9.9 and 7.15 when compared to a common centroid (CC) and interdigitated (ID) pattern in the presence of gradients effects. Furthermore, we discuss evaluation metrics that can be used to select one of multiple gradient canceling layouts for any fixed rectangular grid and device application.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Analog IC Security Using Randomized Obfuscation Circuits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10689372</link><description>With advances in technology scaling and globalization of the semiconductor industry, the vulnerability of analog integrated circuits (ICs) to reverse-engineering-based attacks, intellectual property theft, and unauthorized access has increased. Prior state-of-the-art analog deobfuscation techniques, such as those using genetic algorithms (GAs) and the satisfiability modulo theory, require an Oracle (i.e., unlocked IC) to recover the correct key. However, in some scenarios, an attacker present in an untrusted foundry might not have access to the Oracle. We demonstrate an Oracle-less attack using Bayesian optimization (BO) to retrieve the key of locked analog designs. To thwart both Oracle-guided and Oracle-less attacks, we present an automated obfuscation circuit generation framework for securing analog ICs. By employing randomness in obfuscation circuit generation, the proposed analog key-based methodology safeguards the integrity and reliability of analog ICs. Experimental results and security analysis for several analog designs demonstrate the robustness of the proposed technique to optimization attacks based on a GA and BO. We further show that the probability of guessing the correct key through brute force attack for an obfuscated analog circuit is negligibly small  $(4.83\times 10^{-18})$ . The proposed obfuscation scheme incurs an area overhead of less than 1.3% and power overhead of less than 2.64% for a mixed-signal IC.</description></item><item><title>Sobol Sequence Optimization for Hardware-Efficient Vector Symbolic Architectures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10683781</link><description>Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) is an emerging computing paradigm with significant promise for efficient and robust learning. In HDC, objects are encoded with high-dimensional vector symbolic sequences called hypervectors. The quality of hypervectors, defined by their distribution and independence, directly impacts the performance of HDC systems. Despite a large body of work on the processing parts of HDC systems, little to no attention has been paid to data encoding and the quality of hypervectors. Most prior studies have generated hypervectors using inherent random functions, such as MATLAB&#8217;s or Python&#8217;s random function. This work introduces an optimization technique for generating hypervectors by employing quasi-random sequences. These sequences have recently demonstrated their effectiveness in achieving accurate and low-discrepancy data encoding in stochastic computing systems. The study outlines the optimization steps for utilizing Sobol sequences to produce high-quality hypervectors in HDC systems. An optimization algorithm is proposed to select the most suitable Sobol sequences via indexes for generating minimally correlated hypervectors, particularly in applications related to symbol-oriented architectures. The performance of the proposed technique is evaluated in comparison to two traditional approaches of generating hypervectors based on linear-feedback shift registers and MATLAB random functions. The evaluation is conducted for three applications: 1) language; 2) headline; and 3) medical image classification. Our experimental results demonstrate accuracy improvements of up to 10.79%, depending on the vector size. Additionally, the proposed encoding hardware exhibits reduced energy consumption and a superior area-delay product.</description></item><item><title>Algorithmically Enhanced Design of Spintronic-Based Tunable True Random Number Generator for Dependable Stochastic Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10640136</link><description>This article proposes a tunable true random number generator (TTRNG) based on stochastic magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) switching in the subcritical current regime. The proposed design consists of three parts. The first part is a write/read circuit featuring a static write circuit and an energy-efficient circuit optimized for read operations. The second finds the probability generation array (PGA) similar to the longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. However, the algorithms presented so far for the LCS have not been responsive to finding the Desired-PGA as it must look for the common subsequence among one million sequences, each sequence being 259 long. Hence, the convergence of those algorithms is impossible in this problem. Accordingly, we propose an algorithm to find a common subsequence of length 24, each defining a logic function. We also propose a controller to generate arbitrary probabilities with a zero steady-state error. These parts, especially PGA, make the design highly robust to the process variations. Notably, the proposed design passes the National Institute of Standards and Technology test. The proposed design also reduces energy dissipation compared to previous designs. Also, as it does not require precise sizing, the FinFET technology is appropriately used to design the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Buffer and Splitter Insertion for Adiabatic Quantum-Flux-Parametron Circuits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10684033</link><description>The extremely low-bit energy characteristic of the adiabatic quantum-flux-parametron (AQFP) circuit makes it a promising candidate for highly energy-efficient computing systems. However, in contrast with conventional circuit design, general logic synthesis tools can not make sure that the circuit functionality of generated AQFP circuits is correct. AQFP circuits require buffer and splitter insertion for dataflow synchronization at all clock phases of the circuit and multifan-out driving. Notably, buffers and splitters inserted take up much area and delay in AQFP circuits, also causing a significant increase in energy dissipation. To address this problem, this article analyses in detail why buffer and splitter insertion is necessary for AQFP circuits and proposes a global optimization framework for this purpose. This framework consists of three parts: 1) logic level assignment; 2) splitter tree generation; and 3) buffer insertion. An integer linear programming algorithm is proposed for the logic level assignment to estimate the globally optimal number of inserted buffers and splitters. Subsequently, a dynamic programming-based multiway search tree generation algorithm is proposed to construct an optimal splitter tree for each net of the input circuit. Moreover, three optimization strategies are proposed to further enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework. Experimental results on ISCAS&#8217;85 and EPFL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework compared with the state-of-the-art, particularly with significant advantages on large circuits.</description></item><item><title>Optimizing Data Reuse for Loop Mapping on CGRAs With Joint Affine and Nonaffine Transformations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10659174</link><description>Coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs) can provide high energy efficiency while maintaining flexibility, which is promising to keep pace with the power requirements and the frequent updates of applicants. With flexible register chains, modern CGRAs enable data reuse within the processing element array (PEA) to reduce on-chip memory accesses and improve pipelining performance. However, existing works pay little attention to comprehensive loop transformations, such as affine and nonaffine transformation, to obtain a data reuse-friendly loop structure. Therefore, this article proposes a data-reuse-friendly loop mapping approach using joint affine and nonaffine transformations. With affine transformations, the distance of loop dependencies could be reduced and then handled by in-PEA routes. With nonaffine transformations (i.e., loop unrolling), small loop kernels could be unrolled and expose more memory accesses for data reuse. To efficiently solve the loop transformation problem, we first establish a reduced polyhedral formulation and then propose a divide-and-conquer-based solution to find optimized transformations with moderate compilation time. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve a speedup up to  $1.74\times $  compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Automatic Design of IGBT Structural Parameters Using Differential Evolution and Machine Learning Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693555</link><description>Insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) are the key component in power electronics, and the intricate relationship between their performance and structural parameters poses a formidable challenge in the design process. This article proposes an automatic optimal design method for IGBT structural parameters to leverage the pretrained machine learning (ML) model to efficiently predict the initial IGBT device&#8217;s performance, followed by utilizing the differential evolution (DE) algorithm to automatically adjust structural parameters based on the disparity between predicted and expected device performance until the expected performance is achieved. The method is validated in the design of punch-through IGBTs (PT-IGBTs) and trench gate field-stop IGBTs (FS-IGBTs), and the performance of technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulation of the designed device is similar to the target performance. In particular, the simulation results of the designed FS-IGBT are highly fitted to the datasheet of the commercial device, which verifies the generalizability and effectiveness of the method. In addition, comparative analyses with various algorithms show DE provides the fastest optimization and extraordinary robustness under the exact specifications. Crucially, the proposed design scheme aligns with semiconductor physics. The method simplifies IGBT design without the need for manual tuning and TCAD tool simulation.</description></item><item><title>Graceful Register Clustering and Rebanking for Power and Timing Balancing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643595</link><description>As dynamic power has become the bottleneck to achieving low power, clock power reduction is crucial in modern IC design. Register clustering can effectively save clock power because of significantly reducing the number of clock sinks and register pin capacitance, clock routed wirelength, and the number of clock buffers. In this article, we propose effective mean shift to naturally form clusters according to register distribution without placement disruption. Effective mean shift fulfills the requirements to be a good register clustering algorithm because it needs no prespecified number of clusters, is insensitive to initializations, is robust to outliers, is tolerant of various register distributions, is efficient and scalable, and balances clock power reduction against timing degradation. Furthermore, we devise a rebanking mechanism to legalize the clustering result according to the adopted multibit register library. Experimental results show that our approach achieves superior power and timing balancing.</description></item><item><title>Design and Utilization of Multiskewed Multibit Flip-Flop Cells for Timing Optimization: Design and Technology Co-Optimization Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10677402</link><description>Utilizing multibit flip-flops (MBFFs) in circuit implementation offers a considerable saving on the dynamic power dissipated at the clock networks. However, indiscreetly allocating MBFFs by grouping single-bit flip-flops at the logic synthesis or placement stage in order to greedily save dynamic power severely hinders a full applicability of useful clock skew scheduling to the individual flip-flops in MBFFs, failing in effectively optimizing circuit timing. This is because the two internal clock inverters, consequently, the clock skew value, in an MBFF are shared by all of the flip-flops in the MBFF. This work overcomes this inherent limitation of inflexibility in MBFFs for useful clock skew scheduling by proposing a comprehensive design and technology co-optimization (DTCO) framework. To this end, we devise a new layout of MBFF cells called multiskewed MBFF layout, in which different clock skew values can be set to the individual internal flip-flops at the cost of additional internal clock inverters. With the multiskewed MBFFs, we propose a three-step DTCO flow: 1) DTCO-based flip-flop clustering at the logic stage, which clusters flip-flops considering multiskewed MBFFs; 2) DTCO based on in-place MBFF debanking technique at the preroute stage to facilitate the full applicability of useful skew scheduling at the subsequent stages; and 3) DTCO utilizing MBFF cell layout diversification at the post-route stage, by which useful clock skew scheduling can effectively resolve timing violations. Through experiments with OpenCores benchmark circuits, it is shown that our proposed DTCO flow of reinforcing the effectiveness of useful clock skew scheduling on circuits with MBFF instances is able to reduce the worst and total negative slacks by 36.73% and 50.76%, respectively, while decreasing the clock and total power consumption by 43.46% and 22.70% over that produced by the conventional flow using a state-of-the-art commercial tool.</description></item><item><title>LithoHoD: A Litho Simulator-Powered Framework for IC Layout Hotspot Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10683791</link><description>Recent advances in VLSI fabrication technology have led to die shrinkage and increased layout density, creating an urgent demand for advanced hotspot detection techniques. However, by taking an object detection network as the backbone, recent learning-based hotspot detectors learn to recognize only the problematic layout patterns in the training data. This fact makes these hotspot detectors difficult to generalize to real-world scenarios. We propose a novel lithography simulator-powered hotspot detection framework to overcome this difficulty. Our framework integrates a lithography simulator with an object detection backbone, merging the extracted latent features from both the simulator and the object detector via well-designed cross-attention blocks. Consequently, the proposed framework can be used to detect potential hotspot regions based on 1) the variation of possible circuit shape deformation estimated by the lithography simulator and 2) the problematic layout patterns already known. To this end, we utilize RetinaNet with a feature pyramid network as the object detection backbone and leverage LithoNet as the lithography simulator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed simulator-guided hotspot detection framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods on real-world data.</description></item><item><title>Prior-Boosted GRL: Microarchitecture Design Space Exploration via Graph Representation Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10673996</link><description>The design space exploration (DSE) of contemporary microprocessors faces a significant challenge of high-computational cost. In this context, we introduce Prior-boosted graph representation learning (GRL), a novel framework for the DSE of the microarchitectures the microprocessors underpinned by graph embeddings. Using GRL, Prior-boosted GRL constructs a compact and continuous vector space for design representation. This framework is further boosted by an efficient sampling algorithm informed by prior knowledge, which is instrumental in generating a superior set of initial designs to accelerate the exploration process. A well-designed ensemble surrogate model is combined with the multiobjective Bayesian optimization to explore the design space holistically within this graph-embedding domain. Rigorous experimental evaluations conducted on the RISC-V Berkeley-Out-of-Order Machine (BOOM) platform demonstrate that Prior-boosted GRL substantially surpasses preceding methods, achieving a 107.79% enhancement in Pareto front quality compared to the state-of-the-art DSE algorithm. It also outstrips manual designs on performance, power, and area metrics. As of this writing, Prior-boosted GRL holds the first place in the ICCAD 2022 CAD Contest evaluation platform.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Low-Power BIST for Automotive SoC With Periodic Pattern Type Selection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10677544</link><description>In the realm of automotive System-on-Chip (SoC), scan-based logic built-in self-test (LBIST) is commonly utilized for in-system testing, primarily for its cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, this approach encounters challenges, particularly in attaining high-test coverage within constrained test times. The challenge intensifies when implementing low-power patterns, as it further complicates the achievement of adequate test coverage. To overcome these hurdles, this article introduces a novel testing methodology that enhances test coverage using low-toggled patterns. This method consists of two primary phases. Initially, it involves grouping and pairing scan cells (SCs), ensuring adjacent placement of paired cells. The following phase involves the generation of low-toggled patterns, tailored to the specific arrangement of SCs. To optimally detect as many previously undetected faults as possible, this method applies the low-power pattern selectively to particular scan groups. Furthermore, the scan group subjected to low-power patterns alternates after a certain number of patterns. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of this proposed method in both fault detection and power reduction, in comparison to earlier methods.</description></item><item><title>Fast Machine-Learning-Driven Supply Noise-Aware Macromodeling for High-Speed Nonlinear Drivers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10666877</link><description>Emerging domains, such as artificial intelligence, 5G mobile, and automotive, are increasingly reliant on high-speed circuits for efficient processing, in which achieving high operating frequencies and data rates is crucial to enable productive data exchange and rapid responses. High-speed data as well as low noise margin in the high-speed serial links call for efficient models of drivers. In this article, we propose a fast machine-learning-driven macromodel for high-speed drivers, which can efficiently capture the nonlinear characteristics of drivers considering dynamic supply noise with low model complexity. A decoupling-superposition strategy is employed to effectively calculate the impact of power supply noise. Additionally, we introduce a piecewise-segmented method for macromodel solving to further enhance the speed of model utilization. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to HSPICE, the proposed macromodel achieves up to  $50\times $ &#8211; $1200\times $  speedup while maintaining sufficient accuracy, even for signals with GHz data rate.</description></item></channel></rss>
