However, the traditional thermal network model is difficult to predict the temperature information of power devices at multitimescale accurately. This article proposes a multitimescale thermal network model for power devices, with metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect-transistor (mosfet) as an example. First, we establish a finite-element model for temperature calculation of power devices and then reduce the order of the finite-element model based on the proper orthogonal decomposition algorithm. The reduced-order model is converted into an equivalent circuit model by the node voltage method and integrated into the circuit simulation software. To demonstrate its general applicability, this article also establishes thermal network models for both insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) and SiC mosfet devices, and validates the multitimescale thermal network models through ANSYS/transient thermal software and experiments. The temperature calculation results of the three power devices all indicate that the proposed multitimescale thermal network model can calculate the temperature of power devices faster than the ANSYS/transient thermal model and has less than 5% error under test conditions. This article is accompanied by a video demonstrating a comparison of the computational speed of the multitimescale thermal network model with a finite-element model. Finally, a case study of junction temperature calculation in a buck converter is presented to illustrate the application method of the thermal network model.</description></item><item><title>Fault-Tolerant Multiparallel Three-Phase Two-Level Converters With Adaptive Hardware Reconfiguration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10381814</link><description>This letter proposes a fault-tolerant multiparallel converter with adaptive hardware reconfiguration. The proposed topology maximizes open-switches&#8217; fault tolerance with minimal hardware redundancy, efficiently covering a broad spectrum of potential fault scenarios. Another pivotal feature of the proposed topology is its adaptive hardware reconfiguration capability in the event of an insulated gate bipolar transistor failure. Significantly, this adaptability is achieved without additional control circuits, simplifying the overall control complexity. The proposed topology achieves a more harmonic balance with minimal hardware redundancy, maximal fault coverage, and minimum control complexities. Finally, the prototype of the proposed fault-tolerant topology has been constructed. This prototype and the proposed postfault control strategies have been thoroughly validated through experimental investigations, demonstrating their effectiveness and resilience.</description></item><item><title>Virtual Arm Impedance Emulation and Stability Improvement in Modular Multilevel Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10384740</link><description>The arm impedance in a modular multilevel converter (MMC) influences both the internal dynamics and the converter impedance, significantly impacting the overall system stability. This article proposes a damping method with virtual arm impedance to suppress the small-signal oscillations caused by impedance interactions and improve the MMC stability. The virtual arm impedance, including both a resistance and a reactance component, is emulated based on the common-mode (CM) second-harmonic circulating current, which is injected to optimize the capacitor voltages of MMCs. Different from existing virtual impedance methods, the steady-state operation of the MMC is not influenced by the CM virtual arm impedance. It is shown that the virtual reactance of the same impedance has a better damping effect, compared with the virtual resistance. Selection guidelines of virtual reactance are also provided considering both the stability margin and dynamic performance. Moreover, the stability improvement is quantified by a stability boundary map and validated by real-time grid interaction studies and experimental results. This paper is accompanied by a video file demonstrating the experimental validation of the proposed virtual arm impedance emulation methods.</description></item><item><title>Asymmetrical-Bidirectional Input-Series&#8211;Output-Parallel Modular DC&#8211;DC Converter in DC Distribution Grids With Renewables</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10306310</link><description>Interlinking dc&#8211;dc converters are essential in urban-area dc distribution grids to interconnect the medium-voltage and low-voltage (LV) buses. The increasing installation of renewable energy sources at the LV side will result in backward power flow through these converters, which is usually less than the forward power. This letter presents an asymmetrical-bidirectional input-series&#8211;output-parallel (AB-ISOP) dc&#8211;dc converter with a partial-scale backward power rating to satisfy the above realistic requirement. Single-active bridge (SAB) and dual-active bridge (DAB) converter modules are combined in the proposed structure: the unidirectional SABs process most of the forward power, whereas the bidirectional DABs provide passage for the backward power flow. A string of embedded nonisolated resonant DAB converters is constructed at the input stage to realize natural power coupling and voltage sharing. Compared with the all-DAB ISOP scheme, the proposed one requires fewer devices and presents higher conversion efficiency as active switches are omitted at the secondary side of SABs. Experiments conducted on the downscale prototype verify the operating principles and performance of the proposed converter.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive Enhanced Complex-Coefficient Filter-Based PLL in Variable Frequency Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10342708</link><description>The complex-coefficient filter-based phase-locked loop is widely used in state estimation for the constant frequency grid system. However, its performance under power systems with a variable frequency is generally unacceptable and related applications are consequently rare. This letter proposes an adaptive enhanced complex-coefficient filter-based phase-locked loop (AECCF-PLL) that accurately estimates the operational state of variable frequency grids. By deriving the relationship between model parameters and frequency, a frequency adaptive module is established to dynamically correct the model parameters in real time. Furthermore, a stability analysis of the system is provided to meet the requirements of stability and fast response for state estimation in more electric aircraft variable frequency grids and the computational workload is relatively small. Experimental tests show strong evidence for the effectiveness and validity of the proposed AECCF-PLL method.</description></item><item><title>Fuzzy-Based Adaptive VOC Methods for Parallel Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10349946</link><description>This letter is focused on different kinds of virtual oscillator control (VOC) schemes that can be used to regulate the power inverters. Deadzone oscillator (DZO), Van der Pol oscillator (VdPO), and New-VdPO-based VOC techniques are presented in this work. The output voltage falls as the load increases with the aforementioned control methods, which might be problematic for sensitive equipment that demands a constant voltage. To overcome this limitation, the authors proposed adaptive VOC methods (DZO-Adaptive, VdPO-Adaptive, and New-VdPO-Adaptive) based on fuzzy logic algorithms (FLAs). The proposed New-VdPO-Adaptive-based VOC controller has good voltage regulation and lower total harmonic distortion (THD). The simulation and hardware results of the FLA-based adaptive VOC methods are presented to determine the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes.</description></item><item><title>A Discrete Selective Harmonic Elimination Formulation With Common-Mode Voltage Elimination Ability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10376306</link><description>Common-mode voltage (CMV) is harmful to high-power converter-fed drive systems, thus actively suppressing the CMV that is of great significance. Compared with CMV reduction, CMV elimination is a better choice as it can totally avoid the influence of CMV. In this letter, a discrete selective harmonic elimination (SHE) formulation with CMV elimination ability is proposed, which uses output voltage levels as variables to be optimized instead of switching angles as in conventional SHE models. In this formulation, the optimization objective is low-order harmonic elimination, while CMV elimination is used as a constraint. The output result is the complete full SHE- pulsewidth modulated waveform over one fundamental period, where selected low-order harmonics and CMV have both been eliminated. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed formulation, and some comparison results are also provided.</description></item><item><title>A Small-Sized High-Precision Digital Closed-Loop Modulation Method for Dead-Time Compensation for Flying Capacitor Three-Level Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10379116</link><description>This article proposes a small-scale high-precision digital closed-loop modulation method for a flying-capacitor three-level inverter to eliminate the influence of dead time. The proposed method only uses a resistive voltage divider to collect the state information, without the need for a current sensor and an analog-to-digital converter, enabling a small footprint. This method does not require complex calculations, can be applied to high switching frequencies, and is independent of the original control system, so it is easy to integrate into a controller or a stand-alone IC. Finally, a 450-W/400-Hz prototype is built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Effective Field Grading at 200 &#176;C of a Nonlinear Resistive Polymer Nanocomposite Coating for Medium-Voltage Power Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10384759</link><description>Medium-voltage silicon carbide power modules have the potential to enable a more renewable, resilient, and reliable electric grid. However, their electrical insulation, especially the partial discharge around the module's triple point, remains a challenge. To address this, we have applied a nonlinear resistive coating made of a polymer nanocomposite to the module's triple point and have shown its effectiveness in reducing the electric field stress at room temperature. In this research, we assessed the performance of the coating at high temperatures up to 200 &#176;C. A test setup capable of measuring the partial discharge of a substrate at high temperatures was built. We found that from 25 &#176;C to 200 &#176;C, the coated samples maintained an 85% higher partial discharge inception voltage than that of the uncoated samples. The temperature dependence of the nanocomposite's electrical conductivity was measured and used in field simulations. Over the tested temperature range, the observed increase in partial discharge inception voltage agrees with the decrease in the simulated electric field stress caused by the nanocomposite coating. This research marks the first experimental demonstration of effective nonlinear resistive field-grading at 200 &#176;C for medium-voltage power modules, potentially hastening their adoption in grid-tied applications.</description></item><item><title>A Strongly Coupled Vehicle-to-Vehicle Wireless Charging System for Emergency Charging Purposes With Constant-Current and Constant-Voltage Charging Capabilities</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10388485</link><description>One current issue concerning rapidly developing electric vehicles (EVs) is range anxiety, especially when no charging station is around. A simple and expandable vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) wireless charging scheme has been proposed to satisfy urgent charging needs. In the proposed V2V system, one EV serves as a mobile charger for the other. Two power relay coils without compensating capacitors are adopted, forming a strong coupling with the coils in the EV. Thus, power can be transferred from one EV to the other via the ac magnetic relay. The mathematical models of the existing loosely coupled V2V system and the proposed strongly coupled V2V system are established. The constant-voltage and constant-current operations for the proposed V2V system are explored. The experimental results reveal that, compared with the existing loosely coupled V2V system, employing the proposed strongly coupled V2V system can improve efficiency and reduce weight, volume, and cost.</description></item><item><title>Nonlinear Inductor-Based Single Sensor Current Balancing Method for Interleaved DC&#8211;DC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10402083</link><description>The nonlinear characteristics of inductors, especially those with soft magnetic powder cores, are often perceived as undesirable and should be typically either avoided or mitigated. However, this letter presents an innovative method to take advantage of the nonlinear behavior of inductors in interleaved dc&#8211;dc converters. By analyzing the total current shape after interleaving, a novel single-sensor current balancing method is proposed, which is realized by using peak current sampling and exploiting the inductor's nonlinearity. The proposed method not only achieves low-cost current balancing with just one current sensor but also reduces the hardware volume and complexity of the converter. In addition, it also provides inspiration for various current balancing applications. Experimental validations for an interleaved dc&#8211;dc converter confirm the effectiveness of the proposed current balancing scheme.</description></item><item><title>Improving dv/dt Immunity of Reverse Blocking IGCT for Hybrid Line-Commutated Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10411065</link><description>The dv/dt induced turn-on is an undesirable triggering event of integrated gate-commutated thyristor (IGCT). In this letter, we aim to improve the dv/dt immunity of the IGCT in the hybrid line-commutated converter (H-LCC), which is a newly proposed topology that can reduce the commutation failure probability. First, the mechanism of the dv/dt induced turn-on is revealed. Second, it is proved evidentially that both the dv/dt applied time and the temperature significantly impact the dv/dt immunity. Third, three distinct snubber topologies to improve the dv/dt immunity are proposed and compared based on the above analysis. It is experimentally demonstrated that the topology comprising a capacitor, resistor, and normally on junction field effect transistors (JFETs) is the most effective; the dv/dt immunity at 50 &#176;C is improved from 144 to 655 V/&#956;s when the dv/dt applied time is 5 &#956;s, satisfying all requirements of the H-LCC successfully.</description></item><item><title>A Control Strategy for Solid-State Transformers With Coupled Load Disturbance Attenuation Ability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10376302</link><description>The architecture of solid-state transformers (SSTs) is usually comprised with three-stage cascaded converters. The control of cascaded multistage SSTs is conventionally designed considering decoupled stages. Furthermore, the isolating stage, which is typically implemented with dual active bridge converters, employs a closed-loop control with a much larger bandwidth (BW) than the ac&#8211;dc stage. This disparity in the BWs can put a strain on the intermediate dc-link capacitors that connect the ac&#8211;dc and isolating stages, resulting in large capacitor voltage excursions when the load changes. In fact, this can result in ac&#8211;dc stage overmodulation and even large current overshoots through the isolating stage's high-frequency transformers. This necessitates advanced SST control strategies that can mitigate the aforementioned challenges. This article proposes a control design in which the state variables are selected as the sum of capacitor energies and differences in capacitor energies. Unlike the state-of-the-art SST controllers, the proposed integrated control approach creates a more balanced and safe distribution of energies among the dc-link capacitors during load transients. The control design is simplified as the difference in the control-loop BWs between the stages does not affect this disturbance attenuation ability. The effectiveness of the proposed control is demonstrated by experiments using a 1-kVA SST with two strings.</description></item><item><title>High-Performance Control and Power Decoupling of a Grid-Tied Differential Boost Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10376288</link><description>This work proposes the control of a grid-tied differential boost inverter that achieves active power decoupling of the second harmonic ripple in the power drawn from the dc voltage source. The control strategy employs partial feedback linearization, a technique that enables precise positioning of the closed-loop poles of the linear representation of a part of the system obtained via coordinates transformation and nonlinear feedback. This approach allows for obtaining an excellent dynamic response in the active power decoupling control loop. The validity and effectiveness of the proposal are demonstrated through experimental and simulation results.</description></item><item><title>A Multienergy Interface Electric-Drive- Reconstructed Onboard Charger for EVs With Integrated Control Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10379144</link><description>In this article, an innovative multienergy interface electric-drive-reconstructed onboard charger (MEI-EDROC) and its derivative integrated control strategy (ICS) are proposed for a solar-powered electric vehicle that is equipped with a six-phase machine drive. The proposed MEI-EDROC is capable of dc charging, single-phase charging, in-motion charging, and normal driving with applications for single-phase ac grid, dc grid, and photovoltaic energy input interfaces. In particular, all the operation modes are implemented by the ICS extended from the vector control of the six-phase permanent-magnet synchronous machine. First, the topology and operation modes of the proposed MEI-EDROC are discussed. Then, operation principles for all work scenarios are studied in detail, and the concept of integrated control is proposed. Thereafter, based on the vector control strategy, the ICS is designed. Finally, a 2-kW experimental test rig is built, and the obtained results verify the steady-state and dynamic performances, as well as the mode switching operation.</description></item><item><title>Switched Active Power Control of a Grid-Connected Inverter With Reduced RoCoF and Frequency Overshoot</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10380738</link><description>In this article, a switched active power control of the grid-connected inverter is proposed. First, the principle of the proposed control is demonstrated with the phase trajectory analysis. The proposed control allows for direct adjustment of the maximum rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) and frequency overshoot of the inverter, thereby enhancing the frequency stability. Next, the stability of the proposed control is examined using the Lyapunov function. For the active power control loop of the inverter, the proposed control has been proven to ensure global asymptotic stability. Then, the parameters of the proposed control are designed. Due to the clear physical meaning, the proposed control allows for explicit derivation of the relationships among RoCoF, frequency overshoot, response time, and active power overshoot of the inverter. Therefore, the controller parameters can be directly designed using the derived analytical equations, simplifying the application of the proposed control. Finally, the proposed control is clarified through detailed comparisons to highlight its advantages. The proposed control achieves a lower RoCoF and frequency overshoot compared to existing controls while maintaining the same active power overshoot and response time. This is demonstrated through theoretical, simulation, and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithm Based Reinforcement Learning Controller for Single-Inductor Multiple-Output DC&#8211;DC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10381868</link><description>Due to its advantages, such as simple structure, high power density, and strong scalability, single-input multiple-output (SIMO) dc&#8211;dc converters exhibit vast application prospects. However, a significant challenge arises in the control design of SIMO converters. This challenge stems from the shared usage of the inductor in the main circuit by all loads, inevitably leading to mutual interference and cross-regulation among the output voltages. Consequently, research on control methods for SIMO dc&#8211;dc converters has been a widely discussed topic. In this article, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm based reinforcement learning (RL) controller. The proposed control method is applicable to multivariable and nonlinear control systems, offering excellent regulation performance and robustness. It effectively addresses the issues of mutual interference and cross-regulation among the outputs of SIMO dc&#8211;dc converters. This approach also enhances the steady-state performance and dynamic regulation capabilities of the converter when operating in continuous conduction mode. Simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed RL multivariable controller. The results demonstrate that SIMO converters, when controlled by the RL multivariable controller, exhibit improved steady-state and dynamic response performance. This approach effectively mitigates the cross-regulation issues among the outputs of SIMO converters.</description></item><item><title>Review of Topologies, Application Areas, Modeling, and Control Methods for Switched Capacitor Circuits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10381836</link><description>Switched capacitor (SC) circuits have been widely used for low-power and high-power areas, such as the integration circuit power supply, energy conversion for wearable devices, and power supply for data centers and electrical vehicles.

In this article, a model predictive control (MPC) scheme for a single-phase IBC is proposed for the first time. The IBC repurposes the motor drive, which consists of a three-phase induction motor and a three-phase inverter, for charging purposes. The proposed MPC scheme is implemented with the objective of minimization of switching frequency using double prediction algorithm, along with maintaining a sinusoidal grid current profile at unity power factor (UPF) during charging mode. Furthermore, the proposed scheme addresses the issue of ripple power at the dc link with twice the grid frequency, which is inherently present in a single-phase IBCs. This ripple component is effectively suppressed by using active power decoupling by reutilizing one of the stator windings of the induction motor along with the inverter legs without any additional hardware requirement. Additionally, the power reversal capability of IBC is also demonstrated. The control scheme was implemented on hardware by using Texas instruments$^{\prime }$ DSP TMS320F28335.</description></item><item><title>Stability Analysis of Input-Series/Output-Parallel Solid-State Transformers Equipped With Second-Order Harmonic Active Power Filters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10384781</link><description>Solid-state transformers (SSTs) with input-series/output-parallel (ISOP) configuration offer a convenient solution for ac/dc conversion due to their scalability and modularity. In this configuration, each module experiences a second-order harmonic ripple caused by local single-phase ac/dc conversion. To neutralize this ripple, active power filters (APFs) can be installed, eliminating the need for oversized dc-bus capacitances. However, the presence of multiple APFs, working at the same time, can lead to dynamic interactions and potential instability due to the coupling between different ISOP SST modules. This study examines the mutual dynamics arising from multiple APFs in ISOP SSTs. It is shown that ensuring stability for the operation of a single APF does not automatically guarantee the overall stability when all APFs are simultaneously enabled. To study this phenomenon, an analysis approach based on the generalized Nyquist criterion for multi-input/multi-output systems is derived. Through the proposed approach, the closed-loop stability only needs to be verified toward two equivalent SST impedances that intrinsically considers the mutual coupling. This provides a simple design and verification tool for the APF controller, and the results are validated experimentally using a single-phase ISOP SST.</description></item><item><title>An Energy-Based Model of Four-Switch Buck&#8211;Boost Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10388278</link><description>The four-switch buck&#8211;boost (FSBB) topology is often used in combination with other isolated converters to extend the voltage range capability of the overall structure. In such applications, the duty-cycles of the two legs of the FSBB are independently controlled, and a phase shift is typically used to shape the inductor current ripple and, thus, achieve zero voltage switching. This article proposes a nonlinear average model, and the corresponding linearized small-signal model for the FSBB operating in the described way. Notably, the proposed approach is based on the modeling of the inductor energy, which allows the correct description of the dynamics related to the phase shift, in addition to those related to the duty-cycles. The derived models are shown to be in excellent agreement with simulation results and are also validated by measurements on an experimental prototype.</description></item><item><title>Insights on the Dynamic Performance of Nonminimum-Phase Boost Converters Exploiting Inductor-Current-Feedback RHPZ Mitigation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10398513</link><description>Inductor current feedback (ICF) has been recently proposed to mitigate the adverse effect of the right-half-plane zero (RHPZ) in nonminimum phase boost converters. Basically, ICF is used to move the RHPZ into the left-half-plane, leading to increased closed-loop stability. This article systematically investigates the impact of the ICF mitigation technique on the dynamic performance of the converter. It is shown that both line and load transient responses are still limited by the RHPZ despite the exploitation of ICF. Compared to a boost converter equipped with a properly designed proportional-integral-derivative controller, the use of ICF leads to a load transient response with similar peak overshoots/undershoots but slower settling time, whereas the line transient response shows a significant reduction in the peak overshoots/undershoots. The theoretical analysis and the proposed design guidelines are verified with SIMetrix/SIMPLIS and MATLAB/Simulink simulations. Experimental results from a prototype boost converter designed for 2.3&#8211;4.5 V to 5 V voltage conversion, 800 mA load current capability, provide further validation.</description></item><item><title>Subsynchronous Damping by Battery Storage System in Grid-Forming Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10400798</link><description>Wind farms are susceptible to subsynchronous oscillation (SSO) issues due to the interaction between the grid-side converter (GSC) and the weak-grid impedance. Integration of battery energy storage system (BESS) to damp SSO became popular due to its ability to also provide various grid services. Generally, BESS can be externally integrated at the PCC or internally integrated at the dc link of the wind turbine (WT). In case of external BESS integration, grid-forming (GFM) control is usually applied to the BESS GSC. Proper increase of the GFM damping coefficient contributes to a better SSO damping, at the cost of a higher BESS power rating due to its droop meaning. Reconfiguring power loop of GFM to decouple the damping and the droop coefficient enables GSC to realize similar SSO damping performance while reducing the BESS power rating. In case of internal BESS integration, a virtual GFM control is proposed as an ancillary control of the WT GSC. This enables GSC to emulate the output behavior of two parallel converters, operated in grid-following and GFM mode, respectively. Consequently, similar SSO damping performance can be realized without an external GFM converter. Simulation and experimental results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Comparative Study on High-Temperature Electrical Properties of 1.2 kV SiC MOSFET and JBS-Integrated MOSFET</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10337796</link><description>For 4H-SiC mosfets, the parasitic PiN body diode causes problems such as significant forward voltage drop of body diode and poor reverse recovery characteristics during high-temperature operation. A reasonable solution is a mosfet with an integrated Schottky barrier diode to deactivate the PiN body diode. Since SiC mosfets can operate at extremely high temperatures, the characterization of electrical parameters at high temperatures and changing with the temperature are very important for high power applications and system reliability. However, there is a lack of comparison and analysis of the two devices on electrical properties at ultrahigh temperatures. In this article, a 1.2 kV conventional mosfet and a mosfet integrated with a junction barrier Schottky diode (JBSFET) were fabricated with a consistent process flow. In the temperature range from 300 to 575 K, analytical models of the temperature-dependent electrical parameters of these two devices were established and compared, which were successfully verified by the measurements. These models can provide guidance for ultrahigh temperature applications of JBSFETs. Temperature-related expressions can also be used for junction temperature monitoring of temperature-sensitive electrical parameters. Experimental results show that JBSFET has better third quadrant conduction characteristics and higher temperature stability below 450 K, but loses obvious performance advantages at 575 K. So, the recommended operating temperature range of JBSFET is from 300 to 450 K. Finally, the continuous operation performance of the body diodes in buck converters is analyzed. The higher efficiency of buck converter based on JBSFET's body diode indicates its great application potential in compact converters, especially in the recommended temperature range.</description></item><item><title>Reduction of CM Noise by Minimizing Near-Field Effects in a DC&#8211;DC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10337757</link><description>Enabled by the adoption of wide-bandgap power devices, converters in many applications continue to push switching frequency and power density. These trends have the unintentional effect of strengthening parasitic inductive and capacitive couplings between different areas of the power converter. If not properly addressed, these parasitic near-field couplings may increase the converter's conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI). This article investigates the impact of parasitic near-field couplings on conducted common-mode (CM) noise in a buck converter with the EMI filter. Magnetic and electric coupling mechanisms are studied using near-field measurements. A CM model with capacitive couplings is developed and shown to accurately predict the CM noise spectrum under two different test conditions. The model is analyzed and two critical capacitive couplings are identified. Finally, shielding techniques are demonstrated to reduce CM noise up to 35 dB, and a novel shielded-windings PCB inductor structure is proposed.</description></item><item><title>A Clamped Interlocking Isolated Resonant Gate Driver for High-Frequency LLC-DCX</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10319065</link><description>This article proposes a clamped interlocking isolated resonant gate driver (CIRGD) to provide multiple isolated complementary drive signals for the LLC dc transformer (LLC-DCX). The CIRGD clamps the gate voltage to 0&#8211;Vg using clamped mosfets, reducing conduction loss caused by the circulation current in the drive circuit and further improving system efficiency. With appropriate parameter design, the CIRGD generates gate drive signals with the necessary deadtime, enabling soft switching of the LLC-DCX. The working principle, parameter design, loss analysis, and comparative study of the CIRGD are presented in detail. Finally, a prototype with an operating frequency of 1.3 MHz, and a power output of 48 V&#8211;6 V/30 A was developed. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional voltage source drive circuit, the proposed CIRGD can significantly enhance efficiency and reduce gate drive power loss by nearly 85%.</description></item><item><title>Bipolar Current-Fed DC&#8211;DC Converter With Automatic Voltage Balance and Full Range ZVS for Bipolar DC System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10356717</link><description>The bipolar dc microgrid is attracting attention for its high efficiency and reliability, but the bipolar dc bus is susceptible to unbalanced power. This article proposes a bipolar current-fed dc&#8211;dc converter with automatic voltage balance under phase-shift plus pulsewidth control.

LCL exhibits similar soft switching characteristics and enhanced voltage gain regulation capability with a simpler resonant tank than the existing classic CLLC. The operating principles, mode distribution, and power transfer properties of LCL during bidirectional operations are presented and analyzed in detail utilizing TDM. By incorporating TDM, the low accuracy deficiency of the first harmonic approximation for wide voltage applications is completely eliminated, and the implementation of full-range zero-voltage switching (ZVS) with time-domain accuracy becomes feasible. An LCL resonant parameters optimization method that is capable of providing the required voltage gain and guaranteeing the achievement of ZVS with reduced reactive power under desired load conditions during bidirectional operations is proposed. Finally, the revealed experimental results from a 1-kW prototype validated the correctness of the TDM theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed optimization method.

Both additional series-connected converters and their adjacent transformers are necessitated when controlling the power flow among multiple transmission lines. Such implementation will further increase the cost and volume of the equipment owing to the port expansion.

This device presents several advantages, including low cost, lightweight, fast dynamic response characteristics, and easy port expansion. Therefore, the MTUPFC has significant advantages in power grids with complex configurations and large-scale renewable energy integration. The operation principle and control strategies of the proposed MTUPFC are elaborated. The feasibility and effectiveness of the MTUPFC are verified by a 60-MVA simulation model and a 2.5-kVA scaled-down experimental platform, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Development of a MHz Pulsed Power Supply for Kicker Magnet in SHINE</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375743</link><description>Shanghai high repetition rate X-ray free electron laser and extreme light (SHINE) project is a superconducting linear electron accelerator-based facility under construction at the Shanghai Advance Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Conventional power loss evaluation methods separate the theoretical analysis and experimental verification stages. Consequently, these methods often suffer from irreconcilable disparities between the analytical predictions and measurement outcomes. This article introduces a transfer learning (TL)-based refinement approach for power loss evaluation, which can be iteratively improved with ongoing experimental data. Our method entails the creation of an extensive source domain dataset for training a source domain model, followed by fine-tuning in the target domain. Consequently, a self-adaptive and refined power loss evaluation model is established with a small amount of experimental data.

Leveraging a dataset of 2 33 280 simulation samples and 45 experimental samples, our refined power loss evaluation model achieved a remarkable 50% reduction in average power loss error compared with conventional methodologies. Guided by the TL refined power loss model, the peak efficiency and corresponding optimal control parameters can be obtained.</description></item><item><title>Topology and Hybrid Modulation of Six-Level Switched-Capacitor HC Converter With Improved DC-Link Capacitor Voltage Balancing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10384793</link><description>Neutral point (NP) voltage imbalance blocks the deployment of carrier-based clamped converters for specific scenarios due to the limited adjustment capability of NP current by zero-sequence voltage (ZSV) injection. Therefore, a novel six-level switched-capacitor (SC) hybrid clamped (6L-SCHC) converter is proposed, which has compromised voltage stress, and utilizes the discrete voltage boost and capacitor voltage self-balancing features of the SC circuit to simplify control complexity. On this basis, a carrier-based hybrid modulation is developed, which simplifies the complexity of SC voltage control, and ensures the voltage natural balance of SC and dc-link center capacitor to minimize voltage ripples. Furthermore, a reasonable functional relationship between average NP current and reference modulation voltage is explored. As the result, the proposed 6L-SCHC converter has extremely powerful NP voltage balancing capability compared with other carrier-based clamped converters in theory, especially at high modulation indexes and low power factors. Capacitor voltage ripple models are also derived to achieve voltage independent controls of all capacitors. Comparative simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed topology and modulation greatly reduce the low-frequency voltage ripples of dc-link upper and lower capacitors, and provide excellent NP voltage balancing performance over a wide range of modulation indexes and power factors.</description></item><item><title>A High-Efficiency High-Density Three-Phase CLLC Resonant Converter With a Universally Derived Three-Phase Integrated Transformer for On-Board-Charger Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10400842</link><description>This article proposed a universal method of integrating magnetizing inductance with built-in leakage inductance based on multiple perfectly coupled transformers (PCTs).

When combined with high output power, magnetic optimization becomes crucial in the pushing of the boundaries of magnetic shrinkage. Among those applications in need of power dense systems, aircraft is considered one of the most restrictive due to its ultrahigh reliability and miniaturization in both volume and mass. On-board equipment transfers the responsability to the power stage classifying it as mission-critical. The selection of a multiphase converter enables the desired magnetic components' shrinkage.

This article introduces a reconfigurable half-bridge gate driver (GD) for SMPSys, with an open-drain output configuration, electrostatic discharge self-protection, and two dead-time management modes to address these challenges. The first mode is an externally tunable fixed dead-time generator (FDTG) capable of achieving a wide dead-time range from 5 to 200 ns. The second mode is a self-adjusting dead-time generator (SDTG), designed to adapt to delay mismatches between the GD's channels, regardless of process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations, while minimizing dead-time and preventing cross-conduction. The GD was fabricated in an HV 0.18-&#956;m silicon-on-insulator CMOS process technology, supporting a high-side floating bias voltage rail up to 100 V and occupying a core area of 0.285 mm2. It was tested in a buck converter system using a gallium nitride (GaN)-based half-bridge with a switching frequency of 0.5 to 1 MHz. It achieves a total propagation delay of 11.4 ns and a minimum dead-time of 3.6 ns (3&#215; smaller than state-of-the-art) using its SDTG mode. The system achieved a peak efficiency of 90.5% at an output load of 8 W. Notably, the SDTG mode improves the overall efficiency by up to 20% over the FDTG mode, specifically at higher switching frequencies, showing its effectiveness in enhancing the performance of SMPSys.</description></item><item><title>Multicell-to-Multicell Equalizer With Hybrid Pulsewidth Modulation and Phase-Shift Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10355888</link><description>In this article, an any-cells-to-any-cells equalizer based on the multiwinding transformer is proposed to reduce the component number and increase the balancing speed.

The proposed circuit topology exhibits a high voltage conversion ratio and a reduced current ripple. On the transformer primary side, a quasi-switched-capacitor (QSC) circuit mitigates voltage stress on switching devices and achieves a 3:1 voltage step-down ratio. The proposed transformer-interleaved circuit on the secondary side features the 2:1 voltage conversion ratio and minimizes the battery current ripple without adding extra switching or magnetic components. The 6:1 voltage conversion contributes to a simpler winding structure, smaller transformer size, and lower transformer loss in high voltage gain application.

That is studied by many researchers. In addition, using dual-mode control can improve the line-to-line output voltage waveform to be more easily filtered into sine wave. Thus, the traditional method to determine the LC filter parameters is unreasonable and will cause over filtering. The redundant design of filter will bring unnecessary volume, weight and loss on inductor and capacitor of the inverter, while decrease the power density. To solve this issue, this article derives the line-to-line output voltage harmonic components calculation formulas for the conventional two-stage inverter and the dual-mode inverter by using double Fourier integral analysis. By comparing the harmonic components calculation results around switching frequency, a new LC filter parameters design method for dual-mode inverter is proposed. Through the proposed method, the LC filter parameters are declined by 50%, which significantly reduces the volume, weight and cost of the inverter under other conditions of constant performance. Calculation and experimental results based on a 1 kW prototype verify the validity of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Fast-Transient Radiation-Tolerant LDO-cum-Latching Current Limiter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10379868</link><description>The low-dropout regulator (LDO) and the latching current limiter (LCL) are two important constituent components of the power management system in satellites, including for the impending 6G satellite communications. In this article, we present a fast-transient radiation-tolerant LDO-cum-LCL realized in CMOS (vis-&#224;-vis III/V or BiCMOS exotic processes). The LCL therein detects load current anomalies, thereby protecting the load against current anomalies (when the load suffers from single-event-latch-up, a radiation effect). The fast-transient response is realized by our proposed triple-feedforward-path technique that is efficacious over wide range of load currents (up to 3A) and off-chip capacitors (100 to 880 &#956;F). The LDO-cum-LCL is monolithically realized in a 130 nm CMOS process. The dropout voltage is 210 mV at the full load, and the overshoot and undershoot are 14.2 and 11.8 mV, respectively, at fast 3A load transitions. The load regulation is 0.15 mV/A while the power supply rejection is &#8722;52.3 dB@100 kHz. These parameters of the LDO-cum-LCL are very competitive when benchmarked against reported LDOs, albeit the reported LDOs not featuring radiation tolerance.</description></item><item><title>Ultrafast Self-Powered Circuit for Gate Driving of Normally On Wide-Bandgap Transistors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10379848</link><description>Normally on wide-bandgap (WBG) devices switch faster and have lower power loss compared to similarly rated normally off devices. However, their application in voltage-fed power electronic converters is limited due to the risk of the dc-link short-circuit condition. Several techniques are proposed in the literature to address this problem. However, some drawbacks exist, first, the use of several additional components; second, slow response to the short-circuit condition; and third, increased power losses.

However, one big challenge is the mismatch of overvoltage withstand capability of electromagnetic transformer and converters in the HTs. The limited overvoltage capacity of the converter limits the overall performance of the HT in overvoltage events in the power grid.

The voltage-clamped circuit, which consists of a gap and a metal oxide varistor, ensures the safe operation of the VCS without the risks of breakdown during overvoltage period. Thus, this scheme allows the high-voltage HT to take advantage of the surge resistance of electromagnetic transformers and keep the enhanced controllability normally during transient surges. An experimental platform was built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed VCS, and simulation results demonstrated the usefulness of the high voltage HT with proposed scheme in power delivery systems subjected to different transient surges.</description></item><item><title>A High-Order Harmonic Compound Rotor Based Brushless Dual-Electrical-Port Dual-Mechanical-Port Machine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10195929</link><description>The brushless dual-electrical-port dual-mech- anical-port machine (BLDDM) is increasingly developed as an effective power split device for continuously variable transmission due to its compactness and high control flexibility.

However, the unsuppressed torque ripple of IPMSM will cause declined torque quality, increased vibration, and reduced reliability. This article presents a novel composed T-shaped notching rotor to suppress torque ripple for IPMSM. The mathematical models of cogging torque and winding factors considering T- shaped notches are established, respectively. Although the principle of the novel rotor design is clearly explained by mathematical models, the accurate dimensions of the composed T-shaped notch are difficult to calculate. Therefore, two-dimensional finite element analysis and multiobjective design optimization are employed to calculate the T-shaped notch dimensions. The electromagnetic performance of the proposed rotor machine is compared with that of the commonly notching rotor machine. In addition, the mechanical strength of the novel rotor is verified by calculations of stress and deformation. Finally, the proposed prototype with a novel rotor is fabricated, and extensive experiments are conducted. The results show that the torque ripple of IPMSM can be significantly reduced by the novel composed T-shaped notching rotor.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Highly Efficient Torque-Sharing Algorithm for Dual Stator Winding Induction Machines for Various Speed Regions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10168138</link><description>This article proposes a novel and highly efficient torque-sharing algorithm for dual stator winding induction machines (DSWIMs). This algorithm introduces three modes of operation for DSWIMs based on the command speed and the required load power. Implementing this algorithm makes accurate flux calculation and control possible in very low-speed regions, including zero speed. In higher speed regions, if one of the winding sets is able to supply the required power solely, the other is switched off to augment the overall efficiency. In higher required powers, both winding sets cooperate to supply the load torque, and the required electromagnetic torque division between the two winding sets is fulfilled based on their power ratings. This guarantees overloading avoidance in various operation conditions. Moreover, the optimal flux condition is guaranteed in various speed regions free of the torque sharing. In addition, this algorithm is general and can be implemented in direct torque control and field-oriented control schemes in various reference frames. The proposed algorithm has been experimentally implemented in a 3.3-kW vector-controlled DSWIM drive system. In this flux and speed control system, the flux is controlled such that a search-based maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) algorithm is realized. The proposed MTPA strategy is insensitive to DSWIM parameters and load variations.

The current-source charge pump (CS-CP) PFC converter has the advantages of simple structure, easy control, and low cost, but it can only obtain a high power factor (PF) over a narrow input range. The operation principle of the CS-CP PFC converter and the input voltage range are analyzed in this article. In order to obtain a high PF over a wide input voltage range, in this article, a variable turn ratio CS-CP PFC converter is proposed. By adjusting the turn ratio according to the variation of the input voltage, the proposed converter can obtain a high PF over a wide input voltage range, reduce the voltage stress of the bus capacitor, and solve the problem of insufficient voltage gain at low input voltage. The operating modes and the wide input voltage range of the proposed converter are analyzed, and the relevant parameters are given. A 40-W experimental prototype operating with the input voltage range of 100&#8211;242 Vac is built to verify the theoretical analysis. The proposed converter obtains the PF of 0.946&#8211;0.991 and its total harmonic distortion of current can satisfy the IEC 61000-3-2-2020 Class-C Standard in the whole input voltage.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Capacitor Voltage-Balancing Method for Multiwinding Resonant Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10183679</link><description>Isolated dc/dc converters play a key role in electric vehicle applications, and novel multiwinding resonant converters have recently been proposed for on-board and off-board charging applications. Some of these topologies have two series capacitors at the dc bus with a mid-point connection to the windings. Parameter mismatch due to manufacturing differences will cause voltage unbalance on these capacitors, which can lead to safety and reliability concerns. However, the well-known capacitor balancing strategies proposed for other topologies are not applicable to these new resonant multiwinding topologies. Thus, this article proposes a novel capacitor voltage-balancing method for a resonant multiwinding converter. The method uses a simple table to decide on balancing switching states. Time-domain analysis is performed to quantify the control cycles required, and an adaptive control strategy is proposed. Experimental results with multiple bus capacitor sizes validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, use of the proposed method is found to slightly increase efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Automatic Tuning Resonant Capacitor to Fix the Bidirectional Detuning With ZVS in Wireless Power Transfer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10190168</link><description>The power transfer efficiency of a wireless power transfer is degraded by mismatch between LC resonant frequency and TX switching frequency. One of the drawbacks of conventional resonance tuning methods is that only increment of capacitor is allowed. Even if some conventional tunings allow both increment and reduction of capacitance, they fail zero-voltage switching (ZVS) at the increment of capacitance, which practically limits their tuning range. To solve the issue, we propose an automatic tuning resonant capacitor (ATRC), which can both increase and decrease the resonant capacitor. The tuning mosfets achieve zero-voltage turn-on (ZVS) both at the capacitor-reduction mode and the capacitor-increment mode. These two (decrement/increment both are possible, and ZVS for both modes) are the advantages compared to conventional autotuning methods. Additionally, low dv/dt turn-off is achieved at capacitor-increasing mode in proposed method. Hence, the delivered power and overall efficiency is improved. The proposed method is suitable for any LC network to solve the detuning problem. A 200 W prototype is fabricated and tested experimentally. The measurement results show that the proposed ATRC can improve the overall PTE by 25%&#8211;63% point when the operating frequency is detuned ranging 75&#8211;125 kHz for 100 kHz nominal LC resonant frequency.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Practical Evaluation of Dimmable Passive Light-Emitting Diode Drivers for Smart Lampposts</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10199135</link><description>Passive light-emitting-diode (LED) drivers have recently been adopted by the lighting industry in street lighting applications due to their high robustness against extreme weather conditions, long lifetime, and high percentage of recyclable components. With the increasing trend of smart lamp posts, there are new requests for dimmable passive street lighting systems. This article presents a novel dimmable technology for passive LED drivers. By adding a switchable parallel capacitor across the input current-limiting inductor, a small freewheeling period between the inductor and capacitor can provide an artificial dead angle, which reduces the power for a passive half-bridge voltage doubler LED driver. The operating principle of this new dimming mechanism is explained, and a full analysis is included. The new dimmable mechanism has been practically confirmed in a 120-W passive LED system. The theoretical and practical results are in good agreement.</description></item><item><title>Simultaneous Wireless Power and Data Transfer System With Single Coil Based on Multifrequency Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10189817</link><description>The existing energy modulation simultaneous wireless power and data transfer (EM-SWPDT) system will cause severe load voltage drop and power efficiency reduction at the data transmitting. Besides, those methods can only achieve simplex communication. To solve these problems, this article proposes a single coil half-duplex communication EM-SWPDT system using a novel multifrequency modulation, which can enhance data transmission performance. By modulating the conduction angle of the converter with desired signal frequency, the steady state and sinusoidal fluctuating states are realized, which compose different data wave, respectively. Because the data transmission relies on frequency information instead of amplitude information, the load voltage drop can be reduced. And the phase-shifting equivalent current model is constructed to evaluate the influence of data transmission on load voltage. Since the data modulation is performed by the converters of wireless power transfer system, additional auxiliary data circuits, such as signal generators and wave trappers are omitted and branch crosstalk is reduced. Therefore, the influence of data transmission on power transmission efficiency is weak. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed EM-SWPDT system with a novel multifrequency modulation is verified by experimental platforms.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Voltage Stiffness Control Technique for a Virtual Oscillator-Based Grid- Forming Controller</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10163995</link><description>Voltage stiffness is a vital parameter for grid-forming inverters. With a very high voltage stiffness, an inverter picks up all the reactive power demands of the point of common coupling. In contrast, with a very low voltage stiffness, the inverter does not participate in voltage regulation at all. Hence, any grid-forming controller should be able to control voltage stiffness dynamically. Virtual oscillator-based controllers (VOCs), the latest and most advanced grid-forming controllers, provide all the steady-state functionalities of the conventional droop controllers and, in addition, time-domain synchronization with a connected network. However, existing VOCs cannot control voltage stiffness dynamically. As a result, limiting reactive power output during a higher voltage sag, especially when connected to a weak grid, is challenging for VOCs. The only existing solution for a VOC in such conditions is to enter into current control mode, which leads to ineffective synchronization, output power oscillation, and, finally, inefficient grid-forming operation. Integrating a dynamic voltage stiffness controller inside a VOC is not as straightforward as a droop controller. Because, unlike phasor-based droop controllers, VOCs have time-domain implementation. In this article, we introduce virtual impedance-based dynamic voltage stiffness control technique for VOCs with systematic design procedures and rigorous stability analysis.</description></item><item><title>High-Efficiency Time-Division Multiplexing Modulation Technology for Modular Multiactive Bridge Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10194423</link><description>In this article, a time-division multiplexing (TDM) modulation technology is proposed to enhance the efficiency of modular multiactive bridge (MMAB) converters in multiport power electronic transformers over a wide operating range. The TDM modulation retains the simplicity of single phase-shift (SPS) modulation while achieving efficiency improvement by adopting different structures (i.e., half-bridge and full-bridge) under different operating conditions with dc bias capacitors. However, determining the optimal structure under the same operating condition poses a significant challenge due to the strong coupling among MMAB ports. To address this issue, this article analyzes a dual-active bridge converter to investigate the steady-state characteristics of different structures, including the root-mean-square current and zero-voltage switching. By decomposing the MMAB converter into different transmission branches, the optimal combination structure of half-bridge and full-bridge are selected based on the branch powers, forming a simple and efficient TDM modulation technology. Finally, an experimental prototype of a four-port MMAB converter is established and tested. The results demonstrate that the proposed TDM can increase efficiency up to 19.09% compared to SPS, validating the correctness and effectiveness of the theoretical analysis.</description></item><item><title>Efficiency Enhancement for Alkaline Water Electrolyzers Directly Driven by Fluctuating PV Power</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10163951</link><description>Hydrogen production from photovoltaic arrays is a promising way to fully utilize the solar energy and to relieve consumption pressure of the power system. The low-cost and mature alkaline water electrolysis is suitable for large-scale hydrogen production. However, the low-load inefficiency of alkaline water electrolyzers greatly limits their operation range (usually 40%&#8211;100% of rated load). Hence, alkaline water electrolyzers are hard to follow the fluctuating photovoltaic power in full range. Focusing on this problem, this article analyzes the inefficiency mechanism of low-load alkaline water electrolyzers. It is found that through modifying the excitation electric field, the low-load performance of alkaline water electrolyzers can be greatly enhanced. Based on this, an optimal current pulsewidth modulation control strategy and the corresponding prototype converter are proposed to regulate alkaline water electrolyzers directly driven by photovoltaic arrays. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a 2 Nm3/h commercial alkaline water electrolyzer. Experimental results show that compared to the conventional dc power supply, 1) the maximum efficiency improvement can exceed two times, and 2) the alkaline water electrolyzer can follow the fluctuating photovoltaic power well.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Power Balancing Control Method for Energy Storage DC/DC Parallel Supply System With Low-Frequency Pulsed Load</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10197235</link><description>For the energy storage dc/dc parallel supply system with low-frequency pulsed load, an unbalanced dynamic power distribution problem will occur due to the inconsistent dc inertia of each converter, even resulting in a severe continuous low-frequency power oscillation. For this, a dynamic power balancing control method is proposed to reshape their dc inertia to be consistent and realize dynamic power balancing distribution among multiple converters without low-frequency power oscillation. Meanwhile, by analogy with the rotor swing equation of the synchronous machine, the power&#8211;voltage equivalent model with introducing the dc inertia parameter is established. Afterward, the essential mechanism of power oscillation with a low-frequency pulsed load is revealed. Furthermore, the principle of the proposed control method is clarified, and the control parameters are reasonably designed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control method is verified experimentally.</description></item><item><title>Model Predictive Control for Intersubmodule State-of-Charge Balancing in Cascaded H-Bridge Converter-Based Battery Energy Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10179256</link><description>In the operation of battery energy storage systems based on the cascaded H-bridge converter, it is beneficial to balance the state of charge of batteries in different submodules within the converter phase-arm. This is achieved by distributing the active power among the submodules. Although multiple methods have been proposed for this purpose, they face the challenge of rendering optimal active power distributions that maximize balancing speed while meeting power constraints in the battery energy storage system. To overcome this challenge, a model predictive control scheme is developed in this article. The proposed method is remarkably robust against parametric uncertainties (battery voltage, capacity, etc.), as evidenced by its ability to tolerate a substantial 50% uncertainty in the parameters, resulting in a mere 0.05% steady-state error. Furthermore, because the predictive control can be executed at a low frequency, the computational burden is comparable to other existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Event-Triggered Hybrid Anti-Islanding Protection Scheme Based on Q-Axis Disturbance Injection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10190124</link><description>Distributed generators are required to be integrated with sophisticated anti-islanding protection system (AIPS). However, most conventional AIPS fails to detect unintentional islanding event during perfectly matched loading conditions. To overcome this issue, in this article, a hybrid islanding detection algorithm has been proposed based on the rate of change of kinetic energy and root-mean-square value of absolute frequency deviation at the point of common coupling (PCC). The methodology presents a significant contribution prior to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of the disturbance injection mechanism through the q-axis current control loop of the grid-tied inverter. The method activates the disturbance signal injection mechanism only when an unintentional islanding event is suspected based on monitoring certain parameters at the PCC. This mechanism has been proposed to have zero nondetection zone, very fast operation, straightforward implementation, and significantly less impact on the power quality and stability of the power electronics system. The performance of the proposed method has been evaluated by conducting 200+ islanding and nonislanding case studies in simulation as well as an experimental platform. The proposed method is robust, accurate, and fast enough to detect an islanding event cleverly with a detection time as small as 120 ms.</description></item><item><title>A Current-Stress-Optimized Design Method for Dual Active Bridge Converters With Improved ZVS Capability Under Wide Output Voltage Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10185988</link><description>In dual active bridge (DAB) converters, the current stress seriously impacts the switching losses, and thus is tightly relevant to the efficiency.

The proposed approach utilizes a multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) technique to coordinate multiple control objectives. During the offline training stage, each DRL agent supervises a submodule (SM) of the DCSST, and outputs real-time actions based on the received states. Optimal phase-shift ratio combinations are learned using triple phase-shift modulation, and soft actor-critic (SAC) agents optimize the neural network parameters to enhance controller performance. The well-trained agents act as fast surrogate models that provide online control decisions for the DCSST, adapting to variant environmental conditions using only local SM information. The proposed distributed configuration improves redundancy and modularity, facilitating hot-swap experiments. Experimental results demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed multiagent SAC algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Impedance Specifications for Stability Design of Grid-Connected DC Distribution Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10195858</link><description>In practical application, it is more expected that the impedance-based stability criteria can provide intuitive system design guidance. However, the existing stability criteria for the complicated systems always aggregate all equipment/subsystem impedances. As a result, it is difficult to determine the port impedance specification that each equipment/subsystem should meet to ensure the system stability and a certain stability margin. In this article, the impedance specifications for the stability design of grid-connected dc distribution power systems are proposed. First, the stability conditions for impedance specification design are presented based on the dc-side subsystem impedance ratio criterion. On this basis, the ac-side admittance specifications and dc-side impedance specifications are proposed to ensure system stability. The former is used to constrain the ac-side admittance of voltage-source converter (VSC), and the latter restricts the dc-side impedance of grid-connected VSC and the input impedance of each converter-based load. The proposed impedance specifications are mainly related to grid impedance, transmission power, dc-bus voltage, two specific frequencies, and the required stability margin. As long as the proposed impedance specifications are met, the whole system must be stable and has sufficient stability margin. Finally, the case studies and experiments validate the proposed impedance specifications.</description></item><item><title>Power Balancing Strategy for Cascaded H-Bridge Inverter in a Grid-Connected Photovoltaic System Under Asymmetrical Operating Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10183673</link><description>Cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverter is a well-established technology for photovoltaic systems. Power imbalance occurs in the system because of the environmental dependence of photovoltaic modules, damage and dusting of panels, and the ageing effect. Subsequently, the power handled by H-bridge modules is unequal. As a result of power imbalance, the H-bridge modules carrying higher power are likely to get overmodulated, increasing the distortion in grid current. Due to this, reliability of the system is affected. The ability of existing harmonic compensation techniques to counter this issue is limited to a modulation index of $4/\pi$. In the view of this adversity, a voltage alteration method along with an optimization algorithm is proposed in this article to alleviate the power imbalance issue. The presented simulation and experimental results validate the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Design and Implementation of an Interleaved High Efficiency and High Voltage Gain Converter With Minimum Switch Count for Renewable Energy Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10173751</link><description>This article proposes a new nonisolated, interleaved, high step-up, soft-switching converter for renewable energy applications. The proposed converter is a boost topology designed to have a continuous input current with low ripple.

Using the proposed structure of the components to form the SDLCN, the converters A and B have continuous input current, better efficiency due to lower voltage and current stress, and minimum component count compared to some of the conventional dc&#8211;dc converters. To analyze the controllability of these converters, a switched linear system model is developed for the proposed converters. For better accuracy, the effect of parasitic elements is considered in the model. The controllability is validated by experiments on a 380 V, 50 kHz, and 200 W laboratory prototype. From the switched linear system model, a small-signal model and nominal transfer functions are obtained, and validated experimentally. Using the stability boundary locus technique and Kharitonov's first method, the PI controllers are designed. This technique selects a resilient performance zone for closed-loop converter operation by considering source and load-side disturbances. The developed PI controllers are implemented in the Xilinx System Generator and the closed-loop performance is validated experimentally.</description></item><item><title>Current-Referencing Electrified Synchronous Machine to Emulate a Synchronous Machine via a Voltage-Source Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10203000</link><description>The gradual decrease of the grid inertia in contemporary power grids is one of the significant problems caused by the expansion of renewable energy sources. As the inertia provided by the kinetic energy in the rotating mass of conventional fossil fuel-based synchronous generator decreases, the stability of the grid frequency deteriorates. Virtual synchronous machines (VSMs) that emulate the properties of a conventional synchronous machine through voltage-source inverters have gained attention as a solution to support the grid frequency. In this study, a current-referencing electrified synchronous machine (CURESYM) is proposed as a new control method that allows an inverter to have properties of a conventional synchronous machine. The CURESYM supports grid frequency through the inertial and damping responses. In addition, the CURESYM regulates the current in the synchronous reference frame according to the intended transient response, which is separately determined from the inertial and damping responses. A droop control was also implemented via current references independent of the damping response. The performance of the CURESYM is verified through experiments. Furthermore, the advantages of the CURESYM are examined by comparing with existing VSM topologies.</description></item><item><title>s-Domain Model of Single-Sampling and Multisampling DPWM DC&#8211;DC Converter Based on Discrete-Time Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10163961</link><description>This article proposes a general s-domain model of the single-sampling and multisampling digital pulsewidth modulation (DPWM) dc&#8211;dc converter. The proposed model has two main characteristics. First, the PWM delay is modeled by both time delay and state feedback rather than the time delay only. The time delay and state feedback are decided by the type of converters and carriers together. Therefore, the proposed model can explain the different effects of the PWM delay in different converters and carriers. Then, the time delay in the proposed model is decided by the switching frequency rather than the sampling frequency. Therefore, the multisampling cannot reduce the time delay of DPWM, which introduces ripples instead. For different converters and carriers, the influence of the ripple is varying. Therefore, based on the proposed model, the multisampling does not always improve the stability of converters, which is more in line with the actual situation. Compared with existing models, the proposed model reflects the complex effects of the PWM delay more accurately. To demonstrate these advantages intuitively, the stability of basic converters is judged by the proposed method, whose results are compared with existing models and experiment results.</description></item><item><title>Observer-Based Variable Impedance Control Using Moving Horizon Estimation for Robot Machining Thin-Walled Workpieces</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10188400</link><description>Adaptability is one of the most important survival and living abilities in nature and human society, which needs to perceive the environment and regulate self-behaviors.

No insect-scale jumping robots have yet demonstrated accurate trajectory following. Here, we propose a miniature origami omnidirectional jumping robot (Moobot) capable of high-accuracy feedback control of its jumping trajectory. The robot is based on a four-bar origami structure and shape memory alloys. Two strain gauges and an inertial measurement unit were used to control the jumping force and takeoff angle, respectively, and a reliable jumping mechanism and novel supporting leg were designed to improve jumping stability and trajectory accuracy. Unlike typical externally powered miniature robots, we constructed a 5 cm, 6 g untethered prototype. The error and the standard deviation of the jumping distances were both less than 1.5 cm; this represents a significant improvement relative to all previous insect-scale jumping robots. Furthermore, we integrated the yaw control and conducted omnidirectional jumping experiments, showing that Moobot was capable of accurately traversing different platforms from all directions.</description></item><item><title>An Energy-Based Anisotropic Vector Hysteresis Model for Rotational Electromagnetic Core Loss</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10188384</link><description>In this article, a model that describes the anisotropic behavior and core loss of electrical steel sheets over a wide range of rotational excitation is developed. Based on the definition of the effective field, the macroscopic anisotropy field is deduced from a weighted average of the magnetocrystalline energy of a single crystal. An anisotropic vector hysteresis model is then proposed by applying the effective field to the energy-based model. Experimental measurements are used to fit and validate the model. Either alternating or rotational measurements with a maximum magnetic flux density 1.55 T under 10 Hz are employed to fit the model parameters and the remaining set of measurements is used for validating the model accuracy. The results show that the model can naturally account for the drop in the rotational losses at high flux densities regardless of whether it is identified from alternating or rotational measurement data. The generality of the model is demonstrated through continuous angle results and modeling of another material.</description></item><item><title>Modulated FCS-MPC Based on Zero-Sequence Component Injection Algorithm and Vector Synthesis Algorithm With NPP Deviation Suppression</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10191041</link><description>Conventional finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) for three-phase three-level (3P-3L) converters suffers from cumbersome weighting factor design, variable switching frequency, and performance compromise in neutral point potential (NPP) and current.

However, influenced by noise and mutation information, vibration-based prediction methods remain in the preliminary phase for precise prediction of power transformer. To address this issue, a contrastive adversarial sparse model is proposed to predict the progress of power transformer faults in the early phases. First, a sparse transformer improves the feature extraction ability of the bidirectional recurrent gated network to reduce noise and extracts significant information from original signal. Then, the mutation information is suppressed by a contrastive adversarial method, based on which discrimination layer predicts the power transformer fault. Finally, to constrain the network, a contrastive loss based on feature matching is proposed to learn more extra information distinct from sparse transforms. Datasets are collected using wireless vibration sensors from a 10-kV real power transformer. Under an identical parameter setting, experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms comparison algorithms in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient, symmetric mean absolute percentage error, and mean absolute error. Especially, the RMSE of the proposed model is 0.0242, exceeding the performance of the conventional model in power transformer fault prediction.</description></item><item><title>Leak Detection for Natural Gas Gathering Pipelines Under Multiple Operating Conditions Using RP-1dConvLSTM-AE and Multimodel Decision</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10190156</link><description>Real-time leak detection for natural gas gathering pipelines is critical to guarantee the safe transportation of energy in the source of production. Since leak samples are scarce in real pipelines, modeling healthy data becomes one of the mainstream solutions. However, due to the lack of prior knowledge of leaks, more effective feature learning for multivariate time series (MTS) of pipeline data is a prerequisite for reliable leak detection. Moreover, in-service gathering pipelines usually involve multiple operating conditions (MOCs), where the leak characteristics of MOCs could be significantly different. This poses a serious challenge to accurate leak detection. To address the abovementioned problems, we propose a hybrid leak detection method for gathering pipelines under MOCs. First, anomaly processing and long&#8211;short sequence construction are designed to provide high-quality data for leak detection. Then, reconstruction- and prediction-one-dimensional convolutional long short-term memory autoencoder is proposed to enhance the feature learning for MTS. Based on the learned features, a multimodel decision scheme with one-class support vector machine is developed to deal with leak detection under MOCs. Finally, experimental results on supervisory control and data acquisition data obtained from real-world natural gas gathering pipelines demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Combined Model-Based and Data-Driven Fault Diagnosis Scheme for Lithium-Ion Batteries</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10203013</link><description>Diagnosing potential faults is of great importance to ensure reliability of battery management systems. This is because a current or voltage sensor fault often results in an inaccurate state-of-charge estimate. A temperature sensor fault will cause abnormal thermal management. A battery internal resistance (BIR) fault can lead to an increase in energy and power losses, capacity fading, and further degradation of health. In addition, frequent data transmission to fault diagnosis unit will cause a great waste of communication resources. To this end, a combined model-based and data-driven fault diagnosis scheme for lithium-ion batteries is proposed in this article. First, a model-based fault estimation method with sliding mode observer is developed to estimate the voltage, current, and temperature sensor faults. By integrating an adaptive event-triggered mechanism, the communication resource costs are alleviated. Second, a data-driven gap metric approach is presented to detect the BIR fault. By combining the model-based and data-driven strategies, the fault diagnosis logic is put forward to isolate the BIR fault.

However, most studies on securing CPPS rarely considered resource constraints, resulting in the unsatisfactory performance of security solutions in practical applications. To gain insight into attack behavior in realistic scenarios, this article fully develops the concept of load redistribution (LR) attacks and designs an intelligent version that considers both concealment property and resource limitation. Then, aiming to develop an effective countermeasure, this article provides a novel attack detection method based on power load pattern learning, which consists of a power load predictor and subsequent attack detector, to determine the existence of intelligent LR attacks. Specifically, a multichannel power load predictor based on the SARIMAX model is proposed to capture both temporal and spatial correlations of power load data for accurate prediction. Using augmented features, a dictionary-learning-based attack detector that can handle the class imbalance problem by unsupervised learning is capable to detect the intelligent LR attacks. Finally, experiments on numerical simulation and the CPPS-HITL platform are conducted to verify the effectiveness and practical availability of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive-Optimization-Based Digital Simulation Database for Nonuniform Aging Diagnosis of Transformer Insulation System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10196011</link><description>The trend toward intellectualization is pervasive in the field of power equipment fault diagnosis. However, due to the sample database's limitations, intelligent diagnosis of transformer insulation aging states near the internal hotspot regions remains a challenge. To address this issue, an optimization-design-based simulation model is proposed for the development of a frequency domain spectroscopy (FDS) database for diagnosing nonuniform aging states of power transformer. The simulation model is developed in the current work using distributed relaxation circuits and fast Fourier transforms, and the electric parameters used are identified using adaptive iteration particle swarm optimization. Finally, verification established that the extended simulation model was capable of simulating the FDS of a system with nonuniformly assigned aging states. In this regard, the contribution will aid in the establishment of a trustworthy FDS database for the purpose of advancing intelligent diagnosis of the aging state of transformer oil&#8211;paper insulation at hotspots.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Multiband Rectifier System for Stabilized Wireless Energy Harvesting at Flexible Distances and Dynamic Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10209271</link><description>The unpredictable propagation of ambient radio frequency (RF) waves may cause significant randomness in power densities against the propagation distance, time, and locations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel adaptive rectifier system with stabilized output dc power against dynamic power densities. A novel detection circuit is designed to identify the frequency range and receiving power level. Then the received RF power is amplified to the saturated level by referring to the detected frequency and power information for adaptive dc biasing control for an integrated power amplifier. Doing so makes the input power to the rectifier constant regardless of the power and frequency variations. The experimentally validated system can output a stabilized power under the time-varying power range of &#8722;10 to 0 dBm and location varying within 0.5 m at 1.8, 2.1, and 2.6 GHz. Compared with conventional designs, this system has realized stabilized and enhanced conversion efficiency (61% at 1.8 GHz, 64% at 2.1 GHz, and 53% at 2.6 GHz) and therefore could be adopted for wireless powering distributed sensors and Internet of Thing (IoT) devices continuously and steadily at flexible conditions.</description></item><item><title>Mitigating the Impact of Photovoltaic Power Ramps on Intraday Economic Dispatch Using Reinforcement Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10080978</link><description>The rapid growth of large-scale photovoltaic (PV) power generation has received considerable attention, where a major challenge is that PV power ramp events can adversely affect the operations of integrated power systems. Therefore, effective forecast and dispatch methodologies are critical. However, it is relatively difficult to predict an accurate PV power ramp rate. Another issue is that, since forecast and dispatch are typically considered in research as two separate problems, forecast modeling does not involve the knowledge of dispatch. In this case, unbiased PV forecast is unpractical for PV ramp events, increasing their negative effects. Besides, such a unified optimization with both forecast and dispatch cannot be solved easily since the problem is strongly nonlinear. Motivated by these challenges, a reinforcement forecasting framework is proposed for intraday economic dispatch in this study. First, the PV power ramp rate forecasting is categorized into two tasks of multi-classification and class expectation prediction, where the class continuity is considered in order to improve the forecast distribution. Next, a reinforcement learning agent is established for connecting PV forecast and system dispatch, which adjusts PV power generation schedules based on real-time system feedbacks. Comparative studies are conducted on an intraday system dispatch environment with energy storage. The results of the studies indicate that the proposed framework can provide higher economic benefits than those under benchmark schemes.</description></item><item><title>Hardware in the Loop Wave Energy Converter Control Under Control Faults and Model Mismatch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122770</link><description>Ocean wave energy conversion is operated in a challenging environment featuring massive and impulsive stresses and is subjected to large amounts of biofouling and marine growth. As most wave energy converter technologies are off-shore, operation, maintenance, and repair costs may be significant. Therefore, any cost-effective control and operation of Wave Energy Converters (WECs) must be robust to faults and changes in the operational environment. This paper presents a Bayesian policy gradient-based WEC control approach that is responsive and adaptive to faults in controller feedback, controller actuation, and changes in the plant model. The controller is tested via Hardware in the Loop real-time testbed. The results show that the proposed control is capable of adapting its policy to the loss of information from one or two sensors and recovering nearly full power operation. In the case where sensor loss occurs, after the loss of plate excitation force estimation and displacement sensors, the power decreases to 215.2 kW from 252.7 kW before recovering to 238.4 kW mean power over 20 minutes. Moreover, the Bayesian RL-based control model proves its adaptability by compensating a large portion of power loss due to PTO failures and rapid changes to the dynamic system because of non-destructive damage to the float structure.</description></item><item><title>Grid Forming Fast Frequency Response for PMSG-Based Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10091242</link><description>Electric power systems are undergoing a rapid transition from fuel-based generation using synchronous generators to renewable generation interfaced by power electronics. In this context, a key challenge is using renewable generation with limited controllability to contribute to power system stability. In this work, we investigate grid-forming control of permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) wind turbines. The proposed control and curtailment strategy supports the entire spectrum of standard functions of grid-following (e.g. maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and grid-forming control (e.g., primary frequency control) without explicit mode switching. A detailed case study is used to compare the performance of the proposed control at operating points corresponding to MPPT and frequency control with standard grid-forming and grid-following controls. The results demonstrate that (i) the proposed energy balancing grid forming control is self-synchronizing in MPPT mode, (ii) the (limited) energy storage and controllability of wind turbines can be adequately utilized to provide grid support, and (ii) the proposed control exhibits good performance under variable wind speeds and does not result in a significant increase of wind turbine fatigue loads.</description></item><item><title>A Coordinated Optimal Operation of a Grid-Connected Wind-Solar Microgrid Incorporating Hybrid Energy Storage Management Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10089547</link><description>The hybrid-energy storage systems (ESSs) are promising eco-friendly power converter devices used in a wide range of applications. However, their insufficient lifespan is one of the key issues by hindering their large-scale commercial application. In order to extend the lifespan of the hybrid-ESSs, the cost functions proposed in this paper include the degradation of the hydrogen devices and the battery. Indeed, this paper aims to develop a sophisticated model predictive control strategy for a grid-connected wind and solar microgrid, which includes a hydrogen-ESS, a battery-ESS, and the interaction with external consumers, e.g., battery/fuel cell electric vehicles. The integrated system requires the management of its energy production in different forms, i.e., the electric and the hydrogen ones. The proposed strategy consists of the economical and operating costs of the hybrid-ESSs, the degradation issues, and the physical and dynamic constraints of the system. The mixed-logic dynamic framework is required to model the operating modes of the hybrid-ESSs and the switches between them. The effectiveness of the controller is analyzed by numerical simulations which are conducted using solar and wind generation profiles of solar panels and wind farms located in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Such simulations, indeed, show that the proposed strategy appropriately manages the plant by fulfilling constraints and energy requests while reducing device costs and increasing battery life.</description></item><item><title>Probabilistic Prognosis of Wind Turbine Faults With Feature Selection and Confidence Calibration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10114598</link><description>With the ever-increasing expansion of the installed capacity of wind power generation, reliable condition monitoring for wind turbines (WTs) has become increasingly important. To this end, this paper proposes a probabilistic WT fault prognosis (WTFP) scheme to output reliable fault probabilities in addition to class predictions. First, a multivariate time series (MTS) based mutual information estimator (MIE) is developed to integrate with combinational optimization, selecting features that contain more beneficial temporal data patterns for WTFP. Then, a multi-fault prognosis model for WTs is trained based on the selected features and MTS learning network. Next, a confidence calibration (CC) post-processing module is appended to re-construct the mapping relation between network logits and posterior probabilities by minimizing negative log-likelihood, thereby calibrating confidence estimates to approximate the true correctness likelihood as much as possible while keeping the high accuracy of the trained MTS learning network. These components finally drive a comprehensive WTFP model. Test results on the field data of WT verify the efficacy of MTS-based MIE and CC, and show that the proposed probabilistic WTFP scheme can provide more reliable probability estimates, contributing to better decision-making.</description></item><item><title>On Power Control of Grid-Forming Converters: Modeling, Controllability, and Full-State Feedback Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10111054</link><description>The popular single-input single-output control structures and classic design methods (e.g., root locus analysis) for the power control of grid-forming converters have limitations in applying to different line characteristics and providing favorable performance. This paper studies the grid-forming converter power loops from the perspective of multi-input multi-output systems. First, the error dynamics associated with power control loops (error-based state-space model) are derived while taking into account the natural dynamical coupling terms of the power converter models. Thereafter, the controllability Gramian of the grid-forming converter power loops is studied. Last, a full-state feedback control design using only the local measurements is applied. By this way, the eigenvalues of the system can be arbitrarily placed in the timescale of power loops based on predefined time-domain specifications. A step-by-step construction and design procedure of the power control of grid-forming converters is also given. The analysis and proposed method are verified by experimental results and system-level simulation comparisons in Matlab/Simulink.</description></item><item><title>Incentivizing Prosumer Voltage Regulation for Unbalanced Radial Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10121692</link><description>Voltage regulation in distribution networks is becoming extremely challenging with the increased penetration of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) generation. Many recent studies demonstrate the effectiveness of power control of smart inverters for voltage regulation purposes. However, how to fully incentivize demand-side participation in voltage regulation is yet to be answered. This article seeks to address this challenge by designing a comprehensive voltage regulation incentive scheme for customers to control their smart inverters in unbalanced radial distribution networks. A three-phase residential network from a Distributed Network Service Provider (DNSP) in Australia is modelled in the open-source distribution system simulator OpenDSS with real load and PV data, and an control algorithm to optimize the households' smart inverters in a distributed fashion is developed using game theory. The proposed algorithm is implemented in MATLAB, which is guaranteed to approach the optimal solution. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves better voltage regulation performance as the widely adopted localized voltage-var droop control method and, at the same time, with lower costs to the prosumers.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Carbon Footprint Management of Electric Vehicles and Emission Abatement in Electricity Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122732</link><description>Electric vehicles (EVs) are believed to play an important role in mitigating carbon emissions in the transportation sector. However, EVs may still cause carbon emissions in the power sector if they are charged by electricity generated from burning fossil fuels like coal. Researchers have focused on managing emissions on the power generation sector. However, the underlying driver of carbon emissions is the demand of consumers. Given this background, a probabilistic carbon footprint management strategy is proposed for EVs in this paper. First, the conventional deterministic carbon emission flow model is extended to a probabilistic one (PCEF) to track the carbon footprint of EVs considering various kinds of uncertainties based on non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) and the two-point estimation method (2PEM). Second, a stochastic chance-constrained carbon footprint management model for EV charging is presented to address the carbon obligation allocation of EVs from the perspective of consumption and provide a technical basis for demand-driven stimulation to reduce carbon emissions. Third, an efficient method is proposed to solve the formulated chance-constrained problem based on nonparametric Bayesian modeling and inference. The proposed model and method are demonstrated by the IEEE 39-bus power system. The feasibility of the proposed PCEF model is validated. According to simulation results, the computation speed of the proposed PCEF model is enhanced from 3456.8 seconds to 1341.3 seconds compared with the Monte Carlo simulation by sacrificing the accuracy within 2%. Besides, the proposed emission control strategy can attain a better emission control performance compared with the other state-of-art methods.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Modeling of Microgrid Transient Dynamics Through Modularized Sparse Identification</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10115474</link><description>Modularized sparse identification (M-SINDy) is developed in this paper for effective data-driven modeling of the nonlinear transient dynamics of microgrid systems. The high penetration of power-electronic interfaces makes microgrids highly susceptible to disturbances, causing severe transients, especially in the islanded mode. The M-SINDy method realizes distributed discovery of nonlinear dynamics by partitioning a higher-order microgrid system into multiple subsystems and introducing pseudo-states to represent the impact of neighboring subsystems. This specific property of the proposed algorithm is found to be very useful while working with re-configurable and scalable microgrids. The governing equations of the subsystems are identified through regression by mapping the nonlinear system's data to a linear system in a large functional space. The effectiveness of the M-SINDy method is tested and validated through numerical examples and comparisons with other existing identification models on a typical islanded microgrid. The method can simultaneously compute the governing equations of different subsystems and is examined to be robust to measurement noises and partial observations. This paper highlights the advances of data science in providing a potent tool for modeling and analyzing higher-order nonlinear microgrid systems. Dynamic discovery of system transients from measurements can be beneficial for designing control strategies that improve the overall microgrid stability and reliability.</description></item><item><title>Encoding Carbon Emission Flow in Energy Management: A Compact Constraint Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122721</link><description>Decarbonizing the energy supply is essential and urgent to mitigate the increasingly visible climate change. Its basis is identifying emission responsibility during power allocation by the carbon emission flow (CEF) model. However, the main challenge of CEF application is the intractable nonlinear relationship between carbon emission and power allocation. So this article leverages the high approximation capability and the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) representability of the deep neural networks to tackle the complex CEF model in carbon-electricity coordinated optimization. The compact constraint learning approach is proposed to learn the mapping from power injection to bus emission with sparse neural networks (SNNs). Then the trained SNNs are transformed equivalently as MILP constraints in the downstream optimization. In light of the &#8220;high emission with high price&#8221; principle, the blocked carbon price mechanism is designed to price emissions from the demand side. Based on the constraint learning and mechanism design, this article proposes the carbon-aware energy management model in the tractable MILP form to unlock the carbon reduction potential from the demand side. The case study verifies the approximation accuracy and sparsity of SNN with fewer parameters for accelerating optimization solution and reduction effectiveness of demand-side capability for mitigating emission.</description></item><item><title>An Improved PSO-Based MPPT Technique Using Stability and Steady State Analyses Under Partial Shading Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122737</link><description>Partial shading (PS) conditions create challenging issues for the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms in photovoltaic (PV) systems such as getting stuck in the local maximum power points (LMPP), slow tracking time and fluctuations in the generated power during tracking the global maximum power point (GMPP). To address these issues, this article brings contributions by proposing an improved PSO-based MPPT technique tailored for PS conditions. First, to highlight the weakness of the traditional PSO-MPPT technique, its stability and steady state behavior in the PS conditions is analyzed in depth. Second, the required criteria to achieve a stable response are obtained. Finally, a novel technique to estimate the convex area of the power versus voltage (P-V) curve is presented where the GMPP is located using two voltage boundaries. The performance of the proposed MPPT technique is experimentally validated. The results highlight the capabilities of the proposed technique in finding the GMPP with a rapid convergence and small fluctuations. The proposed MPPT is applicable to most PV inverters under any PS conditions.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Dimensional Economy-Durability Optimization Method for Integrated Energy and Transportation System of Net-Zero Energy Buildings</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10123098</link><description>With the increasing penetration of renewable energy and zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), the integrated energy and transportation system (IETS) is considered a promising solution for achieving net-zero energy buildings (NZEBs). However, the tight coupling and the conflict of interests between the transportation and energy systems increase the difficulty of collaborative operation scheduling. Therefore, this article proposes a multi-dimensional economy-durability (MDED) optimization method for IETS of NZEBs. The multidimensionality includes multiple subjects of energy, transportation, and IETS, and multiple time scales of day-ahead and intraday. In the day-ahead stage, the comprehensive cost-optimal scheduling strategy with joint intelligent parking lot (IPL) is constructed for the collaborative operation of IETS. In the intraday stage, two scheduling strategies are applied to satisfy the operation of the transportation and energy systems, respectively. For the transportation system, a coordinated scheduling strategy based on charging service satisfaction (CSS) is presented to coordinate ZEVs demands with diverse vehicle types and service manners. And for the energy system, a rolling optimization strategy based on a dynamic economy-health matrix (DEHM) is designed to track the day-ahead scheduling plan. The results indicate that the proposed method resolves the conflict between the charging needs and the comprehensive cost of the IETS system. In addition, the economic potential and coordination capability of fast charging services in IETS coordinated scheduling are verified. Finally, the proposed DEHM has significant advantages for the system cost and health compared to the conventional weighting matrix.</description></item><item><title>An Analytical Polytope Approximation Aggregation of Electric Vehicles Considering Uncertainty for the Day-Ahead Distribution Network Dispatching</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10124003</link><description>The integration of large-scale heterogeneous electric vehicles (EVs) into the distribution network increases the system management complexity significantly. Due to the flexible charging/discharging operation and shiftable energy consumption during the parking time, EVs possess a great dispatching potential for the distribution network. This article develops an analytical polytope approximation (APA) aggregation model to efficiently depict the dispatchable regions of large-scale EVs with uncertainties and proposes a bilevel cooperative optimization approach for EV aggregators to participate in the distribution network day-ahead optimal scheduling. Uncertainties of EVs are modeled by chance constraints with different confidence levels to accommodate various regulatory requirements. The proposed approach can obtain large-scale EVs dispatchable capabilities with minimum flexibility loss and realize the regulation command disaggregation without violations. Numerical case studies are conducted on IEEE 33-bus and 141-bus distribution networks based on real data sets, which show that the proposed approach outperforms other state-of-art methods in terms of low operation flexibility conservatism, high system economics, and computational efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Allocation of Dynamic Operating Envelopes in Distribution Networks: Technical and Equitable Perspectives</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10123018</link><description>A Dynamic Operating Envelope (DOE) specifies the available capacity to import/export power for Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) or connection points of a distribution network in a time interval without violating its physical and operational constraints. This article proposes a two-stage, top-down approach to allocate DOEs in MV-LV (medium voltage-low voltage) integrated distribution networks. In the first stage, Distribution System State Estimation (DSSE) and Capacity Constrained State Optimisation (CCSO) techniques are employed to allocate DOEs at transformer connection points. Using network data from available metering infrastructure, DSSE estimates the current operational state of the network, whereas CCSO facilitates the DOE allocations at transformer connection points considering technical, soft-equitable and equitable perspectives. In the second stage, the allocated DOEs, containing available aggregate export/import power, are distributed among DERs of LV networks ensuring network integrity. Real-world data of an Australian MV-LV network is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approach. Test results show that technical perspective can offer maximum allocated export/import power, whereas, minimum disparity of allocated power among different connection-points is attained for equitable perspective. Further, insightful performance studies of DOE and existing fixed export policies are conducted considering the condition of present as well as future power systems expecting substantial proliferations of renewables.</description></item><item><title>Optimal HVAC Energy and Regulation Reserve Scheduling in Power Markets</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10132017</link><description>This paper considers the optimal scheduling of the hourly energy consumed and regulation reserve capacity offered by a Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) system participating in a day-ahead electricity market. We formulate an Integrated hourly energy and regulation reserve Scheduling and Deployment (ISD) problem that optimizes the hourly costs and benefits resulting from the power consumed, the regulation reserve capacity offered, the occupant thermal comfort utility, and the expected Intra-Hour Costs (IHCs) due to HVAC's imperfect tracking of the regulation signal broadcasted by the Independent System Operator every few seconds. Addition of the IHCs to the objective function is the major innovation of this paper. It enables optimal HVAC scheduling to internalize expected regulation signal tracking error cost traded-off against incremental occupant thermal discomfort that may result from perfect tracking. The cost causation circle closes by noting that a high hourly regulation reserve offer may result in higher expected IHCs by increasing the associated tracking error and the incremental occupant discomfort. The paper's innovation is achieved by (i) estimating an analytic function of the hourly HVAC scheduling decision and state variables that approximates the expected IHCs, and (ii) including this exogenously estimated analytic function in the objective of the hourly ISD optimization problem. Non-convexities introduced to the optimization problem resulting from high fidelity HVAC model and the inclusion of the expected IHCs, are addressed efficiently through piecewise convex relaxations that provide tight optimality bounds. Extensive numerical results are provided to demonstrate the applicability and performance of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>A Rule-Based Bionic Energy Management System for Grid-Connected Community Microgrid Using Peer-to-Peer Trading With Rapid Settlement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10129832</link><description>This article applies the bionics theory to the design of energy management system (EMS) for the grid-connected community microgrid. Drawing lessons from the humoral regulation mechanism, a rule-based bionic EMS is proposed for the grid-connected community microgrid, with the aim of keeping the supply-demand level of the system approaching self-sufficiency in real time, so as to reduce the dependence of the community microgrid on the utility grid and improve the local utilization of distributed generations in the community microgrid. To realize the bionic EMS, a novel peer-to-peer trading model with rapid settlement is proposed. Fuzzy control is used to cope with the complex real-time control issue, and the basic principles of the adopted fuzzy controller are to maintain the supply-demand ratio close to 1 and extend battery life. Simulation results demonstrate that the bionic EMS has the ability to keep the real-time supply-demand level of the grid-connected community microgrid approaching self-sufficiency. Compared with the optimization-based EMS, the bionic EMS has excellent real-time performance and good robustness, and does not rely on prediction data. Experimental results on the testbed are consistent with the simulation results and validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the bionic EMS in the practical applications.</description></item><item><title>Target Voltage Iterations Based Global Flexible Power Point Tracking Algorithm Under Partial Shading Photovoltaic Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10144415</link><description>Global flexible power point tracking (GFPPT) is proposed to realize the flexible power point tracking (FPPT) of photovoltaic systems under partial shading conditions (PSC). Because the working process of GFPPT is similar to global power point tracking (GMPPT), the performance of GFPPT can be improved by applying the existing advanced GMPPT algorithm. However, the improvement of GFPPT is limited while applying the existing advanced GMPPT algorithm directly. So, a target-voltage-iterations (TVI) based GFPPT algorithm is proposed in this article to further increase the performance of GFPPT during PSC. Compared with the advanced GFPPT algorithms, the proposed TVI-based GFPPT algorithm shows the advantages of fast-tracking speed and little energy difference during the tracking by skipping the voltage section without the reference power. Followed by theoretical analysis, the simulation and experimental evaluation validate the claimed advantages of the proposed TVI-based GFPPT algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Voltage Control and Renewable Accommodation Using Spatial-Temporal Graph Information</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10143277</link><description>Renewable energy resources (RERs) have been increasingly integrated into distribution networks (DNs) for decarbonization. However, the variable nature of RERs introduces uncertainties to DNs, frequently resulting in voltage fluctuations that threaten system security and hamper the further adoption of RERs. To incentivize more RER penetration, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based strategy to dynamically balance the trade-off between voltage fluctuation control and renewable accommodation. To further extract multi-time-scale spatial-temporal (ST) graphical information of a DN, our strategy draws on a multi-grained attention-based spatial-temporal graph convolution network (MG-ASTGCN), consisting of ST attention mechanism and ST convolution to explore the node correlations in the spatial and temporal views. The continuous decision-making process of balancing such a trade-off can be modeled as a Markov decision process optimized by the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm with the help of the derived ST information. We validate our strategy on the modified IEEE 33, 69, and 118-bus radial distribution systems, with outcomes significantly outperforming the optimization-based benchmarks. Simulations also reveal that our developed MG-ASTGCN can to a great extent accelerate the convergence speed of DDPG and improve its performance in stabilizing node voltage in an RER-rich DN. Moreover, our method improves the DN's robustness in the presence of generator failures.</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid Model for Long-Term Wind Power Forecasting Utilizing NWP Subsequence Correction and Multi-Scale Deep Learning Regression Methods</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10144668</link><description>The accuracy of long-term wind power forecasting (WPF) is crucial for the efficient operation of grid systems. However, wind power generation is highly stochastic and intermittent due to the influence of weather, which makes long-term WPF less effective. Numerical weather prediction (NWP) data contains valuable weather forecast information, which can mitigate the negative effects of stochastic weather fluctuations on WPF. However, the accuracy of NWP data decreases over time, and multiple NWP data can have redundancy and errors that make it challenging to extract valid information. Reducing the variety and errors in NWP data and using more effective information extraction methods are essential for improving long-term WPF performance. In this article, we propose a novel long-term WPF hybrid model that corrects NWP wind speed and uses multi-scale deep learning regression prediction to exclude excessive NWP data. We use only the corrected NWP wind speed data to establish a nonlinear mapping relationship with actual power data. The validation case study shows that our proposed model reduces the mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) by 65.0% and 43.8%, respectively, compared to the current state-of-the-art time series forecasting model in a seven-day forecasting scenario.</description></item><item><title>An Optimal Wind Farm Operation Strategy for the Provision of Frequency Containment Reserve Incorporating Active Wake Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10158926</link><description>This study proposes a novel operation strategy for wind farms' optimal Frequency Containment Reserve (FCR) provision that simultaneously distributes FCR and optimally controls wake formation. The power reserve allocation is dynamically decided at the wind farm supervisory control level, considering the intermittent wind power and direction, grid frequency stochasticity, and the aerodynamic complexity of the wake. A two-stage stochastic programming approach supports decision-making for an optimal contribution to day-ahead energy/FCR markets considering sub-hourly wind power and grid frequency uncertainty. Moreover, a novel method is used to reduce the computational complexity by employing a data-driven surrogate model of wake formation in the optimizer. This surrogate model consists of a neural network trained on the Gauss-Curl-Hybrid wake model in FLORIS. This deep learning approach allows fast estimation of the wake control parameters, i.e., the optimal yaw angles and axial induction factors. Then, a coevolutionary-based multi-objective particle swarm optimization searches for the optimal deloading of the WTs and maximizes the total power production and kinetic energy while minimizing wake. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on the C-Power wind farm layout in the North Sea. Simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the wind farm's overall performance for different operational conditions.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Frequency Regulation of Multi-Terminal HVDC-Linked Grids With Deloaded Offshore Wind Farms Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10145805</link><description>This paper proposes a new decentralized strategy for optimal grid frequency regulation (GFR) in an interconnected power system, where onshore grids and offshore wind farms (OWFs) are linked using a multi-terminal high-voltage direct-current (MTDC) system. In the proposed strategy, grid- and OWF-side optimal controllers are developed to coordinate the operations of synchronous generators and the MTDC converter, and the OWF and the MTDC converter, respectively, thus achieving optimal generator power and deloaded OWF power sharing of the interconnected grids and minimizing frequency deviations in each grid. Full-order dynamic models of an MTDC-linked grid and an OWF are implemented, and given each dynamic model, grid- and OWF-side decentralized linear quadratic Gaussian regulators are designed for optimal GFR of the MTDC-linked grids and supporting GFR through optimal deloading operation of the OWFs, respectively. Eigenvalue analyses are conducted with a focus on the effects of system parameter uncertainties and communication time delays. Comparative case studies are also performed to verify that the proposed strategy improves the effectiveness and stability of real-time GFR in MTDC-linked grids under various conditions.</description></item><item><title>A Coordinated Consensus Control Strategy for Distributed Battery Energy Storages Considering Different Frequency Control Demands</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10146450</link><description>With the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs), ensuring frequency stability is becoming urgent for the power system. The distributed battery energy storage systems (DBESs) is one of the promising solutions to this problem. In this paper, a consensus control-based strategy is proposed for coordinating the DBESs to participate in the frequency regulation. Firstly, the system frequency response (SFR) model with the DBESs is introduced, and different frequency control demands are analyzed in detail, based on which the designing principles of the strategy are elaborated. Then, a revised dead band of frequency response is proposed to improve the frequency control performance under severer and more frequent RESs power fluctuation, reduce the possibility of frequency variation crossing the thresholds, and fully utilizes the DBESs&#8217; frequency regulation capability. Further, a developed consensus strategy derived from droop control is proposed, which enables the DBESs to participate in different frequency control demands simultaneously. The proposed strategy can prolong the service time when DBESs involved in frequency control as an aggregator, avoid unexpected energy exhaustion during frequency regulation, and reduce the frequency variation. The performance of the proposed control strategy is validated by the simulation cases with different operating scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Physics-Aware Degradation Model of Lithium-ion Battery Energy Storage for Techno-Economic Studies in Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10154547</link><description>Power system operation and planning decisions for lithium-ion battery energy storage systems are mainly derived using their simplified linear models. While these models are computationally simple, they have limitations in how they estimate battery degradation, either using the energy throughput or the Rainflow method. This article proposes a hybrid approach for lithium-ion battery system modeling suitable for use in power system studies that enhances representation of battery degradation at a reasonable computational cost. The proposed hybrid model combines a physics-based model for improved degradation estimates with a simple and linear energy reservoir model commonly used to represent a battery storage system. The advantage of constructing the battery model with this vision is that it allows its smooth integration into the mixed-integer optimization frameworks. The proposed model is evaluated using both power- and energy-based use cases from the electrical grid. The simulations demonstrate that degradation could be reduced by 45% compared to other modeling strategies while generating the same level of operation profits. The net result of using the proposed hybrid model could be an extended lifespan through better informed planning and operating decisions for energy storage assets.</description></item><item><title>A Novel ANN-Based GMPPT Method for PV Systems Under Complex Partial Shading Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10148801</link><description>In this article, a new two-stage global maximum power point tracking (GMPPT) algorithm based on artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed. The novel ANN architecture is presented first, which requires fewer sampling points than other ANN-based GMPPT approaches, thereby reducing both the tracking time and power loss involved in the tracking. In addition, it does not require costly illuminance or temperature sensors and can be realized using a low-cost digital signal controller. According to the simulation results, the proposed method has the best performance among all methods in terms of tracking speed, tracking accuracy, and tracking loss for all the three tested shading patterns (SPs). The simulated results of 252 SPs show that the performance indexes (PIs) of the proposed method are the best among all the compared methods, which are: the average tracking time 0.18 seconds, average power loss 0.01 W. In addition, the proposed method can correctly predict the GMPP positions of all 252 SPs. Furthermore, the PIs of the proposed method are also the best among all the compared methods according to the experimental results, which are: the tracking speed 0.21 seconds, tracking accuracy 99.66%, and tracking loss 12.58 W, all the above are average values.</description></item><item><title>Frequency Reserve Allocation of Large-Scale RES Considering Decision-Dependent Uncertainties</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10147366</link><description>The proliferation of renewable energy sources (RES) imposes significant challenges on system frequency dynamics. By synthetic inertia and droop control, RES units can provide fast response to sudden frequency events. However, the reserved power and available power of RES units are featured as decision-dependent uncertainties (DDUs), posing challenges to both post-contingency frequency security and system balancing under normal conditions. This article develops a frequency-constrained unit commitment and reserve allocation (FC-UC&amp;amp;RA) model that co-optimizes the reserve allocation and energy dispatch among synchronous generators and RES units. An analytic frequency dynamic model is embedded in the FC-UC&amp;amp;RA problem to accurately assess the system's frequency performance under heterogeneous responses of synchronous and inverter-based units with limited reserve deliveries. To cope with the DDUs stemming from RES generation capabilities scheduled as reserves, a robust FC-UC&amp;amp;RA model is proposed and an adaptive column and constraint generation (C&amp;amp;CG) algorithm is developed to solve the DDU-integrated robust optimization. Comparative case studies verify the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed model and solution approach.</description></item><item><title>Data-Based Control Synthesis and Performance Assessment for Moored Wave Energy Conversion Systems: The PeWEC Case</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10149212</link><description>With a model-based control strategy, the effectiveness of the associated control action depends on the availability of a representative control-oriented model. In the case of floating offshore wave energy converters (WECs), the device response depends upon the interaction between mooring system, any mechanical parts, and the hydrodynamics of the floating body. This study proposes an approach to synthesise WEC controllers under the effect of mooring forces building a representative data-based linear model able to include any relevant dynamics. Moreover, the procedure is tested on the moored pendulum wave energy converter (PeWEC) by means of a high-fidelity mooring solver, OrcaFlex (OF). In particular, the control action is computed with and without knowledge of the mooring influence, in order to analyse and elucidate the effect of the station-keeping system on the harvested energy. The performance assessment of the device is achieved by evaluating device power on the resource scatter characterising Pantelleria, Italy. The results show the relevance of the mooring dynamics on the device response and final set of control parameters and, hence, a significant influence of the station-keeping system on control synthesis and extracted mechanical power.</description></item><item><title>Coordinated Power Smoothing Control Strategy of Multi-Wind Turbines and Energy Storage Systems in Wind Farm Based on MADRL</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10158038</link><description>The randomness and volatility of wind power greatly affect the safety and economy of the power systems, and the wake effect of the wind farm aggravates the wind energy loss and the wind power fluctuation. Taking into consideration the wake effect of the wind farm, a new coordinated wind power smoothing control strategy for multi-wind turbines (M-WT) and energy storage systems (ESS) is proposed. The proposed method is based on a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL), in which the relationship between output power and wake effect is firstly analyzed, and a power smoothing control model of the M-WT and ESS is established. MADRL is then introduced to optimize the power control of M-WT and ESS. In order to further increase the learning and training efficiency, an improved MADRL algorithm based on the partitioned experience buffer and prioritized experience replay is proposed, where the experience buffer is divided into positive, negative, and neutral experiences, and the experiences are sampled according to experience priority. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified on the SimWindFarm platform. The results show that the proposed control strategy can maximize the economic benefits while further smoothing wind power fluctuations and increasing power generation.</description></item><item><title>Local Energy Market Design for Power- and Hydrogen-Based Microgrids Considering a Hybrid Uncertainty Controlling Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10159501</link><description>Despite the significant merits of plugin electric vehicles (PEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), their enormous rise has posed serious challenges in terms of energy supply. This research proposes a sustainable energy platform to integrate PEVs and FCEVs under the concept of microgrid (MG) with power and green hydrogen as energy carriers, so-called integrated power, and hydrogen MG (IPHMG). In addition, a decentralized market clearing model is developed to enable the nearby IPHMG to interact in a local energy market (LEM). The LEM is run by a central manager for both power and hydrogen. To do so, the mobile edge computing (MEC) system is proposed to move the computation from a central cloud server to decentralized edge servers, causing to reducing the computational burden and increasing data security and privacy. Moreover, the fast alternating direction method of multipliers (fast-ADMM) is employed to decompose the problem. Further, this work advances the state-of-the-art in uncertainty management by introducing a tri-level uncertainty controlling approach to fully consider the uncertain parameters. According to the obtained results, the community of IPHMGs could reduce 5.86% of total cost by trading energy in the LEM and the presented hybrid uncertainty management model could protect the community against uncertainties by reducing the total cost by 8.08%.</description></item><item><title>Stochastic Planning for Power Distribution System Resilience Enhancement Against Earthquakes Considering Mobile Energy Resources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10184456</link><description>Earthquakes, which are high-impact low-probability extreme events, can cause severe damage to electrical infrastructure. This article studies the stochastic planning of resilient power distribution systems (PDSs) against earthquakes. Specifically, the portfolio of resilient measures including hardening distribution lines (DLs), and investing Mobile Emergency Generators (MEGs) and Mobile Energy Storage Systems (MESSs) are investigated in a stochastic environment. A stochastic spatial seismic damage model is developed to geographically characterize the random damages of earthquakes. Based on the stochastic model, the PDS planning problem is formulated as a risk-averse two-stage stochastic bi-level programming problem. The upper-level minimizes the total investment cost and the expected interruption cost. The lower-level minimizes the expected loss of load through MEG and MESS coordination, including co-allocation and energy exchange. To solve this problem, a scenario aggregation method based on graph theory and community detection is proposed to reduce the size of scenario set, and an endogenous uncertainty relaxation method is developed to address the DL hardening decision-dependent uncertainty. Then, the PDS planning problem with minmax form is reformulated into a standard bi-level programming problem with minmin form. A decomposition method is also proposed to break up the problem into two separate sub-problems to speed up the computation. The effectiveness of the proposed PDS planning strategy against earthquakes is evaluated through case studies based on the IEEE 37-Node Test Feeder and the IEEE 123-Node Test Feeder.</description></item><item><title>Distribution Network Planning Towards a Low-Carbon Transition: A Spatial-Temporal Carbon Response Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10179921</link><description>Recently, the ambitious targets of emission reduction worldwide have triggered a new trend to focus on low-carbon planning in not only the transmission networks but also the demand-side distribution networks. The existing planning approaches aim to effectively obtain a trade-off solution between emission reduction targets and system economic benefits. In this article, the distribution system planning method with a specific emission reduction target is proposed, in which the emission target is embedded in the objective function via the exterior point method rather than considered as a constraint. Simultaneously, a spatial-temporal carbon response model is proposed, which is based on geographically dispatchable loads (GDLs) incorporating distributed data centers (DDCs) and mobile energy storage systems (MESSs). This model can be extended to further mitigate system emissions without changing the current system framework. The proposed planning method is tested on the modified IEEE 33-bus and 123-bus benchmark systems. According to the simulation results, the impact on system cost and emission results owing to specific emission reduction targets and spatial-temporal carbon response model are analyzed. The results demonstrate that the proposed model and method can achieve a reduction in emissions of more than 30% within 5% of increasing system costs. The effectiveness and scalability of the proposed model have also been verified.</description></item><item><title>On the Low Risk of SSR in Type III Wind Turbines Operating With Grid-Forming Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10197565</link><description>We have shown in previous work that the risk of subsynchronous resonance between wind power plants with Type III wind turbines and series-compensated transmission lines is low when the wind turbines are operated in grid-forming (GFM) mode instead of the standard grid-following mode. This article explains the fundamental mechanism behind the improved damping characteristics by modeling the positive- and negative-sequence impedances of Type III wind turbines in GFM control mode. It is discovered that the GFM control naturally acts against the negative resistance behavior of Type III wind turbines at subsynchronous frequencies that results from an interaction between the rotor-side converter current controller and negative slip. The developed impedance models in the sequence domain and the improved damping behavior are verified using PSCAD simulations of a 2.5-MW Type III GFM wind turbine. The modeling predictions are also supported by experimentally measuring the impedance response of a 2.5-MW Type III wind turbine in GFM mode.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Design of V2G Incentives and V2G-Capable Electric Vehicles Parking Lots Considering Cost-Benefit Financial Analysis and User Participation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10226205</link><description>The deployment of electric vehicles parking lots (EVPLs) has been suggested as a solution that could serve the charging needs of electric vehicles (EVs) parked in public spaces. Due to their nature, EVPLs offer some advantages that public charging stations cannot offer. The availability of numerous EV batteries over a long period in the EVPL means that the storage capacity of EVs in EVPLs could be utilized in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) schemes through the installation of bi-directional chargers (BD) that allow injection of power back into the grid. However, it is imperative to determine the optimal number of BD in an EVPL given their high costs and the lack of clear evidence that many EV users will participate in the provision of V2G programs. Therefore, this article aims to develop a model for the optimal design of a V2G-capable EVPL via which the financial model of V2G services and V2G incentive-participation scheme for EV users are incorporated in the decision of installing different types of chargers. The model integrates a multi-mode objective that allows for the maximization of EVPL owner profit and/or EVPL social responsibility using control parameters incorporated in the model. The model also decouples the intertwined economic dynamics of EV charging and V2G services in the EVPL via revenue models targeting each service separately. This allows optimal pricing of services with respect to the invested capital. Actual survey data and historical operating information are used to verify the validity and feasibility of the model. The results show that the proposed model effectively meets design targets and charging/discharging requirements. By providing V2G services, including DR services to the grid, the profit margin of EVPL owners can increase by up to 12.16%.</description></item><item><title>Novel Fast-Speed Partial-Shading-Tolerant Flexible Power Point Tracking for Photovoltaic Systems With Explicit Key Points Estimation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10223421</link><description>Recent power curtailment-based photovoltaic (PV) flexible power point tracking (FPPT) algorithms mainly adopted intricate curve fitting or sophisticated curve-scanning mechanisms to ensure the grid supportive functionalities under partial shading conditions (PSCs), showing the limitations of mathematical solidity or system dynamics improvement. Accordingly, a novel fast-speed partial-shading-tolerant FPPT (PST-FPPT) algorithm is proposed in this article. Regarding the proposed scheme, a modified explicit PV model is developed to express the key operation points with the assistance of several representative current-voltage samples from the initialization process, which is beneficial to computational burden reduction and irradiance sensors removal. Additionally, to guarantee the tracking speed to system dynamics, a set point estimation-based direct voltage regulation strategy is proposed in this article, eliminating the redundant searching in approaching the predefined power command. Simulation and experimental evaluations under various PSCs and operational circumstances validated the effectiveness of the proposed control.</description></item><item><title>Power-Transfer-Distribution-Factor-Based Sensitivity Factors for Integrated Energy Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10236470</link><description>The stronger the electric power, district heating and gas system are linked in an integrated energy system (IES) the larger their flexibility potential but also their complexity. To ensure a secure system operation, the effect of a coupling unit's power change on the overall system state must be analyzed before the power change is carried out. Otherwise, coupling units can unintentionally cause limit violations in one energy system. Currently, for such analyses a power flow calculation must be performed, which is computational expensive and time-consuming. This article presents sensitivity factors extending Power Transfer Distribution Factors from electric power system analysis to IES. The sensitivity factors include the dynamic behavior of district heating and gas systems as we derive the sensitivity factors from a joined quasi-steady-state power flow calculation. In two case studies we profoundly test the applicability of the IES sensitivity factors, their accuracy, and limitations. We show that the sensitivity factors are on average ten times faster in estimating a new system state after a unit's power change compared to a power flow calculation. Also, the sensitivity factors can provide good estimates and have a higher accuracy than sensitivity factors which are derived from a steady-state power flow calculation.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Grid-Support Strategy With Inverter-Interfaced Distributed Generators for Short-Term Voltage Stability Improvement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10207767</link><description>With the increasing integration of renewable energy sources into distribution networks, short-term voltage stability (STVS) has become a prominent issue. Considering grid impedance and maximum rated current, a novel dynamic voltage support (DVS) control strategy for inverter-interfaced distributed generators (IIDGs) is proposed in this article for improving STVS. Furthermore, the impact mechanism of load dynamics and load spatial distribution on the STVS-support strategy are elucidated. For maximizing the STVS of the system, due to the difficulty of obtaining analytical closed-form expressions, a practical optimization method for multi-IIDG is proposed for the optimal control parameters. The optimization is solved alternately based on the time-domain simulation (TDS) and the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) algorithm. The STVS is evaluated by a proposed quantitative indicator. According to the operation state of the system, the control strategy can be adjusted online. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified based on two test systems. Compared with other DVS capabilities, the STVS is further improved by considering distributed dynamic loads. The applicability and computational efficiency of the proposed method are discussed under various key conditions.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Fault Ride-Through Operation Strategy Based on Model Predictive Control for High Power Wind Turbine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10210001</link><description>This article presents an advanced fault ride-through control strategy based on model predictive control (MPC) of high-power wind turbine (WT), which is able to provide voltage support for power grid under symmetrical and asymmetrical grid faults. An optimal cost function is first established to realize multi-objective control of wind power converter, considering current regulation, neutral-point voltage balance, and switching frequency control. The flexible positive and negative sequence control (FPNSC) method is applied to generate the current references complying with converter current and voltage limitations. Simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experimental verification are implemented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed fault-ride through operation strategy. The verification results show that the proposed strategy is able to effectively support voltage and implement fault ride-through (FRT) during grid faults with optimized neutral-point voltage and average switching frequency. The proposed MPC strategy can address different fault conditions with good adaptivity. It thus enhances the operation performance of high-power WT during faults events.</description></item><item><title>A Fault Ride-Through Method for LVDC Networks With Photovoltaic Energy Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10214031</link><description>Fault ride-through (FRT) is key to DC distribution networks for both avoidance of system blocking and improvement of the safety of flexible DC devices in the face of faults. This article proposes an FRT method for low-voltage DC distribution networks with a photovoltaic energy storage system, which achieves rapid fault detection and constraint of fault current contributed by DC solid-state transformers (DCSST), making non-blocking FRT viable. An inductor-based current-limiting module (CLM) is designed to cooperate with capacitors on the output terminal of a DCSST to restrain current and maintain voltage in the wake of faults. The system voltage can recover to a stable level swiftly after the FRT process under temporary faults. Correspondingly, permanent faults can be reliably isolated by DC circuit breakers after a reasonable FRT delay to minimize their impacts. Finally, a DC distribution network with a CLM is modeled in PSCAD/EMTDC and a hardware-in-the-loop test platform to verify and validate the overall effects and performance of this proposed method. Consequently, effectiveness and superiority of this method is justified in the test, where the results highlight its quick, stable and controllable fault current suppression capabilities compared with existing FRT methods under various fault conditions.</description></item><item><title>Coordinative Planning of Public Transport Electrification, RESs and Energy Networks for Decarbonization of Urban Multi-Energy Systems: A Government-Market Dual-Driven Framework</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10225407</link><description>Synergy among renewable energy sources (RESs), energy network (EN) expansion and electrified transport provides a potential pathway toward low-carbon energy systems. However, the ambition of deep decarbonization may not be achieved by connecting all stakeholders through single market-wise effort. To this end, this article presents a coordinative planning framework of public transport electrification (PTE), RESs and ENs for decarbonization of urban multi-energy systems (UMESs). The framework is formulated as a three-level programming and driven by both government incentives and market signals. In the upper-level, the investment decision models of RESs, ENs and PTE are developed. Particularly, public transport hubs (PTHs) are viewed as flexible multi-energy demands whose potential of implementing demand response is incorporated in PTE planning model. In the middle-level, a carbon emission-security assessment subproblem is proposed, where market equilibriums are captured by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions; then the nested Benders decomposition and Lagrangian relaxation approach are utilized to synthetize capacity incentives paid by governments. In the lower-level, a hybrid energy pricing mechanism is designed to obtain integrated energy-carbon prices. The above hierarchical model is solved by an iterative algorithm where all investors update their planning decisions in a decentralized manner based on customized government incentives and market prices. Numerical studies prove that our proposed approach can effectively coordinate all stakeholders and promote the low-carbon transition of UMESs.</description></item><item><title>SoilingEdge: PV Soiling Power Loss Estimation at the Edge Using Surveillance Cameras</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268055</link><description>Solar panels are exposed to various pollutants in outdoor environments, such as dust, sediment, and bird excrement, which can cause the power generated by the panels to drop by up to 50%. To accurately estimate the power generated by photovoltaic (PV) systems, it is necessary to take into account the effects of soiling on the panels. In this article, we propose a deep learning approach that uses edge devices such as micro-controllers to estimate the power loss due to soiling based on images captured by surveillance cameras. The proposed model, called SoilingEdge, is based on MobileNet and has been implemented on several platforms, including CPUs, edge tensor processing units (EdgeTPUs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and vision processing units (VPUs). We present a comparative study of the performance of SoilingEdge on these different platforms and show that FPGA offers a balanced compromise between cost and inference performance, while VPU is the most cost-effective option, but has a slower execution time. Furthermore, the article also investigates the interpretability of the model through the visualization of attention maps, thus providing useful insights for researchers and engineers in understanding the model behaviors.</description></item><item><title>Impact of Battery Ramp Rate Limit on Virtual Synchronous Machine Stability During Frequency Events</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10234653</link><description>The fast growing penetration of renewable energy sources has led to increasing retirement of conventional power plants, which affects operational stability of electricity networks. Therefore, researchers have proposed virtual synchronous machine (VSM) techniques for inverter-based renewable generators to address the related instability issues. However, most of the studies consider a stiff or infinite DC source of VSMs, which does not reflect the reality of battery storage with limited ramp rates. In this article, a thorough investigation has been conducted to evaluate the impacts of VSM battery ramp rates on system stability during frequency events. Then, the mechanism of VSM instability with slow ramp rates has been analysed. The results show that the system may lose stability during the frequency events since the ramp rate significantly impacts the energy delivered during such contingency. The eigenvalues analysis has also been performed to investigate the impact of ramp rate limit on system stability. Potential solutions are proposed after analysing the mechanism of this instability, such as reducing the AC voltage control speed. This also reveals that VSMs with DC ramp rate restriction can not achieve a high AC voltage loop bandwidth as the traditional synchronous machines.</description></item><item><title>Rapid Active Power Support by Regional PV Aggregation Considering Physical Topological Correlation and Communication Delay</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10243633</link><description>Harnessing the rapid active power regulation potential of aggregated distributed photovoltaics (PVs) to support the bulk power system is crucial under high-penetration PV scenarios. In this article, based on a hierarchical architecture, the optimization and control strategies of distributed PVs are proposed to realize rapid active power support. In the upper level, to achieve reliable and rapid active power allocation, an optimal active power flow model incorporating the prediction uncertainty of distributed PVs and active power transmission loss is constructed, which can be solved in real-time by Chebyshev graph convolutional network (ChebNet). In the lower level, given the electrical interaction between distributed PVs, the optimal active power tracking of the distributed PVs is realized through reference voltage and current tracking control. Further, a delay-dependent distributed coordinated $ H_{\infty }$ controller is designed to achieve stable tracking in the presence of communication delays and load perturbations. Finally, simulations are performed on the modified IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 118-bus test systems, and the results verify the effectiveness and superiority of ChebNet, as well as the good accuracy, tracking speed, and robustness of the proposed control method.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Modeling and Stability Control Strategy of Integrated Energy System in Multi-Time Scales</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10239532</link><description>In this article, the overall framework of integrated energy system (IES) is established including the integrated dynamic models of electricity, gas, and heat networks. The operation mechanism, dynamic coupling, energy flow constraints, and multi-time scale coordination of IES are fully considered as the basis of stability control. Then, an innovative multi-time-scale stability control strategy is proposed to simultaneously control the dynamic stability of voltage, frequency, flow, pressure, and temperature based on discrete model predictive control (DMPC). The outputs of outer loop control in long-time scale are regarded as the model inputs and control objectives for the inner loop control in short-time scale. The optimal solutions of electricity, heat, and gas are simultaneously obtained without decoupling based on the established integrated dynamic models. The proposed stability control method simplifies and unifies the stability control mode of different energy forms. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the proposed scheme can synchronously achieve the control objectives (frequency/voltage/temperature/mass flow/pressure regulation).</description></item><item><title>Analysis of Wave Energy Conversion for Optimal Generator Sizing and Hybrid System Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10258409</link><description>The effective integration of offshore wind and wave energy is highly challenging due to their distinct intermittency characteristics. The power take-off (PTO) level power smoothing in the wave energy converter (WEC) is needed to reduce its power variations and optimize the generator and associated converter sizing. However, there is a lack of understanding of the impact of mechanical storage systems at the PTO on the WEC operation; hence, a guide on the selection of the electrical generator rating under a wide range of wave climates is missing. This article addresses these research gaps by using a representative point absorber WEC with a hydraulic PTO system. A general method of selecting the optimum generation system rating is proposed from the technical and economic viewpoints. In addition, the impacts of two mechanical storage systems (added inertia and gas accumulator) on WEC system efficiency and availability are investigated under four distinct levels of practical wave climates (399 sea states). It is shown that both mechanical storage methods can effectively reduce the generator ratings but their impacts vary under different wave climates. It is also concluded that the storage systems have limited impact on the optimal generator ratings, while wave specifications at various sea locations present a greater impact.</description></item><item><title>A Dynamic Equivalent Energy Storage Model of Natural Gas Networks for Joint Optimal Dispatch of Electricity-Gas Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10261292</link><description>The development of energy conversion techniques enhances the coupling between the gas network and power system. However, challenges remain in the joint optimal dispatch of electricity-gas systems. The dynamic model of the gas network, described by partial differential equations, is complex and computationally demanding for power system operators. Furthermore, information privacy concerns and limited accessibility to detailed gas network models by power system operators necessitate quantifying the equivalent energy storage capacity of gas networks. This article proposes a multi-port energy storage model with time-varying capacity to represent the dynamic gas state transformation and operational constraints in a compact and intuitive form. The model can be easily integrated into the optimal dispatch problem of the power system. Test cases demonstrate that the proposed model ensures feasible control strategies and significantly reduces the computational burden while maintaining high accuracy in the joint optimal dispatch of electricity-gas systems. In contrast, the existing static equivalent model fails to capture the full flexibility of the gas network and may yield infeasible results.</description></item><item><title>Protection of Doubly Fed Induction Generator-Based Wind Turbines Against Loss of Excitation of the Rotor Winding</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10265142</link><description>The doubly fed induction generator-based wind turbine (DFIG-WT) has an excitation system in the rotor winding (RW), provided from the machine terminal through a back-to-back converter which may be lost partially and/or completely due to the fault in the rotor-circuit. Accordingly, this article outlines a novel protection system for DFIG-WT against loss of excitation (LOE) of the RW. For this purpose, two parameters of the reactive power (Qs) and DC-link voltage (Vdc) have been comprehensively analyzed theoretically and through typical simulation studies. The results show that, although they have the potential for detecting the complete LOE (CLOE), the partial LOE (PLOE) cannot be detected by means of them. Hence, to precisely detect the CLOE, the derivative of multiplication of the parameters has been implemented. On the other hand, further exploration to find the suitable parameter to address the PLOE show that, the stator current (Isr) considering the proper settings, can be the most suitable indicator. The results from evaluation of the developed algorithm on a typical test system in MATLAB/Simulink (2017b) environment show its reliability and swiftness in addressing the LOE events.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Sizing and Siting of BESS in High Wind Penetrated Power Systems: A Strategy Considering Frequency and Voltage Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10269003</link><description>Battery energy storage system (BESS) is a prominent option to provide frequency and voltage support in high wind penetrated power systems. However, the high investment cost of BESS makes its optimal allocation a critical issue. To address this issue, this article proposes an optimal sizing and siting strategy of BESS in high wind penetrated power systems considering the coordinated frequency and voltage control. The key feature of this strategy lies in the fact that the control scheme is incorporated into allocation process, thus achieving the optimal allocation in a dynamic context. Specifically, the allocation problem is a linear programming problem with the objective of minimizing BESS investment cost. Meanwhile, the control scheme is established based on model predictive control (MPC) with the aim of frequency and voltage grid support. The MPC control problem is then embedded into the linear allocation problem, resulting in an integrated multi-objective optimization problem, which links the allocation domain and control domain. The generalized Benders decomposition is introduced to decompose the integrated optimization problem into a master problem and a set of subproblems, which can be solved iteratively and alternately. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Feedback Based Online Aggregate EV Power Flexibility Characterization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286155</link><description>As an essential measure to combat global warming, electric vehicles (EVs) have witnessed rapid growth. Flexible EVs can enhance power systems' ability to handle renewable generation uncertainties. How EV flexibility can be utilized in power grid operation has captured great attention. However, the direct control of individual EVs is challenging due to their small capacity and large number. Hence, it is the aggregator that interacts with the grid on behalf of the EVs by characterizing their aggregate flexibility. In this article, we focus on the aggregate EV power flexibility characterization problem. First, an offline model is built to obtain the lower and upper bounds of the aggregate EV power flexibility region. It ensures that any trajectory within the region is feasible. Then, considering that parameters such as real-time electricity prices and EV arrival/departure times are not known in advance, an online algorithm is developed based on Lyapunov optimization techniques. We provide a theoretical bound for the maximum charging delay under the proposed online algorithm. Furthermore, real-time feedback is designed and integrated into the proposed online algorithm to better unlock EV power flexibility. Comprehensive performance comparisons are carried out to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Joint Granular Model for Load, Solar and Wind Power Scenario Generation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286981</link><description>The main thrust of the article is the development of a joint stochastic model for electricity demand, and wind and solar power production in a given region. The model hinges on special statistical data analysis techniques including the estimation of heavy tail distributions, graphical LASSO fitting procedures, and conditional Monte Carlo simulations. Assuming the availability of point forecasts, we model the deviations from these forecasts instead of modeling the actual quantities of interest. The resolution of the model is determined by the resolution of the forecast data. For the sake of illustration, we implement our model and the corresponding simulation algorithms on data made available by NREL for the Texas region with hourly time resolution, load data at the zone level, and wind and solar power production at the generation asset level. Our numerical simulations confirm that the dependencies identified through the fitting algorithm are consistent with the relative locations of the production assets and the geographical load zones over which the data were collected.</description></item><item><title>A New Closed-Loop Solar Power Forecasting Method With Sample Selection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10288077</link><description>In this article, a new short-term solar power forecasting method is proposed which has a closed-loop structure composed of point-estimating and range-classifying parts. If the forecasts generated by these parts for solar power are inconsistent, the feedback loop sends appropriate signals to them to correct their predictions. The feedback loop iterates until consistent forecasts are generated for the solar power by the point-estimating and range-classifying parts. This enables the proposed closed-loop forecasting method to enhance its solar power prediction accuracy and reliability. Furthermore, a novel sample selection approach, different from feature selection methods, is devised to mine the historical data for finding the most informative training samples for training the proposed forecasting engine. The effectiveness of the proposed solar power forecasting method is illustrated by testing it on some real-world solar farms and comparing its results with the results of several state-of-the-art solar power prediction methods.</description></item><item><title>On the Forecastability of Solar Energy Generation by Rooftop Panels Pointed in Different Directions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10169105</link><description>By increasing the penetration of small-scale rooftop solar panels, forecasting their output has become important to both homeowners and distribution systems operators. In many areas, the roof of residential houses is not such that all solar panels are installed pointing in one direction; so, they are installed pointing in different directions. In this letter, the effect of this phenomenon on the forecastability of the day-ahead solar panels' power output is experimentally investigated. To perform day-ahead energy forecasting, a feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) is created using historical data and weather conditions of a similar day along with the forecast weather conditions of the day for which the forecast is to be performed. A similar day selection algorithm based on Euclidean distance is used to determine the reference day. Two forecasting approaches have been compared: forecasting each panel output and forecasting the total output. Moreover, Long short-term memory (LSTM) is used to validate the conclusion made by the feedforward ANN. The results evidently show that considering different directions of the solar panels increases the forecastability of the rooftop solar power plant.</description></item><item><title>Control Solution to Over-Modulation of DFIG Converter for Asymmetrical Fault Ride Through</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10119222</link><description>This letter proposes a control solution to mitigate the problem of converter over-modulation in doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbine generators (WTGs). Overmodulation is a critical reason in failing to ride through asymmetrical faults and inject positive- and negative-sequence reactive currents (I1R and I2R) per grid code requirements. Analytical expressions are first proposed to independently calculate the transient, positive- and negative-sequence current components. The I2R injection factor is then optimized to mitigate the problem of steady-state over-modulation. The transient components are eliminated in the inner-loop control to mitigate the problem of transient over-modulation. The proposed control solution is validated with EMT-type simulations. The results show that the transient performance and the fault ride through (FRT) capability are significantly improved.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Power System Topology and Energy Management Scheme Design for Hydrogen-Powered Aircraft</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10172057</link><description>The electrification of the aviation industry is a major challenge to realizing net-zero in the global energy sector. Fuel cell (FC) hybrid electric aircraft (FCHEV) demonstrate remarkable competitiveness in terms of cruise range and total economy. However, the process of simply hybridizing different power supplies together does not lead to an improvement in the aircraft economy, since a carefully designed power system topology and energy management scheme are also necessary to realize the full benefit of FCHEV. This paper provides a new approach towards the configuration of the optimal power system and proposes a novel energy management scheme for FCHEA. Firstly, four different topologies of aircraft power systems are designed to facilitate flexible power flow control and energy management. Then, an equivalent model of aircraft hydrogen consumption is formulated by analyzing the FC efficiency, FC aging, and BESS aging. Using the newly established model, the performance of aircraft can be quantitatively evaluated in detail to guide FCHEA design. The optimal aircraft energy management is realized by establishing a mathematical optimization model with the reduction of hydrogen consumption and aging costs as objectives. An experimental aircraft, NASA X-57 Maxwell, is used to provide a detailed performance evaluation of different power system topologies and validate the effectiveness of the energy management scheme. The new approach represents a guide for future power system design and energy management of electric aircraft.</description></item><item><title>Plug-and-Play of Grid-Forming Units in DC Microgrids Assisted With Power Buffers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10186352</link><description>Grid-forming units (GFUs) are fundamental devices in DC microgrids for DC bus voltage regulation. Droop control is widely used for GFU control due to its Plug-and-Play feature. However, it may fail to meet some desired DC microgrid control features and performances, such as zero steady-state DC bus voltage deviation, high system inertia, and fast DC bus voltage regulation. To achieve these desired control performances, some advanced control strategies have been proposed, but the introduction of time-dependent terms or the centralized controller in these control strategies leads to the loss of the key Plug-and-Play feature for GFUs. To maintain the Plug-and-Play feature of GFUs while meeting the desired microgrid control features and performances, this paper proposes a power buffer based control framework. The power buffer is a new device combing a capacitor and a bidirectional DC-DC converter as an interface between GFUs and the DC bus. It enables the development of a novel decoupled control strategy where GFUs are regulated by the droop control while advanced control strategies are applied to the power buffer. Thus, the Plug-and-Play feature of GFUs is maintained, while specific DC microgrid performances are also achieved simultaneously. Supported by this power buffer based control framework, GFUs can be plugged in/out DC microgrids seamlessly at any time without introducing DC bus voltage fluctuations. This allows GFUs, especially mobile GFUs, to achieve high DC bus voltage regulation performance. The hardware-in-loop (HIL) test and real circuit experimental results demonstrate its efficacy.</description></item><item><title>Model Reduction for Grid-Forming Hybrid Renewable Energy Microgrid Clusters Based on Multi-Timescale Characterization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10188666</link><description>Due to the high-order model of photovoltaic and wind power generation systems, it is complicated to accurately establish the detailed state-space model of the multi-source renewable energy microgrid (MG) system. In addition, when the MGs are interconnected into microgrid clusters (MGCs), the difficulties of the control and stability analysis are greatly increased. However, the fast and slow dynamics of power electronic interface-based units may not be sufficiently separated on time-scale, which cannot directly follow the assumptions of the traditional model reduction method. This paper selects a typical grid-forming hybrid renewable energy MGC, where the multi-timescale characteristics of the system considering detailed electromagnetic and electromechanical transient modes are analyzed. An identification method without trial-and-error searching for coupling dynamics is proposed under the non-classical singular perturbation characteristics, which is unreported in previous studies and is different from the traditional power systems. Moreover, the reduced-order model can characterize multi-timescale while guaranteeing computational efficiency, which is able to further perform the key parameter optimization and stability analysis for the larger-scale MGCs. The theoretical analysis and the time-domain simulations verify the feasibility and the accuracy of the reduced-order model.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Planning of Dual-Zero Microgrid on an Island Toward Net-Zero Carbon Emission</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10197218</link><description>This paper proposes an optimal planning method for the dual-zero microgrid (DZMG) on an island. The DZMG is the off-grid microgrid that exchanges zero power with entity grids and operates in a net-zero carbon emission mode. A net-zero emission operating strategy is designed considering the positive interaction between  $\rm CO_{2}$  flow and energy flow. The multi-scale circulation of  $\rm CO_{2}$  flow is realized by coordinating the carbon capture system, solvent storage tank (SST), and direct air capture (DAC), while the seasonal shift of energy flow is completed by the hydrogen storage system (HSS) and DAC. An optimization planning model for DZMG is developed to size the SST, DAC, and HSS optimally. The net-zero emission target and the net-zero operating strategy are involved in the model to balance the environmental and economic concerns in the planning. Numerical experiments are carried out on two IEEE test systems and a real-world island microgrid to validate the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed method. Simulation results reveal that the proposed method reduces the planning cost by over 25% compared with the extant zero-carbon-based method. Besides, the economy of the DZMG positively correlates to carbon prices and technological maturity, while inversely relates to fuel prices.</description></item><item><title>A Transfer Learning-Based Method for Cyber-Attack Tolerance in Distributed Control of Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10210203</link><description>Distributed secondary control of a microgrid highly relies on information exchange via communication networks, which may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This paper aims to enhance the cyber-attack tolerance against various types of cyber-attacks, including false data injection (FDI) attack, denial of service (DoS) attack, latency attack. To this end, a data-driven signal estimator is developed based on a deep neural network (DNN), where the inputs are local sampled time-series measurements (frequency, voltage, active/reactive power) and the outputs are the sums of communicated signals from other units. To achieve a better generalization ability, a representation subspace distance (RSD)-based transfer learning model is designed for offline training. As an advantage, the proposed estimator can work for various working conditions without multiple training processes. For online stage, a reference tracking scheme is designed to recover the attacked signal based on the estimated signal, which mitigates or eliminates the effect of cyber-attacks. Finally, numerical case studies are presented to validate the effectiveness and advantages of the method.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive Discrete Piecewise Droop Control in DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10210195</link><description>In DC microgrids, the discrete piecewise droop control is an attractive decentralized control strategy due to its ability to better achieve load distribution targets within a preset bus voltage deviation range. However, the practical application of this control strategy is challenged by the difficulty of implementing switching among different segments of droop curves. The conventional hysteresis-based switching approach suffers from serious undesired droop curve switching issues that parallel distributed generators extremely easily switch to different segments of droop curves as loads vary. Consequently, the power distribution significantly deviates from its intended control objective, leading to suboptimal system performance and adversely affecting the durability and longevity of energy storage units that are costly to maintain. Even worse, certain units may abruptly overload, posing a significant safety threat to the entire system. In this paper, first, the negative effect and corresponding cause of undesired droop curve switching that occurs in the hysteresis-based discrete piecewise droop control are both comprehensively investigated. Accordingly, a decentralized adaptive discrete piecewise droop control featuring a distinct control structure and control logic is proposed. Compared to the hysteresis-based switch approach, the control structure enables continuous command regulation rather discretely. The control logic restricts the command change to a small value during a step cycle instead of a significant change. Furthermore, the proposed controller is comprehensively designed based on the transient analysis. Results from both simulations and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed control method.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Optimization for Reactive Power Sharing and Stability of Inverter-Based Resources Under Voltage Limits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10210641</link><description>Reactive power sharing and voltage containment for inverter-based resources (IBRs) are two important but related objectives in inverter-based grids. In this paper, we propose a distributed control technique to achieve these objectives simultaneously. Our controller consists of two components: a purely local nonlinear integral controller that adjusts the IBR voltage setpoint, and a distributed primal-dual optimizer that coordinates reactive power sharing among the IBRs using neighbor-to-neighbor communication. The controller prioritizes the voltage containment objective over reactive power sharing at all times; except for the IBRs with saturated voltages, it provides reactive power sharing among all IBRs. Considering the voltage saturation and the coupling between voltage and angle dynamics, a formal closed-loop stability analysis based on singular perturbation theory is provided, which provides practical tuning guidance for the overall control system. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed controller for different case studies, we apply it to a low-voltage microgrid, the modified CIGRE medium-voltage network benchmark, and the IEEE 33 bus radial distribution system, all simulated in the MATLAB/Simulink environment.</description></item><item><title>Novel IoT-Based Droop Control for Battery SoC Balancing Among Multiple Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10214366</link><description>Energy storage systems are a crucial part of microgrids, making up for their autonomous operation. Therefore, much research has focused on increasing their lifetime and operational efficiency. One of the most viable topics is maintaining connected energy storage units (ESUs) at the same state of charge (SoC). Droop control techniques have been developed in centralized, decentralized, and distributed fashions. This paper proposes a novel IoT-based droop control that can achieve SoC balancing not only within the same microgrid but also between multiple microgrids. The proposed architecture increases reliability and flexibility while allowing the system to be expanded, reconfigured, or upgraded, enabling the plug-and-play capability more easily. First, the proposed IoT-based hierarchical control and communication architecture is presented. Then, the proposed SoC balancing technique and its coordination with IoT architecture are introduced. Through 24-hour simulations, the proposed technique&#8217;s scalability, adaptiveness, and robustness are validated under different scenarios, including the operation of any microgrids or ESUs with different capacities and the operation in case of a communication failure. Finally, the IoT value chain of the proposed technique is experimentally validated using a physical laboratory microgrid that uses HTTP protocol to send and receive data through the ThingSpeak IoT-cloud service.</description></item><item><title>An Affine Arithmetic-Based Energy Management System for Cooperative Multi-Microgrid Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10224308</link><description>This paper presents an Energy Management System (EMS) for a Multi-Microgrid (MMG) system that considers power exchanges between a set of interconnected microgrids (MGs) in an Active Distribution Network (ADN), taking into account electricity demand and renewable energy generation uncertainties using an Affine Arithmetic (AA) approach. The deterministic EMS model is formulated as a cost minimization problem which includes detailed operational constraints of thermal generators and Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) within each MG, as well as power flow limits at the Point of Common Coupling (PCC), considering all power exchanges among the set of MGs and the ADN. The uncertainties are formulated in the AA domain to obtain an EMS model that is robust for a range of realizations of the uncertain parameters, with no need of statistical assumptions or repeated calculations, which can be solved with relatively low computational burden, as opposed to other approaches such as Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). The proposed AA model is then tested and validated with data of a set of MGs in an ADN located in S&#227;o Paulo, Brazil, through comparisons with the deterministic model, MCS, and a Two-Stage Stochastic Programming (TSSP) approach. Results show an execution time improvement in the AA model of approximately 70% when compared to a MCS approach, which is expected to be slower, while considering the same range of uncertainties. Furthermore, the operation cost of the overall system decreases, as expected, by approximately 63% when power exchanges are enabled, as opposed to the individual operation of each MG, demonstrating the economic benefit of MMG systems.</description></item><item><title>Assessment and Mitigation of Multi-Mode Oscillations in Wind-Solar Hybrid Multi-Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10225568</link><description>Multi-microgrids (MMGs) provide an effective solution for further improving the overall economy and ensuring resilience under major disasters, while high penetration level of renewable energy generations inevitably brings adverse oscillation problems to the system. So far, no comprehensive study has been carried out to assess the interaction and oscillatory stability of autonomous wind-solar hybrid MMGs. Besides, the feasible method giving consideration to coordinated control and simple communication architecture for damping out the multi-mode oscillations deserves further research. Therefore, this paper first establishes a detailed model of wind-solar hybrid MMGs by taking multiple types of renewable energy generations with similar and different response features in timescale into account, which are rarely included by most of the existing studies. Then, participation factor analysis is applied to reveal the multi-timescale interactions within the single microgrid and MMGs. Meanwhile, different critical influence factors, especially primary energy source fluctuations, are thoroughly investigated through sensitivity analysis to assess the multi-mode oscillations and stability issues. To mitigate the undesirable multi-mode oscillations, a hierarchical distributed damping controller based on the optimal partial output feedback technique is proposed subsequently. Finally, comparative tests are conducted to validate the correctness of the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>An Improved Additional Control Method for Extending Stable Operating Region of Multi-Terminal LVDC System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10227311</link><description>The low damping of a multi-terminal low-voltage direct current (MT-LVDC) system with the influence of negative impedance characteristic in DC network, can reduce the system stability. This study aims to find an additional control method to extend the system stable operating region on the premise of not changing the local control system of each converter and not affecting the accurate tracking of each converter&#8217;s power command under their normal dispatching, thereby significantly extending the stable operating region of a MT-LVDC system by small damping powers, and ensuring the stable DC voltage when operating point changes. First, an additional control method based on feedback linearization is proposed. Then an analytical expression of damping powers required to realize additional control is built, and a method to obtain the overall stable operating region is established. Furthermore, a multi-objective optimization model for additional control is proposed, and the optimized additional controller is obtained using Pareto front solution. The proposed method is experimentally verified to be able to provide an effective method to improve the system stability with simple control structure and low complexity, which can be conveniently implemented in the MT-LVDC system.</description></item><item><title>Bi-Level Adaptive Storage Expansion Strategy for Microgrids Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10246411</link><description>Battery energy storage (BES) is a versatile resource for the secure and economic operation of microgrids (MGs). Prevailing stochastic optimization-based approaches for BES expansion planning for MGs are computationally complicated. This work proposes a data-driven bi-level multi-period BES expansion planning framework to determine the siting, sizing, and timing of BES installations. The proposed planning framework unifies deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and linear programming, thereby decoupling the determinations for the integer and continuous decision variables in two time scales, respectively. In the upper level, a rainbow DRL agent with quantile regression is trained to provide dynamic planning policies to accommodate stochastic renewable energy resources (RESs), load, and battery price changes efficiently. The lower level computes the optimal operation of MGs with frequency constraints to hedge the islanding contingency. The two levels communicate with one another by exchanging storage configuration and operating expenses in order to accomplish the shared goal of minimizing investment and operation costs. Comparative case studies on an MG are carried out to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DRL-based solution to the mixed-integer linear programming counterpart on efficiency, scalability, and adaptability.</description></item><item><title>Analytical Large-Signal Modeling of Inverter-Based Microgrids With Koopman Operator Theory for Autonomous Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10250860</link><description>The microgrid (MG) plays a crucial role in the energy transition, but its nonlinearity presents a significant challenge for large-signal power systems studies in the electromagnetic transient (EMT) time scale. In this paper, we develop a large-signal linear MG model that considers the detailed dynamics of the primary and zero-control levels based on the Koopman operator (KO) theory. Firstly, a set of observable functions is carefully designed to capture the nonlinear dynamics of the MG. The corresponding linear KO is then analytically derived based on these observables, resulting in the linear representation of the original nonlinear MG with observables as the new coordinate. The influence of external input on the system dynamics is also considered during the derivation, enabling control of the MG. We solve the voltage control problem using the traditional linear quadratic integrator (LQI) method to demonstrate that textbook linear control techniques can accurately control the original nonlinear MG via the developed KO-linearized MG model. Our proposed KO linearization method is generic and can be easily extended for different control objectives and MG structures using our analytical derivation procedure. We validate the effectiveness of our methodology through various case studies.</description></item><item><title>Voltage Sensitivity-Related Hybrid Coordinated Power Control for Voltage Regulation in ADNs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10174718</link><description>Voltage is a key operation index for active distribution networks. Coordinated power compensation of distributed energy resources (DERs) has shown promising results in alleviating voltage violation. Most methods use global optimization to obtain the optimal use of network-wide available resources, which becomes unfair when solving the same voltage issue of regional buses. Refined coordination of DERs on regional buses has not been formed as well. Therefore, this paper proposes a voltage sensitivity-related hybrid coordination algorithm. In order to fully tap into surplus reactive power of DESs, Volt/VAr control is considered in a higher priority than Volt/Watt control. For the selected crucial bus, a hybrid coordinated power compensation of regional DERs is designed in descending order of sensitivity or in proportion to available capacity under the same sensitivity value, which prioritizes using local and adjacent DERs to improve regulation effect and reduce changes in power flow. Due to the fact that voltage information is updated through association, the crucial bus needs to be reselected based on voltage assessment as a result, and the algorithm process will continue until the updated bus voltages become acceptable. Finally, the case study results in MATLAB indicate the effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>Graph Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Inverter-Based Active Voltage Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10223729</link><description>Active voltage control (AVC) is a widely-used technique to improve voltage quality essential in the emerging active distribution networks (ADNs). However, the voltage fluctuation caused by intermittent renewable energy makes it difficult for traditional voltage control methods to deal with. In this paper, the voltage control problem is formulated as a decentralized partial observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP), and a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm is developed considering each controllable device as an agent. The new formulation aims to adjust the strategies of agents to stabilize the voltage within the specified range and reduce the network loss. To better represent the mutual interaction between the agents, a graph convolutional network (GCN) is introduced. By aggregating the information of adjacent agents, complex latent features are effectively extracted by the GCN, hence promotes the generation of voltage control strategy for the agents. Meanwhile, a barrier function is applied in MARL to ensure the system voltage within a safe operation range. Comparative studies are conducted with traditional voltage control and other MARL methods on IEEE 33-bus and 141-bus systems, which demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>An Improved Neural Lyapunov Method for Transient Stability Assessment of Networked Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10208158</link><description>The transient stability analysis (TSA) of power-electronics-interfaced microgrids has a vital role in secure system operation. Such analysis normally entails extremely nonlinear and complex dynamics. Nearly all of the current studies have addressed this problem by making further assumptions in the system dynamics, and there remains an overall lack of an effective and general solution. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel neural Lyapunov framework with a trial solution structure for the TSA, which is a learning-based approach. On top of that, the modules that have been included within the framework consist of a learning and a falsification module. In general, the learning module iteratively learns the candidate Lyapunov functions via deep neural networks. The falsification module guides the learning process to satisfy the Lyapunov conditions and guarantees provable stability. The learned neural Lyapunov function attempts to identify the disturbances that the networked microgrid tolerates through the estimated region of attraction (ROA) in addition to determining large-signal stability. Applications of this method for power electronics interfaced networked microgrids are presented and multiple case studies are used to validate the suggested strategy. The findings demonstrate how the suggested framework expands the ROA while being quick, effective, and generalizable.

Specifically, we propose, respectively, SACPER (Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with Prioritized Experience Replay (PER)) and Constrained Variational Policy Optimization (CVPO) DRL algorithms to address the sequential decision-making problem of active network management (ANM) in distributed power systems and optimizing emergency load shedding (ELS) control problems. First, we propose SACPER for the ANM problem, which prioritizes the training of samples with large errors and poor policy performance. Evaluation of SACPER in terms of stability improvement and convergence speed shows that the ANM problem is optimized and energy loss and operational constraint violations are minimized. Next, we introduce CVPO for the ELS control problem, which is formulated as the Safe Reinforcement Learning (SRL) framework to address safety constraint prioritization issues in power systems. We consider additional voltage variables in the network as strong constraints for SRL to achieve fast voltage recovery and minimize unnecessary energy loss, while ensuring good training performance and efficiency. To demonstrate the performances of SACPER, we apply it to ANM6-Easy environment. The CVPO algorithm is applied to IEEE 39-Bus and IEEE 300-Bus systems. The simulation results of SACPER and CVPO are validated through extensive comparisons with other state-of-the-art DRL approaches.</description></item><item><title>Voltage-Price Coupling in Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10210691</link><description>Demand-side users are practical and economical resources for participating in voltage regulation of distribution networks, whose regulation effect is closely related to the price. This paper proposes a novel voltage-price coupling (VPC) mechanism to construct a fair voltage-based nodal pricing method for distribution networks to encourage demand-side users to participate in voltage regulation to improve voltage quality. The voltage impact factor is established to fairly characterize the impact of each nodal power on the voltage deviation in the distribution network. Further, the VPC mechanism is constructed to highly couple the nodal price with the voltage in both spatial and time dimensions by establishing distribution rules of prices at different nodes and different horizons. The VPC mechanism forms a fair and adaptable voltage-based nodal pricing method for distribution networks, which also considers the impact on the existing pricing mechanism, and the balance between the voltage regulation effect and user experience. Then, a price-driven voltage regulation (PVR) model is proposed for the distribution network to reduce voltage deviations and user costs, which integrates the demand-side resource management, voltage regulation, and voltage-based nodal pricing. Case studies verify the effectiveness of the VPC mechanism and the PVR model.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Sizing of Behind-the-Meter Battery Storage for Providing Profit-Oriented Stackable Services</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10177780</link><description>This paper focuses on an advanced optimization method for optimizing the size of the behind-the-meter (BTM) battery energy storage system (BESS) that provides stackable services to improve return on investment. The grid frequency regulation service and two customer-side services, i.e., energy arbitrage and peak shaving, are selected as stackable services of BTM BESS. A two-stage stochastic programming model is proposed to handle uncertainty and achieve the most cost-effective BTM BESS size. The first stage obtains the optimal BTM BESS size with the maximum annual net income. The operating strategy of the BTM BESS is optimized in the second stage to maximize revenue while considering the BTM BESS degradation cost and the uncertainty of operating scenarios. A hybrid solution algorithm combining genetic algorithm and mixed-integer linear programming is employed to solve the two-stage stochastic programming model. A strategy based on a recorder and a filter is proposed to speed up the solution. In addition, a novel method for converting the second-level regulation signal into the equivalent minute-level signal is offered to reduce computational burden while maintaining high accuracy. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated based on an industrial load and regulation information from the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) market.</description></item><item><title>Probabilistic Multi-Energy Load Forecasting for Integrated Energy System Based on Bayesian Transformer Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10185930</link><description>Probabilistic multi-energy load forecasting in an integrated energy system is very complex, because it needs to consider the following three aspects simultaneously: 1) Complex coupling relationship exists between multi-energy loads. 2) The intrinsic distribution of load uncertainties and dynamic changes of the distributions should be captured. 3) The probability distribution containing sufficient information should be generated. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-task Bayesian neural network, Bayesian Multiple-Decoder Transformer (BMDeT), which can capture both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, and achieve the joint probabilistic forecasting of the multi-energy loads considering their complex coupling relationship and related uncertainties. Firstly, the proposed model adopts the one-encoder multi-decoder framework, which could catch the multi-load coupling information by one Bayesian encoder and perform respective subtasks by multiple Bayesian decoders. Specifically, the Bayesian multi-head attention mechanism is proposed to capture the complex coupling relationship and uncertainties between multi-energy loads by optimizing the distribution of network parameters. Then, a multi-task balance method based on Bayesian theory is proposed to quantify the uncertainties of different tasks by giving trainable weights. Finally, the proposed model has been verified on a real-world load data set, the results show that it has superior performance over other benchmark models.</description></item><item><title>Resilience Assessment for Integrated Energy System Considering Gas-Thermal Inertia and System Interdependency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10221865</link><description>The gas-thermal inertia and power-gas-heat interdependency, as two fundamental features of the IES, play a crucial role in IES resilience during extreme events. This paper proposes a comprehensive resilience assessment framework to investigate the influence of these two factors on IES resilience performance during extreme events. Considering the inherent operational properties of power distribution system (PDS), natural gas system (NGS) and district heating system (DHS), the interactions among multiple sectors and gas-thermal inertia, a dynamic optimal energy flow model is established to simulate the IES cascading failures and restoration process under outage scenarios. On this basis, the multi-stage resilience curves for the IES as well as each subsystem are obtained. Regarding the geometric features of the resilience curves, a set of interdependency metrics is further proposed to quantify the sensitivity of NGS and DHS vulnerabilities that arise from their interdependency with PDS. Comparative experiments are conducted to analyze the influence of gas-thermal inertia and system interdependency on IES resilience. The results demonstrated the proposed metrics can effectively assess the spatial and temporal interdependency among the resilience of power, gas, and heat subsystems, providing useful information for operators in identifying critical links and evaluating potential upgrades to enhance the resilience of IES.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Agent Distributed Operation Solution to Electricity and Natural Gas Distribution Systems for Enhancing Resilience</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10229242</link><description>The multi-energy synergy of electricity and natural gas distribution systems (EGDS) offers a more proactive potential for resiliency in extreme contingencies. The interests of energy systems owned by different agents are nonnegligible in resilience enhancement. Existing distributed coordinated operation models seldom consider the multiple resilience resources co-scheduling cost and the social resilience enhancement benefit allocation. Absence of an equilibrium transaction settlement rule to constrain the &#8220;reap without effort&#8221; phenomenon and the concealed quotation behavior. To address this issue, this paper presents a multi-agent distributed operation and settlement model to EGDS for enhancing resilience, and a hierarchical solution based on the cooperative game theory is developed. Specifically, the model is formulated as a two-stage optimization framework including the social resilience enhancement subproblem and the transaction settlement subproblem. The transaction settlement rule of multi-energy coupling support is characterized as the model with quotation uncertainty is solved, and the balanced operational cost of a diverse allocation strategy is given as an output of the optimization. Two test cases of different scales are used to verify the validity and applicability of the model, whose numerical results show the subject interest and social interest are both improved while protecting privacy.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Energy Management of Multi-Entity Integrated Electricity and Heat Systems: A Review of Architectures, Optimization Algorithms, and Prospects</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10237300</link><description>Synergies among multiple energy sectors in an integrated electricity and heat system (IEHS) improve energy efficiency, economic operation and renewable energy utilization, thus contributing to a sustainable society. In reality, however, energy sectors are owned and operated by different entities, constituting a multi-entity integrated electricity and heat system (ME-IEHS). This calls for distributed energy management due to the curse of dimensionality and privacy concerns. Specifically, it is challenging to achieve socially optimal coordination using local information and limited information exchange, while the key to distributed energy management is to decompose the integrated energy management problem into smaller subproblems for interactive entities, respectively. This paper first explains the fundamentals of IEHSs including the definition of entities. According to the interactions among entities, this paper then establishes and compares the current energy management architectures. Distributed optimization algorithms supporting distributed energy management of the IEHS are systematically reviewed, while the extension to deal with uncertainties in a distributed fashion is also summarized. Finally, future research directions regarding the strategic behaviors yielded from multi-stakeholders and the distributed learning solution are envisioned.</description></item><item><title>Smart Home Energy Management: VAE-GAN Synthetic Dataset Generator and Q-Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10171153</link><description>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in academia and industry in the analysis of electrical consumption in residential buildings and the implementation of smart home energy management systems (HEMS) to reduce household energy usage and costs. HEMS have been designed to emulate the statistical and functional characteristics of real smart grids. However, a major challenge in this research area is the limited availability of publicly accessible datasets. To address this challenge and further leverage the potential of artificial HEMS applications, it is crucial to develop time series that accurately represent diverse operating conditions of synthetic systems. This paper introduces a novel approach based on the combination of variational auto-encoder-generative adversarial network (VAE-GAN) techniques to generate time-series data of energy consumption in smart homes. Additionally, we investigate the performance of the generative model when integrated with a Q-learning based HEMS. The effectiveness of the Q-learning based HEMS is assessed through online experiments using real-world smart home data. To evaluate the quality of the generated dataset, we employ various metrics including Kullback&#8211;Leibler (KL) divergence, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), and the Wasserstein distance, which quantify the disparities between probability distributions of the real and synthetic data. Our experimental results demonstrate that the synthetic data generated by VAE-GAN closely aligns with the distribution of real data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the utilization of the generated data facilitates the training of a more efficient Q-learning based HEMS, surpassing the performance achieved with datasets generated using baseline approaches.</description></item><item><title>Customer Targeting for Load Flexibility via Resident Behavior Segmentation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10188905</link><description>Caused by the widespread of renewable energy resources, oversupply and overdesign of reserve capacity are serious concerns in electrical power system. Hence, power system needs load flexibility (LF) to mitigate the concerns. Despite utilities&#8217; efforts to aggregate LF for residential loads, aggregated LF operations are typically inefficient due to load uncertainties caused by individual customers&#8217; varying behaviors. Therefore, in this study, a novel customer targeting model for LF participation is proposed based on resident behavior analysis. The proposed scheme comprises a resident behavior segmentation model (RBSM) performing deep-learning-based and probabilistic clustering and a virtual LF operation model (VLFOM) considering human comfort. Simulations were conducted in a residential environment in San Diego, California. The superior performance of RBSM was confirmed through internal clustering evaluation methods. Accordingly, the results of the VLFOM model confirmed the criteria of resident behaviors for adequate LF participation. The experiment results present that the proposed model is economically and environmentally effective to the LF operation for utilities. Finally, implications of LF aggregation based on uncertainty assessment and meaningful suggestions of the settlement design for future LF expansion are presented.</description></item><item><title>Novel Incentive-Based Multi-Level Framework for Flexibility Provision in Smart Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10210201</link><description>Within smart grids, end-users often seek to reduce electricity costs using a home energy management system, while the power utility aims to optimize the grid operation. This article proposes a novel three-level framework to tackle the contradictory nature of the objectives of end-user and distribution system operators (DSOs) by upward and downward flexibility provision. In addition, the proposed method designs a novel incentive program based on the flexibility provided by the end-users. Then, the aggregated flexibility is offered to the DSO. The model takes advantage of the local flexibility of home appliances to re-schedule their use based on the flexibility request from the DSO. The aggregator provides incentive programs based on the flexibility provided by the prosumers to reduce/shift energy consumption. The proposed methodology considers the alignment of the conflicting techno-economic objectives of the prosumers and system operators. The results show that our proposed strategy has increased the monetary benefits for prosumers for their flexibility services provided to the DSO compared to other scenarios. Moreover, the proposed method improves the voltage profiles and reduces the peak load and power losses by 20.8% and 24.6%, respectively, of the overall system.</description></item><item><title>Predicting Strategic Energy Storage Behaviors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10214105</link><description>Energy storage are strategic participants in electricity markets to arbitrage price differences. Future power system operators must understand and predict strategic storage arbitrage behaviors for market power monitoring and capacity adequacy planning. This paper proposes a novel data-driven approach that incorporates prior model knowledge for predicting the strategic behaviors of price-taker energy storage systems. We propose a gradient-descent method to find the storage model parameters given the historical price signals and observations. We prove that the identified model parameters will converge to the true user parameters under a class of quadratic objective and linear equality-constrained storage models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through numerical experiments with synthetic and real-world storage behavior data. The proposed approach significantly improves the accuracy of storage model identification and behavior forecasting compared to previous blackbox data-driven approaches.</description></item><item><title>A Distributed Coordination Strategy for Heterogeneous Building Flexible Thermal Loads in Responding to Smart Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10221860</link><description>Air conditioning systems are promising energy flexibility resources for smart grids. However, buildings with various thermodynamics must be coordinated to utilize limited energy flexibility effectively. This study proposes a distributed coordination strategy to coordinate building flexible thermal loads of different characteristics for optimized utilization of energy flexibility in a scalable and distributed manner. It consists of two components:1) an average consensus-based distributed sensing scheme to estimate the average thermal state of charge (SoC) of multiple zones, and 2) a weighted consensus-based distributed allocation module to allocate the demand response (DR) tasks or limited energy resources to multiple zones, proportional to their thermal storage capacities and deviations to the average thermal SoCs. Both algorithms achieve their goals respectively by fully distributed means through a sparse network with neighbor-to-neighbor communication. The sufficient condition for converging the weighted consensus algorithm is also derived for the first time. The proposed strategy is adopted for 1) weighted DR participation of residential inverter air conditioners and 2) weighted water flow redistribution of the commercial building water heating systems under urgent DR events. Simulation results show that adopting the distributed coordination strategy avoids the early depletion of demand flexibility resources and nonuniform thermal comfort sacrifices under uncoordinated control.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Online Game-Theoretic Framework for Real-Time Energy Trading in Smart Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10227354</link><description>In this paper, the real-time energy trading problem between the energy provider and the consumers in a smart grid system is studied. The problem is formulated as a hierarchical game, where the energy provider acts as a leader who determines the pricing strategy that maximizes its profits, while the consumers act as followers who react by adjusting their energy demand to save their energy costs and enhance their energy consumption utility. In particular, the energy provider employs a pricing strategy that depends on the aggregated amount of energy requested by the consumers, which suits a commodity-limited market. With this price setting, the consumers&#8217; energy demand response strategies are designed under a non-cooperative game framework, where a unique generalized Nash equilibrium point is shown to exist. As an extension, the consumers are assumed to be unaware of their future energy consumption behaviors due to uncertain personal needs. To address this issue, an online distributed energy trading framework is proposed, where the energy provider and the consumers can design their strategies only based on the historical knowledge of consumers&#8217; energy consumption behavior at each bidding stage. Besides, the proposed framework can be implemented in a distributed manner such that the consumers can design their demand responses by only exchanging information with their neighboring consumers, which requires much fewer communication resources and would thus be more suitable for the practical operation of the grid. As a theoretical guarantee, the proposed framework is further proved to asymptotically achieve the same performance as the offline solution for both energy provider and consumers&#8217; optimization problems. The performance of practical designs of the proposed online distributed energy trading framework is finally illustrated in numerical experiments.</description></item><item><title>Novel Architecture of Energy Management Systems Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning in Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10255281</link><description>In microgrids, energy management systems (EMS) have been considered essential systems to optimize energy scheduling, control and operation for reliable power systems. Conventional EMS researches have been predominantly performed by employing demand-side management and demand response (DR). Nonetheless, multi-action control in EMS is confronted with operational challenges in terms of the profitability and stability. In this paper, energy information systems (EIS), energy storage systems (ESS), energy trading risk management systems (ETRMS), and automatic DR (ADR) are integrated to efficiently manage the profitability and stability of the whole EMS by optimal energy scheduling. The proposed microgrid EMS architecture is optimized by using proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm, which has been known to have good performance in terms of learning stability and complexity. A novel performance metric, represented as a burden of load and generation (BoLG), is proposed to evaluate the energy management performance. The BoLG is incorporated into the reward settings for optimizing the management of multi-action controls such as load shifting, energy charging-discharging, and transactions. From the simulation results, it is confirmed that the proposed architecture can improve energy management performance with the proper trade-off between stability and profitability, compared to dynamic programming (DP)-based and double deep Q-network (DDQN)-based operation.</description></item><item><title>Black Start of Coastline Power Networks From Grid-Forming Ship-to-Grid Services</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10168164</link><description>The expansion of electric ships in the transportation sector, along with environmental advantages, has the potential to enhance the resilience and stability of coastline power grids during blackouts or emergencies through ship-to-grid technology. The power grids located in remote coastal and island communities often face high energy costs and are more vulnerable to blackouts due to their increased risk of natural disasters. Ship-to-grid technology offers an innovative localized solution that enables onshore utilities to avoid the need for installing excessive on-land energy storage capacity to enhance stability and resiliency in the coastline power grid. Electric ships can provide a flexible source to restart power to critical facilities such as hospitals and communication networks. In this paper, a comprehensive scheme for integrating ships into the grid system is proposed, which involves a grid-forming control approach through a DC-link connection. The approach employs a droop-based control strategy, current limiter control, and voltage source grid interface to regulate both voltage and frequency at various stages of the coastline power network restoration. The approach is verified using a 4-zone shipboard power system with grid-forming DC-link connection, for black start of a modified IEEE 30-bus test system during a multi-step black start and re-energization process.</description></item><item><title>Coupling Constraint Behavior and Design Method for Two-Degree-of-Freedom in Series-Parallel Architecture Electric Energy Router</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10174282</link><description>For low-voltage distribution networks (LVDNs), the series-parallel architecture electric energy router (SPA-EER) has two obvious advantages under two-degree-of-freedom (TDF) control, that is, power flexible operation and up to 200% power transmission. However, there are coupling constraint behaviors between TDF, which will mutually limit their operation ranges. To this end, by analyzing simultaneous operation principles of active and reactive powers in SPA-EER, these coupling constraint behaviors are revealed, which is important for specifying the TDF operation ranges and promoting the safe operation for SPA-EER. Additionally, the effects of TDF on the maximum available active and reactive powers output by SPA-EER system are discussed, which can provide a basis for the mode selection of system. Based on the criterion of maximizing the utilization of renewable energy, a mode generator (MG) considering the actual powers of load, DC bus, LVND port, series converter and parallel converter is proposed to determine the suitable values for TDF, and then a MG-based TDF power flow flexible control (TDFPFFC) is developed to respond to demands of different operation modes. Finally, the simulation results are presented to verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed MG-based TDFPFFC.</description></item><item><title>Tracing, Ranking and Valuation of Aggregated DER Flexibility in Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10186453</link><description>The integration of distributed energy resources (DER) makes active distribution networks (ADNs) natural providers of flexibility services. However, the optimal operation of flexible units in ADNs is highly complex, which poses challenges for distribution system operators (DSOs) in aggregating DER flexibility. For example, to maximise the provision of services, flexible units must be strongly coordinated to manage network constraints, e.g., by performing simultaneous flexible power consumption and production in different parts of the network (referred to as power swaps in this work). Furthermore, due to the nonlinearities of aggregated DER flexibility provision, some units may need to rapidly change their outputs to enable the services. To address these challenges, this paper brings together exact AC optimal power flow (OPF) models and a cooperative game formulation and presents a new framework for tracing, ranking, and valuation of aggregated DER flexibility in ADNs. Extensive tests and simulations performed for the 33-bus radial distribution network demonstrate that the framework enables translating complex DER interactions into useful information for DSOs by ranking the criticality of flexible units and performing flexibility valuation based on its cost or economic surplus. Additionally, the framework proposes no-swap constraints and a nonlinearity metric which can be used by DSOs to identify unreliable operating regions with power swaps or rapid changes in flexible unit dispatch.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Operating Envelope-Based Local Energy Market for Prosumers With Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10208161</link><description>This paper presents a new framework for the management of prosumers with electric vehicles (EVs) and photovoltaic (PV) systems in a local energy market (LEM) using the dynamic operating envelope (DOE) that secures the network operation for prosumers&#8217; trading and allows prosumers to manage EVs charge/discharge with PV systems. Prosumers can configure the charge/discharge status of their EVs depending on mobility and determine their net import/export power which will be used to establish DOEs. The proposed framework incorporates a bidding strategy to enable prosumers to participate in the LEM within DOE limits, and peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading is developed to offer economic benefits to prosumers. The framework&#8217;s performance is evaluated with a 100% penetration level of EVs and PV systems on the IEEE 55-node low-voltage European test system. The simulation results demonstrate that DOEs can facilitate prosumers in managing their imports/exports for trading without violating voltage and congestion limits. The proposed framework efficiently manages EV charging/discharging with PV systems and enables prosumers to make optimal bids within DOEs, thereby benefiting from P2P trading in the LEM.</description></item><item><title>A Fully Distributed Privacy-Preserving Energy Management System for Networked Microgrid Cluster Based on Homomorphic Encryption</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10232904</link><description>The networked microgrid cluster (NMGC) integrating multiple heterogeneous microgrids is an effective way to improve the renewable energy utilization. However, the centralized scheduling scheme may be less secure and suffer from privacy concerns. In this paper, we present a fully distributed privacy-preserving energy management framework for secure and fair energy sharing within NMGC. To this end, firstly, a robust energy management model based on generalized Nash bargaining is formulated for proactive energy sharing and fair benefit allocation among microgrids. Then, a fully distributed optimization algorithm combining the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm and distributed consensus protocol is designed for the formulated energy management model. It only depends on flexible peer-to-peer communication without needing any third-party coordinators, potentially preventing a single-point failure. Furthermore, a privacy preservation communication scheme based on homomorphic encryption is designed for the developed distributed optimization algorithm. With the proposed privacy preservation scheme, that is, by using ciphertext instead of plaintext throughout the entire communication and computation process, the privacy of each microgrid can be prevented from being leaked to malicious adversaries and eavesdroppers. Finally, the effectiveness and superiorities of the developed distributed energy sharing mechanism are verified via numerical case studies.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Load Restoration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10236471</link><description>This paper addresses the load restoration problem after power outage events. Our primary proposed methodology is using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning to optimize the load restoration process in distribution systems, modeled as networked microgrids, via determining the optimal operational sequence of circuit breakers (switches). An innovative invalid action masking technique is incorporated into the multi-agent method to handle both the physical constraints in the restoration process and the curse of dimensionality as the action space of operational decisions grows exponentially with the number of circuit breakers. The features of our proposed method include centralized training for multi-agents to overcome non-stationary environment problems, decentralized execution to ease the deployment, and zero constraint violations to prevent harmful actions. Our simulations are performed in OpenDSS and Python environments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using the IEEE 13, 123, and 8500-node distribution test feeders. The results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve a significantly better learning curve and stability than the conventional methods.</description></item><item><title>Grid-Forming and Spatially Distributed Control Design of Dynamic Virtual Power Plants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10239108</link><description>We present a novel grid-forming control design approach for dynamic virtual power plants (DVPP). We consider a group of heterogeneous grid-forming distributed energy resources (DER) which collectively provide desired dynamic ancillary services, such as fast frequency and voltage control. To achieve that, we study the nontrivial aggregation of grid-forming DERs to establish the DVPP, and employ an adaptive divide-and-conquer strategy that disaggregates the desired control specifications of the aggregate DVPP via adaptive dynamic participation factors to obtain local desired behaviors of each DER. We then design local controllers at the DER level to realize these local desired behaviors. In the process, physical and engineered limits of each DER are taken into account. We extend the proposed approach to make it also compatible with grid-following DER controls, thereby establishing the concept of so-called hybrid DVPPs. Furthermore, we generalize the DVPP design to spatially dispersed DER locations in power grids with different voltage levels and  $R/X$  ratios. Finally, the DVPP control performance is verified via numerical case studies in the IEEE nine-bus transmission grid with an interconnected medium voltage distribution grid.</description></item><item><title>DER Capacity Assessment of Active Distribution Systems Using Dynamic Operating Envelopes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10243614</link><description>The increasing deployment of distributed energy resources (DER) within electricity distribution systems can push them outside their safe operational limits. This urges the distribution system operators (DSO) to perform a DER capacity assessment that utilises the network&#8217;s full potential to accommodate more DER while ensuring the network&#8217;s safety. However, this is a challenging task as the DER units are mostly consumer-owned and therefore the DSO does not have control over them. To overcome this challenge, this paper first develops dynamic operating envelopes (DOEs). A DOE is a convex set defining acceptable real and reactive powers exchange with the grid at a consumer connection point without violating any network constraints. We propose a novel methodology to calculate a DOE by applying the right-hand side decomposition technique through which we allocate the network&#8217;s capacity to mutually independent consumers. We then build a hierarchical DER capacity assessment within DOEs that considers the uncertainty of solar power and demand when making investment decisions. In the proposed framework, the consumers are then free to make their decisions as long as they comply with their DOEs.</description></item><item><title>Fairness-Incorporated Online Feedback Optimization for Real-Time Distribution Grid Management</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10251452</link><description>With the increasing penetration of distributed energy resources such as photovoltaics (PVs), frequent voltage and congestion problems are expected to occur in distribution grids. Existing solution approaches based on centralized or distributed offline optimization cannot handle the dynamics of distribution grids in real time, i.e., by the time the computations are finished, the used data are already outdated as the grid loadings evolve so fast. Moreover, the unfair distribution of costs or burdens among end-users to relieve network issues, for example with PV curtailment, has not been sufficiently considered either. To address these issues, a fairness-incorporated online feedback optimization (OFO) approach is proposed. This approach produces implementable intermediate iterates for inverter-based assets using online optimization and suitably integrated measurements, and thus can work with the distribution grid dynamics. Moreover, it addresses the unfairness issue by modifying the voltage sensitivity matrices and leverages the feedback-based nature of OFO to compensate for the resulting modeling inaccuracies. Case studies based on a 96-bus low-voltage grid demonstrate the effectiveness of the fairness-incorporated OFO to handle the distribution grid dynamics and improve fairness, in both static and dynamic cases, with balanced and unbalanced grid models.</description></item><item><title>Successive Convexification Algorithms for Optimizing Power Systems With Energy Storage Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10254570</link><description>Energy storage systems (ESSs) are increasingly used in power system optimization. Different ESS mathematical models are developed that consider nonlinear functions for power losses. However, these models require non-convex constraints to represent the ESS losses, resulting in challenging optimization problems. To reduce the complexity, convex relaxation models are often derived but generate infeasible solutions when the relaxation exactness is violated. To deal with this issue, this work develops two successive convexification algorithms that generate fast and high-quality feasible solutions when the derived solution is not exact. The first algorithm handles general loss functions, while the second algorithm enhances performance when piecewise-linear loss functions are used. Specifically, the algorithms reduce the feasible region of the relaxed ESS models using a tightening box trust region around the current solution in successive iterations. The proposed algorithms are applied to the Unit Commitment and Peak Shaving and Energy Arbitrage problems to investigate their performance considering piecewise-linear and quadratic ESS loss functions. Simulation results demonstrate the impact of the ESSs relaxation violation on the actual system operation and validate the algorithms efficacy to generate high-quality feasible and even optimal solutions with significantly lower execution times compared to problems utilizing exact ESS models.</description></item><item><title>An Inverse Optimization Method for Electric Vehicle Charging and Road Toll Pricing in Coupled Urban Transportation and Power Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10173663</link><description>This is the sequel to our earlier paper on A Decentralized Bi-level Decomposition Method for Optimal Operation of Electric Vehicles in Coupled Urban Transportation and Power Distribution Systems. After presenting the pricing framework, coordinated operation model and bi-level decomposition algorithm to obtain the optimal operation state in the previous work, this paper presents the pricing approach to adjust EVs&#8217; behavior and achieve that expected state. First, the network equilibrium (NE) and social optimum (SO) operation states are defined, based on which the traditional marginal social cost pricing is developed as benchmark. Second, in light of inverse optimization approach, the minimum charge pricing is proposed which adopts road tolls, charging prices and plug-in fees to coordinate the system operation. Different from the traditional pricing approach, the proposed one can align coupled power-transportation network (CPTN) flows from the spontaneously-formed NE with the least-cost SO state, while minimizing extra user charges. Third, various partial pricing schemes are developed to approximate the expected SO state for practical applications. Finally, case studies on a modified real-world urban network verify the effectiveness and performance of the pricing method. It is proven to significantly reduce the extra user charges while attaining the same optimum state.</description></item><item><title>A Coordinated Model for Multiple Electric Vehicle Aggregators to Grid Considering Imbalanced Liability Trading</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10180215</link><description>In the interaction between electric vehicle (EV) and grid, research on the coordinated optimization of different EV aggregators to reduce the adverse effect of EVs uncertainty is of great significance. This paper commits to formulating an imbalanced liability trading cooperation platform among multiple EV aggregators in real-time (RT) market. First, we propose a joint bidding model of multiple EV aggregators in RT market from the individual perspective. Each aggregator optimizes its internal bidding strategy and external imbalanced liability trading simultaneously. Next, considering the self-interest of each EV aggregator, the cooperative model is built based on general Nash bargaining (GNB) theory. To promote EV aggregators to trade but avoid over-dependence, each EV aggregator&#8217;s bargaining power is formulated by both individual trading quantity and trading dependence. Then, we decompose the model into two subproblems and introduce the neurodynamic-based algorithm for distributed solving. Finally, numerical results show that the proposed coordinated model can reduce the adverse effect of EVs&#8217; uncertainties on grid power balance to some extent, and realize cost saving or even profit earning for aggregators.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Machine Learning Forecasting for Online MPC of Work Place Electric Vehicle Charging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10184283</link><description>This work proposes a novel EV forecasting technique that predicts each EV&#8217;s arrival time (AT), energy demand (ED) and plug duration (PD) over the course of a calendar day using a hybrid machine learning (ML) forecast. The ML forecasts as well as persistence forecasts are then input in a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm that minimizes the electricity costs incurred by the charging provider. The MPC with the hybrid ML forecast reduced peak loads and monthly electricity costs over a base case scenario that determined costs for uncontrolled L2 charging: Reductions in weekday mean peak load during a 30 day summer time case study were 46.7% and 2.8% from the base case to ML MPC and persistence to ML MPC, respectively. Reductions in utility costs during the summer case study were 20.9% and 0.1% from base case to ML MPC and persistence to ML MPC respectively. Results are similar for a 30 day winter case study.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Mitigating the Cycle Aging Cost of Vehicle Batteries in Energy Transportation Nexus</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10185627</link><description>There is a critical need to protect batteries from degradation to achieve the benefit of electric vehicles (EVs) in the energy and transportation sectors. However, existing battery degradation models have either failed to reflect the actual battery cycle aging mechanism, or are too complex for practical vehicle energy management. This paper presents a new approach for the efficient integration of battery cycles aging mechanisms into vehicle energy management by a prioritized experience-driven imitative learning (PExp-IL) framework. A prioritized degradation experience pool is constructed by comprehensively analyzing battery cycle aging mechanisms in vehicle standard driving schedules. Battery cycle aging features are mathematically presented by learning the expert experience that characterizes its degradation under different working conditions imitatively. The battery protective target is achieved by integrating the established gradient aging model into a vehicle energy management optimization problem. With the anti-aging policy gradient, battery aging mitigation can be easily incorporated into vehicle energy management scenarios that highly depend on algorithm computation efficiency. Two detailed demonstrative cases are further constructed to realize the anti-aging battery management in hybrid vehicles and grid integration of EVs. This approach provides a new practical solution for improving vehicle total economy by mitigating battery aging costs, which can contribute to net zero in the energy-transportation nexus.</description></item><item><title>Market-Based Coordinated Planning of Fast Charging Station and Dynamic Wireless Charging System Considering Energy Demand Assignment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10197206</link><description>With the rapid growth of electric vehicle (EV) penetration, EV charging demand is becoming greater and diversified. To meet the diverse EV charging demand, we propose a market-based coordinated planning method of fast charging station (FCS) and dynamic wireless charging system (DWCS). Firstly, a bi-level coordinated planning model considering the benefits of charging service provider and EV user group is built. It can make full use of the complementary characteristics of FCSs and DWCSs. Then, the energy demand assignment(EDA) approach that can directly assign energy demand to roads and power nodes is proposed and applied in the inner level of bi-level coordinated planning model. Finally, the cases that consider the impact of differentiated traffic demand and land prices in different regions are proposed. The case studies are formulated based on the 21 power nodes-12 traffic nodes network and the 54 power nodes-25 traffic nodes network. To calculate the optimal solution, the KKT conditions, the McCormick relaxation approach, the optimization-based bound tightening approach (OBBT) and the sequential bound tightening approach (SBT) are employed. Numerical simulation results validate that the proposed method can effectively improve the profits of charging service provider and keep the EV users&#8217; charging cost at relatively low range.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Transient Stability Evaluation of Electric Distribution Networks Dominated by EV Supercharging Stations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10227373</link><description>Accelerated deployment of high-power electric vehicle (EV) supercharging stations is expected to alleviate EV drivers&#8217; range anxiety, while imposing stress on the electric distribution networks (EDNs) and threatening their transient stability. As a powerful transient stability evaluation (TSE) tool, the estimation of region of attraction (ROA) plays a vital role in maintaining situational awareness and stable operation of the emerging EDNs. However, EDNs dominated by EV charging stations typically involve highly nonlinear and complex system dynamics, rendering the model-based approaches for ROA estimation computationally intensive. Thus, solution accuracy is usually compromised due to simplified system modeling. This paper proposes a data-driven approach to ROA estimation of emerging EDNs based on the Koopman operator theory. Numerically stable Koopman eigenfunctions can be learned from the system measured data and then employed to establish a set of linearly parameterized Lyapunov candidate functions. Various trajectory data are then employed to establish a tight feasible polytope. Through efficient sampling and linear optimization, the union of invariant sublevel sets of the determined Lyapunov functions can constitute a tight inner approximation to the actual ROA. The proposed method is evaluated to be computationally efficient and permits real-time ROA estimation. Numerical simulations of a DC EDN interfaced to an AC grid validate the superior performance of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Preserving Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading via Hybrid Secure Computations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10176288</link><description>The massive integration of uncertain distributed renewable energy resources into power systems raises power imbalance concerns. Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading provides a promising way to balance the prosumers&#8217; volatile energy power generation and demands locally. Particularly, to protect the privacy of prosumers, distributed P2P energy trading is broadly advocated. However, severe privacy leakage issues can emerge in the realistic fully distributed P2P energy trading paradigm. Meanwhile, in this paradigm, two-party and multi-party computations coexist, challenging the naive privacy-preserving techniques. To tackle privacy leakage issues arising from the fully distributed P2P energy trading, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving approach via hybrid secure computations. A secure multi-party computation mechanism consisting of offline and online phases is developed to ensure the security of shared data by leveraging the tailored secret sharing method. In addition, the Paillier encryption method based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem is proposed for both the secure two-party computation and the offline phase of the multi-party computation. The random encryption coefficient is designed to enhance the security of the two-party computation and simultaneously guarantee the convergence of the distributed optimization. The feasible range for the encryption coefficient is derived with a strict mathematical proof. Numerical simulations demonstrate the exactness, effectiveness, and scalability of the proposed privacy-preserving approach.</description></item><item><title>Moment-Based Distributionally Robust Peer-to-Peer Transactive Energy Trading Framework Between Networked Microgrids, Smart Parking Lots and Electricity Distribution Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10190171</link><description>This paper proposes a decentralized scheduling framework for peer-to-peer (P2P) transactive energy trading between prosumers and the local electricity market (LEM). In this approach, prosumers are modeled in the form of networked microgrids (NMG) and smart parking lots (SPL), which can exchange energy in a P2P framework. At the same time, each of the prosumers exchanges information and energy with the LEM in a decentralized approach based on the distribution locational marginal price (DLMP). The LEM is modeled by an active radial electricity distribution network (EDN), considering a high penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) and the feeder power losses in a convex optimization model. In proposed P2P transactive energy model, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has been used to achieve the equilibrium point between peers. The distributionally robust optimization (DRO) method has been used to model the uncertain behavior of RES in NMGs, SPLs, and the EDN. In addition, the impact of applying smart charging strategies for electric vehicles (EV) in the proposed P2P transactive energy model has been investigated. To confirm the functionality of the model, 12-bus, 6-bus, and 4-bus networks have been used to model NMGs, while the EDN is embodied by a standard IEEE 33-bus and 123-bus test systems.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Operating Envelope-Enabled P2P Trading to Maximize Financial Returns of Prosumers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10188896</link><description>This paper presents a new dynamic operating envelope (DOE)-integrated peer-to-peer (P2P) trading scheme to increase the exchange of electricity from prosumers to a distribution network without jeopardising the network constraints. First, a DOE computation mechanism is designed to estimate the power export and import limits for prosumers at different time slots. Second, considering the DOE-estimated export and import limits, a network-aware P2P trading framework is developed utilising cooperative game theory. The key properties of the P2P coalition are studied, as well as the incentive-compatibility and stability are also confirmed. Finally, an algorithm is proposed that enables prosumers to form a stable and incentive-compatible network-aware P2P coalition and fairly distribute the total coalition benefit among themselves. With extensive simulations, it is demonstrated that the modelled P2P trading structure allows prosumers to export more electricity to the low-voltage (LV) network safely compared to existing techniques while keeping bus voltages and line loading within acceptable margins. Subsequently, by trading more power locally, prosumers can substantially mitigate their electricity costs.</description></item><item><title>A Federated Byzantine Agreement Model to Operate Offline Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10227349</link><description>Providing equitable and resilient electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) to remote locations with limited access to the Internet infrastructure is one of the paradoxes in the decarbonization plan. In this paper, we develop an electric vehicle (EV) charging management system comprised of offline EVSEs based on a Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) system. To enable offline peer-to-peer (P2P) authentication between the user&#8217;s device (UD) and EVSE stations, we use a distributed certificate management based on Shamir&#8217;s algorithm and blind signing approach using the ring signature. We introduce extended FBA for charge point operator (FBA-CPO) systems and include explicit operational functions to ensure the ledger dissemination and scalability of the network. We specifically employ a pre-authorized mechanism for deferral vouchers using a pre-signed and weighted signing method. In the FBA-CPO network, each charger records all transactions on a local ledger and publicly publishes ledgers through random UD nodes. Under a generalization of the property of the federated quorum system, the proposed approach could provide a reliable network centrality with or without offline EVSEs. Eventually, we examined the performance of the proposed model using a system of real devices and their digital twins. Results show the FBA-CPO satisfies all functional and cross-cutting requirements for a consistent transnational mechanism.</description></item><item><title>Virtual Power Plants Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading in Unbalanced Distribution Networks: A Distributed Robust Approach Against Communication Failures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10229177</link><description>In recent years, virtual power plants (VPPs) have been undergoing a rapid development to aggregate mushrooming distributed energy resources. In this paper, a distributed robust algorithm for VPPs&#8217; peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading is proposed which can improve the robustness against communication failures such as packet losses and computing node failures in the cyber layer. Firstly, a P2P energy trading framework suitable for VPPs located in the unbalanced distribution network managed by the distribution system operator (DSO) is proposed, which is a bi-level problem with the DSO standing at the higher level to solve the power flow model and VPP operators (VPPOs) following at the lower level to decide the bilateral trading quantity and prices. Herein, an enhanced linearized DistFlow model is developed to address the unbalanced distribution network. Then, a distributed algorithm wherein the DSO and VPPOs engage in an iterative negotiation process based on relaxed alternating direction method of multipliers (R-ADMM) is derived, which renders the VPPOs&#8217; parallel computation and preserves privacy. Furthermore, a robust version of the algorithm against communication failures (DRAACF) is developed. The economy, robustness, computational efficiency and scalability of the proposed approach are validated by simulation analyses based on the modified IEEE 13-bus and IEEE 123-bus distribution networks.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Cryptography-Based Architecture to Achieve Secure Energy Trading in Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10179950</link><description>With the advancement of distributed generation and information technology, energy trading in micro grid (MG) becomes popular in recent years. However, due to the lack of authority management in the MG, the traditional energy trading method with trusted system operator (SO) and market operator (MO) is no longer suitable. This paper proposes a novel, secure and privacy-preserving energy trading architecture with the state-of-the-art cryptosystem. Firstly, a zero-knowledge-proof based non-interactive protocol is proposed to authenticate prosumers. Next, a novel energy data evaluation method is proposed to achieve privacy-preserving power pricing and dispatching with the homomorphic encryption. Moreover, a lightweight tree-chained trading book is proposed to protect the transaction information. Then, we analysis the security performance and emphasize the advantages of our proposed architecture. At last, we exam the performance of our proposed methods in the IEEE benchmark systems. We observe that, our proposed architecture could achieve the privacy-preserving and secure energy trading in a low-time-cost but high-accuracy way.</description></item><item><title>Adversarial Dynamic Load-Altering Cyberattacks Against Peak Shaving Using Residential Electric Water Heaters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10197626</link><description>Innovative smart grid technologies such as demand-side management (DSM) and smart home systems promise more optimal energy consumption; however, they expose the grid to load-altering cyberattacks wherein adversaries take control of customers&#8217; connected high-wattage appliances and consequently induce harmful load fluctuations. In this article, we present a novel adversarial machine learning algorithm powered by black-box optimization to synthesize stealthy dynamic load-altering attacks aiming at evading existing intrusion detection measures while maximizing the damage inflicted on the grid. The proposed algorithm is applied on a case study involving peak shaving using direct load control of residential electric water heaters. It is capable of designing stealthy attacks that can increase the detectors&#8217; misclassification probability by up to 44%. It can also be adapted to other load-altering attacks involving different DSM programs or other classes of loads. The algorithm can be used by electric power utilities to evaluate and harden the robustness of their cybersecurity solutions.</description></item><item><title>A General Real-Time Cyberattack Risk Assessment Method for Distribution Network Involving the Influence of Feeder Automation System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10226606</link><description>The power system has become the key target of national cyber confrontation. To enhance the risk management capability of the distribution network (DN) while assessing the cyberattack risk quickly and accurately, this paper proposes a general real-time cyberattack risk assessment method for DN involving the influence of distributed feeder automation systems (DFAs). In particular, to clarify the quantitative relationship between cyberattack intrusion and DN state deterioration, we constructed the quantitative model of the cyber physical distribution network (CPDN) under cyberattack, which involves the influence of DFAs&#8217; behavior. In addition, in order to intuitively demonstrate the cyberattack risk, we developed a novel entropy-like risk assessment system upon the quantitative model of CPDN. The real two-feeder test platform with cyberattack simulation devices is used to verify the correctness and practicality of the proposed method. In this process, a digital cyberattack risk assessment unit is created, contributing to the system-level application of risk management.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Event-Based Resilient Secondary Control for AC Microgrids: A Trust-Reputation Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10210689</link><description>A new resilient distributed secondary control for AC microgrids is studied based on event-triggered mechanisms and trust-reputation evaluation methods. When distributed generators (DGs) in a microgrid are subject to attacks, their transmitted state information would be tampered and thus affect the dynamics of normal generators. In order to isolate possible attacks, two types of trust evaluation metrics with different attack indices and time scales are designed, by which the performance of neighboring DGs can be assessed for specific practical demands. Based on the trust values of each neighbor, a reputation-propagation method is introduced at triggered time instants to determine whether a DG is under attack by comprehensively incorporating the opinion of mutual neighbors. The dynamic updating law of the communication edge weights is utilized with the derived reputation values. Based on this, a distributed Zeno-free event-triggered control protocols for voltage/frequency restoration and active power sharing are proposed. Sufficient conditions for picking proper control parameters are given in the main theorem. Lastly, the simulations are conducted in MATLAB/SimPowerSystems for several scenarios to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Online Recursive Detection and Adaptive Fuzzy Mitigation of Cyber-Physical Attacks Targeting Topology of IMG: An LFC Case Study</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10215089</link><description>Due to the low inertia of inverter-based islanded microgrids (IMGs), these systems require a delicate and accurate load frequency control (LFC) scheme. The deployment of such a control scheme, which preserves the balance between the load and generation, needs a cyber layer on top of the physical system that makes IMGs an appealing target for a variety of cyber-physical attacks (CPAs). Among these CPAs, there is a family of malicious CPAs whose aim is to compromise the LFC scheme by changing the topology of IMG and its parameters. On this basis, an online system identification method is developed to estimate the parameters of IMG using the recursive least square forgetting factor (RLS-FF) approach. Then, based on the estimated parameters, an anomaly-based intrusion detection system (IDS) is developed to identify CPAs and distinguish them from the uncertainties in the normal operation of IMG. Following anomaly detection, a mitigation scheme is proposed to regulate the IMG&#8217;s frequency using an adaptive interval type-2 fuzzy logic controller (IT2FLC). The proposed IT2FLC uses different types of distributed energy resources (DERs)&#8212;i.e., tidal power plants and solar panels which are, respectively, equipped with inertia emulation and droop-based controllers&#8212;to improve the frequency excursion resulting from CPAs. The simulation results verify the performance of the developed detection and mitigation schemes, particularly when the RLS-FF parameters, i.e., forgetting factor, covariance matrix, and reset parameter, are obtained through the grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm. Furthermore, the designed mitigation scheme is corroborated by comparing its performance with several well-known attack-resilient control frameworks in LFC studies, e.g., linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and  $H_{\infty }$ , using real-time simulations.</description></item><item><title>Matrix-Completion-Based False Data Injection Attacks Against Machine Learning Detectors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10231128</link><description>False data injection (FDI) attacks can manipulate power system measurements, leading to system economic losses and security issues. Although machine-learning (ML) detectors can effectively detect FDI attacks, the current methods used to construct FDI attacks do not take into account the presence of ML detectors. To tackle this problem, we propose novel convex matrix-completion-based FDI (MC-FDI) attacks on DC and AC power flow models from an attacker&#8217;s perspective, accounting for the temporal correlation between compromised and historical measurements. The proposed attacks minimize the nuclear norm of the compromised measurement matrix to make the compromised measurement consistent with the historical measurements, and also maximize the L1-norm of the incremental voltage angle to ensure a sufficient negative impact on the power system operation. Moving target defense (MTD) is proposed to detect the proposed MC-FDI attacks from the defender&#8217;s standpoint. The idea is to actively change the line impedance to corrupt the spatial and temporal correlation of the compromised measurements in the MC-FDI attacks. Numerical results on the IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems show the stealthiness of the proposed attacks to both the Chi-square detector and ML detectors as well as the efficacy of MTD in detecting the MC-FDI attacks.</description></item><item><title>Design and Defense of Modal Resonance-Oriented Cyber-Attack Against Wide-Area Damping Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10250853</link><description>Most existing cyber-attacks are steady state-oriented attacks, not dynamic ones. Moreover, dynamic modal interaction between cyber layers and physical layers is not considered in current studies. This paper firstly proposes a novel modal resonance-oriented cyber-attack (MROCA) against wide-area damping control (WADC). MROCA, as a dynamic cyber-attack, analyzes the signal sent to WADC in the cyber layer and then estimates the critical oscillation mode of the physical layer without acquiring the system parameters. Then MROCA is designed to stimulate the open-loop modal resonance between the virtual oscillation mode of MROCA and the critical mode of the physical layer, thereby degrading the stability of cyber-physical power systems (CPPSs). Furthermore, the connection between MROCA and typical cyber-attacks is investigated, and the impact of MROCA on the stability of CPPSs is quantified by the modal movement with respect to the parameters of MROCA. Additionally, the corresponding defense strategy is proposed to inject the signal corresponding to the reverse mode of MROCA, thereby offsetting the negative impact of attacks. Finally, the proposed work is tested in the IEEE 39-bus benchmark system and the practical provincial power system. Simulation results indicate that the proposed MROCA will excite the open-loop modal resonance and reduce the stability of CPPS. The proposed defense strategy can accurately estimate the injected mode signal and ensure system stability when the system is attacked by MROCA.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Source Data Aggregation and Real-Time Anomaly Classification and Localization in Power Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10253676</link><description>This paper proposes a real-time anomaly location and classification framework for power distribution systems to simultaneously determine the type of anomaly (i.e., short-circuit fault, cyber attack, DER switching) and its location. The proposed framework employs the data aggregation module to collect the measurement data from multiple field devices operating at different sampling rates, such as protection relays and D-PMUs. The output of the data aggregation is then fed into a multi-task learning-based long-based short-term memory (MTL-LSTM) to classify the type of anomaly and the location in two separate tasks. The proposed MTL-LSTM approach can be utilized in real-time operation in order to distinguish between normal and several anomalous operations and locate the anomaly. The proposed framework is tested on a modified IEEE 33-bus test feeder benchmark that integrates solar generation and energy storage. The results show that the proposed framework can locate and classify anomalies for several operation conditions with more than 96% accuracy. Further experiments highlight the impact of aggregating multiple sources of data on the performance of the proposed model.</description></item><item><title>Enabling Efficient and Malicious Secure Data Aggregation in Smart Grid With False Data Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10254595</link><description>As the next-generation power grid, the smart grid has significantly improved dependability, flexibility, and efficiency compared with the traditional power grid. However, due to increasingly diverse application requirements, it faces challenges on balancing data privacy, efficiency, and robustness. In this paper, we present a fog computing-based smart grid model. In addition, based on the proposed model, we construct an efficient and privacy-preserving scheme that supports malicious secure smart grid usage data aggregation communication. To our best knowledge, this is the first concrete smart grid solution that concurrently achieves secure aggregation communication, data privacy, and data robustness (e.g., false data detection). Specifically, benefiting from Boolean/Arithmetic secret-sharing methods, our proposed scheme allows home users to report their electricity usage data to the cloud and fogs securely. Besides, a false data detection protocol is proposed to resist false data injection attacks launched by malicious home users. Theoretical analysis and experimental implementation show that our scheme efficiently achieves data security, anonymity, and robustness.</description></item><item><title>Unsupervised Anomaly Detection and Diagnosis in Power Electronic Networks: Informative Leverage and Multivariate Functional Clustering Approaches</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292588</link><description>We propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection and diagnosis algorithm in power electronic networks. Since most anomaly detection and diagnosis algorithms in the literature are based on supervised methods that can hardly be generalized to broader scenarios, we propose unsupervised algorithms. Our algorithm extracts the Time-Frequency Domain (TFD) features from the three-phase currents and three-phase voltages of the point of coupling (PCC) nodes to detect anomalies and distinguish between different types of anomalies, such as cyber-attacks and physical faults. To detect anomalies through TFD features, we propose a novel Informative Leveraging for Anomaly Detection (ILAD) algorithm. The proposed unsupervised ILAD algorithm automatically extracts noise-reduced anomalous signals, resulting in more accurate anomaly detection results than other score-based methods. To assign anomaly types for anomaly diagnosis, we apply a novel Multivariate Functional Principal Component Analysis (MFPCA) clustering method. Unlike the deep learning methods, the MFPCA clustering method does not require labels for training and provides more accurate results than other deep embedding-based clustering approaches. Furthermore, it is even comparable to supervised algorithms in both offline and online experiments. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed unsupervised framework accomplishing anomaly detection and anomaly diagnosis tasks is the first of its kind in power electronic networks.</description></item><item><title>Quantile-Mixer: A Novel Deep Learning Approach for Probabilistic Short-Term Load Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10171210</link><description>As the power grid becomes more complex and dynamic, accurate short-term load forecasting (STLF) with probabilistic information is a prerequisite for various smart grid applications. For doing this, various deep learning models have been proposed, and recent models increase model size and complexity to achieve better accuracy which could also increase the burden on model design, computation time, and resources. To this end, we propose a novel deep learning model for accurate and efficient probabilistic STLF (PSTLF). First, we develop an STLF model utilizing the multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-mixer structure, i.e., MLP-mixer for STLF (MM-STLF), that has an advantage in forecasting accuracy and efficiency compared to the other deep learning models. Then, we propose a random quantile regression (RQR) method that takes a cumulative probability  $\tau $  as an input to the model and is trained on random  $\tau \text{s}$ . By combining MM-STLF and RQR, we develop a novel deep-PSTLF model, namely quantile-mixer (Q-mixer). We evaluate the overall performance of the proposed model with seven load datasets in terms of prediction error, model size, and inference time, respectively. Through experiments, various STLF models and probabilistic forecasting methods are compared, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Q-mixer in load forecasting.</description></item><item><title>A Contextual Bandit Approach for Value-Oriented Prediction Interval Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10185994</link><description>Prediction interval (PI) is an effective tool to quantify uncertainty and usually serves as an input to downstream robust optimization. Traditional approaches focus on improving the quality of PI in the view of statistical scores and assume the improvement in quality will lead to a higher value in the power systems operation. However, such an assumption cannot always hold in practice. In this paper, we propose a value-oriented PI forecasting approach, which aims at reducing operational costs in downstream operations. For that, it is required to issue PIs with the guidance of operational costs in robust optimization, which is addressed within the contextual bandit framework here. Concretely, the agent is used to select the optimal quantile proportion, while the environment reveals the costs in operations as rewards to the agent. As such, the agent can learn the policy of quantile proportion selection for minimizing the operational cost. The numerical study regarding the day-ahead and real-time operation of a virtual power plant verifies the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of operational value. And it is especially evident in the context of extensive penetration of wind power.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Feedback Linearization Control of Distributed Energy Resources Using Sparse Regression</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10190751</link><description>A complex physics-based modeling procedure and the uncertainty and confidentiality of internal parameters of distributed energy resources (DERs) motivate system identification tools for control purposes in smart grids. This paper develops a framework for data-driven nonlinear modeling and control of DERs using sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy). Using the proposed data-driven model for closed-loop control, we demonstrate the effectiveness of a model-free design in stability analysis of DERs in smart grids. Feedback linearization control of DERs was chosen over conventional vector control in this research due to its superior capability of accounting for DER nonlinearities and weak AC grid integration. Compared with existing physics-based designs that heavily rely on knowing the detailed system dynamics or uninterpretable data-driven designs that rely on large historical data, the proposed model-free DER identification and control framework can accurately capture the dynamics of the DERs based on available measurements and provide guaranteed performance for black-start, weak AC grid integration, microgrid integration, and stability analysis. Real-time and offline simulations in addition to a detailed eigenvalue analysis are conducted to compare the effectiveness of the proposed data-driven approach with physics-based controllers.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Joint Regulations of Frequency and Voltage for TSO-DSO Coordination: A Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10208157</link><description>The increasing scale of distributed energy resources (DERs) in the active distribution network (ADN) offers valuable opportunities for distribution system operators (DSOs) to assist transmission system operators (TSOs) in regulating operational issues and reducing overall operational costs. The paper proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based TSO-DSO coordination framework for jointly regulating the frequency and voltage measured at the grid supply point (GSP) of the transmission network (TN) with a sufficient utilization of control flexibility of converter-based DERs. To facilitate MADRL, a simple grid partitioning method is employed for the balanced partitioning of ADNs with the connectivity constraint imposed on each sub-region. On this basis, a MADRL algorithm is designed by combining the QMIX and twin delayed deep deterministic policy (TD3) algorithm for an effective optimization of the decentralized regulation scheme. The proposed QMIX-TD3 is equipped with the graph convolutional network (GCN) for its temporal-spatial learning ability to tackle the challenges of the complicated transmission and distribution (T/D) system dynamics. In addition, a policy smooth regularization (PSR) loss is proposed to damp action oscillations and enhance sample efficiency. Experiments on the integrated T/D system demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively mitigate the impact of system disturbances and therefore benefit the system operation.</description></item><item><title>Receding-Horizon Chiller Operation Planning via Collaborative Neurodynamic Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10217176</link><description>Optimal chiller loading is crucial to reduce energy consumption in chiller operation planning. In existing methods for planning with heterogeneous chillers, minimum-up/down-time constraints are not imposed. This paper addresses receding-horizon chiller operation planning via collaborative neurodynamic optimization. A mixed-integer optimization problem with minimum-up/down-time constraints is formulated for receding-horizon chiller loading with heterogeneous chillers. It is then decomposed into a binary optimization subproblem and a global optimization subproblem, to facilitate the planning process. A neurodynamics-driven algorithm is proposed based on paired discrete Hopfield networks and projection neural networks to solve the subproblems alternatingly and iteratively. Experimental results based on the specifications of two chiller systems are elaborated to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Privacy Preserving User Energy Consumption Profiling: From Theory to Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10251453</link><description>The smart grid benefits and suffers from smart meter data. Proper use of massive data can improve energy services but may raise privacy concerns. For example, user energy consumption profiling, a classic method, can identify energy consumption patterns based on the collected load profiles from users. Thus, the privacy of these individual load profiles needs to be protected. However, most of the existing works focus on data transmission and calculation privacy, and often require additional computation, communication, or platform construction costs. In contrast, noise-injection-based data source privacy-protecting works can avoid such additional costs and provide theoretical differential privacy (DP) guarantee. This paper theoretically analyzes noise-injection-based user profiling mechanisms in terms of both privacy protection and accuracy. Specifically, we establish the privacy-accuracy trade-off. We then propose an optimal user energy consumption pattern estimation method for heterogeneous noise-injection-based data. Finally, we design a valid information ratio-based pricing scheme for noisy data that is independent of downstream tasks and easy to implement. Numerical studies based on field data confirm the effectiveness of our theoretical results.</description></item><item><title>MITS: Mobility-Aware Intelligent Task Scheduling in Vehicular Fog Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10273770</link><description>Vehicular Fog Computing (VFC) has emerged as a captivating research paradigm to increase computing resources for Internet of Vehicles (IoV) applications. However, the allocation of the best possible computing resources is challenging due to the enormous growth of services in vehicular networks, such as augmented reality, 3-D gaming, autonomous driving, etc., and their severe delay limitations, processing demands, and mobility of vehicles. Mainly, achieving strict task latency is a challenging problem while vehicles traverse through the roadside unit (RSU) regions. In this work, the vehicle's task processing latency and energy consumption are considered by deciding which tasks should be scheduled to either the local RSU or the neighbour RSUs along the vehicle's path. We study the mobility-aware task scheduling problem to jointly optimize the service latency of the tasks and energy consumption of the vehicles. Initially, we employ the Markov renewal process (MRP) to model the vehicle's mobility. Subsequently, we establish that our proposed objective function is a monotone submodular function and provide a greedy heuristic for the maximization of the submodular function with an approximation of ($1-\frac{1}{\mathrm{e}}$). Further, we propose a hybrid optimization algorithm that combines particle swarm optimization (PSO) and simulated annealing (SA) algorithms to solve mobility-aware task scheduling problems for large-scale networks. We compare our proposed algorithm with existing mobility-aware scheduling approaches and simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs efficiently for task scheduling problems.</description></item><item><title>Collaborative Computing Optimization in Train-Edge-Cloud-Based Smart Train Systems Using Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10288258</link><description>With the advent of the intelligent and digital era, intelligent urban rail transit systems have been a research focus. As the core part of intelligent urban rail transit systems, smart trains are empowered by various intelligent applications. While improving system performance and reducing system risk, intelligent applications demand a large amount of computing power. However, it is challenging to provide simultaneously all intelligent applications for smart trains due to limited on-board computing resources. In this article, we design a train-edge-cloud (TEC) collaborative computing framework for train intelligent computing tasks. We aim to develop a TEC-based collaborative computing scheme to minimize the task processing delay with edge computing resource constraints. Considering the unique environment of smart train systems, we design a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to realize collaborative computing optimization. We design a novel risk function in the system by jointly considering the computing load of edge intelligence (EI) servers and the characteristics of the urban rail transit systems. Moreover, we optimize the proposed risk-sensitive RL algorithm by using quantum representation and functions to accelerate its convergence speed. We design the TEC-based collaborative computing framework and design the quantum-inspired risk-sensitive RL algorithm to formulate the strategies for task scheduling. Comprehensive simulation results indicate that the algorithm adopted in this article can significantly reduce the task processing delay while satisfying EI servers' computing resource constraints. The quantum-inspired-optimized risk-sensitive RL model dramatically improves the model convergence speed.</description></item><item><title>Predictive Recruitment in Vehicular Crowdsensing Based on Spatial Sensing Strength Analysis Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10290938</link><description>Vehicular crowdsensing is an efficient method of data collection in cities, benefiting from the powerful moving and sensing capabilities of intelligent vehicles. Modeling sensing capacities of vehicles and analyzing sensing effect based on sensor setup schemes are crucial in vehicular crowdsensing system. If we can infer the sensing strength of vehicles towards surrounding spatial points in advance, it would facilitate the determination of which vehicles to recruit for uploading sensing data, thereby achieving uniform and wide sensing coverage. However, the sensing strength of vehicles is not considered in the current research due to the diversity of sensors deployed on vehicles and the complexity of spatial relationships among vehicles in actual traffic scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a predictive vehicle recruitment method based on spatial sensing strength analysis. First, a fine-grained method is proposed to analyze the sensing strength of vehicles with different sensor setup schemes at various points in space. We fuse the sensing results of multiple vehicles and design novel metrics to evaluate the overall sensing effect, which comprehensively consider sensing strength, uniformity, and coverage ratio. The proposed method innovatively combines the perceptual properties of actual sensors and the complex spatiotemporal relationships among vehicles. Then, to guarantee the timeliness of recruiting vehicles, we distinguish moving modes to predict vehicle movements and further obtain the spatial sensing strength of vehicles at a specific moment in the future. Furthermore, combined with the sensing and communicating capabilities of the roadside infrastructure, the vehicle recruitment problem is described as an optimization problem under multiple practical constraints. To address this problem, an online heuristic algorithm is proposed based on the predicted vehicles' sensing strength. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations based on a real dataset to visualize vehicle sensing effect and verify the superiority of the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>Joint Communication and Control Optimization of a UAV-Assisted Multi-Vehicle Platooning System in Uncertain Communication Environment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304322</link><description>In the context of intelligent and networked transportation, vehicle platoon control technology is an essential measure for improving overall vehicle traffic efficiency, reducing driving energy consumption, increasing driver comfort and driving safety, and easing traffic congestion. However, in high-speed mobile states, vehicles face an uncertain communication environment, making it difficult to meet the demand for multi-vehicle cooperative control. To address the existing research deficiencies, this paper investigates a UAV-assisted multi-vehicle cooperative platoon system. The paper aims to improve the communication success probability between vehicles and UAV nodes while mitigating the velocity perturbations generated by the platoon during travel. Specifically, we design a platoon controller based on a discrete double integral model and a joint optimization model for resource scheduling of air-ground communication. This model can flexibly adjust the communication resource allocation of each platooning vehicle within each timeslot according to the communication link. Due to the complex coupling between the variables of the objective function and the constraints of the optimization problem, we design an optimization iterative solution method based on sequential quadratic programming (SQP). Finally, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed joint optimization method through simulation experiments compared to benchmark methods.</description></item><item><title>Traffic Information-Based Hierarchical Control Strategies for Eco-Driving of Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292883</link><description>The development of intelligent transportation technology provides a great opportunity for energy efficiency improvement of electrified vehicles. However, for plug-in hybrid vehicles, eco-driving control usually involves three problems, including speed planning, SOC planning, and energy management. Solving the above three problems requires considering not only the fuel economy but also the computational efficiency. To this end, this paper proposes a hierarchical control strategy to improve driving comfort and fuel economy simultaneously for a PHEV. Specifically, three main contributions are presented to distinguish our efforts from the existing research. First, in the control framework, the traffic light information is utilized to calculate optimal driving speed by minimizing a multi-objective function. Then, the SOC planning problem is solved by convex optimization, while the fuel consumption is minimized by a predictive equivalent consumption minimization strategy. Second, the speed trajectories and fuel consumptions in the other two traffic scenarios with different traffic light SPaT (Signal Phasing and Timing) are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, the robustness with respect to prediction horizon length, initial co-state value, and gain coefficient value are analyzed and discussed.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Adaptive Fault-Tolerant Control for High-Speed Trains Using Multi-Agent System Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10301690</link><description>In this paper, the speed and position tracking problem of high-speed trains is investigated in the presence of actuator faults. A multi-agent system model is constructed, where each vehicle of the train is regarded as a controllable agent. A distributed adaptive controller is then proposed for healthy train system based on terminal sliding mode control. Further, a distributed adaptive fault-tolerant controller (DAFC) is designed for high-speed trains considering actuator faults, and an auxiliary system is introduced to cope with the influence of input saturation. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the distributed fault-tolerant control is considered in a multi-agent system model, which can better utilize the residual power of each vehicle when actuator faults occur. The stability of the closed-loop control system is analyzed through Lyapunov theory, and it is proven that the speed and position tracking errors of all vehicles are cooperative convergence. The simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DAFC. Compared with the existing method, the proposed DAFC reduces the average speed and position control errors by 54.3$\%$ and 55$\%$, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Four-Wheel Independent Drive Vehicle Fault Tolerant Strategy Using Stochastic Model Predictive Control With Model Parameter Uncertainties</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287580</link><description>With the popularity and increasing demand of new energy automotive, four-wheel independent drive electric vehicles (4WID-EVs) and its distributed control mode is promising to be a better chassis architecture for its flexibility and maneuverability. However, due to the uncertainty of the vehicle internal time-varying parameters and imprecise fault detection method, a novel robust fault estimator-based stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) is proposed in this article to ensure the vehicle lateral motion control and track the desired longitudinal velocity considering the estimation error of motor failure degree. Firstly, a robust H-infinity fault estimator with a linear parameter-varying (LPV) model is established to estimate the real-time fault signal considering the external disturbance and parameter perturbation (i.g. longitudinal and lateral vehicle speed). Then, a SMPC controller framework is developed to alleviate the effect of inevitable evaluated estimation error while the vehicle lateral safety and vehicle speed tracking can be ensured. Finally, the hardware-in-loop (HIL) tests are conducted to prove the feasibility of SMPC controller. The experiment results indicate that the proposed controller framework can effectively preserve vehicle stability and keep vehicle in a healthy state with faster response compared with the traditional fault-tolerant controller.</description></item><item><title>An Electric Vehicle-Oriented Approach for Battery Multi-Constraint State of Power Estimation Under Constant Power Operations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10274132</link><description>State of power (SOP) reflects the peak power capability of a lithium-ion battery (LIB). Constant power (CP) operation (e.g., discharge or charge) is more representative of actual battery loadings in electric vehicle (EV) applications (e.g., EV acceleration, gradient climbing and regenerative braking) than constant current or constant voltage operation. However, relevant research on CP-based SOP estimation for LIBs in EVs is still rare. In this article, a novel model switching-based iterative algorithm is proposed for multi-constraint SOP estimation under a CP operation scenario. Two state-space models with implicit representations are constructed to describe the indirect relationships between a given CP over a prediction window and the maximum look-ahead current/voltage at the end of this window. An unscented Kalman filter-based correction strategy is applied to determine the dominant limitation factor so as to pinpoint battery SOP in high fidelity. Moreover, a SOP testing approach is designed to calibrate reference SOPs in high precision for validations.

In particular, the commercial vehicle requires an electrical-powered multiple motor based steering system generating large steering torque, which can replace the existing hydraulic steering one. However, the control of such system become more complicate than controlling of a single actuator and must deal with the unavoidable non-synchronous nature of multiple motors. In line with the trends and issues, many automobile manufacturers are currently paying attention to the robust and efficient motion controls of a dual-motor driving steer-by-wire (DSBW). Therefore, we proposed a novel synchronous motion control system of DSBW using passive decomposition and sliding mode control (SMC) techniques guaranteeing the passivity and robustness of the overall synchronized motion. Furthermore, the performance of proposed control system is validated through HILS of an actual DSBW using a developed vehicle model and an optimal finite preview control (OFPC) scheme tracking a specific test scenario, Double Lane Change (DLC). It is found that the motor-to-motor synchronization error and tracking one for the target reference trajectory are less than 1 degree, which sufficiently meets the requirement of automobiles manufacture company and is comparable to other existing approaches. We also investigated the tracking performance of the control system based on the different steering characteristics of OFPCs generated by the several preview times. Moreover, we investigated the tolerance level of proposed technique (without any additional FTC) against a partial fault condition in one of the motors and compared it with other control schemes in terms of tracking performance. This work will be valuable asset for those who wish to design the robust synchronous motion control of DSBW and construct the corresponding HILS of system considering different steering characteristics.</description></item><item><title>Triple-Active Bridge-Based Dynamic Power Balancing Solution for Minimizing Overdesigning in Military Aircraft Power System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10275060</link><description>Military aircraft are an excellent example of custom-designed power grids, powering a mix of both steady and transient intermittent loads. The electrical power system (EPS) in military aircraft like F-35, consists of two sets of 270 V-HVDC buses powering these loads. During real-time operation, switching in of these intermittent loads will lead to unequal loading of HVDC buses, resulting in overloading/underloading of HVDC buses and higher conduction losses on the overloaded bus. For satisfactory performance, both the HVDC buses in the EPS are overdesigned. This anomaly arises because, in the current architecture, there is no provision for controlled power exchange between the two HVDC buses. This article proposes a novel Triple-Active Bridge (TAB) converter-based solution to address this concern without adding extra weight to the overall system. To achieve optimal performance and operational efficiency for bidirectional power flow in HVDC buses, a novel decoupled current control integrated with duty-cycle optimization is proposed. Simulation results validating the decoupled bidirectional power flow control are presented in detail. Compared to conventional control (phase-control alone), the proposed algorithm results in at least a 30% reduction in conduction losses. A 1&#8201;kW hardware prototype is developed, and experimental results showing bidirectional power flow and higher operating efficiency are demonstrated.</description></item><item><title>A Rolling Convergent Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10285067</link><description>Energy management strategy (EMS) is regarded as a crucial measure to further leverage the benefits of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). However, existing EMSs often fail to balance applicability and optimality. As a widely recognized instantaneous optimization strategy, equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) is considered to be competitive to achieve the desired performance, provided that equivalent factor (EF) is properly tuned. To achieve this goal, a rolling convergent ECMS for energy management of PHEV is proposed in this article. Instead of seeking the instantaneous solution solely from two-dimensional scale like traditional ECMS, this article extends the analysis to three-dimensional global scale. And the analytic expression of the optimal EF initial interval is derived, which can be quantitatively described by the component specifications of PHEV and driving condition information. Subsequently, inheriting the obtained optimal EF initial interval, a rolling convergent method using tabu search is developed for more efficient optimization. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified by simulation and experiment. The results show that the proposed strategy improves the fuel economy of PHEV by 3.7% and 5.2% over that using the traditional adaptive ECMS under two real-world driving cycles, respectively. And the validity of the optimal EF initial interval is corroborated under several typical driving cycles. Furthermore, the proposed strategy is performed on the test bench, demonstrating its superiority and practicality.</description></item><item><title>Cyclic Impulse Spectrum Analysis of Time-Frequency Slices for Axle-Box Bearing Fault Identification</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10294216</link><description>For the incipient fault weakness, irregular pulse disturbance, and pseudo-cyclic periodicity of localized damage impact in the fault diagnosis of axle-box bearing (ABB) under complex service environments, the cyclic impulse spectrum (CIS) based on time-frequency spectrogram slicing is proposed to discriminate repetitive transients under noise contamination. In this approach, a new indicator called the cyclic impulse degree (CID) is designed based on the coefficient of variation of the impulse peak moment within a specified time-shifted periodic window, which allows for a generalization of impulsiveness and pseudo-cyclic periodicity to quantify the characteristics of bearing fault impacts. First, the normalized S transform (NST) highlights the energy distribution of fault impacts in the time&#8211;frequency plane, from which the CID is constructed to distinguish the cyclic impulses from random transients. Secondly, the NST slice at the frequency associated with the maximum integrated CID is used as a spare representation of fault impact response. Finally, the CIS derived from the NST slice presents the fault characteristic frequencies clearly and accurately. The numerical simulation and data processing results of the ABB faults demonstrated that the CIS can identify the multiple faults of ABB, but also exhibits good performance in resisting random transient interference and discriminating noise-contaminated periodic impulses caused by the bearing localized defects.</description></item><item><title>Simultaneous Estimation and Receding Horizon Sliding Control of Dog Clutch Coupling With Backlash for Rear Electrical Drivelines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10294311</link><description>Compared to friction clutches, dog clutches have the advantages of high efficiency, small size, low cost, and large transmission torque; therefore, they are selected for use in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) with a single electric motor (EM) driving the rear axle. In the dog clutch coupling process, the meshing of the teeth produces an impact, and dynamic control of the clutch faces problems of backlash and flexible shaft control. For an advanced dynamic study and subsequent improved performance, a novel dynamic estimation algorithm is proposed. This algorithm includes an observer for estimating the clutch torque, two piecewise-affine (PWA) estimators for estimating the torsion angle and half-shaft torque, and a state machine for indicating the backlash position. To demonstrate its feasibility, the convergence rate and observation error are investigated. Based on the information obtained through dynamic estimation, a second-order receding horizon sliding control (RHSC) approach is proposed. In dog clutch coupling, the speed deviation and tracing torque set points, which correspond to different backlash positions, are the control targets. Based on the second-order sliding mode structure, an optimization algorithm is developed and its convergence is studied. The performance of the estimator and control method is verified through road tests. The results show that the estimator can correctly indicate the system state and that the control method can improve the performance of the powertrain.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Regenerative Braking Control Strategy for Electric Vehicles Based on Braking Intention Recognition and Load Estimation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10298604</link><description>Regenerative braking technology plays a crucial role in recovering braking energy and extending the range of electric vehicles. To maximize energy recovery and ensure braking stability across various road conditions, loads, and braking intentions, an optimal regenerative braking control strategy is proposed. Firstly, the driver's braking intention is recognized using optimized modal features extracted from the brake pedal signal. Vehicle load estimation is then performed using a forgetting factor recursive least squares algorithm. Subsequently, an artificial bee colony optimization algorithm is employed to allocate optimal braking forces between the front and rear axles for different braking intentions and loads. Based on the obtained braking force distribution ratio, an optimal regenerative braking control strategy is developed, considering braking stability and energy recovery safety. The proposed strategy is validated on the dSPACE hard-in-loop platform under various simulated conditions, including different road conditions, braking intentions, and loads. The results demonstrate that braking intention, vehicle load, and road conditions all impact the regenerative braking process of electric vehicles. Moreover, the proposed regenerative braking control strategy significantly enhances the energy recovery rate and effectively reduces braking distance.</description></item><item><title>Imbalance Cost-Aware Energy Scheduling for Prosumers Towards UAM Charging: A Matching and Multi-Agent DRL Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10301640</link><description>In this paper, an energy scheduling problem is formulated for the prosumer-based urban area, where prosumers are regarded as the drone charging stations for urban air mobility (UAM). Particularly, since electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft (eVTOL) is regarded as the anticipated technique for future UAM, we consider eVTOL drone taxis for transporting passengers. The objective is to minimize the overall energy supply-demand imbalance cost. This problem covers two aspects: 1) association between passengers and eVTOLs, and 2) energy balance strategy determination through power grid energy scheduling for each prosumer. For the first aspect, a destination collision-aware Gale-Shapely matching game (DC-MG) approach is proposed, where the distance concern of passengers, the remaining energy of eVTOLs, and the destination collision are comprehensively considered. Subsequently, hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAGC)-based multi-agent dueling double deep Q network (MA3DQN) with a multi-step bootstrapping (MSB) approach (CMA3DQN) is proposed, where the input (i.e., energy demand) depends on the output of the first aspect. Particularly, the HAGC approach is adopted to group all prosumers into several agents to reduce the input feature size of each agent. Then the MA3DQN with MSB approach is applied to achieve the best grid energy balance strategy per prosumer. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Particularly, the imbalance cost achieved by the proposed joint method is separately $128.71\times$, $12.57\times$, and $11.72\times$ less than the random energy scheduling approach, the independent multi-agent dueling DQN approach, and the approach of employing the double deep Q network per cluster.</description></item><item><title>Performance Analysis of RIS-Assisted Full-Duplex Communication Over Correlated Nakagami-$m$ Fading Channel</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10275022</link><description>In this article, we investigate the performance of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted full-duplex (FD) communication network, where each user is facilitated by a specific RIS in the network. The correlated Nakagami-$m$ fading channel is first considered in a RIS system, which is a general channel model that can capture the spatial correlation effect inherent in the RIS-assisted communication system. Using the two-dimensional Laplace transform and its inverse, the closed form expressions of the mean and variance of the signal power distribution are obtained. Then, the outage probability and average achievable rates of the uplink and downlink users are derived in closed form. Furthermore, the impact of the residual self-interference (SI) on FD communication performance is discussed. It is demonstrated that FD communication outperforms HD communication when the residual SI is below a threshold, and the threshold is derived in closed form. Simulation results are presented to confirm the accuracy of the theoretical analysis and show the negative impact of channel correlation on the system performance. Moreover, it is illustrated that the outage probability and the average achievable rate of the uplink user will converge to a constant when the residual SI is linearly dependent on the transmit power.</description></item><item><title>Online Trajectory Optimization for Energy-Efficient Cellular-Connected UAVs With Map Reconstruction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10275015</link><description>In this article, we leverage the outage probability knowledge map to characterize the connection between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and cellular networks. The outage probability knowledge map is a database that simulates the connection between UAV and the cellular network during real hovers, which helps to enhance the UAV's awareness of the environment and reduce the connection interruption under complex real-time channel state information. We assume that the UAV roughly samples from the actual radio environment of the airspace in advance, and calculates the outage probability of the sampled points. After that, the UAV reconstructs the actual outage knowledge map, and flies in the airspace to learn the optimal UAV trajectory planning policy based on the reconstructed map. The optimization objective is to minimize the flight energy cost of the UAV performing tasks. In this article, we propose a deep image prior based radio map reconstruction (DIPRMR) method to reconstruct the map, and then propose a deep reinforcement learning based trajectory optimization algorithm. The UAV that performs the task adjusts the flight trajectory based on the outage probability knowledge obtained from the reconstructed complete map. Simulation results show that the proposed online trajectory optimization scheme based on outage probability knowledge map can obtain great returns in terms of maintaining connectivity, reducing task completion time and energy consumption.</description></item><item><title>Multifunctional Switched-Beam Antenna Located on Solar Cell for Vehicular to Satellite Communication</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10285606</link><description>In this article, a multifunctional beam forming architecture is studied in detail for intelligent transportation systems and advanced vehicular technologies.

This paper proposes a high-rate reflection STSK system based on a 3-D constellation and a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). To implement reflection phase shifting, a set of reflection dispersion matrices (RDMs) are constructed without power limit. To improve bandwidth efficiency, an additional phase is introduced to the selected 3-D constellation point and carries up to three bits. An upper bound for bit error rate (BER) is derived under maximum-likelihood (ML) detection. It is shown that both diversity gain and coding gain rely on the construction of the RDMs for the system. Accordingly, a genetic algorithm is proposed for randomly generating an optimal family of the RDMs and the additional phase parameter. Simulation results show that the proposed system can improve both bandwidth efficiency and power efficiency, when compared with the traditional 3-D STSK and RIS-based SSK-assisted Alamouti space-time block coding systems.</description></item><item><title>Throughput Maximization in Cellular Networks With Wireless Backhaul and Energy Harvesting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10285397</link><description>This article investigates the throughput maximization problem in cellular networks where a macro cell is overlaid with multiple small cells, and each small-cell base station (sBS) provides data links for wireless backhaul and energy links for energy harvesting (EH) nodes. The data links enable communication between sBSs, while the energy links facilitate radio-frequency-based energy harvesting by EH nodes. Efficient scheduling of these links is crucial for enhancing network throughput while fulfilling the energy requirements of the EH nodes. To tackle this challenge, a mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP) and a minimizing power problem are formulated to derive a link schedule for both types of links with the minimum power consumption. However, obtaining the optimal schedule is challenging due to the complexity of the initial formulations. To address this, a practical problem decomposition method is proposed, along with a single-stage technique that simultaneously maximizes the number of scheduled data links and minimizes transmit power. The optimization process is further improved using benders decomposition (BD), complemented by the machine learning-aided multi-cut method for enhanced convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves near-optimal link scheduling with reduced iterations. Numerical analysis validates the effectiveness of the problem decomposition method, particularly when the EH nodes have an energy requirement of 0.1 Joules.</description></item><item><title>Deep Learning-Enabled Joint Edge Content Caching and Power Allocation Strategy in Wireless Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286984</link><description>Edge content caching has emerged as a promising solution against network latency by pre-caching popular contents at the edge of networks. However, the edge content caching and wireless resource allocation are intertwined with each other. The content downloading latency depends not only on the edge content caching strategy, but also highly on the wireless resource allocation strategy. To cope with them as a whole, this work aims at jointly optimizing the edge content caching and power allocation to minimize the content downloading latency. In doing so, a joint edge content caching and power allocation problem is formulated. But, this problem is NP-hard and difficult to be solved. Solving it with the traditional approaches will cause quite long computational delay, which cannot meet the real-time requirements of resource scheduling. To address this challenge, a novel deep learning (DL)-enabled joint edge content caching and power allocation framework is proposed. In particular, the formulated problem is firstly transformed into a classification problem in DL field. After that, the convolutional long short-term memory networks (ConvLSTM) are utilized to capture the temporal-spatial features of content requests, and the fully-connected networks (FC) are introduced to explore the users' location differences. Finally, the temporal-spatial features of content requests and the location differences are fused to make intelligent decisions for joint edge content caching and power allocation. Simulation results show that the proposed joint edge content caching and power allocation strategy outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines at about 2.3% in terms of the average content downloading latency while guaranteeing real-time resource scheduling.</description></item><item><title>Learning Wireless Power Allocation Through Graph Convolutional Regression Networks Over Riemannian Manifolds</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286982</link><description>Optimum power allocation is a key enabler for maximizing data rate in wireless networks. Recently, various deep neural network models have been introduced for predicting power allocation in device-to-device (D2D) networks. However, they require large training samples (i.e., network layouts). On the contrary in this paper, we aim to develop a learning model for power allocation with fewer training samples, which is vital in dynamic networks (e.g., vehicular networks) with the need for fast learning of power allocation. The proposed model transforms Euclidean-based network layouts and power allocation problems into Riemannian (i.e., non-Euclidean) manifolds, which is shown to require fewer learning parameters and hence shorter learning time. Such transformation is possible thanks to the symmetric positive definite (SPD) property of spectral representation (i.e., Laplacian matrix) of network layouts. In particular, we propose a graph convolutional regression network (GCRN) for predicting power allocation over Riemannian manifolds in an unsupervised manner. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GCRN model approaches the maximum network rate in large-scale networks, with only 300 training samples as opposed to 10,000 in Euclidean-based learning models.</description></item><item><title>Graph Neural Networks for Quality of Service Improvement in Interference-Limited Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10288214</link><description>This paper aims to improve the Quality-of-Service (QoS) of Ultra-Reliability and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) in interference-limited wireless networks. To obtain time diversity within the channel coherence time, we first put forward a random repetition scheme that randomizes the interference power. Then, we optimize the number of reserved slots and the number of repetitions for each packet to minimize the QoS violation probability, defined as the percentage of users that cannot achieve URLLC. We build a cascaded Random Edge Graph Neural Network (REGNN) to represent the repetition scheme and develop a model-free unsupervised learning method to train it. To obtain some analytical results, we derive approximations of the QoS violation probability using stochastic geometry in a Poisson bipolar network and apply a model-based Exhaustive Search (ES) method to find the optimal repetition scheme. Based on the analytical results, a model-assisted initialization is developed for the cascaded REGNN to improve the training efficiency. Simulation results show that the cascaded REGNN can achieve a lower QoS violation probability than the cascaded fully connected neural network, and generalizes well in wireless networks with different scales, network topologies, cell densities, and frequency reuse factors.</description></item><item><title>Coexistence Designs of Radar and Communication Systems in a Multi-Path Scenario</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287644</link><description>The focus of this study is on the spectrum sharing between multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications and co-located MIMO radar systems in multi-path environments. The major challenge is to suppress the mutual interference between the two systems while combining the useful multi-path components received at each system. We tackle this challenge by jointly designing the communication precoder, radar transmit waveform and receive filter. Specifically, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the radar receiver is maximized subject to constraints on the radar waveform, communication rate and transmit power. The multi-path propagation complicates the expressions of the radar SINR and communication rate, leading to a non-convex problem. To solve it, a sub-optimal algorithm based on the alternating maximization is used to optimize the precoder, radar transmit waveform and receive filter iteratively. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design.</description></item><item><title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Assisted High-Speed Train Communications: Coverage Performance Analysis and Placement Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287590</link><description>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) emerges as an efficient and promising technology for the next wireless generation networks and has attracted a lot of attention owing to the capability of extending wireless coverage by reflecting signals toward targeted receivers. In this paper, we consider a RIS-assisted high-speed train (HST) communication system to enhance wireless coverage and improve coverage probability. First, coverage performance of the downlink single-input-single-output system is investigated, and the closed-form expression of coverage probability is derived. Moreover, travel distance maximization problem is formulated to facilitate RIS discrete phase design and RIS placement optimization, which is subject to coverage probability constraint. Simulation results validate that better coverage performance and higher travel distance can be achieved with deployment of RIS. The impacts of some key system parameters including transmission power, signal-to-noise ratio threshold, number of RIS elements, number of RIS quantization bits, horizontal distance between base station and RIS, and speed of HST on system performance are investigated. In addition, it is found that RIS can well improve coverage probability with limited power consumption for HST communications.</description></item><item><title>Energy-Efficient Design for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided Cell-Free Ultra Dense HetNets</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10290997</link><description>In this article, we investigate the energy efficiency (EE) of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) aided cell-free ultra-dense HetNets (CFUDN). To maximize the EE of CFUDN, users (UEs) association and clustering, RISs subsurface (SSF) associations are carefully designed. Then, the phase shift matrix of RISs and transmission power of base stations (BSs) are jointly optimized. Due to the non-convexity and high complexity of the formulated problem, this jointly optimized problem is usually difficult to solve. At present, the most commonly adopted method to deal with joint optimization problems is the block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm based on an alternative optimization framework. However, as we all know, the BCD algorithm has some degree of performance loss due to the alternate optimization of variables. To overcome this challenging issue, a novel joint optimization framework based on Riemannian product manifolds (RPM) is proposed, in which the phase shift matrix of RISs and transmission power of BSs can be simultaneously optimized rather than alternating ways. The simulation results and computational complexity analysis demonstrate that the joint optimization framework based on the RPM exhibits superior performance and lower complexity compared to the joint optimization algorithm based on the BCD.</description></item><item><title>Deep Learning Based Fingerprint Positioning for Multi-Cell Massive MIMO-OFDM Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292876</link><description>In this paper, we investigate user terminal (UT) fingerprint positioning for multi-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems in non-line-of-sight scenario. We first introduce a refined double beam-based channel model to the positioning problem and extract the energy coupling matrix in the refined beam domain as location-related fingerprint. By taking advantage of refined spatial and frequency beams, the new fingerprint (i.e., energy coupling matrix) contains plentiful and stationary multi-path information, such as power, angle of arrival (AoA), and delay of arrival (DoA), which are favorable to positioning. We then propose a novel deep learning-based fingerprint positioning method to locate the 2-dimension (2D) position of UTs, utilizing the multi-cell fingerprint as the input. In particular, we propose two deep neural network (DNN) architectures in this paper. The first DNN consists of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and multilayer perceptron, refining the elementary features from the multi-cell fingerprints and dividing the UTs into their belonging categories. In the second DNN, a new network architecture, Transformer, is applied to the positioning problem. The Transformer is directly based solely on self-attention mechanisms to sequences of fingerprint patches, which can perform outstandingly on the 2D position coordinates regression. Simulation results show that the proposed positioning methods can outperform the existing methods in terms of positioning error.</description></item><item><title>A Distributed Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning-Aided Transmission Design for Dynamic Vehicular Communication Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292947</link><description>In a vehicular communication network, how to efficiently utilize the limited network resources to meet the stringent transmission quality of service (QoS) requirements in the dynamically changing environment is a challenging task. This paper studies a typical vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication scenario, in which multiple source nodes desire to deliver different types of messages to their respective destinations. Considering the case that accurate instantaneous global channel state information (CSI) is unavailable, properly selecting access channel, transmission power, and data rate at each source to optimize the links' performance is an extremely involved mixed-integer stochastic optimization problem. We propose applying the distributed multi-agent deep reinforcement learning technique to solve the problem. Specifically, a distributed multi-agent parameterized deep Q-network (DMA-PDQN) algorithm is employed to explore optimal decision in the discrete-continuous hybrid action space. The idea of federated meta learning (FML) is also adopted to tackle the non-stationarity issue and improve the training efficiency of distributed agents. Using energy efficiency (EE) as the target transmission objective, through extensive simulation we show that our method can achieve excellent convergence and performance.</description></item><item><title>Optimized Resource Allocation for Distributed Joint Radar-Communication System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292936</link><description>In this article, we consider a distributed joint radar-communication (JRC) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system that performs both radar and communication objectives simultaneously. By introducing radar and communication performance metrics, optimized power allocation is achieved for different transmitters of the JRC system. The objective of the radar subsystem is to achieve a desired target localization accuracy quantified in terms of the Cramer-Rao bound of the location estimates, whereas the objective of the communication subsystem is to improve the classical Shannon capacity. First, we consider non-cooperative radar- and communication-centric operations, and the power allocations are respectively optimized for these cases. Next, we present two novel resource allocation strategies for the cooperative JRC system. In the first strategy, joint resource optimization for radar and communication subsystems is performed by exploiting the same waveform resources, resulting in high spectrum efficiency. The second approach provides enhanced flexibility by exploiting separate sets of waveforms that are respectively dedicated to the radar and communication subsystems, enabling the JRC system to independently change radar subsystem waveforms based only on the radar surveillance profile, without impacting the communication subsystem waveforms. Simulation results clearly demonstrate significant performance gain of the proposed cooperative JRC system over radar- or communication-centric power allocation schemes.</description></item><item><title>Two-Layer Large Scale Fading Precoding for Cell-Free Massive MIMO: Performance Analysis and Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10310167</link><description>In this paper, a two-layer large scale fading precoding (LSFP) method is proposed in a downlink cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system. In the first LSFP layer, the access points are responsible for designing distributed precoding and power control coefficients for each user equipment (UE). While for the second LSFP layer, the central processing unit performs the proposed zero forcing LSFP (ZF-LSFP) for the copilot UEs in order to mitigate the interference caused by pilot contamination. To address power constraints and enhance the system's spectral efficiency (SE), we introduce the copilot power scaling factors. Specifically, we derive closed-form expressions for the lower-bound achievable SE under distributed precoding schemes. These expressions are versatile and applicable to downlink SE irrespective of the availability of ZF-LSFP. Based on the derived closed-form results, we formulate a sum SE maximization problem with respect to copilot power scaling factors. Two approaches are designed to solve this problem, i.e. the weighted minimum mean square error (W-MMSE) based approach and the geometric programming (GP) based approach. While the W-MMSE-based approach is suitable for various systems, the GP-based approach is specifically tailored for systems with high signal-to-noise ratios, offering fast running speed. Finally, we validate all theoretical analyses and assess the effectiveness of the proposed two-layer LSFP method through numerical simulations.</description></item><item><title>Energy Efficiency Analysis and Optimization for Millimeter-Wave MIMO With Variable-Resolution ADCs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10301689</link><description>In millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, the surge in hardware cost and power consumption poses a huge challenge to green communication. Considering the high power consumption of the radio frequency (RF) module, we aim to design a high energy-efficient uplink multi-users (MU) communication system by applying variable-resolution analog to digital converters (ADC). Firstly, a closed-form expression for the spectrum efficiency (SE) in terms of the quantization resolution of ADC is derived under hybrid beamforming (HBF) and fully digital beamforming (FDBF) architectures, respectively. We find explicit energy efficiency (EE) expressions and investigate the main factors affecting EE under two kinds of architectures. For HBF, a novel finding is that adding the number of RF chains for a fixed number of transmit data streams can effectively mitigate the quantization distortion introduced by low-resolution ADCs. Furthermore, an EE maximization problem involving joint optimization of ADC bit selection and power allocation between MU for the HBF system is formulated. Based on the concept of block coordinate ascent (BCA), we subdivide the original problem into two subproblems. The first subproblem involves power allocation, which has been reformulated as a convex problem using an equivalent quadratic transformation. The second subproblem tackles ADC bit selection, for which we propose a low-complexity search scheme that achieves performance approaching that of an exhaustive search. The simulation results demonstrate the high accuracy of the derived closed-form expression, which supports the EE analysis. The proposed EE maximization scheme has a fast convergence rate and achieves higher EE compared to existing benchmark technologies.</description></item><item><title>OFDM-BOC: A Broadband Multicarrier Navigation Modulation-Based BOC for Future GNSS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10301478</link><description>The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is a critical infrastructure for positioning, navigation, and timing. Recently, vigorous implementation of low earth orbit (LEO) communication satellites has provided a new opportunity for developing GNSS. However, most of the existing navigation modulations are only applicable for narrow bandwidths; hence, broadband navigation modulation with good compatibility and scalability is needed. This paper presents a new broadband multicarrier navigation modulation, namely orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with binary offset carriers (OFDM-BOC), which uses orthogonal BOC signals as subcarriers. First, we derive the analytical expressions of the autocorrelation function (ACF) and power spectral density (PSD) based on the proposed signal model. Then, we discuss the relationship between the OFDM-BOC parameters and their time-frequency properties. This modulation can update existing BOC-like signals without affecting the original receiver. In addition, OFDM-BOC has a similar transmitter and receiver scheme to traditional modulation, so the update process only needs minor changes for the original navigation equipment. Compared with some representative navigation modulations such as AltBOC, BOC(10,5), and OFDM, the analysis reflects that OFDM-BOC has a flatter PSD main lobe, lower PSD maximum value, and smaller false lock probability. Moreover, it is shown that OFDM-BOC also has better spectrum efficiency, tracking performance, and anti-interference. Due to the excellent compatibility and navigation performance, OFDM-BOC provides a broadband modulation scheme for the next generation of navigation signals.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Hop Airborne FSO Systems With Relay Selection Over Outdated Log-Normal Turbulence Channels</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10301700</link><description>Due to its high capacity and the ability to operate in an unregulated spectrum, free space optical (FSO) communication is ideally suited for airborne backhauling. In this paper, we consider a relay-assisted airborne FSO system in which serial and parallel relaying are deployed together. We deploy relay selection in each hop and select the relay that provides the maximum instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To achieve this in practice, it is necessary to estimate the channel coefficient per hop and feed it back to the preceding transmitting/relaying node. Due to the semi-fixed hovering position of rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), this estimate will likely be outdated for the airborne channel. Therefore, the relay will likely be selected based on the outdated channel coefficient. In this paper, we first propose a model for outdated log-normal fading. Based on the outdated channel state information, we discuss how to optimally set the node transmit power by a proper selection of the pre-amplification factor to ensure signal reception above a targeted threshold at each hop. We finally present the end-to-end bit error rate (BER) performance of the airborne parallel multi-hop system under consideration.</description></item><item><title>Deep Learning-Based Joint Optimization of Closed-Loop FDD mmWave Massive MIMO: Pilot Adaptation, CSI Feedback, and Beamforming</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10294218</link><description>To alleviate severe attenuation of millimeter-wave (mmWave) channel, massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) in which a large number of antennas are utilized in base station (BS) is a promising solution. However, due to a large number of antennas and limited coherence time of mmWave mobile channel, acquisition of a precise channel state information (CSI) requires a large channel estimation overhead, especially for frequency division duplex (FDD) systems. In addition, due to limited saturation level of mmWave power amplifiers, a flexible pilot length adaptation is required for mmWave communication systems. Likewise, because of a large number of BS antennas, it is difficult to feed back all CSI with high accuracy in FDD massive MIMO systems. There exists a trade-off between feedback overhead and the accuracy of recovered CSI. To resolve these issues, in this paper, we propose a deep learning-based joint optimization of closed-loop FDD massive MIMO systems. Unlike previous deep learning-based approach in which only beamforming (BF) from observation of CSI is composed with neural network, we formulate the entire process of generating BF matrix as a functional optimization problem. We compose a deep learning-based FDD massive MIMO system where the functional blocks including pilot length adaptation, CSI compression, and BF are replaced with neural networks. The neural networks are connected and trained as a single network toward a direction which maximizes network utility. During the training process, each functional block learns its best strategy to maximizes network utility. Through simulation, we confirm that each network learned strategies to maximize network utility by itself.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Multimedia Data Sharing in IoV: A Learning-Based Equilibrium of Supply and Demand</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10272628</link><description>The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has great potential to transform transportation systems by enhancing road safety, reducing traffic congestion, and improving user experience through onboard infotainment applications. Decentralized data sharing can improve security, privacy, reliability, and facilitate infotainment data sharing in IoVs. However, decentralized data sharing may not achieve the expected efficiency if there are IoV users who only want to consume the shared data but are not willing to contribute their own data to the community, resulting in incomplete information observed by other vehicles and infrastructure, which can introduce additional transmission latency. Therefore, in this article, by modeling the data sharing ecosystem as a data trading market, we propose a decentralized data-sharing incentive mechanism based on multi-intelligent reinforcement learning to learn the supply-demand balance in markets and minimize transmission latency. Our proposed mechanism takes into account the dynamic nature of IoV markets, which can experience frequent fluctuations in supply and demand. We propose a time-sensitive Key-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (KP-ABE) mechanism coupled with Named Data Networking (NDN) to protect data in IoVs, which adds a layer of security to our proposed solution. Additionally, we design a decentralized market for efficient data sharing in IoVs, where continuous double auctions are adopted. The proposed mechanism based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning can learn the supply-demand equilibrium in markets, thus improving the efficiency and sustainability of markets. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our proposed learning-based incentive mechanism outperforms baselines by 10% in determining the equilibrium of supply and demand while reducing transmission latency by 20%.</description></item><item><title>UAV-Aided Information Collection Method Based on Joint Optimization of Node Access and Flight Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10275059</link><description>UAV-aided communication can utilize the line-of-sight transmission and strong mobility of UAVs to achieve efficient information collection for IoT nodes. However, in scenarios where IoT devices are sparsely distributed and small to medium data volumes are uploaded, the proportion of UAV flight energy consumption increases and the energy efficiency is low. To this end, a UAV-aided information collection method based on joint optimization of node access and flight strategy is proposed. The cost function is minimized by optimizing the speed of UAV, the average flight time and the access selection of IoT nodes. And the cost function consists of UAV energy consumption and total mission time. In order to effectively solve the non-convex term in the original optimization problem, the convex relaxation and successive convex approximation (SCA) technique is used to transform it into a mixed integer disciplined convex program (MIDCP), and an iterative algorithm is de-signed to solve this problem. The simulation results show that the proposed method can reduce the energy consumption and mission time of the UAV under the premise of ensuring the integrity of node information collection.</description></item><item><title>Energy Minimization of Inland Waterway USVs for IRS-Assisted Hybrid UAV-Terrestrial MEC Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10285605</link><description>Due to its exceptional ability to create favorable line-of-sight (LoS) propagation environments, the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is widely recognized as a technological enabler for wireless inland waterway communications. In this article, an IRS-assisted hybrid unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-terrestrial network architecture with unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) is proposed and a USVs energy minimization problem is formulated by jointly considering offloading decisions, computation capability, beamforming vector design and IRS phase shift-vector. To address the formulated problem, we decouple the original problem into two subproblems, in which the first subproblem focuses on joint offloading decisions and computation capability and the second subproblem concerns joint IRS phase shift-vector and the beamforming vector design. The enhanced differential evolution algorithm (EDE) is proposed to solve the former subproblem, and the minimum-variance-distortionless-response (MVDR) and enhanced min-maximization (EMM) algorithms are proposed to obtain optimized beamforming vector and IRS phase shift-vector in the second subproblem, respectively. Simulation results show how the proposed solution realizes a good tradeoff between network energy consumption and capacity in comparison to three alternative algorithms. The results also show that the proposed algorithm can improve the network performance in terms of the number of successfully offloaded tasks.</description></item><item><title>Stochastic Geometry-Based Trajectory Design for Multi-Purpose UAVs: Package and Data Delivery</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10278445</link><description>With the advancements achieved in drones' flexibility, low cost, and high efficiency, they obtain huge application opportunities in various industries, such as aerial delivery and future communication networks. However, the increasing transportation needs and expansion of network capacity demands for UAVs will cause aerial traffic conflicts in the future. To address this issue, in this article, we explore the idea of multi-purpose UAVs, which act as aerial wireless communication data relays and means of aerial transportation simultaneously to deliver data and packages at the same time. While UAVs deliver the packages from warehouses to residential areas, we design their trajectories which enable them to collect data from multiple Internet of Things (IoT) clusters and forward the collected data to terrestrial base stations (TBSs). To select the serving nearby IoT clusters, UAVs rank them based on their priorities and distances. From the perspectives of data and package delivery, respectively, we propose two algorithms that design the optimal UAVs trajectory to maximize the transmitted data or minimize the round trip time. Specifically, we use tools from stochastic geometry to model the locations of IoT clusters and TBSs. Given the nature of random locations, the proposed algorithm applies to general cases. Our numerical results show that multi-purpose UAVs are practical and have great potential to enhance the energy/time-efficiency of future networks.</description></item><item><title>Joint Power Allocation and Task Replication for Reliability-Sensitive Services in NOMA-Enabled Vehicular Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10297596</link><description>To cope with the increasing demands of computing tasks in vehicles, task offloading to computing nodes (vehicles and edge servers) in a vehicular edge computing (VEC) scenario has gained significant attention. However, the high dynamic of task arrival and variant wireless network conditions could severely impact the quality of computation offloading for latency-aware and high-reliability services. Consequently, only offloading tasks to a single computing node may fail to satisfy the reliability requirements due to potential transmission errors or constraints on delay. To mitigate the limitations of task offloading to only one single computing node in VEC, task replication, in which a task can be sent to multiple computing nodes simultaneously is utilized. Nevertheless, unrestricted task replication may exacerbate the depletion of network and computing resources in VEC when a burst of computing tasks is generated. To address the above challenges, we first formulate the problem of power allocation with task replication in NOMA-enabled VEC. Our purpose is to maximize task transmission reliability based on the Finite Block Length (FBL) theory while following the delay constraint. To achieve this goal, we formulate the problem of task replication and power allocation into a constrained stochastic optimization problem and apply the Lyapunov optimization framework to adjust task replication decisions and power allocation for each vehicle. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can obtain better service reliability than other alternative algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Energy-Efficient Communication Networks via Multiple Aerial Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: DRL and Optimization Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10301685</link><description>In the realm of wireless communications in 5G, 6G and beyond, deploying unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been an innovative approach to extend the coverage area due to its easy deployment. Moreover, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has also emerged as a new paradigm with the goals of enhancing the average sum-rate as well as energy efficiency. By combining these attractive features, an energy-efficient RIS-mounted multiple UAVs (aerial RISs: ARISs) assisted downlink communication system is studied. Due to the obstruction, user equipments (UEs) can have a poor line of sight to communicate with the base station (BS). To solve this, multiple ARISs are implemented to assist the communication between the BS and UEs. Then, the joint optimization problem of deployment of ARIS, ARIS reflecting elements on/off states, phase shift, and power control of the multiple ARISs-assisted communication system is formulated. The problem is challenging to solve since it is mixed-integer, non-convex, and NP-hard. To overcome this, it is decomposed into three sub-problems. Afterward, successive convex approximation (SCA), actor-critic proximal policy optimization (AC-PPO), and whale optimization algorithm (WOA) are employed to solve these sub-problems alternatingly. Finally, extensive simulation results have been generated to illustrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Coverage and Throughput Analysis for Peer-to-Peer 6G Directional Slotted Aloha Bursty Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10306312</link><description>This paper presents a theoretical framework for investigating the coverage and throughput behavior of sixth generation (6G) peer-to-peer (P2P) directional slotted Aloha (DirSA) networks managing bursty traffic flows. Proper channel models, accounting for interference, noise, path-loss, random node location, power fluctuation, and beam pointing error, are adopted to derive analytical expressions for the statistic of the received power in ground, air, and space propagation contexts. The resulting coverage probability, obtained in simple integral form for different omnidirectional/directional transmission/reception modes, is exploited to derive multidimensional Markov chains for estimating the throughput in the absence and in the presence of a feedback mechanism, considering also the impact of the initial access procedure and of the beam training overhead. The theoretical results, which are validated by exhaustive Monte Carlo simulations, are used to evaluate the influence of the code-modulation scheme, of the operating signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR), and of the burst length on the performance of 6G terrestrial, aerial, and satellite P2P DirSA subnets.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Resource Allocation With Federated Learning for Delay-Sensitive IoV Services</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10302355</link><description>In this paper, we propose a distributed sidelink resource allocation approach named federated multi-agent deep Q network (FMDQN). The objective is the network spectrum-energy efficiency (SEE) maximization. To address the optimization problem in a distributed manner, we merge federated learning and deep reinforcement learning. We establish an asynchronous federated learning framework by facilitating local model training, thus avoiding the transmission of user-sensitive raw data. Our proposed approach utilizes a client-server architecture and federated aggregation. Additionally, we formulate a sub-band and power allocation strategy that aims to maximize SEE while adhering to strict delay limits for the given task. Simulation results illustrate the favorable convergence of the proposed algorithm in highly dynamic and uncertain Internet of vehicles (IoV) environments.</description></item><item><title>FedTO: Mobile-Aware Task Offloading in Multi-Base Station Collaborative MEC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304307</link><description>With the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT), mobile edge computing (MEC) has great potential to achieve low latency, high reliability, and low energy consumption. However, in collaborative MEC environments, user movement and task migration may cause task transmission and processing delays, resulting in elevated task response times. Therefore, system performance and user experience need to be ensured by rational task offloading and resource management. At the same time, the protection of user data privacy is becoming increasingly important as a challenge to be overcome. To address the problems of intense resource competition and privacy leakage in MEC, the federated learning for the TD3-based task offloading (FedTO) algorithm is proposed. The algorithm has a dual objective of energy consumption and task response time while protecting user privacy. It employs a cryptographic local model update and aggregation mechanism and uses deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to obtain an efficient task offloading decision. Based on the mobile trajectories of real devices, and the pre-deployment of base station locations, experimental results show that the FedTO algorithm ensures task data security. It also effectively reduces the total energy consumption and average task response time of the system, which further improves the system utility.</description></item><item><title>Timing Advance Estimation in Low Earth Orbit Satellite Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286908</link><description>Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication based on 3GPP standard is seen as a promising solution to rolling out communication services in areas without terrestrial base stations. However, due to the fast movement of satellites and large beam footprint size, the existing 5G timing advance (TA) estimation mechanism cannot be directly applied when global navigation satellite system is unavailable. In this article, an enhanced TA estimation approach is proposed for LEO satellite communication networks. Specifically, a user-side time-frequency pre-compensation method is introduced at first, which leverages frequency offset measurement on synchronization signal blocks broadcasted by satellites in initial cell search phase. For the random access phase, the upper bound of inter-preamble interference incurred by partial-period cross-correlation operations is derived for a preamble format advised by 3GPP, and it is shown that the interference level is closely related to the square of the number of such operations. Inspired by this result, a cyclic prefix free preamble format is further designed, which features extended guard time, differential power allocation and flexible preamble structure. Numerical results show that our proposal can reduce the missed detection rate of preamble within a beam. Particularly, the missed detection rates of preamble under 32, 48, and 64 users are lower than 1$\%$ when SNR = &#8722;6 dB, which is a significant improvement compared to baselines. In addition, our proposal can limit the TA estimation error of the detected users to the time length of 25 time-domain sampling points when the subcarrier spacing is 30 kHz and operation frequency is 27 GHz.</description></item><item><title>Dissatisfaction Feedback and Stackelberg Game-Based Task Offloading Mechanism for Parked Vehicle Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10296002</link><description>Considering the limited computing power of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) servers and the emergence of Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs), we employ the computing paradigm known as Parked Vehicle Edge Computing (PVEC) to leverage the computational capabilities of idle vehicles, thereby enhancing the overall computing performance of these vehicles. We establish a multi-stage Stackelberg game model, which captures the interactions among the requester (RV), the service provider (SP), and the parked vehicles (PV). In order to incentivize parked vehicles to provide computing power, we design a dissatisfaction feedback mechanism. To optimize the system and maximize the relative benefits of all stakeholders, we formulate an optimization problem to find an optimal pricing scheme that guides task allocation and resource utilization. We employ reverse induction and gradient descent to solve this problem. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the dissatisfaction feedback mechanism and provide insights into the changing trends of optimal strategies at each stage as the task density increases. These findings contribute to the understanding of PVEC and offer guidance for real-world task offloading scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Transmit Power Minimization for STAR-RIS Aided FD-NOMA Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10272684</link><description>The source and destination should be located on the same side of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), which limits its flexibility and coverage. In this correspondence, a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS) aided full-duplex non-orthogonal multiple access scheme is proposed to structure a full-space smart radio environment. By jointly optimizing the power allocation coefficients at the access point, the transmit beamforming at the cell-center user and the reflection and transmission beamformings at the STAR-RIS, the total transmit power is minimized. Owing to the non-convexity caused by the coupling of active and passive beamformings, we first decouple it into two sub-problems. Then, the semidefinite relaxation and successive convex approximation are utilized to resolve them, respectively. Finally, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm to tackle them iteratively. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the transmit power while expanding the coverage.</description></item><item><title>Robust Frame-Based Beamforming Scheme to Enhance Secure Multigroup Multicast Transmission for Multibeam Satellite Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10285354</link><description>In this article, we propose a robust frame-based beamforming (BF) scheme to enhance the physical layer security for multigroup multicast transmission in a multibeam satellite system. By assuming that only the imperfect channel state information of each user is known, we formulate a constrained optimization problem to maximize the minimal transmission-outage rate with fairness, subject to outage probability (OP) constraints of all satellite terminals (STs), the intercept probability (IP) constraint of an eavesdropper (Eve), and the per-feed power budget. To cope with this complicated optimization problem, we first propose to adopt the Bernstein Inequalities, norm compatibility and $S$-procedure to convert the OP and IP constraints into deterministic forms. Then, we propose a robust frame-based secure multigroup multicast BF scheme to solve it efficiently. Finally, our simulation results demonstrate the superiority and robustness of the proposed robust BF scheme, and confirm that our proposed scheme can significantly improve the security and reliability for multibeam satellite systems.</description></item><item><title>Throughput Maximization for Covert UAV Relaying System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286397</link><description>Covert communication protects the communication behavior from being monitored or eavesdropped, which is particularly vital for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications since they are more likely to establish line-of-sight link. This correspondence investigates the joint trajectory and transmit power optimization for covert UAV relaying systems. Considering covertness requirement, information causality, power and trajectory constraints, a general optimization framework characterized by dynamic and three-dimensional is proposed. The detection performance from warden and relay perspectives is analyzed, and the covertness constraint with uncertain information is converted to tractability expressions. For the joint optimization problem, we propose a covert relaying algorithm which simultaneously optimizes the trajectory and power. Simulation results verify that the proposed covert relaying method can improve the average throughput while satisfying the covertness constraint.</description></item><item><title>On Performance of Downlink THz-Based Rate-Splitting Multiple-Access (RSMA): Is it Always Better Than NOMA?</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10288281</link><description>This article presents a unified framework analysis for downlink terahertz (THz)-based multiple-input single-output (MISO) rate-splitting multiple-access (RSMA) systems under spherical stochastic models. To simultaneously achieve the users' full diversity gain, a novel precoding weight design is proposed based on zero-forcing and maximum-ratio transmission approaches. Accordingly, closed-form expressions for the users' outage probability (OP) and throughput are derived in exact, approximate, and asymptotic manners. Additionally, the users' OP minimization problems are formulated and proven to be strictly convex with regard to the common power allocation (PA) factor. To clarify whether RSMA is superior to non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in future THz communication networks, the OP and throughput comparisons have been carried out. Numerical results confirm that: 1) our theoretical analyses exactly match the simulation results; 2) as for OP aspects, RSMA is not fully superior to NOMA in two-user cases, while for multi-users, it only outperforms NOMA in cases where imperfect successive interference cancellation process produces over 10% residual interference; and 3) as for throughput aspects, RSMA achieves the performance superiority over both two- and multi-users scenarios when compared to its counterparts.</description></item><item><title>Covert Transmission via Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292914</link><description>Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) Systems, which can support simultaneous information transmission and target detection, have been regarded as promising solutions for various emerging wireless network applications. In this work, a covert transmission system with the aid of the ISAC technique is proposed, where the radar intends to sense a target and send message to legitimate users covertly against the warden's surveillance with either perfect or imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the warden. We formulate a beamforming optimization problem for the dual-function signal used for sensing and communication to maximize the covert throughput, subject to a covertness constraint, a maximum transmit power constraint, and a radar detection constraint. We then determine the sufficient conditions under which the covert beamforming design problem can be solved by semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Numerical results show that the proposed covert ISAC system can guarantee covert transmission while ensuring a certain level of sensing performance, and there exists a performance trade-off between the considered radar detection and covert transmission.</description></item><item><title>Max-Min Fairness for Uplink NOMA Systems With Finite Blocklength</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292880</link><description>Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been viewed as a promising technology to meet access and throughput demands in wireless communications.

Specifically, we consider the joint optimization of the power control and transmission rates to improve the max-min effective throughput and simultaneously provide the quality-of-service (QoS) guarantee of transmission reliability for each user. Though the formulated problem appears as a difficult non-convex problem, we obtain the globally optimal solution by first determining the optimal transmission rates for given powers and then obtaining the optimal power control through a line search. We further develop a simplified algorithm to obtain the nearly optimal performance. The superiority of our proposed algorithms is demonstrated via simulation results.</description></item><item><title>$\alpha$-Fair Resource Allocation for Downlink Multiuser Short Packet Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10297574</link><description>Short packet communications are promising techniques to satisfy the stringent latency requirements of delay sensitive applications. Existing works on short packet communications considered either sum throughput maximization or max-min throughput maximization, which correspond to zero fairness and absolute fairness among devices, respectively. Different from that, this paper adopts the $\alpha$-fairness metric, which offers a controllable fairness, and investigates the resource allocation problem in a downlink multiuser short packet communication system to maximize the sum $\alpha$-fair utility by optimizing the bandwidth unit allocation, power allocation and decoding error probability.

An RIS is leveraged to assist legitimate wireless communication. Dedicated sensing signal is transmitted with communication signal to enhance the sensing performance while preventing information leakage. The radar output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be improved by jointly optimizing the transmit and reflection beamforming, and radar receive filter, while satisfying the communication performance requirement of each user, the secure transmission constraint, the power budget constraint, as well as the RIS reflecting coefficients restrict. An alternating optimization method is applied to decompose the non-convex multivariate coupling problem into three sub-problems. We then utilize semi-definite relaxation (SDR), fractional programming (FP), and majorization-minimization (MM) algorithms to solve the sub-problems iteratively.

By densely packing numerous radiation elements together, HMIMOS is capable of realizing accurate beamforming with low hardware complexity. However, enormous radiation elements on the HMIMOS lead to high computational complexity and signaling overhead when applying traditional beamforming schemes relying on instantaneous channel state information (CSI). To tackle this problem, we propose a two-timescale optimization scheme to minimize the required transmission power under the constraint of all users' quality-of-service (QoS). Specifically, the beampatterns at the base station (BS) and the user equippment (UE) are optimized over the slowly changing statistical CSI based on the constrained stochastic successive convex approximation (CSSCA) algorithm. Then, the instantaneous CSI is utilized to design the precoding matrix in order to ensure the system performance without significant increase in computational cost, due to the small number of feeds on the HMIMOS. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to other baselines.</description></item><item><title>Active RIS-Empowered Signal Cancellation Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10302337</link><description>When reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is used to initiate attacks without actively generating sources of jamming signals, signal cancellation attacks (SCAs) are the main methods. However, a passive RIS (PRIS) requires a lot of reflecting elements in order to obtain considerable SCAs when attacked systems limit signal leakage to non-target receivers. This puts the PRIS at high risk of being tracked and monitored by enemies. To increase the flexibility of RIS deployment while maintaining a significant attack, this correspondence proposes active RIS (ARIS) to implement SCAs, which is exact opposite to the original intention of proposing ARIS to improve transmission quality. Specifically, with constraints on maximum reflecting amplitude and maximum amplification power, we derive a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) minimization problem. In order to achieve a fast attack, an algorithm with low complexity is proposed to resolve the non-convex problem. Numerical results show that ARIS can perform a stronger SCA than PRIS under more stringent conditions.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Multi-Level Amplitude-Shift Keying for Non-Coherent SIMO Wireless System in Rician Fading Environment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10302402</link><description>In this paper, we consider a receive diversity wireless communication system with the transmitter employing multi-level amplitude-shift keying (ASK) signaling scheme for data modulation over Rician fading channels and the receiver utilizing an optimal non-coherent maximum likelihood detector for data reception.

Furthermore, the union-bound on the SEP of the system is proposed to be minimized by deriving an optimal multi-level ASK constellation under the constraint of total available energy at the transmitter. Numerical results show the superior performance of the considered communication system with optimal ASK constellation set compared to the traditional equally-spaced ASK constellation. Furthermore, it is observed that higher values of the Rician factor of the system, the average SNR, and the number of receive diversity branches play a crucial role in the reliability of the wireless communication system.</description></item><item><title>Density-Based Clustering Resolution for Grant-Free Preamble Collision in Cell-Free mURLLC Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304369</link><description>As one of the 6G stream services, massive ultra-reliable low-latency communications (mURLLC) can support massive short-packet data communication with high reliability and low latency, while the guarantee of its extreme demand becomes a technical difficulty. Grant-free random access (GFRA) is considered a method to reduce latency, but its performance is limited by the preamble collision caused by orthogonal resource constraints in massive communication scenarios. Due to the signal spatial sparsity of cell-free massive MIMO systems, each user being served by neighbouring access points can reduce mutual interference between collided users. This paper proposes a density-based clustering GFRA collision resolution framework in cell-free mURLLC systems, and the clusters obtained by two-dimensional information of received signal energy and geographic location are used to blind detect users for reliable access. Simulation results show that the proposed collision resolution scheme has an improved probability of successful access compared to previous resolutions, and the system is highly portable and adaptable to sporadic random traffic.</description></item><item><title>Convergence Time Optimization for Decentralized Federated Learning With LEO Satellites via Number Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10273640</link><description>Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) is a federated learning framework without any central controllers. With the development of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, LEO satellites can be used to train a machine learning model collaboratively through DFL. However, due to the energy limitations of the satellites, DFL with satellites has higher requirements on the latency. In this article, we investigate how to minimize the convergence time of DFL with satellites by designing the number of satellites in each orbit and the number of orbits. In addition to considering the total energy cost and the distance constraints in satellite communication, we also consider guaranteeing the DFL performance in the problem of minimizing the convergence time. However, obtaining closed-form solutions to this problem is difficult since the target is non-convex and the performance is hard to evaluate directly. To address these issues, we derive an upper bound on the convergence time and transform it into a quasi-convex function first. Then, we derive the convergence bound of DFL with respect to the number of satellites and orbits. Based on these two bounds, we reformulate the problem and obtain the closed-form expressions of the optimal number of satellites and orbits. Simulation results confirm the impact of these numbers on the convergence time and verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>The Impact of Hot Injection Reaction Temperature on the Properties of Cu2ZnSnS4 Nanocrystal Thin Films for PV Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10356634</link><description>Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) is a p-type absorber layer semiconductor, which is a promising candidate material for advanced solar cell devices. CZTS nanoparticle thin films were synthesized via the hot-injection spin-coating method. Nanoparticle inks were deposited on soda lime glass substrates. Different reaction temperatures during synthesis were investigated by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), focused ion beam microscopy (FIB-SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Raman spectroscopy, and Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy to study the effects of the synthesis reaction temperature on CZTS thin films. The energy band-gap decreased with increasing reaction temperatures from 1.55 to 1.34 eV for the temperature range 225&#8201;&#176;C&#8211;300&#8201;&#176;C. These energy bandgaps show values close to the optimum for a CZTS solar cell device. XRD confirmed the kesterite structure, which is the preferred structure in CZTS for high efficiency PV device performance. In addition, a clear increasing trend of the scattering domain size with the reaction temperature is found to be in good agreement with the FIB-SEM images. Raman spectra showed no secondary phases. EDS of thin films demonstrated compositions consistent with start-up precursor ratios (Cu-poor Zn-rich composition). And 250&#8201;&#176;C was identified as the most suitable reaction temperature for CZTS devices.</description></item><item><title>The Impact of N-Doped Carbon Quantum Dots on Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells Operating Under Diffused- and Low-Light Intensity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10341340</link><description>This study investigates the double role of N-doped carbon quantum dots (N-CQDs) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) that operate under diffused- and low-light intensity conditions. We demonstrate that the incorporation of N-CQDs leads to a substantial improvement in the performance of DSSCs. Under standard one-sun illumination, the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) achieved with N-CQDs is 2% higher than that of the bare cell. Moreover, we introduce two new metrics, the diffused-light coefficient and the low-light intensity coefficient, to evaluate the performance of DSSCs under nonideal illumination conditions. The diffused-light coefficient is recorded at 1.55, which indicates a notable enhancement in diffused-light PCE with N-CQDs. In contrast, the low-light intensity coefficient shows a significant enhancement factor 2, which highlights the superior performance of N-CQD-based DSSCs under low-light conditions. Our findings demonstrate that N-CQDs play a dual role in DSSCs, by being added to both the commercial dye and the mesoporous TiO2 layer. These results provide valuable insights to develop and optimize DSSCs, especially for applications in indoor or low-light environments. The proposed metrics, the diffused light coefficient, and the low-light intensity coefficient, offer a meaningful assessment of the device's performance under nonideal illumination conditions.</description></item><item><title>Development of Solution-Processed Eco-Friendly Cs2SnI6 Double Perovskite Thin-Film Solar Cell</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10376173</link><description>This article reports a simple and efficient solution-processed method for designing stable Cs2SnI6 double perovskite thin film solar cells utilizing Cesium iodide and SnI4 in a 2:1 ratio. Better crystallinity in a Cs2SnI6 film is typically associated with higher optical absorbance, lower carrier concentration, more carrier mobility, and improved air and thermal stability. This compound contains Sn, which is in the 4+ oxidation state, which makes it significantly more robust against oxidation. The detailed synthetic difficulties in processing these compounds in solutions are the primary concern of this study. The solar cell parameters, structural, morphological, and, optical properties of prepared Cs2SnI6 thin film were investigated using Netport Oriel12A solar simulator, thin film grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GI-XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive X-ray, and photoluminescence spectra (PL-Spectroscopy). Further, utilizing the synthesized Cs2SnI6 thin films as an absorber material, we have fabricated n-i-p configured FTO/TiO2/Cs2SnI6/MoS2/Ni/glass in the ambient condition. The current study will also suggest future research directions for increasing the device performance of air-stable Cs2SnI6 perovskite solar cells.</description></item><item><title>Demonstration of a Monolithically Integrated Hybrid Device for Simultaneous Power Generation and Data Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10430188</link><description>A three-terminal, monolithically integrated InP photovoltaic (PV) device with an InGaAs/InAlAs electroabsorption modulator for simultaneous power generation and data modulation has been designed and experimentally validated. A discrete modulator with a data rate approaching 1 Mbps with an on/off ratio of 1.20 was demonstrated. The InP power generating junction of the monolithic device attained an AM0 efficiency of 14.1% for a 0.25 cm2 area, with the efficiency loss primarily coming from the expected loss in the lateral conduction layer that was designed to minimize fractional power loss in the PV device and to minimize insertion loss at 1.55 $\mu$m. The monolithically integrated device demonstrated the potential for data modulation up to 0.5 Mbps at 1.55 $\mu$m. Simultaneous power generation and data modulation were observed in this monolithic device, and the device has application in areas such as low size, weight, power (SWaP) satellites, debris tagging, medical applications, and high altitude, long endurance unmanned aerial systems.</description></item><item><title>Impact of Additional PV Weight on the Energy Consumption of Electric Vehicles With Onboard PV</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10430388</link><description>Photovoltaics (PV) in onboard vehicle applications adds weight to an electric vehicle (EV), increasing the overall energy consumption. Although the added PV system weight is small compared with the vehicle weight, the power generated by PV is also very small compared with the power needed to propel an EV, making the effect of additional PV system weight on energy consumption a nontrivial topic to analyze. We present a method to study the impact of the vehicle onboard PV weight on the energy balance of EVs for different vehicle-added PV and vehicle-integrated PV configurations. The results are expressed through a newly introduced parameter called &#8220;onboard PV yield factor,&#8221; where positive values indicate a net energy gain and negative values indicate a net energy loss of the onboard PV system. Simulations are carried out to highlight the methodology for the driving phase of a medium and large passenger electric car with onboard PV for a selection of trips. Our method calculates the energy consumption attributable to the added PV system weight and PV energy yield for the selected trips. Our results for these sample simulations for the driving phase show a large range of yield factors, indicating the importance of systematically studying the impact of onboard vehicle PV weight.</description></item><item><title>Perovskite Solar Module Enabled IoT Asset Tracking for Wildlife Conservation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10430371</link><description>Perovskite technology has shown impressive improvement in the last decade. Here, the first global positioning system (GPS)-perovskite-powered application is showcased by integrating flexible perovskite modules (fPSMs) onto an animal tracking collar for powering the Internet of Things (IoT) device that monitors wildlife bison to preserve the species and its habitat. A prototype of a solar-powered collar was designed to be more optimal for monitoring ample wildlife than commercially available asset-tracking devices, so it can provide necessary data to successfully introduce bison to new habitats. The fPSM were fabricated on a plastic substrate and connected in series configuration to generate power of 400 mW. A robust packaging with polycarbonate sheets and mechanical rivets was realized to withstand harsh environmental conditions, validated by conducting scratch and bending tests. The electronics and software system were optimized for ultra-low power mode operation, consuming only 1.9 mWh, which is 200 times less than the energy generated by our modules. The packaged modules in the outdoor testing setup retained over 30% of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) and power after 350 days (8400 h), giving still 60 times more power than necessary over &#8764;1 year of operational condition.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Embedded System for Real-Time Fault Diagnosis of Photovoltaic Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10432772</link><description>In this article, a novel embedded low-cost system for real-time fault diagnosis of photovoltaic (PV) modules is proposed. The idea aims to develop an embedded application to classify certain defects that can frequently occur on PV modules based on infrared (IR) images in different regions (desert and Mediterranean climates). The investigated faults are sand accumulation, dirt on PV modules, degradation, and junction box overheating. After several inspections, these are the most commonly observed defects on PV modules in both regions (south and north of Algeria). A tiny convolutional neural network (TinyCNN) was developed, optimized, and integrated into a low-cost and low-power microcontroller (Arduino Nano 33 BLE sense). In this regard, a database of IR thermography images was built and used. The developed TinyCNN-based model could be run locally, without the need to send the data to the cloud for analysis and processing. Another microcontroller [Arduino Nano 33 Internet of Things (IoT)] was used to remotely monitor the state of the PV modules. Thanks to IoT technology, the results have been visualized and posted online on a dedicated monitoring webpage. The proposed embedded solution could be integrated into an unmanned aerial vehicle for real-time applications. Furthermore, it assists operators in diagnosing their PV modules and making a maintenance schedule. The proposed technique outperforms the existing solutions in terms of cost, consuming power, simplicity, and execution time. Simulation and experimental results clearly report the feasibility of the proposed embedded system, which has an average cost of around 120 US dollars.</description></item><item><title>Planet-Scale Energy Yield Potential of Next-Generation Bifacial, Multiterminal, Perovskite-Silicon Tandem Solar Farms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10400063</link><description>To continue reducing the levelized cost of solar energy, the photovoltaics (PV) industry is developing higher efficiency perovskite-based tandem solar cells. Among the various options, the two-terminal (2T) tandem has traditionally garnered the most interest and is expected to enter the market soon. However, the bifacial 2T perovskite-silicon (PVK-Si) tandem cell, constrained by current-matching requirements, would offer diminished energy gains in large-scale solar farms, especially when subjected to suboptimal albedo conditions. The 3/4T tandems obviate current matching and are expected to outperform 2T-tandem cells. However, the actual location-specific yield potential and relative gain of bifacial 3/4T tandems has not been reported in the literature. In this work, we use a novel end-to-end, multiscale simulation framework to carry out the first planet-scale simulation of single-axis-tracking solar farms employing bifacial PVK-Si 3/4T tandem in various ground albedo conditions. The analysis shows that the 3/4T cells offer up to 5% and 23% mean increase in annual energy yield compared with 2T-tandem and single-junction heterojunction solar cells in Earth's average albedo (${R}_A$ = 30%). Importantly, unlike the 2T tandem, the 3/4T tandem maintains its performance advantage across a wide range of albedo conditions, enabling flexible subcell design. The findings should encourage further research efforts aimed at tackling the recognized challenges associated with 3/4T technologies, such as minimizing optical losses and scaling up cell-to-module processes, to fully realize the potential of PVK-Si tandem technology.</description></item><item><title>A PPA Study for Heterogeneous 3-D IC Options: Monolithic, Hybrid Bonding, and Microbumping</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375958</link><description>In this article, we present three commercial-grade 3-D IC designs based on state-of-the-art design technologies, specifically microbumping (3-D die stacking), hybrid bonding (wafer-on-wafer bonding), and monolithic 3-D (M3D) ICs. To highlight tradeoffs present in these three designs, we perform analyses on power, performance, and area (PPA) and the clock tree. We also model the tier-to-tier interconnection in each 3-D IC methodology and analyze signal integrity (SI) to assess the reliability of each design. From our experiments using the OpenPiton benchmark, the hybrid bonding design shows the best timing improvement of 81.4% when compared to its 2-D counterpart, while microbumping shows the best reliability among 3-D IC designs. Moreover, we expand our study to the commercial processor architecture, which is Arm Cortex-A53, with the new set of 3-D integration options. In addition, we show the microbump assignment methodology to handle a large number of 3-D interconnections in the microbumping 3-D design. We also perform SI on the new set of 3-D intertier/interdie connections to discuss the reliability based on their physical dimensions. With a new benchmark design, the hybrid-bonding 3-D shows the best energy&#8211;delay-product (EDP) improvement, which is 25.8% compared to 2-D, and the largest eye-opening among 3-D integration options.</description></item><item><title>Heterogeneous Monolithic 3-D IC Designs: Challenges, EDA Solutions, and Power, Performance, Cost Tradeoffs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10380796</link><description>Monolithic 3-D (M3D) integrated circuits (ICs) introduce a new aspect to the physical design problem by stacking dies vertically. We introduce a novel heterogeneous design for M3D ICs, which utilizes different technology processes for each die. We also propose enhancements to the design flow and improved partitioning methods to support our suggested heterogeneous 3-D IC design. We perform 3-D partitioning with low-cost, low-power, and low-performance cells on the bottom die, and vice versa on the top die. This arrangement allows us to create a high-performance 3-D IC that is more cost-effective and power-efficient than both the 3-D and 2-D homogeneous implementations. We demonstrate these advantages using four different netlists, showing up to a 23% improvement in performance per cost (PPC), and a 16% improvement in power delay product (PDP) when comparing our heterogeneous M3D design to the best 2-D designs.</description></item><item><title>A CMOS AFE Array With DC Input Current Cancellation for FMCW LiDAR</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10400997</link><description>This article presents a low noise and wide linear dynamic 20-channel analog front-end (AFE) array for frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system. Each channel of the AFE array mainly consists of a shunt feedback transimpedance amplifier (SF-TIA) with a dc cancellation loop (DCL), a post amplifier, and an output buffer. The DCL is proposed to eliminate the dc current, comprising the dc current sunk to ground (dc-STG) and the dc current sourced from power supply (dc-SFP). In addition, the post amplifier, cascaded with an operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) and an SF-TIA, is proposed to decouple the relationship between gain and output common voltage, achieving both large gain and large output swing. Furthermore, the equalization technique is adopted to expand the bandwidth of the AFE array. The AFE array was implemented and fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu \text{m}$  CMOS technology. Measurement results show that the AFE array achieves the maximum transimpedance gain of 107 dB and eliminates the dc current between &#8722;150 and  $250 ~\mu \text{A}$ . With the maximum transimpedance gain, the measured bandwidth, the equivalent input-referred rms noise current, and the signal-to-crosstalk ratio (SCR) between adjacent channels are 165 MHz, 29.4 nArms, and &#8722;33.9 dB, respectively. The AFE array also achieves a linear dynamic range (DR) of 66 dB and the area of each channel is approximately equal to  $0.16\times1.3$  mm2.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Stochastic Number and Its Neural Network Computation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10328839</link><description>Stochastic computing (SC) is unique in that it is a type of arithmetic computation based on stochastic numbers (bitstream) instead of binary numbers (BNs). Stochastic number (SN) represents and carries information in the form of pseudo-analog probabilities by CMOS gate circuits. The renewed success of the stochastic number system is mainly related to super low power consumption and high reliability for edge computing. In fact, the stochastic number is a nonpositional number representation that is intrinsically sequential and consequently used for certain important arithmetic operations (such as addition/subtraction and multiplication), and corresponds to a super low area circuit. This article proposes a novel hybrid number system of BNs and stochastic number representation, called hybrid stochastic number (HSN). This study introduces the basic theoretical aspects of the HSN and demonstrates the properties of hybrid stochastic computing (HSC). The hardware implementation of deep neural network with HSC is fabricated using a standard 40-nm low-power CMOS process, with a core area of 0.53 mm2, power of 102.3 mW, and clock of 400 MHz, which has 4544 multiply accumulation operations (MACs).</description></item><item><title>A 16-Gb/s Baud-Rate CDR Circuit With One-Tap Speculative DFE and Wide Frequency Capture Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10414412</link><description>A 16-Gb/s baud-rate clock and data recovery (CDR) circuit with a one-tap decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) and a wide frequency capture range (FCR) is presented.

Unfortunately, the unique scaled dot-product attention mechanism and intensive memory access pose a significant challenge during inference on power-constrained edge devices. One emerging solution to this challenge is computing-in-memory (CIM), which uses memory cells for logic computation to reduce data movement and overcome the memory wall. However, existing CIM designs do not support high-precision computations, such as floating-point operations, which are essential for NLP applications. Furthermore, CIM architectures require complex control modules and costly peripheral circuits to harness the full potential of in-memory computation. Hence, this article proposes a scalable RRAM-based in-memory floating-point computation architecture (RIME) that uses single-cycle NOR, NAND, and minority logic to implement in-memory floating-point operations. RIME features efficient parallel and pipeline capabilities with a centralized control module and a simplified peripheral circuit to eliminate data movement during computation. Furthermore, the article proposes pipelined implementations of matrix&#8211;matrix multiplication (MatMul) and softmax functions, enabling the construction of a transformer accelerator based on RIME. Extensive experimental results show that compared with GPU-based implementation, the RIME-based transformer accelerator improves timing efficiency by  $2.3\times $  and energy efficiency by  $1.7\times $  without compromising inference accuracy.</description></item><item><title>In-Memory Wallace Tree Multipliers Based on Majority Gates Within Voltage-Gated SOT-MRAM Crossbar Arrays</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10399377</link><description>In-memory computing represents an efficient paradigm for high-performance computing using crossbar arrays of emerging nonvolatile devices. While various techniques have emerged to implement Boolean logic in memory, the latency of arithmetic circuits, particularly multipliers, significantly increases with bit-width. In this work, we introduce an in-memory Wallace tree multiplier based on majority gates within voltage-gated spin-orbit torque (SOT) magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) crossbar arrays. By utilizing a resistance sum, the majority gate is implemented during READ operations in voltage-gated SOT-MRAM crossbar arrays, resulting in reduced read currents and improved energy efficiency. We employ a series of READ and WRITE operations to perform multiplier calculations, leveraging the fast READ and WRITE speeds of voltage-gated SOT-MRAM devices. Furthermore, the use of five-input majority gates simplifies multiplication by employing uniform logic gates and reducing logic depth, thereby lowering the operation&#8217;s complexity and the total number of occupied cells. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed in-memory Wallace tree multipliers consume three times less energy for in-memory operations than previously reported  $4\times 4$  multipliers. Moreover, the proposed method reduces the delay overhead from O ( $n^{2}$ ) to O ( $\log _{2}{n}$ ), where  $\mathit {n}$  represents the number of bits.</description></item><item><title>HETA: A Heterogeneous Temporal CGRA Modeling and Design Space Exploration via Bayesian Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10374147</link><description>Due to its high energy efficiency and flexibility, coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture (CGRA) has gained increasing attention. Temporal CGRA is a typical category of CGRA that supports single-cycle context switching and time-multiplexing hardware resources to perform spatial and temporal computations. Although multiple temporal CGRAs have been proposed, an architecture with rich design parameters and heterogeneous modeling is still lacking. To this end, we propose a highly parameterized heterogeneous temporal CGRA, called HETA. However, the highly parameterized and heterogeneous design introduces a challenging design space for manual exploration. To address this challenge, we introduce a Bayesian-optimization (BO)-based design space exploration (DSE) of homogeneous and heterogeneous architectures. Different from other DSE processes that require defining the heterogeneous exploration strategy, our approach adopts a searching-pruning-based method without manual intervention. To improve the efficiency of DSE, we develop a fast statistic model for area evaluation, whose error is below 1%. In addition, a pipeline mapping (PiPMap) algorithm is developed to alleviate the restrictions caused by data synchronization and unleash the potential of the proposed architecture. Experimental results show that HETA can achieve 89%, 52%, and 47% improvement in throughput, area efficiency, and energy efficiency over the neighbor-to-neighbor (N2N)-based interconnect CGRA, respectively. Compared with the Switch-based interconnect CGRA, HETA&#8217;s area efficiency is increased by 61%. Furthermore, compared with the homogeneous architecture of HETA, the optimized heterogeneous architecture improves area efficiency and energy efficiency by 14.7% and 4.8%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A 6&#8211;18-GHz 6-bit Full-360&#176; Vector-Sum Phase Shifter With Low Error in 40-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10322687</link><description>A 6&#8211;18-GHz ultrawideband vector-sum phase shifter (PS) with 6-bit digital phase control for phased-array system in SMIC 40-nm CMOS process is presented in this article.

One, the subsampling down-conversion is inherently heterodyne in nature. Two, as a consequence to one, the passive mixer transparency property can not be exploited for providing impedance matching at the RF port by impedance translation. In this work, an eight-path quarter-rate subsampling (QRSS) mixer-first direct down-conversion architecture is proposed to address these issues. The proposed architecture simultaneously achieves quadrature direct down-conversion and impedance matching by using the third harmonic of the QRSS frequency,  $f_{s}$ . The impedance matching is achieved by exploiting the eight-path passive mixer transparency property. Compared to RF sampling receivers, this architecture employs a sampling frequency  $f_{s}$  three times lesser than  $f_{\text {RF}}$ , saving on the power consumption of nonoverlapping clock generation, distribution circuits, and frequency synthesizer. A test chip is fabricated in 1.2-V, 65-nm CMOS with an active area of 0.32 mm2. The subsampling eight-path mixer, baseband low-noise amplifier (LNA), and  ${\text{g}_{m}}$ -cell consume a power of  $800 \mu \text{W}$ , 23 mW, and 3 mW, respectively, for a target bandwidth of 90 MHz. Nonoverlapping clock generation circuit consumes 2&#8211;9.2 mW, over the band 0.4&#8211;1.8 GHz.

Nevertheless, these algorithms are implemented in the hardware or software of the physical devices. Consequently, attackers will exploit physical information leakages, such as the device&#8217;s power consumption, and use them to get secret keys. The correlation power analysis (CPA) attack is a powerful and efficient cryptographic technique. The evaluation method, however, takes time because many traces are necessary to overcome designs protected by different countermeasures. Therefore, this article proposes a new technique to reduce the computation time by extracting the point of interest (POI) with an interpolation method. The proposal uses the local extreme value and two adjacent samples around it to interpolate the actual peak amplitude. Compared to the conventional CPA, the execution time in our solution is decreased by approximately  $9.55\times $ , with only 53.32% of the given power traces used for attacking the masking design. Moreover, this technique can deal with the public desynchronized ASCAD database and has better results than recent alignment preprocessing methods. We apply the proposal in the preprocessing step before performing the previously non-profiled deep learning-based attacks. Our suggestion requires only 5000 traces, while the reported attacks fail or require more traces to recover the correct subkey.</description></item><item><title>An Open-Loop VCO-ADC Based on a Linearized Current Control Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10345506</link><description>This brief presents an open-loop current-controlled oscillator (CCO)-based analog-to-digital converter (ADC) intended for ultralow power direct digitizing micro-sensors readout applications.

An extensive array of parameters need to be gathered concurrently with high-precision, low-cost, and low-power sensor nodes, such as resistive (R) and capacitive (C) sensors. Single-chip channel fusion can be an effective solution, while it is challenging to suppress the noise and integrate massive I/O pads. However, conventional oversampling noise-shaping methods increase power consumption, which fails to meet the demand of long-term monitoring applications. In addition, existing R/C sensor-interface chips require a pair of I/O pads for each sensor, where the pad frame dominates the overall chip area in massive-channel integration. In this work, we demonstrate a 72-channel R&amp;amp;C sensor-interface chip for proximity-and-temperature sensing. A noise-orthogonalizing technique is proposed to eliminate the quantization noise at the signal frequencies, achieving an energy efficiency of 19.1 pJ/step/channel. Moreover, a pad-sharing technique is proposed to reduce the number of I/O pads by half, enabling 72 sensors to be read by 36 pairs of I/O pads. The chip is fabricated by 65-nm CMOS technology, and measurement results show resolutions of 286  $\Omega $  and 162 fF, respectively. The power consumption and die area are reduced to 0.74  $\mu \text{W}$ /Channel and 0.038 mm2/Channel, respectively.</description></item><item><title>An Area-Efficient Smart Temperature Sensor Based on a Fully Current Processing Error-Feedback Noise-Shaping SAR ADC in 180-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10371365</link><description>This article presents a bipolar junction transistor (BJT)-based smart temperature sensor employing a noise-shaping successive-approximation-register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC).

For the design of a DTC-free  $\Delta \Sigma $  fractional-N BBPLL, the use of a phase-domain lowpass filter (PDLPF) based on a finite-impulse response (FIR)-embedded injection-locked oscillator (FIR-ILO) is proposed. By integrating the FIR filtering in the ILO-based PDLPF, the quantization noise effect of the  $\Delta \Sigma $  modulator is significantly mitigated in the fractional-N BBPLL, resulting in good in-band phase noise and fractional spur performance. A prototype fractional-N BBPLL is implemented in 65-nm CMOS. With the proposed FIR-ILO PDLPF, the in-band phase noise and the fractional spur are improved by more than 25 and 10 dB, respectively. An in-band noise of &#8722;96.6 dBc/Hz and a reference spur of &#8722;78.7 dBc are achieved at 2.6-GHz output, consuming 4.3 mW from a 0.9-V supply. The proposed FIR-ILO filtering method is useful not only to improve the in-band noise and spur of the fractional-N BBPLL but also to provide an effective way of suppressing the out-of-band noise for conventional fractional-N PLLs.</description></item><item><title>A 4.6&#8211;400 K Functional Ringamp-Based 250 MS/s 12 b Pipelined ADC With PVT-Robust Unity-Gain-Frequency-Aware Bias Calibration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10313340</link><description>This article presents a process voltage temperature (PVT) -robust ring amplifier that enables a high speed pipelined analog-to-digital-converter (ADC) without gain calibration, operating across a temperature range of 4.6&#8211;400 K. To ensure the stability of the ringamp, given the large variation of MOSFET transconductance, threshold voltage, and drain resistance across temperature, we propose a unity-gain-frequency-aware bias calibration and a 1st-stage bias-enhancement technique. The unity-gain-frequency-aware bias calibration stabilizes the amplifier bandwidth by biasing the 3rd stage of the ringamp using a constant- $Gm$  circuit and then optimizing the overall phase margin by tuning the 1st and 2nd stages based on feedback from an amplifier output settling monitor. An additional bias-enhancement technique alleviates the issue of insufficient voltage headroom at cryogenic temperatures (CTs) in the fully differential first stage of the ringamp. This is achieved by separately ac-coupling the NMOS and PMOS of the 1st-stage inverter. Furthermore, to deal with insufficient gain in advanced CMOS process, a cascode correlated-level-shifting (CLS) technique is proposed. This enables gain-calibration-free operation while achieving higher speed than conventional CLS. A 12-bit 250 MS/s pipelined ADC prototype is fabricated with the proposed ringamp in 65 nm CMOS technology. It achieves a signal to noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) above 57.7 dB across the 4.6&#8211;400 K temperature range, and Walden figure-of-merit (FoM) of 154 fJ/conv.-step at 4.6 K while operating without any gain calibrations. To the best of our knowledge, the achieved functional temperature range is the widest ever reported for a pipelined ADC.</description></item><item><title>An ELDC-Free 4th-Order CT SDM Facilitated by 2nd-Order NS CT-SAR and AC-Coupled Negative-R</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375522</link><description>This article presents an excess loop delay compensation (ELDC) free 20 MHz bandwidth (BW) fourth-order continuous-time sigma-delta modulator (CT SDM) facilitated by a noise-shaping continuous-time successive-approximation register (NS CT-SAR) ADC. The modulator comprises a second-order single amplifier biquad (SAB) loop filter (LF) and a second-order NS CT-SAR with a passive integrator. The NS CT-SAR provides a stable second-order NS with a dedicated reset operation to ensure a robust input biasing for its CT interface. With ping-pong operation in the passive integrator, the delay of the 6b CT quantizer (QTZ) with 1b redundancy reduces to only one SA cycle, thus enabling the ELDC-free design. An ac-coupled negative-R is introduced to support the SAB integrator, which achieves low power and maintains a stable performance at band-edge input. The prototype is fabricated in 28-nm CMOS technology, occupying an active area of 0.037 mm2. It achieves 75.5-dB SNDR with 20 MHz BW at 750 MHz sampling frequency while consuming 2.78 mW from 1.5 to 1 V supply voltage. The proposed SDM yields a Walden figure-of-merit (FoMw) of 14.3 fJ/conversion step and a Schreier FOM (FoMS) of 174.1 dB, which are competitive among single loop architectures with similar sampling frequency and BW, while this design is ELDC-free.</description></item><item><title>A 7 GHz ERBW 1.1 GS/s 6-bit PVT Tolerant Asynchronous Charge-Injection SAR With Only 8.5 fF Input Capacitance in 28 nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10388348</link><description>This article presents a 6-bit 1.1 GS/s asynchronous charge-injection SAR (ci-SAR) analog-to-digital-converter (ADC) achieving an unprecedented area efficiency of 0.0048 [GS/s/ $\mu \text{m}^{2}$ ] per slice. A current-reduced charge injection cell (CIC) enables a small input capacitance of 8.5 fF, which helps extend the effective resolution bandwidth (ERBW) to 7 GHz.

However, due to their black-box nature in system, the underlying mechanisms of DNNs behind the inference results remain opaque to users. In order to address this challenge, researchers have focused on developing explainable artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. Explainable AI aims to provide a clear and human-understandable explanation of the model&#8217;s decision, thereby building more reliable systems. However, the explanation task differs from well-known inference and training processes as it involves interactions with the user. Consequently, existing inference and training accelerators face inefficiencies when processing explainable AI on edge devices. This article introduces explainable processing unit (EPU), the first hardware accelerator designed for explainable AI workloads. The EPU utilizes a novel data compression format for the output heat maps and intermediate gradients to enhance the overall system performance by reducing both memory footprint and external memory access. Its sparsity-free computing core efficiently handles the input sparsity with negligible control overhead, resulting in a throughput boost of up to 9.48&#215; It also proposes a dynamic workload scheduling with a customized ON-chip network for distinct inference and explanation tasks to maximize internal data reuse hence reducing external memory access by 63.7%. Furthermore, the EPU incorporates point-wise gradient pruning (PGP) that can significantly reduce the size of heat maps by a factor of 7.01&#215; combined with the proposed compression format. Finally, the EPU chip fabricated in a 28 nm CMOS process achieves a remarkable heat map generation rate of 367 frames/s for ResNet-34 while maintaining the state-of-the-art area and energy efficiency of 112.3 GOPS/mm2 and 26.55 TOPS/W, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A 4-bit Calibration-Free Computing-In-Memory Macro With 3T1C Current-Programed Dynamic-Cascode Multi-Level-Cell eDRAM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10360848</link><description>Analog computing-in-memory (CIM) has been widely explored for computing neural networks (NNs) efficiently. However, most analog CIM implementations trade compute accuracy for energy efficiency. The low accuracy restricts the practical application of analog CIM. In this article, a current-programming CIM that unifies the weight programming and computing in the current domain is proposed to address this dilemma. The enabled technique is a novel 3-transistor 1-capacitor (3T1C) embedded dynamic random access memory (eDRAM) cell. The current-programming mechanism and the dynamic-cascode read structure of the 3T1C cell make it immune to transistor-level non-idealities, including nonlinear  $I$ &#8211; $V$ , threshold voltage variations, and short-channel effect. Therefore, the cell enables multi-level-cell (MLC) operations without any calibration, supporting eight current-weight levels (0&#8211;700 nA). In addition, a voltage&#8211;current two-step programming scheme is proposed to boost the sub-microamphere current-weight writing speed. To support signed 4-b weights, a pseudo-differential CIM cell composed of two 3T1C MLCs is developed.

Despite the potential, its unstructured positions of zeros and a wide range of sparsity make it challenging to exploit this nature in hardware implementations that are often built on regular structures. To address these challenges, this article presents a low-power and high-performance AI accelerator, the so-called FreFlex, via sparsity-adaptive dynamic frequency modulation (SA-DFM) conjointly with the proposed processing element (PE) in a 2-D systolic array. The sparsity of each layer is determined by counting zero elements from the output while the layer is being computed. Then, the clock frequency is optimally modulated based on the sparsity level obtained from the previous layer&#8217;s output, which becomes an input of the next layer. The unused power slack due to the sparsity is exploited to boost performance while fully using the power budget. The proposed technique achieves up to 1.8 $\times $  performance improvement by exploiting the sparsity while incurring less than 7% power overhead, even when there is no sparsity. The silicon prototype, fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS node, demonstrates 0.6&#8211;1.0-TOPS/W efficiency for convolution and attention computations, with a performance of 160 GOPS/s/mm2 with a maximum frequency of 1.1 GHz.</description></item><item><title>A 0.61-&#956;W Fully Integrated Keyword-Spotting ASIC With Real-Point Serial FFT-Based MFCC and Temporal Depthwise Separable CNN</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10366379</link><description>A fully integrated near-microphone keyword spotting (KWS) chip is proposed to directly interact with a passive microphone and achieve submicrowatt power for the Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

By driving the two ports of a Gilbert-cell with in- phase signals, but reducing the switching-quad duty-cycle, the output current assumes square-wave shape at twice the input frequency, with enhanced harmonic conversion gain and free of DC offset. By avoiding the need of quadrature-signals generation, commonly required in multiplier-based frequency doublers, the performance advantage of the proposed approach is intrinsically broadband. The switching-quad duty-cycle is reduced by biasing the switching-quad transistors with a DC offset automatically regulated by a simple low-frequency loop. The article includes a detailed discussion of the operation principle, an analysis of the robustness to impairments, and thorough design considerations. The performance of the proposed architecture is finally compared against a conventional quadrature-driven Gilbert-cell doubler designed and implemented with the same technology. Realized in a SiGe-BiCMOS process, and operating at 1.5 V supply voltage, the doubler achieves state-of-the-art conversion gain (6 dB),  ${P_{\mathrm{ sat}}}$  (5.7 dBm) and efficiency (17%). The operation bandwidth, of more than one octave (14&#8211;32 GHz), demonstrates a remarkable improvement against previous works.</description></item><item><title>A Fully Integrated 135-GHz Direct-Digital 16-QAM Wireless and Dielectric Waveguide Link in 28-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10260317</link><description>This article presents a fully integrated direct-digital 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) communication link operating at 135 GHz. The transmitter employs a Cartesian direct-digital modulation architecture capable of generating a low-EVM 16-QAM constellation without relying on high-speed digital-to-analog converters (DACs). The receiver performs on-chip 16-QAM demodulation in the analog domain by means of pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) decoders, obviating the need for high-speed analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The transmitter and receiver chips were fabricated in 28-nm CMOS and were used to establish both a wireless and a dielectric waveguide (DWG) link via off-chip Vivaldi antennas.

In this article, a full CMOS integration of two sub-DACs and an active analog multiplexer (AMUX) on a single chip in 28-nm fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (FD-SOI) CMOS technology is presented for the first time for sampling rates of 100 GS/s and beyond. Sampling rates up to 108 GS/s for broadband pulse-amplitude modulated (PAM) signals and up to 118 GS/s for oversampled signals are shown outperforming previously reported data in terms of sampling rate or data rate, respectively. Two 8-bit sub-DACs up to 59 GS/s with CMOS inverter-based output drivers and pseudo-segmentation provide the analog input data for the 2:1 AMUX realized in current-mode topology. An additional on-chip memory of 256 kB completes the system to a universal arbitrary waveform generator (AWG). At 100 GS/s, the total power consumption is about 4 W. Generally, an AMUX is able to shift the limits of DACs in well-established CMOS technologies toward higher frequencies independent on technology advances and opens a second, conceptual path for achieving higher sampling rates with an additional benefit of a principle bandwidth extension by the AMUX operation.</description></item><item><title>A Frequency-Division Transceiver for Long-Range Neural Signal Recording From Multiple Subjects</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286830</link><description>This article proposed a multiple-point multiple-channel wireless neural signal recording system-on-chip (SoC) integrated a frequency-division (FD) transceiver.

A single-channel phase-tracking receiver (RX) was proposed for a low-power downlink to receive control commands. An FD multiple access-based coordinator receiving method was proposed, enabling multiple-point recording without increasing the power consumption of the on-body side. A configurable cascaded-integrator-comb sub-band filter bank-based time-multiplexing demodulation algorithm was proposed with 20 $\times $  and 5 $\times $  reduction of the number of multiply accumulates (MACs) and their operations compared with the direct filter method, respectively. Experimental results show a power consumption of 4.18 mW for the SoC with 16-channel neural signal recording and &#8722;5-dBm transmitter output power. The on-chip receiver consumes 3.81 mW in the waiting signal stage and 3.26 mW in the demodulation stage. A sensitivity of &#8722;91 dB was achieved for the on-chip phase-tracking receiver.

To increase hardware utilization and minimize reconfigurability overhead, Amber features the following: 1) dynamic partial reconfiguration (DPR) of the CGRA for higher resource utilization by allowing fast switching between applications and partitioning resources between simultaneous applications; 2) streaming memory controllers supporting affine access patterns for efficient mapping of dense linear algebra; and 3) low-overhead transcendental and complex arithmetic operations. The physical design of Amber features a unique clock distribution method and timing methodology to efficiently layout its hierarchical and tile-based design. Amber achieves a peak energy efficiency of 538 INT16 GOPS/W and 483 BFloat16 GFLOPS/W. Compared with a CPU, a GPU, and a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), Amber has up to 3902 $\times $ , 152 $\times $ , and 107 $\times $  better energy-delay product (EDP), respectively.</description></item><item><title>DIMCA: An Area-Efficient Digital In-Memory Computing Macro Featuring Approximate Arithmetic Hardware in 28 nm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10266328</link><description>Recent SRAM-based in-memory computing (IMC) hardware demonstrates high energy efficiency and throughput for matrix&#8211;vector multiplication (MVM), the dominant kernel for deep neural networks (DNNs). Earlier IMC macros have employed analog-mixed-signal (AMS) arithmetic hardware. However, those so-called AIMCs suffer from process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. Digital IMC (DIMC) macros, on the other hand, exhibit better robustness against PVT variations, but they tend to require more silicon area. This article proposes novel DIMC hardware featuring approximate arithmetic (DIMCA) to improve area efficiency without hurting compute density (CD). We also propose an approximation-aware training model and a customized number format to compensate for the accuracy degradation caused by the approximation hardware. We prototyped the test chip in 28-nm CMOS. It contains two versions: the DIMCA with single-approximate hardware (DIMCA1) and DIMCA with double-approximate hardware (DIMCA2). The measurement results show that DIMCA1 supports a 4 b-activation and 1 b-weight (4 b/1 b) CNN model, achieving 327 kb/mm2, 458&#8211;990 TOPS/W (normalized to 1 b/1 b), 8.27&#8211;392 TOPS/mm2 (normalized to 1 b/1 b), and 90.41% accuracy for CIFAR-10. DIMCA2 supports a 1 b/1 b CNN model, achieving 485 kb/mm2, 932&#8211;2219 TOPS/W, 14.4&#8211;607 TOPS/mm2, and 86.96% accuracy for CIFAR-10.</description></item><item><title>Revisiting Dynamic Logic&#8212;A True Candidate for Energy-Efficient Cryogenic Operation in Nanoscaled Technologies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10324399</link><description>Dynamic logic is a high-speed technology that was previously used in mature technologies, but lost popularity due to the increased leakage and process variations in advanced technologies. However, the recent popularity of circuits running in the cryogenic region provides a new opportunity for dynamic operation, thanks to the reduced leakages at such low temperatures. This paper revisits dynamic logic as a true candidate for high-performance and energy-efficient circuits for cryogenic operation in nanoscaled technologies. The paper first overviews and analyzes transistor operation at cryogenic temperatures and how it influences digital circuit design targeted to this regime. With these effects in mind, the use of dynamic logic families, including the classical dynamic (NORA) logic and the recently introduced Dual Mode Logic (DML) and Dual Mode Pass Logic (DMPL) families, are examined under cryogenic operation, showcasing improved performance and power efficiency. Measurements conducted on a 16 nm FinFET test chip validate their operation at low temperatures down to 4K, with supply voltages ranging 0.4&#8211;0.8-V. Furthermore, the considered dual mode logic families exhibit performance enhancements of up to 26% in dynamic mode and power efficiency increases up to 53% in static mode, compared to CMOS.</description></item><item><title>VLSI Architectures of Approximate Arithmetic Units Applied to Parallel Sensors Calibration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10324468</link><description>Approximate computing maximizes area and energy savings for a trade-off between quality and efficiency. Approximate arithmetic operators have emerged as an efficient alternative to design low-power VLSI circuits. This paper investigates the design of approximate arithmetic operator units used in the calibration procedure for radio astronomy light sensors &#8212; the so-called StEFCal (statistically efficient and fast calibration) method. The StEFCal algorithm comprises arithmetic operations like a divider, square-accumulate (SAC), and multiply-accumulate (MAC) units. The StEFCal circuit of this work explores the following arithmetic operators: i) two approximate squarer units from the literature, i.e., radix-4 (AxRSU) and SquASH, ii) two approximate iterative-based Newton-Raphson (NR) and Goldschmidt (GLD) dividers, iii) one approximate parallel prefix adder (AxPPA), and iv) a new approximate radix-4 multiplier (AxRMU), proposed in this work, explored in the StEFCal multiply-accumulate circuit design. The AxRSU utilizes the parameters  $K1$  and  $K2$  to represent the number of exact encoders for squarer- and conventional-partial products, respectively, subsequently replaced with approximate encoders. The same principle applies to AxRMU, where the parameter  $K$  indicates the number of exact encoders for conventional-partial products, subsequently exchanged with approximate encoders. We demonstrate the efficiency of StEFCal using the approximate arithmetic operators from the Pareto-optimal front that expresses the area- and power-quality trade-off. The results show that using the AxRSU with  $K1=4$  and  $K2=6$ , AxRMU, and AxPPA with  $K=16$  and NR with one iteration has an MSE equal to 89.98dB and offers up to  $158\times $  energy-savings compared to the exact StEFCal, and up to  $25\times $  more energy-savings and  $3.33\times $  area-savings compared with our previous work,  $440\times $  energy-savings compared to the accurate state-of-the-art, and  $258\times $  compared with the approximate state-of-the-art.</description></item><item><title>RSACIM: Resistance Summation Analog Computing in Memory With Accuracy Optimization Scheme Based on MRAM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10339805</link><description>Computing in memory (CIM) has become a promising candidate to address the Von Neumann bottleneck in processors designed for data-intensive applications. In this article, we propose a resistance summation analog computing in memory (RSACIM) with accuracy optimization scheme in spin transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM), in order to realize energy-efficient and highly reliable analog multiply-and-accumulation (MAC) operation. Firstly, we construct a resistance summation array by serial magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) to perform analog MAC operation utilizing time domain technology. Secondly, in order to reduce the impact of position-dependent error caused by resistance summation mechanism, we propose an accuracy optimization scheme to maximize the sensing margin (SM) and computation accuracy. Finally, we design a power-gated reconfigurability control scheme to implement power saving corresponding to different precisions for both input and weight. Evaluation on a 2 Kb RSACIM architecture shows an energy efficiency of 92.9 TOPS/W. System level simulation shows that comparing to existing CIMs based on MRAM, RSACIM architecture saves the inference energy by 4.2 times with 8.4 times lower latency in CIFAR10 image classification task.</description></item><item><title>A Mixed-Signal Quantized Neural Network Accelerator Using Flash Transistors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10342877</link><description>This paper presents a mixed-signal architecture for implementing Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs) using flash transistors, to achieve extremely high throughput with extremely low power, energy and memory requirements. Its low resource utilization makes our design especially suited for use in edge devices. The network weights are stored in-memory using flash transistors, and neurons perform operations in the analog current domain. Our design can be programmed with any QNN whose hyperparameters (the number of layers, filters, or filter size, etc) do not exceed the maximum provisioned. Once the flash devices are programmed with a trained model and our IC is given an input, our architecture performs inference with zero access to off-chip memory. We demonstrate the robustness of our design under current-mode non-linearities arising from process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. We test validation accuracy on the ImageNet dataset, and show that our IC suffers only 0.71% and 0.92% reduction in classification accuracy for Top-1 and Top-5 outputs, respectively. Our implementation achieves between  $2.1\times $  and  $125\times $  better energy efficiency than previous NVM-based QNN accelerators. Our approach provides layer partitioning and neuron sharing options, which allow us to trade off latency, power, and area amongst each other.</description></item><item><title>A High Accuracy and Bandwidth Digital Background Calibration Technique for Timing Skew in TI-ADCs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375893</link><description>This paper presents a digital background timing-skew calibration technique with high accuracy and bandwidth in time-interleaved (TI) analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Compared with other calibration works, it features three highlights. Firstly, the proposed DCSD-based step-by-step and grouping calibration scheme can effectively improve the correction accuracy by minimizing the root mean square (RMS) value of the detected timing skews. Secondly, the linear compensation for a 13-taps FIR filter and the decimation-calibration-interpolation working pattern are used to expand the calibration effective bandwidth to the whole first Nyquist zone from different perspectives. Thirdly, the binary search is employed, instead of LMS algorithm, in order to meet the compensation requirement for FIR filter and improve the convergence speed and accuracy significantly in timing-skew detection. As a result, the proposed technique achieves the widest calibration bandwidth and higher accuracy compared to other fully digital calibration techniques while having the great convergence speed. Simulation model in MATLAB and FPGA-based hardware verification are employed to demonstrate its significant improvement on the performance and hardware overhead of the TI-ADCs. Finally, the proposed technique is employed in a 10-bit 2.5 GS/s 4-way TI-SAR ADC fabricated by standard CMOS 28nm process. The measurement results show that with the proposed technique, the SFDR and SNDR are improved by 18.9 and 17.9 dB at Nyquist frequency, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Cryo-CMOS SAR ADC With FIA Sampling Driver Enabled by Cryogenic-Aware Back-Biasing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10348019</link><description>This paper presents a floating inverter amplifier (FIA) that performs high-linearity amplification and sampling while driving a  $2\times $  time-interleaved (TI) SAR ADC, operating from room temperature (RT) down to 4.2K. The power-efficient FIA samples the continuous-time input signal by windowed integration, thus avoiding the traditional sample-and-hold. Cascode switching, a floating supply and accurate pulse-width timing calibration enable high-speed operation and interleaving. In addition, by exploiting the behavior of CMOS devices at cryogenic temperatures, forward-body-biasing (FBB) is pushed well beyond what is possible at RT to ensure performance down to 4.2K, and its impact on the performance of cryogenic circuits is analyzed. The resulting ADC, implemented in 40-nm bulk CMOS and including the FIA driver, achieves SNDR=38.7dB (38.2dB), SFDR&gt;50dB (&gt;50dB), and FOMW=25.4fJ/conv-step (31.3 fJ/conv-step) with Nyquist-rate input at 1.0GS/s (0.9GS/s) at 4.2K (RT), respectively.</description></item><item><title>Design of Wideband Asymmetric Doherty Power Amplifier Using a New Phase Compensation Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10339859</link><description>This article proposes a new phase compensation technique to expand the operating bandwidth of an asymmetric Doherty power amplifier (ADPA). Its operation principle is to increase the solution space of network parameters, thereby contributing to the broadband solvability of network parameters. The article provides a general method for solving network parameters in theory and numerical solutions for each network parameter. To verify the theory, a simple current source model simulates the load modulation process. The results show that this new compensation technique has consistent performance with the load modulation process of traditional ADPA at a similar parameter solution region. This technique can greatly expand the applicability of the network and allow for a more flexible design of ADPA. Furthermore, this theory was validated by designing a broadband ADPA of 1.7&#8211;2.7-GHz. The experimental results show that the saturation output power range is 46.9 dBm&#8211;48.5 dBm, with a saturation gain between 6 dB&#8211;9.3 dB and a corresponding saturation efficiency of 44%&#8211;69%. The efficiency is between 37%&#8211;65% at 6 dB back-off and 44%&#8211;52% at 9 dB back-off.</description></item><item><title>X-Band Power Divider Design and Its Network for Active Electronically Scanned Array Vertical Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10356896</link><description>In this paper, a circuit topology of the wideband power divider is proposed based on the coupled transmission lines and complex isolation impedance.

AdderNets use lightweight addition operations to replace multiplication and accumulation (MAC) operations, but can keep almost the same accuracy compared to other CNNs. Nevertheless, challenges still exist with regards to hardware resources, power consumption, and communication bandwidth, primarily due to the &#8216;Von-Neumann bottlenecks&#8217;. However, computing-in-memory (CIM) architecture based on magnetic random-access memory (MRAM) has great potential for edge DNN implementation. In this paper, we propose a novel CIM paradigm using a novel Toggle-Spin-Torques (TST) driven MRAM for energy-efficient AdderNets (called CiTST_AdderNets). In CiTST_AdderNets, MRAM is driven by the interplay of the field-free spin orbit torque (SOT) effect and the spin transfer torque (STT) effect, which offers a fascinating prospect for energy efficiency and speed. Furthermore, a novel CIM paradigm is proposed to implement the dominating subtraction and sum operations in AdderNets, reducing data transfer and the related energy. Meanwhile, a highly parallel array structure integrating computation and storage is designed to support CiTST_AdderNets. In addition, a mapping strategy is proposed to efficiently map the convolution layer on the array. Fully connected layers can also be efficiently computed. The CiTST-AdderNets macro is designed by using a 65-nm CMOS process. Results show that our CiTST-AdderNets consumes about 1.65 mJ, 9.29 mJ, and 42.46 mJ for running VGG8, ResNet-50, and ResNet-18 respectively at 8-bit fixed-point precision. Compared to state-of-the-art platforms, our macro achieves an energy efficiency improvement of 1.45 x to 66.78 x.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Latency FPGA Accelerator for YOLOv3-Tiny With Flexible Layerwise Mapping and Dataflow</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10360333</link><description>Object detection models have demonstrated outstanding performance in terms of accuracy. However, mapping convolutional neural network-based object-detection models to memory and computing-constrained devices is still challenging, which commonly leads to accuracy degradation and long latency. To address the problem, this work presents a design methodology to map the YOLOv3-tiny model onto a small FPGA board, in this case the Nexys A7-100T, which only has 0.5 MB on-chip SRAM and 240 DSPs. First, we design four identical MAC arrays to maximize the throughput by utilizing both DSPs and LUTs. Second, to exploit the MACs fully, we propose a dynamic data reuse scheme that handles inter-layer and intra-layer executions effectively under a small on-chip SRAM footprint. To this end, the proposed accelerator achieves an inference speed of 76.75 frames per second and throughput of 95.08 GOPs at 100MHz and consumes power of 2.203W. Specifically, it achieves a hardware utilization rate of 82.53%, thus significantly outperforming current YOLOv3-tiny accelerators.</description></item><item><title>Fast FPGA Prototyping to Explore and Compare New SPWM Strategies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10378975</link><description>This study presents a Flexible Test Bench (FTB) implemented with FPGA that synthesises of a large number of strategies that apply &#8220;Spread Spectrum&#8221; to reduce the energy of the fundamental harmonics present in a conventional Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). The FTB not only incorporates most of the known spread spectrum techniques but also allows to combine them and even to easily create new ones, thus providing a highly flexible test bench. The FTB has been described in standard VHDL, so it can be synthesised using any synthesis tool, and the number of logical resources used by each of them can be determined according to the spread spectrum strategy configured in its registers. Therefore, a tool is available to choose, according to the spectral response and the consumption of logic resources, the most suitable PWM spread spectrum strategy for each application. The particularity of the proposal is to have a unique hardware platform that allows the comparison of different techniques under the same physical implementation conditions since geometry and physical location are important when evaluating the conducted and radiated emission of the circuits. Another objective of our FTB is to solve in a unified way all the numerical aspects present in the FPGA-based implementation so that the numerical ranges and roundings used affect all the implemented techniques equally.</description></item><item><title>Stability Analysis for On-Off Voltage-Mode Controlled VHF Converter Combining Short-Period and Long-Period Discrete Map Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10376210</link><description>Benefited from harmonics well-defined and easy design of filter, the ON-OFF voltage-mode control strategy suitable for the very-high-frequency (VHF, 30~300MHz) dc-dc converter has been developed in recent year. However, the potential risk of this control strategy is that unreasonable parameter design will lead to system instability. Moreover, the conventional stability methods are also difficult to adopt in VHF converters due to its feature of high circuit order and many operating modes as well as extremely high switching frequency. Hence, this article proposes a new stability analysis method suitable for VHF converter employing the ON-OFF voltage-mode control strategy. Firstly, the combined characteristic of short-period switching signal and long-period modulation signal is considered, which dividing the VHF converter into short-period open-loop system and long-period closed-loop system. Then, by establishing both system discrete iterative map models, the effect of converter and controller parameters on stability are revealed by using bifurcation diagram and eigenvalue locus as well as Jacobian matrix. As a result, the established system models and stability analysis can obtain the stability boundary and predict the nonlinear behavior, which helps to guide the parameters design to ensure system stability. Finally, experimental results evaluated the correctness of the theoretical analysis.</description></item><item><title>LEAPS: Topological-Layout-Adaptable Multi-Die FPGA Placement for Super Long Line Minimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10364626</link><description>Multi-die FPGAs are crucial components in modern computing systems, particularly for high-performance applications such as artificial intelligence and data centers. Super long lines (SLLs) provide interconnections between super logic regions (SLRs) for a multi-die FPGA on a silicon interposer. They have significantly higher delay compared to regular interconnects, which need to be minimized. With the increase in design complexity, the growth of SLLs gives rise to challenges in timing and power closure. Existing placement algorithms focus on optimizing the number of SLLs but often face limitations due to specific topologies of SLRs. Furthermore, they fall short of achieving continuous optimization of SLLs throughout the entire placement process. This highlights the necessity for more advanced and adaptable solutions. In this paper, we propose LEAPS, a comprehensive, systematic, and adaptable multi-die FPGA placement algorithm for SLL minimization. Our contributions are threefold: 1) proposing a high-performance global placement algorithm for multi-die FPGAs that optimizes the number of SLLs while addressing other essential design constraints such as wirelength, routability, and clock routing; 2) introducing a versatile method for more complex SLR topologies of multi-die FPGAs, surpassing the limitations of existing approaches; and 3) executing continuous optimization of SLL counts across the whole placement stages, including global placement (GP), legalization (LG), and detailed placement (DP). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LEAPS in reducing SLLs and enhancing circuit performance. Compared with the most recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, LEAPS achieves an average reduction of 43.08% in SLL counts and 9.99% in HPWL while exhibiting a notable  $34.34\times $  improvement in runtime.</description></item><item><title>DNN-Based Optimization to Significantly Speed Up and Increase the Accuracy of Electronic Circuit Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10385177</link><description>Efficient design and optimization of flip-flops can significantly affect overall circuit performance as they have many applications in digital systems which can impact the overall power consumption and timings of the emerging system on chips (SOCs). In this paper, modeling, design, and optimization of transmission gate-based master-slave positive-edge-triggered flip-flop (TGFF) in 16 nm complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) is proposed. The proposed deep neural network (DNN)-based optimization method first generates an accurate model for different performance metrics by using the training data obtained from transistor-level models which are over 100 times faster than them. Then, these accurate DNN-based models are used to optimize design goals such as dynamic and static power, setup time, and propagation delay (Data to Output). Using these fast, accurate models significantly speed up the design procedure and leads to a considerably more optimized design. Additionally, as the DNN is a universal approximator that can catch any nonlinear input-output relationship, the proposed method can be used to optimize circuits for any performance metric, even if no analytical formula is available. Additionally, circuit design based on the proposed method is automated which, facilitates the tasks of circuit designers.</description></item><item><title>Edge-Side Fine-Grained Sparse CNN Accelerator With Efficient Dynamic Pruning Scheme</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10385165</link><description>With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), it has become a common concern of academia and industry to provide real-time high performance services for edge-side applications and to bestow intelligence on massive edge-side devices. Due to the limitations of storage space, volume and power consumption of edge side devices, it is difficult for existing convolutional neural networks with large number of parameters and large amount of computation to match them. Network pruning can effectively alleviate the excessive parameters and computation issues in CNNs. However, fine-grained pruning is not hardware friendly, while other structured pruning schemes will result in a much higher loss of accuracy under the same compression ratio. In this paper, an model compression strategy is given including the proposed efficient fine-grained pruning scheme, a dynamic pruning &amp; training method, and a weight importance judgment method. Depending on this strategy, sparse VGG16 (ResNet50) model can be obtained by training from scratch, and achieves a total of  $16\times $  compression ratio with 1/32 indexing overhead. Further, a light-weight, high-performance sparse CNN accelerator with modified systolic array is proposed. Implementing VGG16 and ResNet50 on the proposed accelerator, the experimental results show that compared with the most advanced design, the proposed accelerator can achieve 8.13 Frames Per Second (FPS) with  $2.17\times $  better power efficiency and at most  $4.14\times $  better calculation density.</description></item><item><title>Extended Application of Improved D-D-&#931; Current Control in Synchronous Inverter Cluster Considering N Times Equivalent Impedance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10343133</link><description>Photovoltaic (PV) power station is an inverter cluster with a single grid connected inverter as the unit. The resonance frequency shift caused by the grid impedance of the inverter cluster under weak grid is more serious. In this paper, Dual-Division-Summation (D-D- $\Sigma$ ) current control strategy is extended to inverter cluster to solve the more serious problem of resonant frequency offset. A derivative curve of logarithmic amplitude frequency characteristic curve is used to analyze the resonance characteristics, and the change of resonance characteristics caused by equivalent grid impedance is analyzed mathematically. Aiming at the resonance characteristics after the equivalent impedance is enlarged by  $N$  times, a resonance suppression strategy of inverter cluster under weak grid is proposed. The control gain of the resonance suppression strategy is obtained through the Routh Criterion, which can consider the wider range of resonance frequency offset. The experimental results verify the correctness of the above analysis.</description></item><item><title>Model Predictive Control of Overloaded Stand-Alone Hybrid AC/DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10376460</link><description>In recent years, hybrid AC/DC microgrids have become popular due to their combined benefits from both AC and DC microgrids. One of the challenges in such a system stems from high AC load demands, which can jeopardize the stability of the system. The existing droop controllers, which are based on the per-unit values of DC voltage and AC frequency, have poor performances in sharing the active power between the DC and AC microgrids in the case of high AC load demands. These controllers are required to provide very high gains to mitigate the power sharing problem in overloaded cases, which make the system more sensitive to overload disturbances. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel control scheme based on model predictive controllers to compensate for the poor performance of the existing power sharing droop controllers. The proposed controller minimizes the active power difference between the DC and AC microgrids by transferring more power from the DC to the AC microgrid. The simulation results illustrate the outperformance of the proposed model predictive control method as compared to the benchmark techniques including Fuzzy-proportional-integral-derivative, adaptive-fractional-two-degree-of-freedom proportional-integral-derivative, and virtual impedance in terms of steady-state overload power sharing, transient overload damping, nonlinear load harmonic attenuation, and integral time absolute error analyses.</description></item><item><title>Correlated Channel-Oriented Expectation Propagation-Based Detector for Massive MIMO Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10376221</link><description>The expectation propagation (EP) algorithm is near-optimal in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems but suffers from high computation complexity. Most of the previous works exploit the channel hardening property and introduce iterative matrix inversion algorithms to simplify the EP algorithm, but the performance degrades dramatically in non-ideal channels. In this paper, we propose a more universal EP-based detector, which can perform well in both ideal and non-ideal channels. Firstly, two general methods are proposed to effectively improve the detection performance and convergence speed of iterative matrix inversion algorithms under correlated channels. The proposed diagonal preprocessing (DP) method can improve the detection performance by more than 2-dB compared to not using this method; the novel eigenvalue parameter estimation method guarantees the convergence of all the frames. These two methods are applied to the second-order Richardson iteration (SORI) algorithm to derive the DP-SORI algorithm, which converges more than twice as fast as the state-of-the-art design. Secondly, for another important part of EP-based algorithms, namely the calculation of expectation and variance, complicated operations such as exponentiations, divisions, and inversions are all removed by algorithmic optimization. Moreover, based on the proposed approximate EP with DP-SORI (EPA-DP-SORI) algorithm, an efficient hardware design is developed, combining multiple optimization methods such as efficient matrix multiplication architecture design and low-complexity LDL decomposition. In addition to better detection performance compared with the state-of-the-art design, the presented EPA-DP-SORI detector can also deliver  $1.27 \times $  and  $1.57 \times $  higher area and energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Where Should Inverter-Based Resources Be Located in Power Networks?</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10339867</link><description>In this paper, we investigate the influence of the locations of inverter-based resources (IBRs) on the synchronization performance of power networks. We propose two indexes to measure the distribution of inertia in power networks, considering the distribution of control parameters and the topological factors jointly. The first index is the inertia clustering coefficient, which measures how densely the neighbors of each node are connected in a power network. The second index is the inertia centrality coefficient, which captures whether the distribution of inertia in a power network is centralized or peripheral. We characterize synchronous generators (SGs), grid-following inverters (GFLs), and grid-forming inverters (GFMs) by their damping and inertial properties. We evaluate the synchronization performance of the system after disturbances by adopting the settling time and hertz-sec metric. Both the frequency response and the trajectories of eigenvalues show that the location of IBRs has a significant impact on the synchronization performance of the system. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted on two test networks, the results of the IEEE 30-, 57-, and 118-bus systems demonstrate a strong correlation between synchronization performance and the two inertia distribution indexes.</description></item><item><title>Synthesizing Step-Down Switched Capacitor Power Converter Topologies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10339894</link><description>The fast-growing development in wearable electronic devices leads to high demand for small-volume, lightweight, and high-efficiency DC-DC power converters, particularly switched capacitor (SC) DC-DC converters. In this paper, we propose a synthesis framework of step-down SC DC-DC power converters to obtain an optimum converter topology under the design constraints of the conversion ratio and a minimum number of capacitors. The proposed rule-based clustering reduction techniques have reduced the search space and sped up the conversion ratio analysis. In the case study of 8:1 converter synthesis, the run-time for conversion ratio analysis is reduced by  $1.26 \,\, \boldsymbol {\times } \,\, \boldsymbol {10^{6}}$ . The proposed efficiency optimization method has improved the peak efficiencies of the cascaded 2:1 converter and Fibonacci converter by 4.7% and 12.8%.

The frontend signaling path is optimized to maximize the receiver&#8217;s bandwidth in combination with a T-coil that mitigates the loading effect of the electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection cell. The following continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE) employs an inverter-based TAS-transimpedance (TIA) stage in a subtraction configuration to compensate for the channel loss. The dual-path T-coil is optimally designed for the CTLE core based on the characteristics of the low and high-frequency signaling paths of the subtractive equalizer to maximize the bandwidth of the high-frequency path. The complementary transconductances with current biasing achieve high gain, wide linearity, and high power supply rejection ratio (PSRR).

The differential amplifier employs multi-coupling inductors and transmission lines at the inter-stage to perform high-gain, high-robustness and miniaturization. The compact multi-coupling inductors used in the  $G_{\mathrm{ m}}$ -boosting technique and noise reduction technique consists of three inductors connected to the base, emitter, and collector of the transistor, respectively.

The proposed differential amplifier provides a measured peak gain of 25.6-dB at 222.5 GHz with a 3-dB bandwidth of 23.4 GHz from 211.4&#8211;234.8 GHz and a simulated noise figure (NF) of 14.1 dB at 220 GHz. Furthermore, the stability condition indicates that the amplifier is unconditionally stable in all frequency bands.

However, the traditional CDL amplifier is very sensitive to its bias voltage, which makes it not user-friendly. In order to improve the sensitivity to the change of bias voltage, this brief proposes a high linearity and bias-robust CDL-amp. It no longer needs to calibrate the bias voltage from outside the chip. Instead, an additional mimetic control circuit is introduced to the CDL-amp, which assists in stopping the CDL-amp amplification process at the optimal linearity instant. Thanks to this on-chip mimical circuit, the CDL-amp&#8217;s linearity is less sensitive to the bias voltage fluctuations. We perform this design in a 28-nm CMOS process. Post-layout simulation result shows a 98.7 dB spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) under 20 MHz clock frequency and 1.8 V supply. Compared to the prior art of high linearity dynamic-amp, this design outperforms by about 20 dB in SFDR. The total-harmonic-distortion (THD) is improved by about 7 dB under supply voltage variations and by about 15 dB under input level variations, respectively. Besides, this fully-dynamic amplifier only consumes  $48~\bf {\mu W}$ .</description></item><item><title>A High-Efficiency E-Band Power Amplifier With Optimized Output Matching Network in a 28-nm Bulk CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10293157</link><description>This brief presents an E-band high-efficiency power amplifier (PA) implemented in a 28-nm bulk CMOS technology. The output matching network (OMN) is optimized for high power and high efficiency through a co-optimization technique where the optimum load admittance (Yopt) is derived by incorporating the loss of the OMN with the active device performance. In the mm-wave band, a transformer with a single turn ratio is widely used for OMN but poses a limitation on the maximum achievable conductance (Gout.max) to be seen by the output transistor. Therefore, a shunt capacitor (CL) is employed in this brief to boost  ${\mathrm{ G}}_{\mathrm{ out.max}}$  up to the value required for reaching Yopt. Finally, the transformer dimension and  ${\mathrm{ C}}_{\mathrm{ L}}$  are optimized for high efficiency and power through the co-optimization technique. The measurement shows that the PA exhibits more than 13.4 dBm of saturated power from 65 to 80 GHz. A peak power-added efficiency (PAE) of 27% is achieved at 71 GHz, which is the highest PAE among the reported E-band CMOS PAs to the best of authors&#8217; knowledge. The PAE is maintained higher than 20% from 65 to 75 GHz. The PA exhibits a rms EVM of &#8722;25.8 dB, average PAE of 8.7%, and average output power of 5.8 dBm with a 3-Gbps 64-QAM signal.</description></item><item><title>5-GHz Injection-Locked Delay Cell With 10&#8211;25 ns Adjustable Group Delay in SiGe BiCMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10153605</link><description>This brief presents an on-chip delay line (DL) unit with an adjustable group delay (GD) between 10 and 25 ns.

A self-cascode MOSFET (SCM) and a cascode structure are combined as the QSCCM to reduce the variations of bias current  $(I_{\mathrm{ B}})$  through the QSCCM, comparing to conventional ones. Then, the  $I_{\mathrm{ B}}$  is fed into an active load to acquire a more stable reference voltage  $(V_{\mathrm{ REF}})$  against the supply voltage  $(V_{\mathrm{ DD}})$  without using any additional native devices, amplifiers, pre-regulation circuits, and DIBL compensation circuits. The proposed SBCVR with the QSCCM is fabricated in a standard  $0.18 \mu \text{m}$  CMOS process, while 22 chip samples are measured. The results show that the average LS is 0.011%/V when the  $V_{\mathrm{ DD}}$  varies from 0.8 V to 1.8 V. The average PSRR are &#8722;76dB, &#8722;53 dB, and &#8722;59 dB at 10Hz, 1kHz, and 1MHz respectively. Moreover, it can produce a  $V_{\mathrm{ REF}}$  of 293 mV and consume a supply current of 1.95 nA  $(V_{\mathrm{ DD}}=$ 1V) at 27 &#176;C. The average temperature coefficient (TC) is 66.1 ppm/&#176;C without trimming in the temperature range from &#8722;40 &#176;C to 85 &#176;C, while the total area is only 0.004 mm 2.</description></item><item><title>A Mixed-Signal Integrator-Differentiator-TIA</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10261498</link><description>Various implementations of transimpedance amplifiers (TIAs) are used for current sensing applications and they allow for low noise and wide bandwidth (BW).

However, the imager&#8217;s responsivity drifts dramatically with the substrate temperature, resulting in scene dynamic range (DR) degradation. This brief presents a 120&#176;C operating range TEC-less bolometric imager with ultra-low responsivity drift. The proposed imager&#8217;s low responsivity temperature coefficient is obtained by summing the positive and negative temperature coefficients. In the readout circuit, a poly resistor and a bolometer resistor are used in series as the feedback resistor of the pre-amplifier to accomplish the above summing. The proposed readout circuit is a low-cost improvement and hardly increases the complexity. A  $12~\mu \text{m}$  pixel pitch  $640\times 512$  resolution vanadium oxide (VOx) bolometric imager is implemented for verification. Measurement results show that the responsivity drift is less than 20% within the 120&#176;C temperature range, while the drift is higher than 90% without compensation. The proposed imager&#8217;s measurement noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD) is 45 mK, demonstrating good NETD performance.

The attenuator adopts several cascaded switchable attenuation cells, in topologies of  $\Pi $ -type, T-type, reduced-T type, bridged-T type, and capacitor-bridging  $\Pi $ -type. To compensate the phase error during state switching, the  $\Pi $ -type attenuation cell is modified to capacitor-bridging  $\Pi $ -type with phase-lead compensation effects, by introducing a compensation capacitor bridging the two resistive branches. The modified cell reduces the phase error/imbalance up to 0.92&#176;, with negligible amplitude error induced. The 5-bit passive attenuator is designed and fabricated in a 55nm CMOS.

In this scenario, the receiver of a video, e.g., a battery-driven portable device, can send a dedicated request to the sender which asks for a video bitstream representation that is less complex to decode and process. Consequently, the receiver saves energy and extends operating times. We provide an overview on latest studies from the literature dealing with energy-saving aspects, which motivate the extension of the legacy Green Metadata standard. Furthermore, we explain the newly introduced syntax elements and verify their effectiveness by performing dedicated experiments. We show that the integration of these syntax elements can lead to dynamic energy savings of up to 90% for software video decoding and 80% for hardware video decoding, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Reinforcement Learning-Based Robust Tracking Control for Unknown Markov Jump Systems and its Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10290993</link><description>This brief presents a novel reinforcement learning-based robust tracking control method for discrete-time unknown Markov jump systems.

Uniformly sampled digital ACMC techniques either use dual-edge modulation or leading-edge modulation for sampling the average inductor current. However, they cannot be configured for trailing-edge modulation. This brief proposes a sampling mechanism to implement digital ACMC in a boost converter under trailing-edge modulation. The proposed sampling mechanism is simple and cost-effective as it does not need any additional sensing circuits or fast analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Furthermore, the proposed mechanism is insensitive to system&#8217;s parasitics and parameter variations. The mechanism can be easily configured for leading-edge modulation. Discrete-time modeling technique is considered for small-signal modeling and controller design. The proposed sampling mechanism is implemented on an FPGA platform to control an in-house boost converter prototype. The proposed technique can be easily extended for other digital average current mode controlled converters.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Reliability-Enhanced Dual Over-Temperature Protection Circuit With Delayed Thermal Restart for Power ICs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10273623</link><description>This brief presents a novel over-temperature protection (OTP) technique with absolute OTP, dynamic OTP, and the thermal-restart function. Absolute OTP operates when the temperature of the power MOSFET reaches the junction temperature to avoid device breakdown. Dynamic OTP monitors the uneven thermal distribution on the chip. When the temperature difference between the power MOSFET and the controller is large, dynamic OTP is triggered to prevent the performance and lifetime degradation of devices. The chip restarts automatically after the temperature drops below the thermal hysteresis to reduce lifetime loss. Additionally, measurement results demonstrate that the current limitation situation results in the shutdown and the restart of the OTP. The overtemperature threshold and hysteresis of absolute OTP are 175&#176;C and 15&#176;C, dynamic OTP occurs when the temperature difference reaches 76&#176;C, and the restart delayed time is 14.4 ms. The proposed dual over-temperature protection circuit with a thermal-restart function can avoid the damage caused by uneven thermal distributions on the chip, and further improve the reliability of the chip.</description></item><item><title>A Five-Level X-Type Boosting Inverter With Reduced Stored Energy of Switched-Capacitors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287566</link><description>This brief proposes a novel five-level (5L) common ground type (CGT) inverter based on switched capacitors (SCs) with dual voltage boosting ability.

In the proposed topology, the SCs are rated for half of the peak output voltage, resulting in a lower voltage diversity factor and reduced energy storage requirement. Further, in case of any capacitor failures, the proposed inverter can sustain operation with reduced voltage levels. In addition, the proposed topology features SC self-voltage balancing, low dv/dt, and sensorless operation. The circuit description and operating principle of the proposed inverter are detailed. A comparative assessment of the state-of-the-art CGT topologies with the proposed inverter is presented to emphasize the distinctive features of the proposed inverter.

However, the non-convexity of the generalized correntropic loss (GC-Loss) function causes the APGMCC algorithm suffers from high steady-state misalignment. In this brief, a new robust adaptive filtering algorithm called affine projection kernel risk-sensitive mean  ${p}$ -power error loss (APKRSMPL) is proposed, which is deduced by minimizing the sum of the KRSMPL functions of the a posteriori error vector elements under a bounded energy constraint on the filter weights fluctuation. Since no matrix inversion is required, the proposed APKRSMPL algorithm is computationally efficient. In addition, the convexity of the KRSMPL function ensures faster convergence and lower steady-state misalignment of the APKRSMPL algorithm. Then, the mean-square stability as well as the steady-state excess mean square error (EMSE) of the APKRSMPL algorithm are analyzed and an approximate steady-state EMSE solution is derived. Finally, system identification and acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) computer simulations verify the accuracy of the steady-state EMSE solution and the effectiveness of the proposed APKRSMPL algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Augmented Complex Generalized Modified Blake&#8211;Zisserman Algorithm for Adaptive Frequency Estimation of Power System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10288595</link><description>To enhance the robustness and reduce the steady-state error under impulsive noise environment, this brief proposes an augmented complex generalized modified Blake-Zisserman (ACGMBZ) algorithm to estimate the fundamental frequency of three-phase power system adaptively.

These routers require significant memory resources and consume a large part of the overall system&#8217;s energy budget. A promising alternative approach to using standard CMOS and SRAM-based routers is to exploit the features of memristive crossbar arrays and use them as programmable switch-matrices that route spikes. However, the scaling of these crossbar arrays presents physical challenges, such as &#8220;IR drop&#8221; on the metal lines due to the parasitic resistance, and leakage current accumulation on multiple active memristors in their &#8220;off&#8221; state. While reliability challenges of this type have been extensively studied in synchronous systems for compute-in-memory matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) accelerators and storage class memory, little effort has been devoted so far to characterizing the scaling limits of memristor-based crossbar routers. Here, we study the challenges of memristive crossbar arrays, when used as routing channels to transmit spikes in asynchronous Spiking Neural Network (SNN) hardware. We validate our analytical findings with experimental results obtained from a 4K-ReRAM chip which demonstrates its functionality as a routing crossbar. We determine the functionality bounds on the routing due to the IR drop and leak problem, based on theoretical modeling, circuit simulations for a 22nm FDSOI technology, and experimental measurements. This brief highlights the limitations of this approach and provides useful guidelines for engineering the memristor device properties in memristive crossbar routers for multi-core asynchronous neuromorphic systems.</description></item><item><title>A TDC With Integrated Snapshot Circuit and Calibration in 28-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10361566</link><description>This brief presents a 135ps dynamic range, 5.45ps effective resolution 2D Vernier time-to-digital converter for use in an all-digital phase-locked-loop.

To efficiently support these tasks, the model pruning technique is developed to compress the computational and memory-intensive DNNs. However, directly executing these sparse models on a common hardware accelerator can cause significant under-utilization, since invalid data resulting from the sparse patterns leads to unnecessary computations and irregular memory accesses.

Conversely, a physical system, which interacts with the surrounding environment, may support emergent phenomena, provided some of its constitutive components are capable to amplify infinitesimal fluctuations in energy under suitable polarization, a property which is referred to as Local Activity. Local Activity is in fact a New Universal Physics Principle, which, grounded on solid theoretical foundations, enables to explain emergent phenomena in any open system, e.g., the emergence of the All-to-None phenomenon in neurons, and Symmetry-Breaking Effects in biological homogeneous cellular media. The existence of solid-state memristor nano-devices, which, similarly as the sodium and potassium ion channels, may operate in the Local Activity domain under opportune bias conditions, opens up new opportunities to synthesise circuits and systems, which, operating according to biological principles, may outperform traditional computing structures in terms of time and energy efficiency.

In this tutorial, we provide a brief overview of AI deployment on edge devices, and describe the process of building and deploying a neural network model on a digital edge device. The primary challenge when deploying an AI model in circuits is to fit the model within the constraints of the limited resources as the restricted memory capacity on IoT circuits and the finite computational power impose constraints on the utilization of deep neural networks on IoT. We address this issue by elucidating methods for optimizing neural network models. Part of the tutorial also covers the deployment of deep neural network on logic circuits, as significantly enhanced computational speed can be attained by transitioning the AI paradigm from neural networks to learning automata algorithms. This shift involves a move from arithmetic-based calculations to logic-based approaches. This transformation facilitates the deployment of AI onto Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The last part of the tutorial covers the emerging topic of in-memory computation of the multiply-accumulate operation. Transferring computations to analog memories has the potential to improve speed and energy efficiency compared to digital architectures, potentially achieving improvements of several orders of magnitude.

As reported in the recent literature, approximate computing systems are prone to stealthy attacks that exploit approximation mechanisms to disguise malicious behaviors in normal operations. The analysis performed in this work indicates that the primary outputs of applications with approximate components are not the best location to detect the presence of attacks. This work proposes an intermediate node evaluation-based attack detection (INEAD) method to distinguish whether the cause of inaccuracy in applications is due to approximation or attacks. The attack detection rate of the proposed method was examined in two applications: 1) an approximate fast Fourier transform (FFT) and 2) an artificial neural network (ANN) using approximate arithmetic modules. The case study of an approximate FFT shows that the INEAD method improves the attack detection rate by 61.6% and reduces the false positive rate by up to 91% over the existing work that detects attacks at the primary output stage. The case study of an approximate ANN shows that the INEAD method outperforms the baseline by 93.6% in terms of attack detection rate.</description></item><item><title>Moving Target Defense Through Approximation for Low-Power Neuromorphic Edge Intelligence</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10296033</link><description>Neuromorphic intelligence is driven by spiking neural networks (SNNs) to achieve high algorithmic performance. However, similar to artificial neural networks (ANNs), SNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Such attacks often succeed in misclassification by repeatedly probing a fixed target model. Recent works claim that repeated attacks can be defended in ANNs by employing a moving target defense (MTD). Nonetheless, the state-of-the-art defense mechanisms in SNNs do not consider the notion of moving targets and are limited to shallow network architectures. To this end, we propose a novel MTD strategy for neuromorphic edge intelligence (MTSpike) that incorporates approximate knowledge distillation based on the distinct inherent structural parameters, i.e., firing threshold and time steps in SNNs, under a pretrain and finetune paradigm. Indeed, it is a 2-in-1 approach that enhances robustness against repeated attacks and reduces energy consumption for deeper SNNs. We evaluate our proposed MTSpike with four benchmark image classification datasets, i.e., ImageNet, CIFAR10, DVS128 Gesture, and CIFAR10-dynamic vision sensor datasets against white-box, black-box, and gray-box fast gradient sign method, projected gradient descent, sparse and efficiency attacks on deep residual SNNs. Our results demonstrate that MTSpike outperforms the state-of-the-art defense techniques by enabling SNNs to operate with a negligible drop in classification accuracy (as low as 1%&#8211;2%) under adversarial attacks. Also, MTSpike achieves  $1.3\times $  higher energy efficiency under efficiency attack. Apart from defense, MTSpike provides an additional advantage of energy efficiency by reducing the spike rate by  $3\times $  in deeper SNNs.</description></item><item><title>TDPP: 2-D Permutation-Based Protection of Memristive Deep Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10274004</link><description>The execution of deep neural network (DNN) algorithms suffers from significant bottlenecks due to the separation of the processing and memory units in traditional computer systems. Emerging memristive computing systems introduce an in situ approach that overcomes this bottleneck. The nonvolatility of memristive devices, however, may expose the DNN weights stored in memristive crossbars to potential theft attacks. Therefore, this article proposes a 2-D permutation-based protection (TDPP) method that thwarts such attacks. We first introduce the underlying concept that motivates the TDPP method: permuting both the rows and columns of the DNN weight matrices. This contrasts with previous methods, which focused solely on permuting a single dimension of the weight matrices, either the rows or columns. While it is possible for an adversary to access the matrix values, the original arrangement of rows and columns in the matrices remains concealed. As a result, the extracted DNN model from the accessed matrix values would fail to operate correctly. We consider two different memristive computing systems (designed for layer-by-layer and layer-parallel processing, respectively), and demonstrate the design of the TDPP method that could be embedded into the two systems. Finally, we present a security analysis. Our experiments demonstrate that TDPP can achieve comparable effectiveness to prior approaches, with a high level of security when appropriately parameterized. In addition, TDPP is more scalable than previous methods and results in reduced area and power overheads. The area and power are reduced by, respectively,  $1218\times $  and  $2815\times $  for the layer-by-layer system and by  $178\times $  and  $203\times $  for the layer-parallel system compared to prior works.</description></item><item><title>DELFINES: Detecting Laser Fault Injection Attacks via Digital Sensors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10273624</link><description>Laser Fault Injection Attacks (LFIA) are a major concern in physical security of electronic circuits as they allow an attacker to inject a fault with a very high spatial accuracy. They are also often considered by information technology security evaluation facilities (ITSEFs) to deliver security certification, as Common Criteria, of embedded systems. Time or spatial redundancy can be foreseen as protection methods but they are costly and do not ensure immunity against multiple laser injections. The detection would be efficient if the detecting sensors meet enough density and sensitivity to cover the functional blocks being protected. Most sensors rely on analog and specific technology. In this article, we propose a method to detect LFIAs via a fully digital sensor based on a time to digital converter (TDC) and show its efficacy in detecting such faults in various conditions related to the current induced by the laser, the characteristics of the power grid network (PGN) of the circuit and the environmental variables (voltage, temperature). The simulation results obtained using a 45nm Nangate technology confirms the high efficiency of the proposed scheme in detecting LFIAs in a large range of such conditions.</description></item><item><title>HPPI: A High-Performance Photonic Interconnect Design for Chiplet-Based DNN Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10302299</link><description>In pursuit of higher inference accuracy, the complexity and parameter size of recent deep neural networks (DNNs) have increased significantly. Due to the increasing demand for computing power, the chiplet-based accelerator has been an important computing platform that can handle these DNN models more efficiently. In widely used DNN models, the feature sizes and the number of channels vary greatly among different convolutional layers. Existing chiplet-based accelerators typically adopt consistent optimization strategy for all of the convolutional layers regardless of their sizes, which would limit the inference performance. In this work, we carry out communication-aware customized optimization for convolutional layers with different sizes. First, we propose a reconfigurable high-performance photonic interconnect (HPPI) architecture to facilitate the communication in chiplet-based DNN accelerators. Second, we propose a customized dataflow as the mapping framework and provide four communication patterns of the photonic interconnect with different ways of spatial mapping. Third, we propose a lightweight back propagation neural network to efficiently select the optimal communication pattern for each convolutional layer. The proposed photonic interconnect can be switched between the four communication patterns to enable communication-aware customized optimization for each convolutional layer in the DNN model. As compared to Simba (a representative chiplet-based accelerator with electronic interconnect), HPPI reduces the execution time by 72.23% on average, while saving the energy consumption by 25.49% on average. As compared to ASCEND (a state-of-the-art chiplet-based accelerator with photonic interconnect), HPPI reduces the execution time by 34.04% on average, while saving the energy consumption by 10.34% on average.</description></item><item><title>SparseACC: A Generalized Linear Model Accelerator for Sparse Datasets</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10283967</link><description>Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is widely used for training generalized linear models (GLMs), such as support vector machine and logistic regression, on large industry datasets. Such a training consumes plenty of computing power and therefore plenty of accelerators are proposed to accelerate the GLM training. However, real-world datasets are always highly sparse. For example, YouTube&#8217;s social network connectivity contains only 2.31% nonzero elements (NZs). It is not trivial to design an accelerator that is able to efficiently train on a sparse dataset that is stored in a compressed sparse format (e.g., compressed sparse row (CSR) format). The design of such an accelerator faces three challenges: 1) bank conflicts, which may happen when multiple processing engines in the accelerator access multiple memory banks; 2) complex interconnections, which are necessary to allow all processing engines to access any memory bank; and 3) high-synchronization overhead, since each sample in sparse dataset has a different number of NZs and these elements have different distributions, thus it is hard to overlap gradient computation and model update of neighboring batches. To this end, we propose SparseACC, a sparsity-aware accelerator for training generalized linear models (GLMs). SparseACC is based on two key mechanisms. First, a software/hardware co-design approach solves the first two design challenges by proposing a novel bank-conflict-free (BCF) and bank-balanced CSR format. Second, a weight-aware ping-pong model solves the third challenge, thus maximizing the utilization of the processing engines. SparseACC leverages these two mechanisms to orchestrate training over sparse datasets, such that the training time decreases linearly with the sparsity of the dataset. We prototype SparseACC on a Xilinx Alveo U280 FPGA (Xilinx, 2020). The experimental evaluation shows that SparseACC converges up to  $3.5\times $ ,  $18\times $ ,  $38\times $ , and  $110\times $  faster than the state-of-the-art counterparts on a sparse accelerator, a Tesla V100 GPU, an Intel i9-10900k CPU, and a dense accelerator, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Mortar-FP8: Morphing the Existing FP32 Infrastructure for High-Performance Deep Learning Acceleration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10309853</link><description>Vanilla deep neural networks (DNNs) after training are represented with native floating-point 32 (fp32) weights. We observe that the bit-level sparsity of these weights is very abundant in the mantissa and the distribution of exponent is aggregated, which can all be directly exploited to speed up model inference. In this article, we propose Mortar and Mortar-FP8, the offline/online software and hardware collaborative approaches for fp32 DNN acceleration. The proposed methods include the software algorithms to morph the mantissa and convert fp32 weights to fp8 format, as well as associated hardware accelerator architecture to accelerate general-purpose deep learning through optimized algorithm and specialized hardware. We highlight the following results by evaluating various deep learning tasks, including image classification, object detection, video understanding, video, and image super-resolution: 1) Mortar increase mantissa sparsity up to  $1.58\times -.09\times $  with only a negligible ~0.2% accuracy loss; 2) Mortar-FP8 morph the fp32 weights to fp8 format with a minimal accuracy loss of ~0.3%; and 3) the corresponding hardware accelerator significantly outperforms baselines, achieving up to  $6.032\times $  and  $6.99\times $  performance improvements. The area and power of Mortar are 0.031 mm2 and 68.58 mW. Those metrics are 0.0505 mm2 and 25.16 mW for Mortar-FP8.</description></item><item><title>Theoretical and Experimental Analysis of a CSWPL Behavioral Model for Microwave GaN Transistors Including DC Bias Voltages</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10293152</link><description>In this article, a novel frequency-domain behavioral modeling approach for gallium-nitride (GaN) devices is presented. The proposed technique is based on using the canonical section-wise piecewise linear (CSWPL) model framework to interpolate the dc input and output bias voltages by a 2-D polynomial function. The basic theory associated with the developed model is described in detail and experimentally verified. The model is implemented in a commercial software and, then, validated through both dc and radio frequency (RF) tests with measured load-pull data from 6-W GaN devices. The achieved results demonstrate an excellent prediction capability, thereby proving the accuracy of the developed modeling methodology. Compared with the standard CSWPL model, the proposed model is able to predict the transistor behavior at different bias voltages with one single set of parameters, which greatly reduces the model complexity as well as the required extraction time. Compared with existing bias included models, the proposed solution shows accurate predictions over a wide range of input power levels and bias conditions, simultaneously. Additionally, the proposed model is utilized for a broadband power amplifier (PA) design for a further validation. The measurements carried out on the realized PA are compared with the simulations based on the proposed model. The comparison is performed at four different bias conditions. The agreement between measurements and simulations confirms the extracted model&#8217;s validity.</description></item></channel></rss>
