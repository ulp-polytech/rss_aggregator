This article identifies the source of error in current analytical models and proposes analytical double-2D models based on the no-shape-approximation (NSA) concept, aiming at accurately predicting the leakage inductance and frequency-dependent resistance for medium-frequency transformers (MFTs) with round litz-wire windings. Without changing the outermost shape of the litz wire, the NSA models can capture the fringing effects not only at the top and bottom of the windings, but also in the irregular inter-turn regions between adjacent litz conductors. This article derives analytical solutions for the magnetic vector potential of a round conductor. On this basis, equations describing the contributions of magnetic vector potential, magnetic energy, and magnetic field between two conductors are solved, yielding clear analytical expressions. Considering the rotationally asymmetric transformer structure, the magnetic energy and winding loss, both inside and outside the magnetic core window, are independently calculated using the method of images and the superposition principle. The models are validated through experimental measurements of transformer prototypes with different geometry parameters. Owing to their accuracy, flexibility, and computational efficiency, the proposed double-2D NSA models are suitable for the optimization design of litz-wire MFTs.</description></item><item><title>Core Loss Model for Nonsinusoidal Excitations Based on Vector Magnetic Circuit Theory</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11079285</link><description>With the development of switching devices toward high frequency, the prediction and calculation of magnetic material losses under high frequency have become increasingly important. Moreover, in modern power electronics, the real excitations across magnetic materials are usually nonsinusoidal. Thus, an analytical magnetic core loss calculation model is proposed based on the vector magnetic circuit theory to calculate the magnetic core loss under nonsinusoidal waveform excitation at high frequencies in this article. By Fourier decomposition, the numerical mapping relationship between magductance and hysteretance under sinusoidal excitations is established. Based on the mechanism of hysteresis loss and eddy current loss, the losses under nonsinusoidal excitations can be directly calculated only based on the parameter values of magductance and hysteretance under sinusoidal excitation. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified by comparing the predicted and measured data of three different magnetic cores 3E6, N30, and N87.</description></item><item><title>High Efficiency Quasi-Single-Stage DAB-DC/AC Converter With Wide Input Voltage Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11066281</link><description>The single-stage dual active bridge (DAB) dc/ac converter is unable to maintain its input and output voltages matched to the transformer ratio over the ac cycle. This results in the limited soft-switching range and high current stress. A quasi-single-stage DAB-dc/ac converter consisting of the four-switch buck&#8211;boost converter and the DAB-dc/ac converter is proposed in this article. For the proposed converter, the input voltage of the DAB stage is controlled by the dc/dc stage, which ensures the matching of the input and output voltages of the DAB stage with the transformer ratio. As a result, the current stress of the DAB stage is reduced, and its soft-switching range is extended, thus improving efficiency across a wide input voltage range. In this article, the principle of operation, current stress, and soft-switching range of the proposed converter are analyzed in detail. Moreover, a 500 W experimental prototype is built to verify the theoretical analysis.</description></item><item><title>General Instantaneous Dynamic Phasor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11073071</link><description>Dynamic phasor has now been widely used in the fields of ac power and signal, such as power electronics, power systems engineering, and instrumentation. It is, however, broadly misunderstood by users that the dynamic phasor is valid for an averaged period of time. This misbelief stems from the definition of Fourier series coefficients for a variable where the time sliding integration is taken over a period to get its average. In this article, it is verified that the dynamic phasor is valid instantaneously for any time and that averaging over a period has nothing to do with the dynamics of phasor variables. An extended phasor transformation is newly proposed as a generalized instantaneous dynamic phasor. This instantly valid dynamic phasor is thoroughly verified by mathematics, simulation, and experiments. The instantaneous dynamic phasor is found to be valid for an arbitrary and even time-varying frequency, which is not necessarily the same as the source frequency. The transfer function of the phasor space system is found to be a frequency shift form of the original one of the real space system for the fixed frequency dynamic phasor.</description></item><item><title>Stress Management of Wind Turbine Components Using a Nano-Enhanced Phase Change Material Integrated Power Module</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11053182</link><description>Offshore wind turbine components endure high mechanical and thermal stress due to fluctuating wind conditions and harsh marine environments, but lack coordinated stress management due to the low thermal inertia of the power electronic system. Frequent and large pitch movements further aggravate component stress. This article introduces a power module packaging method that integrates nano-enhanced phase change materials (PCMs) to provide short-term overload capability. By mixing PCMs with carbon nanotubes, the thermal resistance per insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) of the nano-enhanced PCM module is reduced by 34% and 14% compared to the conventional module and PCM module respectively due to the increased thermal conductivity of PCMs. Finite element analysis and experimental results demonstrate the superior thermal performance of the nano-enhanced PCM module over traditional modules. Based on this improved functionality, a stress management strategy is proposed to mitigate mechanical stress on the pitch system by increasing the rated wind speed and temporarily overloading the turbine powertrain system. Statistical analysis based on real wind speed profiles validates the strategy&#8217;s effectiveness, showing a reduction in the number of pitch angle cycles by up to 86% .</description></item><item><title>A Lifetime Prediction Method for SiC MOSFET Under Low Air Pressure Environment Considering Variation of Convective Heat Transfer Coefficient</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11059977</link><description>In low air pressure environments (LAPE), the reduced cooling capacity of air shortens the silicon carbide metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (SiC mosfet&#8217;s) lifetime. Quantifying the shortened lifetime of SiC mosfet under LAPE effectively is challenging due to the lack of targeted lifetime prediction methods. This article proposes a novel lifetime prediction method that considers thermal transfer characteristics of the SiC mosfet relying on natural convection for cooling under LAPE. The junction temperature of devices under LAPE can be calculated by deriving the functional relationship between air pressure (Pa) and convection heat transfer coefficient of heat sink and air. Then, a relationship between solder layer fatigue degradation and failure criteria is established to enable lifetime prediction of the SiC mosfets. The power cycling experiment demonstrates that the lifetime of SiC mosfets at 700 hPa is 4700 cycles shorter compared to that at 1013.25 hPa. Under both Pa conditions, the prediction errors of the proposed approach remain within 360 cycles. Lifetime performance of devices under real operating conditions is further analyzed to shed light on the assessment of device lifetime under LAPE. The proposed method provides a convenient and effective analytical tool for lifetime design and assessment of SiC mosfet under LAPE.</description></item><item><title>Mitigation of Oscillations in Switching Frequency-Based Active Thermal Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11075593</link><description>Power electronics modules are highly susceptible to thermal cycling stress during operation, which can significantly reduce their lifespan. Active thermal control (ATC) techniques are deployed to mitigate this stress and enhance module longevity. Among the various ATC strategies, switching frequency-based active thermal control (SF-ATC) is the simplest and most commonly used to suppress the junction temperature variation, reducing the accumulated damage. However, this method can lead to oscillations and instability in the switching frequency, which can negatively impact both the power converter operation and the ATC performance. While solutions to mitigate oscillations have been proposed, the issue of instability has not been adequately addressed in the literature. This study presents a comprehensive analytical and Simulink-based simulation and investigation of the switching frequency instability in SF-ATC. Furthermore, a modification of the classic SF-ATC is proposed to mitigate oscillations and instability. The proposed SF-ATC aims to enhance the overall ATC performance in terms of thermal swing reduction and limit the impact on the converter operation (e.g., power quality). The effectiveness of the proposed method is then experimentally validated.</description></item><item><title>Small-Sample Prediction Validation Testing: Uncertainty-Aware Design and Robust Maintenance Strategy for Power Electronic Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11075616</link><description>Reliable degradation prediction is paramount for ensuring operational stability and minimizing failure risks in power electronic converters (PECs). Effective maintenance strategies, and thus system longevity and safety, depend on the accuracy of these predictions. However, verifying prediction accuracy with limited data and test durations presents a persistent challenge. This article introduces a test design methodology for degradation prediction verification in PECs, coupled with a preventive maintenance strategy that explicitly incorporates prediction uncertainties. Our approach provides a systematic means of determining the minimum test duration and a principled basis for selecting small sample sizes, enabling the derivation of robust maintenance plans that account for all potential prediction error scenarios. The methodology is validated through a case study of a three-phase inverter, demonstrating its efficacy with sample sizes of fewer than ten. The results highlight the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed methodology in assessing degradation prediction accuracy and, critically, illustrate the superior performance of the uncertainty-aware maintenance strategy in mitigating the risk of catastrophic failures.</description></item><item><title>D-Axis High-Frequency Impedance Extraction Method for Online Diagnosis of Inter-Turn Short-Circuit Faults in Traction Motors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11082660</link><description>As a critical component of high-speed trains, traction motors are responsible for the conversion of mechanical and electrical energy. However, interturn short circuit (ITSC) faults in stator windings pose a significant challenge to their safe and reliable operation. This article presents an online method for diagnosing ITSC faults in traction induction motors by injecting a high-frequency voltage signal into the d-axis and analyzing the extracted high-frequency impedance of the d-axis. First, an ITSC model for induction motors is established, and the impedance characteristics of faulty traction motors are analyzed using a finite element (FE) method. Second, the d-axis impedance model of a motor with ITSC faults is developed under high-frequency square-wave voltage injection, providing an in-depth perspective on the impact of ITSC faults on the motor&#8217;s high-frequency impedance. In addition, the influence of control delays on impedance extraction and quantization error from the analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion are analyzed. Finally, the Goertzel algorithm is utilized to extract the high-frequency current response of the d-axis from the high-frequency square wave voltage after injection, allowing the calculation of the high-frequency impedance of the motor on the d-axis. The fault diagnosis is then implemented on the basis of the average modulus of high-frequency d-axis impedance. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of this diagnostic method. The proposed method accurately diagnoses ITSC faults online at low speeds or standstill by injecting low-amplitude high-frequency voltage, with minimal impact on motor operation.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Current Stress Optimization Strategy for Three-Level Dual Active Bridge Adapted to Wide Voltage Ranges</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029617</link><description>Compared to the conventional dual-active-bridge (DAB) converter, three-level DAB (TL-DAB) can reduce the voltage stress on the devices and improve the operating performance. However, as the voltage level of the converter increases, the complexity of power modeling increases. In addition, the effect of the conventional current stress optimization (CSO) strategies for TL-DAB is limited over wide voltage ranges. Thus, this article first proposes a direct equivalent modeling method, which equates the power models of multilevel DAB to the combination of several simple single-phase-shift modulations, thereby reducing the complexity of modeling. Based on the obtained model, a hybrid CSO (HCSO) strategy adapted to wide voltage ranges is proposed. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition is utilized to solve the optimization table with three degree-of-freedoms (DOFs) at low voltage ratios. For high voltage ratios, the optimized current stress of the KKT condition and conventional CSO is consistent with that of two-level DAB. Thus, a novel blocking capacitor (BC) modulation is employed to halve the voltage ratio. Then, the current stress is reduced further under light load by utilizing the optimization table of lower voltage ratios. The hybrid modulation of multiple DOFs and BC realized lower current stress and higher efficiency than the conventional CSO strategies across full power and over wide voltage ranges. Finally, the improvement caused by the proposed HCSO was verified by experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Single-Stage Isolated Three-Phase SWISS AC&#8211;DC Converter Based on Dual Active Bridge Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11030864</link><description>This article proposes a single-stage three-phase ac&#8211;dc converter composed of a SWISS converter and two dual active bridge (DAB) converters connected in parallel at the output. The input current relationship between the SWISS and DAB converters is analyzed, and the optimal triple-phase-shift (TPS) control of the DAB converter is introduced to achieve the unity power factor for the entire load power. Under optimal TPS control, zero voltage switching and minimal current stress can be achieved. Based on the optimal working modes of TPS control, the analytical expression is derived to describe the relationship between the phase-shift angle and the input current of the DAB converter. A dual-loop control strategy is proposed to achieve good power quality and output regulation. The ranges of working modes and the control variables under different load power conditions are analyzed, demonstrating the adaptability of this strategy to a wide range of load powers. The design of the series inductor and the calculation of losses are discussed, and the loss distribution under different power conditions is presented. Finally, the proposed control strategy is applied to a 1.6 kW three-phase single-stage DAB-based SWISS converter with 200 V/50 Hz input line voltage and 200 V output voltage. The experimental results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the control strategy.</description></item><item><title>Robust Model Predictive Control of Converter-Based Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11072359</link><description>Converter-based microgrids are modern decentralized energy systems that integrate distributed energy resources, communication networks, and control systems. They manage energy generation, distribution, and utilization to enhance resilience and operational efficiency in modern power networks. Fourth industrial revolution technologies, such as automation, Internet-of-Things, artificial intelligence, and energy storage are integrated to create resilient, efficient, and sustainable energy systems. Model predictive control (MPC) is a promising technique for optimizing microgrid operations by considering system constraints and forecasting disturbances. However, standard MPC implementations struggle with robustness against internal and external uncertainties such as model uncertainties, measurement noise, and cyber threats, making them less effective for real-world microgrid applications. This article provides a comprehensive review of robust MPC techniques designed to enhance the reliability and security of cyber-physical microgrids. The study explores various robust MPC methodologies, including adaptive MPC, observer-based MPC, tube-based MPC, stochastic MPC, and data-driven approaches. The application of these techniques to mitigate uncertainties across different hierarchical levels of microgrid control, in particular, converter and system levels. In addition, this article examines cyber-resilient MPC approaches to mitigate cyber-attacks, including false data injection and denial-of-service attacks. Finally, emerging trends, such as AI-enhanced MPC, digital twin-based testing, and event-driven control, are outlined to support the development of next-generation robust MPC strategies for power converter-based microgrids.</description></item><item><title>Discontinuous Dual-Signal PWM for Neutral-Point Voltage Balancing in Three-Level Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11077469</link><description>Neutral-point voltage (NPV) imbalance presents a significant challenge in three-level converters, especially under conditions of high modulation index (MI) and low power factor (PF). This article proposes a novel discontinuous dual-signal pulsewidth modulation (DDSPWM), which can effectively balance the NPV at high MI and the full range of PF. It is implemented by injecting a simple zero-sequence signal into a carrier-based dual-signal PWM. In each switching cycle, the maximum phase is clamped to the P level to increase the NPV, or the minimum phase is clamped to the N level to decrease it, depending on the direction of the zero-sequence injection. The NPV is pushed toward the balanced potential in each switching cycle by this hysteresis control. It is robust and does not require parameter design. Moreover, the clamping mechanism also reduces switching losses, as switching actions in the maximum or minimum phase are saved. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. DDSPWM exhibits consistently lower switching losses compared to traditional virtual space vector PWM in all tested conditions. The proposed method is particularly advantageous for high-power applications, such as battery energy storage systems.</description></item><item><title>A Simplified Time-Domain Model-Based Maximum Efficiency Tracking-Aided Synchronous Rectification Strategy for CLLC Chargers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11078152</link><description>Synchronous rectification (SR), achieved by replacing secondary-side diodes with active mosfet channels, is crucial for reducing conduction losses in CLLC converters. Traditional SR methods, however, either entail costly and bulky hardware or rely on complex mathematical models. This article introduces a simplified time-domain model (STDM) that utilizes mathematical principles and detailed operational assumptions to provide initial duty cycles and gate signal phases for SR under various frequencies and load conditions. However, the STDM&#8217;s overall accuracy is compromised by parasitic parameters and parameter tolerance of the resonant tank. Directly employing the STDM-based SR method may lead to hard-switching of mosfets or increased circulating current, reducing system efficiency. To mitigate this issue, a maximum efficiency tracking (MET)-aided SR signal adjustment method is proposed, which further modifies the duty cycle and phase shift to minimize the current passing through the diodes. This STDM-MET-SR approach does not necessitate high-bandwidth sensors or complex control algorithms while offering immunity to parasitic parameters and system parameter variations. Experimental results demonstrate that the STDM-MET generated SR signals contain negligible errors compared to the required SR signals, and the efficiency of the CLLC converter with STDM-MET-SR implemented is significantly improved compared to those of diode rectification. Overall, the proposed STDM-MET-SR approach offers a cost-effective and efficient solution to reduce conduction losses in CLLC converters.</description></item><item><title>Electromagnetic Oscillation Stabilizer for Large-Scale Power Electronics-Dominated Power Systems in LTP Framework - Part I: Functional Derivative-Based Measures of Modal Controllability and Observability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11079271</link><description>Power electronics-dominated power systems (PEPSs) are highly susceptible to electromagnetic oscillations across a broad frequency range, posing significant challenges to system stability and security. Addressing these oscillations necessitates the development of electromagnetic oscillation stabilizers (EOSs). However, the time-periodic nature of PEPSs, characterized by multiple frequency components, complicates the design of effective EOSs. To tackle this complexity, this article proposes stabilization analysis and control theories within the linear time-periodic (LTP) framework. The design of EOSs is approached in two key steps: Determining the optimal installation locations and designing their structures and parameters. These aspects are addressed in a two-part series, with this Part I article focusing on the first step. Leveraging functional derivatives and Hilbert space norms, this article develops measures of modal controllability (MOC) and modal observability (MOO) for LTP systems, providing quantitative extensions to existing qualitative LTP controllability and observability theories. The proposed LTP-based MOC and MOO facilitate the optimal selection of control locations and feedback signals for EOSs. Case studies conducted on a real-world large-scale PEPS demonstrate that the LTP-based MOC and MOO achieve higher analytical accuracy and lower computational complexity compared to their linear time-invariant counterparts, underscoring their suitability for large-scale time-periodic PEPSs.</description></item><item><title>Electromagnetic Oscillation Stabilizer for Large-Scale Power Electronics-Dominated Power Systems in LTP Framework&#8211;Part II: Generalized Periodic Stabilization Control and Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11079300</link><description>The design of electromagnetic oscillation stabilizers (EOSs) involves two critical steps: 1) selecting the installation location, and 2) designing the structures and parameters. The first step has been thoroughly addressed in the Part I paper within the linear time-periodic (LTP) framework, hence this Part II paper focuses on the second step. Specifically, this article first introduces a generalized periodic stabilization control (PSC) scheme, which is fundamentally a periodic output feedback control strategy. Unlike existing PSC theories, the proposed scheme imposes less restrictive solution conditions and exhibits reduced computational complexity, thereby enhancing its applicability to large-scale LTP systems. Building on this foundation, the article develops a new PSC-based EOS, which is fundamentally distinct from virtual impedance (VI)-based EOSs designed within the linear time-invariant framework. The proposed PSC-based EOS is then applied to a real-world, large-scale power electronics-dominated power system (PEPS). Both theoretical analysis and electromagnetic transient simulations conducted in RT-LAB validate that, compared to a well-established VI-based EOS, the proposed PSC-based EOS achieves larger stability margins and superior control performance across multiple operating conditions in time-periodic PEPSs comprising numerous diverse devices.</description></item><item><title>Quasi-Single-Stage Micro-Inverter Based on Discrete Capacitor Resonant DAB and its Control Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11079286</link><description>To satisfy the high-performance power conversion requirements of photovoltaic microinverters, this article proposes a quasi-single-stage discrete capacitor resonant dual active bridge (DAB) converter. The converter introduces a pseudobus and combines the transformer leakage inductance with the discrete capacitors on the DAB secondary side to form a resonant circuit. The resonant operation generates a sinusoidal half-wave at twice grid frequency on the pseudobus and achieved ac output through periodic inversion. On this basis, a modeling method based on single-sided Fourier equivalent transform is proposed, which effectively reduces the modeling complexity of the quasi-single-stage resonant DAB and ensures model accuracy. And, a unified representation of the output currents in three operation modes is derived, which facilitates continuous current regulation under multimode switching. In order to achieve favorable system power control, the performance of the converter under different operating modes are analyzed, and a dual-phase-shift variable frequency modulation strategy with high efficiency and low backflow power is studied. Finally, the proposed converter and its control strategy are validated through experiments.</description></item><item><title>Short-Circuit Analysis of Inverter-Based Distributed Generation and Energy Storage System With Different Control Modes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11080074</link><description>The increasing integration of inverter-based distributed generation (DG) and battery energy storage systems (BESS) in modern power systems is driven by the demand for cleaner and more reliable energy sources. However, the diverse control strategies used in these inverter-based resources present challenges in accurately modeling fault current behavior. These challenges can lead to malfunctions in protection systems and increase the risk of damage to power electronic converters. This paper analyzes the fault current characteristics of inverter-based DG and BESS under balanced, unbalanced, and high-impedance fault conditions. Four control modes are considered: maximum power point tracking, PQ, VQ, and Pf. A fault current estimation method is proposed using the initial and final value theorems to evaluate system response during both transient and steady-state periods. The proposed approach is validated through detailed MATLAB/Simulink simulations and further verified using a power hardware-in-the-loop setup. Results confirm that the method accurately captures the dynamic behavior of inverter-based resources under various fault scenarios, providing insights for improved protection coordination in power electronic-rich networks.</description></item><item><title>Single-Stage Switched-Capacitor Integrated DC Transformer for DC Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11079877</link><description>To avoid the centralized capacitor on the high-voltage side and reduce the power stage, a single-stage switched-capacitor integrated dc transformer (SCIDCT) with wide input voltage range and self-balancing is proposed. The proposed converter includes a boost inductor and N LC series resonant full-bridge modules, where the switched-capacitors are integrated to realize single stage. The switched-capacitors of adjacent modules are not directly connected in series, and the LC resonant tank of each module is located on the secondary side. The voltage gain of each module is a constant, which is only related to the transformer turns ratio. Therefore, the proposed SCIDCT realizes the input voltage sharing and output current sharing autonomously thanks to its DCT feature. Moreover, with the pulse frequency modulation, the maximum magnetic flux density of the high-frequency transformer is fixed under different switching frequencies, simplifying the transformer design. The soft switching of all secondary diodes and most primary switches can be realized with the help of the resonant tank. The operation principles of the proposed SCIDCT are analyzed. A three full-bridge module based SCIDCT prototype was built, and the proposed solution is well verified by the experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Simplified Universal Suppression Method for Transient DC Bias of DAB Converters With Multiple Phase-Shift Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11082644</link><description>To address the limitations that traditional methods apply only to specific modulations or power flow directions, this article proposes a simplified and universal transient dc bias suppression (SU-TDCBS) method. First, a phase-shift decoupling method is employed to simplify the transient dc bias suppression problem under multiple phase-shift (MPS) modulation into an equivalent problem under single phase-shift modulation. Based on this, a universal transient dc bias suppression method is proposed. Its key feature is the introduction of four modulation update strategies to extend the power flow applicability. Additionally, a compensation method for nonideal factors is introduced to enhance engineering applicability. Finally, a 500-W experimental prototype was built. Experimental results demonstrate that under MPS modulation, the SU-TDCBS method achieves complete transient dc bias suppression and seamless power transition across all power flow conditions, without overshoot or transient current spikes, and with a short transient time. These results confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Power Allocation Strategy for Hybrid Energy Storage System Based on Dynamic Virtual Impedance Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11085113</link><description>In order to achieve better power allocation results and more control objectives for the hybrid energy storage system (HESS), this article proposes a power allocation strategy for battery-supercapacitor (SC) HESS based on dynamic virtual impedance network.

In addition, the corresponding virtual impedance parameters can be dynamically adjusted according to different energy source states, realizing the reasonable power allocation of HESS while optimizing the system operation. Finally, an experimental platform is built to validate the proposed control method for the HESS composed of multiple sets of batteries and multiple groups of SCs. The experimental results have proven that power frequency division can be performed between energy sources with different characteristics, and dynamic power distribution can be implemented between branches of energy sources.</description></item><item><title>An Inductive Coupled Three-Port Resonant Converter to Achieve Adaptive Power Flow Adjustment for PV Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11098484</link><description>This article proposes a power converter topology to improve the efficiency for standalone photovoltaic (PV) systems.

However, a challenge issue emerges during load changes, namely, the active power oscillation tends to cause overload and frequency stability deterioration, especially in the parallel VSGs system. Although some studies have tried to address this issue, the effectiveness of conventional methods based on small signal model (model linearization) are influenced by the change of equilibrium point. And the linear method of parallel VSGs system is lack of a stable design framework. As the number of VSGs increases, the order of model will increase rapidly, then the stability of parallel system is difficult to be proven by the root locus or other linear stability criteria. Therefore, in this article, the port-controlled Hamiltonian model is first built, which provides a stable framework for control law designing. Then, this model is employed to investigate the impact of coupling effect between parallel VSGs, which induces the oscillation. Furthermore, to mitigate the active power oscillation and enhance the frequency stability, the coupling effect is regarded as the disturbance, and a control law is proposed to constrain the impact of disturbance based on the L2-disturbance attenuation. Finally, effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated by simulations and experiments.</description></item><item><title>Electrochemistry-Driven Design of Multiwinding CLLC Resonant Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11052874</link><description>The voltage of the lithium-ion batteries is determined by its electrochemistry, which is critical for the optimum design of the connected converter. This, combined with the volume and weight limitations of electric vehicles (EVs), poses a few challenges in terms of increasing the power density and efficiency of the auxiliary power modules (APMs) The APM enables power transfer from the high-voltage traction battery to the low-voltage (LV) loads. Converter efficiency is generally highest at a selected input voltage, while the change in battery voltage is often disregarded when selecting that input voltage. This results in a reduced converter efficiency over the rest of the input voltage range, thereby reducing the potential range of the EV. Therefore, this article proposes a new design approach that considers the electrochemistry of the battery to weight the operation points of the converter and match the input voltage of highest efficiency to the voltage of highest differential capacity of the battery. Hence, the efficiency is better distributed over the entire operating range. Furthermore, a multiwinding CLLC converter with increased peak gain is proposed that distribute the current stress and improve thermal management on the LV side. Experiments verify the new design approach and the proposed converter and an efficiency of 96.6% and power density of 1.36 kW/L including cold plate, microcontroller and protection circuit are achieved.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Performance of Non-Isolated DC&#8211;DC Converter With Single Auxiliary Chopper Circuit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11059804</link><description>This article focuses on a nonisolated dc&#8211;dc converter with main and auxiliary converters intended for railway applications.

To solve this problem, this article proposes a nonisolated dc&#8211;dc converter with a single auxiliary chopper circuit with a focus on control, power/efficiency analysis, and performance. The validity of control and analysis is verified using a downscaled experimental setup under both steady and transient states. Further, comparisons with existing circuits in terms of losses, efficiency, and peak inductor current are carried out to show the superiority of the proposed converter.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Current-Fed Dual-Active-Bridge DC&#8211;DC Converter for Ultra-Wide Output Voltage Range Electric Vehicle Battery Charger</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11058463</link><description>Universal dc fast chargers must accommodate a wide output voltage range to support various electric vehicle (EV) battery voltages. This article introduces a novel current-fed dual-active-bridge (CFDAB) converter for universal EV charging applications. The proposed converter enables single-stage, fixed-frequency power conversion while ensuring zero-voltage switching (ZVS) at turn-on for all the switches. Conventional CFDAB topologies employing phase-shift plus duty-ratio control experience significant variations in the pulsewidth of the transformer winding voltage when operating across a wide range of port voltages, resulting in increased high-frequency-link (HFL) conduction losses and limited soft-switching range. In contrast, the proposed topology decouples the pulsewidth of the transformer winding voltage from the duty ratio, allowing for reduced HFL conduction losses and full-range ZVS-on for all switches. Two modules of the proposed converter connected in input-parallel-output-parallel or input-parallel-output-series configuration enable the system to support a wide range of EV battery voltages. The operation of the proposed converter is analyzed in detail, and a closed-loop control scheme is developed to regulate the converter outputs during transients. A 7.7-kW prototype with a 150&#8211;920 V output voltage range validates the theoretical analyses, achieving 98.16% peak efficiency with $\approx \,5\%$ improvement in light-load efficiency compared to similar designs reported in the literature.</description></item><item><title>A Differentiated Operation Strategy for Main Circuit Ground Faults in Electrical Traction Drive System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11062726</link><description>Main circuit ground fault (MCGF) is a typical system fault in electrical traction drive system. When two or more points MCGF occur, it will cause destructive accidents. To ensure driving safety, the existing operation strategy (OS) is to immediately isolate the faulty bogie and troubleshoot the fault when a single point MCGF (SPGF) occurs. However, there are six classic types of SPGF, and the degree of danger of each type is different. This undifferentiated OS results in the train&#8217;s available power not being fully utilized, which in turn leads to train delays and inefficient operation. Therefore, in this article, a differentiated OS is proposed for SPGF. First, according to the working principle of the main circuit, the direction of the grounding current and impact range for each type of SPGF are analyzed. Then, the differentiated OS is proposed for each type of SPGF. Finally, the hardware in the loop experiment has verified that when two points MCGF occurs, the train can still operate normally after adopting the proposed differentiated OS. The results show that it is possible to repair SPGFs after the train arrives at the station, which will improve operational efficiency and train intelligence level.</description></item><item><title>Wide Voltage Range Reconfigurable DAB Converter Realized by Monolithic Bidirectional GaN/Discrete SiC-FETs, and Planar Transformer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11075610</link><description>The standard dual active bridge (DAB) converter with symmetric full-bridge circuits on both the primary and secondary sides of a galvanic transformer has been widely recognized in automotive systems for its efficient performance within a limited voltage conversion range. However, when used in low-power applications or when a broader voltage conversion range (e.g., 200&#8211;800 V) is required, maintaining zero voltage switching (ZVS) becomes difficult, leading to a reduction in efficiency. This article presents the concept of a reconfigurable DAB (Re-DAB) converter to address this challenge. The proposed topology consists of a T-cell branch and a half-bridge cell in both the primary and secondary sides, which can be reconfigured as a full-bridge, half-bridge or hybrid circuit. By incorporation of SiC&#8211;FETs and a recently developed monolithic bidirectional GaN device in the proposed Re-DAB converter, different configurations are extracted aiming to preserve the ZVS operation with a high overall efficiency for a wide range of input/output voltage regulation. A planar transformer (PT) design using Pareto-Front optimization is also carried out for the galvanic isolation. Working principle of the proposed concept is discussed, while the design guidance of the PT, and the ZVS range analysis are given in details. A 6.6 kW/50 kHz prototype with a 98.2% peak efficiency for 200&#8211;800 V input voltage and 400 V output voltage is fabricated and its detailed experimental results in each of the operation modes are presented.</description></item><item><title>An Optimal DC&#8211;DC Converter for Fuel Cell-Supercap Series-Connected Powertrain in Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11079875</link><description>This article proposes a new optimized dc&#8211;dc converter based on a series-connected power source configuration for Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs), along with a flexible series&#8211;parallel transition control strategy. By utilizing the series-connected configuration, the volume of each power source can be reduced, enabling optimal design of power sources in the FCEV by considering their cost, size, and other characteristics. Additionally, increasing input voltage of the converter reduces conduction current, thereby improving system efficiency. This article provides a detailed analysis of the power flow in the proposed converter under various load conditions and control strategy designed to improve the response characteristics of the converter during transient periods of series-to-parallel or parallel-to-series operation. A 120 kW proposed converter is designed, and the power source volume is compared with that of a conventional configuration to verify the volume reduction achieved by the series-connected structure. In addition, an efficiency analysis of the proposed converter is conducted under different operating modes. To verify the feasibility of the proposed converter and control strategy, a 12 kW prototype is designed and implemented. The operation of each mode is verified, and the series mode operation of the proposed converter through series-parallel transitions is also validated. In series mode operation, the efficiency of the proposed converter is measured at up to 98.4%. Based on the experimental results, the effectiveness of the proposed converter and control strategy is verified.</description></item><item><title>A Quasi-Single-Stage AC-DC Converter Based on Resonant Semi-Dual-Active-Bridge With Decoupled Control and Fixed Switching Frequency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029628</link><description>In this article, a resonant semi-dual-active-bridge (semi-DAB) quasi-single-stage ac&#8211;dc converter is proposed.

However, the conventional ICs with limited ports realize the connection of multiple ac/dc subgrids via the bus configuration, where separate converters are inevitably installed to match different bus voltage levels. Apart from the increased power conversion stages, communication demands among separate converters result in extra investment costs and communication burdens. Given this, this article proposes a dual-ac and dual-dc port IC (DDPIC) to achieve power exchange among multiple ac/dc subgrids in a single-stage power conversion. In the proposed topology, the power conversion efficiency is enhanced, and the communication burden is reduced due to the removal of separate converters. Besides, a port power-decoupled model of the DDPIC is built to simplify its modulation scheme design by considering the DDPIC as four virtual two-level converters. With the decoupled model, a multilayer space vector modulation (SVM) scheme, where each layer of the SVM regulates one virtual two-level converter, is proposed to simultaneously realize the ac voltage forming under unbalanced dc-port voltages and power distribution among subgrids. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed topology and modulation scheme is verified by the experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Voltage Ride-Through Strategy for Grid-Connected Dual Voltage Source Inverter Under Unsymmetrical Fault Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11078803</link><description>Symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults pose significant challenges to the operation of microgrids with integrated renewable energy sources. Unbalanced faults lead to deviations in point of common coupling (PCC) voltage and introduce negative sequence voltage components, driving the system away from its stable operating region. This article proposes a unified voltage ride-through (VRT) scheme for a dual voltage source inverter-fed microgrid system to ride through unsymmetrical voltage sags and swells by regulating the PCC voltage while simultaneously minimizing the negative sequence voltage and oscillations in the injected active power with dual sequence current injection. Moreover, VRT is achieved by maintaining the PCC voltages within the nominal range through an appropriate generation of reference voltage. In addition to voltage regulation, frequency deviations due to power imbalances during fault conditions are also damped by adjusting real power supplied to the system. Thereby, consolidated control of positive and negative sequence voltage, oscillating power components, phase voltage deviations, and frequency variations at the PCC is achieved through the proposed VRT scheme, ensuring power quality and reliable operation within rated current limits. The developed control scheme is validated through simulation and experimental studies on the developed hardware prototype for various voltage scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Universal Resonant Parameter Design Method Based on Multiple Boundary Constraints for Wireless Fast Charging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11015653</link><description>Traditional resonant parameter design methods below MHz applications primarily rely on designer&#8217;s experience and labor-intensive trial-and-error processes, which are not only time-consuming and inefficient but also fail to optimize system performance. This research proposes a universal resonant parameter design method based on multiple boundary constraints (MBCs) guiding engineers to complete the system design efficiently for wireless fast charging. This design method comprehensively considers multiple factors in parameter design and innovatively transforms them into constraint relationships, which are then mapped onto a 2-D plane graph to optimize the selection of self-inductances for the transmitting and receiving coils. Beyond rapidly generating an optimized coil design, this design method can also assist designers in refining unreasonable design specifications, significantly enhancing design efficiency and ensuring design results completely leverage superior system performance. According to experimental results, the coils developed with the MBCs-based method not only enable the WPT system to obtain outstanding steady-state and dynamic performance, but also result in high transfer efficiency. With a coupling coefficient $k$ of 0.183 or 0.151, the maximum transfer efficiency can achieve 94.83% or 93.93% under the power rating of 1 kW as well as 91.25% or 87.87% under the power rating of 288 W (light load condition).</description></item><item><title>Challenges and Comparison in Achieving 6.78 MHz Multi-kW H-Bridge DC&#8211;AC Inverters Using High-Voltage SiC and GaN Switching Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11023065</link><description>This article investigates the challenges of designing 6.78 MHz multi-kilowatt H-bridge inverters with high-voltage silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) devices, while comparing their performance. First, a design methodology for MHz-switching H-bridge inverters is proposed, addressing critical aspects such as switch selection, gate driver supply design, parasitic inductance minimization, zero-voltage switching, and thermal management. Three 1st-generation inverters are then implemented using 650 V wide-bandgap devices: SiC MOSFET (C3M0060065K), GaN field-effect transistor (FET) (TP65H070G4PS), and GaN FET (GS66506T). In multi-MHz and multi-kW testing, the SiC-based inverter reaches a switching limit of 4 MHz at 3.874 kW but suffers from gate driver overpowering and thermal constraints. The TP65H070G4PS GaN inverter achieves the optimal frequency-power balance, delivering 2.026 kW at 6.78 MHz, though it exhibits significant oscillations at low dc voltages (&lt;250 V). Meanwhile, the GS66506T GaN inverter demonstrates superior high-frequency performance but struggles with thermal dissipation, attaining 1.105 kW at 6.78 MHz. To enable reliable 6.78 MHz power conversion, a 2nd-generation design is developed using enhanced SiC (C3M0120100K) and GaN (GS66508T) switches and evaluated in a 6.78-MHz and 2.4-kW isolated dc&#8211;dc converter. These inverters achieve 2.448 kW with 93.63% dc&#8211;dc efficiency for the SiC inverter, while the GaN variant reaches 2.483 kW at 95.17% efficiency. This marks the first practical demonstration of a multi-kW SiC H-bridge inverter operating at 6.78 MHz and highlights the performance tradeoffs between SiC and GaN technologies.</description></item><item><title>Design of a High Misalignment Tolerance and CV Output WPT System Using a Secondary Repeater</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11066244</link><description>This article is dedicated to improving the misalignment tolerance of a wireless power transfer (WPT) system using a secondary repeater. To mitigate the drop of mutual inductance when misalignment occurs, the receiver with a co-axial intermediate coil is deployed. As such, the proposed system contains three tuning ratios which correspond to the transmitting, intermediate, and receiving coils. To facilitate the choice of these parameters, an efficient tuning technique is proposed. With the proposed tuning technique, one can conveniently achieve zero voltage switching, constant voltage output, load power regulation, and suppression of load voltage fluctuation under coil misalignment. A 500-W experimental prototype is built to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the secondary intermediate aided (SIA) system. The experimental results show that within a 80-mm planar misalignment range (53.3% of the primary coil diameter), the output voltage fluctuation of the SIA WPT system is within 3%, and the peak dc&#8211;dc efficiency is 86.87%. In the vertical transfer distance range of 30&#8211;65 mm (70% of the standard transfer distance), the output voltage fluctuation is within 5%, with a peak dc&#8211;dc efficiency of 88.27%.</description></item><item><title>Virtual DC Motor-Based Coordinated Control Strategy for Multi-Receiver Dynamic WPT System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11072026</link><description>Dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) is gaining traction in logistics for its continuous and flexible power delivery. However, multireceiver DWPT systems face significant challenges in ensuring current sharing and maintaining output voltage stability. This article proposes a solution for multireceiver DWPT systems using a virtual dc motor (VDCM)-based coordinated control strategy, effectively addressing these two critical issues. The proposed strategy integrates a droop control mechanism to achieve efficient current sharing among multiple receivers, while a VDCM control loop enhances output voltage stability. In addition, this article theoretically analyzes the system&#8217;s stability and dynamic performance and establishes a simulation model. Experimental results from a 1.2 kW prototype system show that the proposed strategy significantly reduces voltage fluctuation and current deviation, achieving an efficiency of 89.76%, with output current deviation under 5% and bus voltage fluctuation below 1%. This article provides an effective approach to improving the performance and stability of multireceiver DWPT systems in complex operating environments.</description></item><item><title>A Trifoil Quadrature Pad Topology for Electric Vehicle Wireless Charging Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11073086</link><description>Decoupled multicoil pads have been proposed as a solution for both magnetic and power class interoperability challenges, which exist in electric vehicle charging using inductive power transfer.

In this article, a two-time-scale model (TTSM) consisting of fast-time-scale and slow-time-scale state variables, which has high accuracy and efficient calculation, is proposed for the cascaded four-switch buck&#8211;boost IPT (FSBB-IPT) system. The full-mode operation and zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) conditions of the cascaded system are studied based on the TTSM. To overcome the failure of the traditional ZVS modulation strategies of the first-stage converter in the FSBB-IPT system, a hybrid ZVS modulation scheme in the new time scale is developed to reduce the root-mean-square value of the inductor current and improve the efficiency. An FSBB-IPT prototype with a wide input voltage range is built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed modulation scheme.</description></item><item><title>Open Circuit Fault Identification Technique for Switch and Diode in a Reduced Sensor Based Medium Voltage MMC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10922748</link><description>The modular multilevel converter (MMC) is a popular choice for various medium voltage applications. Recently, several works have focussed on reducing the number of sensors and thereby reducing the hardware complexities in an MMC. Although the normal operation of MMC with a reduced sensor scheme showed some decent performance, the detection of a switch or diode fault and its localization with a reduced sensor operation remains challenging. There is very few literature that deal with fault identification in MMC with reduced sensor operation, but they lack either due to complexity in fault identification technique or due to dependency on additional measurement. In this work, for the first time, both switch and diode open circuit faults are identified based on certain measurements such as arm voltages, observed arm current, and switching status. As these measurements are being used for the healthy operation of MMC, additional sensor is avoided for the proposed fault identification technique. The fault identification also avoids a computationally intensive software based approach. Extensive simulation and experimental studies are carried out to identify single and multiple switch and diode faults. It is also verified that there is no false trigger in open circuit submodule fault identification due to step change in output current.</description></item><item><title>Maximizing Output Voltage of Three-Phase Nine-Leg Multilevel STATCOM by Minimum Infinity Norm Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10924438</link><description>Power converters based on classic three-phase three-leg voltage source inverters (VSIs) that provide a multilevel output voltage are an interesting alternative to multilevel converters that suffer from complexity and higher costs. However, the multiple degrees of freedom of these systems pose a challenge to their optimal control. In this article, the minimum infinity norm algorithm is proposed and implemented for triple three-leg VSI static synchronous compensators (STATCOM) connected to a three-phase power grid. It is shown that the method provides optimal utilization of the dc-link voltage and allows to increase the output voltage by 39% compared to the minimum $\boldsymbol{l}_{\mathbf{2}}$ norm method and by 16% compared to the phase-disposition pulse width modulation (PD-PWM) while keeping total harmonic distortion (THD) below 0.5%. In addition, the algorithm has been optimized for real-time systems, resulting in a very fast algorithm with a worst-case complexity of 39 scalar&#8211;scalar multiplications and no division.</description></item><item><title>Harmonic Compensation of a Power-Hardware-in-the-Loop Based Emulator for Induction Machines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10918886</link><description>Power-hardware-in-the-loop (PHIL)-based machine emulator systems use controlled power converters to mimic the behavior of an electric machine. In this article, a PHIL-based machine emulation system is proposed for grid-tied three-phase induction machines (IM). Typically, a switched voltage source inverter (VSI) is employed as an emulator converter in the motor emulation system. However, the VSI introduces various harmonics into the motor emulation system. These harmonics are mainly attributed to dead time, switching components, and control signals. These harmonics deteriorate motor emulation accuracy. Thus, it is important to investigate and compensate for emulator converter harmonics in motor emulation systems. As an important source of these harmonics is dead time, a detailed analysis of the dead time effect on motor emulation will be presented first. Subsequently, a novel artificial neural network (ANN)-based harmonic compensation technique is developed to ensure the mitigation of harmonics in the emulated motor currents. The proposed ANN-based intelligent harmonic compensator leads to the improvement of motor emulation accuracy. Experimental results are obtained from the emulator system and a 5 hp squirrel cage induction motor to validate the proposed emulator with harmonic compensation.</description></item><item><title>A Medium-Voltage 10 MW-Class Modular Magnetic-Coupled Converter (MMCC) With High Power Density for Motor Drive Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10908692</link><description>Conventional medium-voltage (MV) 10 MW-class motor drives based on cascaded H-bridge (CHB) and modular multilevel converter (MMC) are plagued by the serious issue of low power density due to the presence of a heavy line-frequency transformer and bulky dc capacitors. To address this problem, this article proposes a 10 MW-class modular magnetic-coupled converter (MMCC). Its basic module is composed by an input full-bridge and one output full-bridge with the dc-links interconnected by a dc-dc stage. Multiple such modules are connected in series and configured into Y-type to construct medium-voltage ac ports on both the grid side and the motor side. Their internal dc-dc stages are jointly linked through LC tanks and a mutual ac bus. By tuning the resonance frequency of LC tanks to the switching frequency, the impedance of the jointly linked dc&#8211;dc stages becomes negligibly small. This configuration not only allows the dc capacitor voltages in the entire system to be automatically balanced without the need for any auxiliary algorithms or additional hardware, but also enables the spontaneous cancellation of low-frequency fluctuating power among the modules that are assembled in three-phase circuit. As a result, the dc capacitance is reduced by 67% compared with that in the CHB and by 97% compared with that in the MMC. Additionally, the weight of the transformer is decreased by 83% in comparison to that of the CHB. These characteristics lead to 3.8-fold and 2.0-fold enhancements in the system power densities relative to the CHB and MMC respectively. The feasibility of the proposal is verified by 10-kV 16-MVA simulations and 380-V 8-kVA experiments.</description></item><item><title>A Reconfigurable Domino IPT System for 35 kV Transmission Line Insulator Ice Melting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916487</link><description>At present, there is no online ice melting method for transmission line insulators whereas the ice on the insulators can cause icing flashovers, being dangerous to power delivery systems. Thus, a reconfigurable domino inductive power transfer (RD-IPT) system is proposed for 35 kV transmission line insulator ice melting. By using thermal relays, the topology of the system can alter automatically corresponding to the temperature of the insulator disks. To avoid the output power decreasing due to the change of the system topology, a frequency control method is also proposed to track the maximum output power under constant load resistances. A prototype is built to validate the performance of the proposed system. Experiment results show that the system can deliver 62.2 W power at least to the insulator heaters, and make the disk temperature 25&#176;C larger than the ambient temperature. Thus, the proposed method can melt ice effectively.</description></item><item><title>Single-Switch Soft-Switched High Step-Up DC&#8211;DC Converter With Reduced Voltage Stress</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10922745</link><description>A soft-switched nonisolated dc&#8211;dc high step-up converter with a single switch is proposed in this article, which can be applied in photovoltaic systems. To achieve high voltage gain and reduce the components voltage stress, coupled inductors and switched capacitor techniques are integrated. A suitable lossless snubber circuit overcoming the lossless snubber challenges such as high component count and freewheeling conduction loss is employed to alleviate the switching losses along with the diodes reverse recovery problems. The lossless snubber circuit adds only two diodes to the proposed structure which is optimum in terms of component count among the soft-switching circuits. Using only one switch with reduced voltage stress and simple passive lossless snubber has contributed to the converter efficiency improvement and reduced control circuit complexity. Furthermore, the input current of the proposed converter is continuous, which facilitates the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) realization and enhances the converter performance. A complete analysis is provided to verify the converter operation, and a 200 W laboratory prototype with an input voltage range of 20 to 30 V and a fixed output voltage of 200 V, is implemented to verify the theoretical analysis. Also, a comprehensive comparison between the proposed and comparative topologies is described to illustrate the converter superiority.</description></item><item><title>Photovoltaic-Powered High-Performance Common-Ground Switched-Capacitor Inverter With Ultra-Wide Input Voltage Range and Constant RMS Output Voltage and Level Count</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10908087</link><description>This article answers a critical requirement for switched-capacitor multilevel inverters SCMLI used in renewable energy applications: capability to provide the same sinusoidal output waveform regardless of big variations in the voltage provided by the photovoltaics or other green cells. The originality of the proposed inverter comes from its capacity of providing five operation regimes, offering gains from 4 to 12, and keeping constant the number of levels in the output waveform. It allows to efficiently handle an input voltage variation between 30 and 90 V while producing a stable 220 Vrms output. A novel structure is presented, as well as a new control approach allowing a smooth passage from an operation regime to another one for a continuous variation of the input voltage. It is a common-ground (CG) topology and features a permanent nonzero input current, which are other two constraints imposed in renewable energy. The new inverter presents the lowest cost function among the CG-SCMLIs. The prototype was supplied by a string of four solar cells and provided a 220V rms sinusoid at the grid, which was not affected even in the worst case when some solar cells broke down.</description></item><item><title>Novel Shielding Method for Planar Transformers to Suppress Common-Mode EMI Noise and Improve Soft-Switching Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909706</link><description>High-frequency LLC resonant converters are crucial for high power density applications such as data center power supplies and battery chargers due to their soft-switching capability. At these frequencies, planar PCB winding transformers are preferred over wire-wound types because of their size and performance advantages. However, high parasitic capacitances, such as inter- and intra-winding capacitance, can increase common-mode (CM) EMI noise and reduce the zero-voltage switching (ZVS) range. To maintain ZVS, either the dead time must be increased or the magnetizing inductance reduced, both of which raise conduction losses. Shielding can mitigate CM noise, but it also adds to transformer&#8217;s parasitic capacitance. This article presents a novel floating shielding technique (FST) that blocks CM noise while improving the ZVS range. Testing on a 242 kHz, 380V/48V, 250W LLC half-bridge converter shows that the FST reduces CM noise by 22 dB&#181;V, preserves ZVS, and increases efficiency by 0.46% compared to conventional shielding.</description></item><item><title>Nonlinear Real-Time Distributed Optimal Control for Frequency Regulation of Cyber&#8211;Physical Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10906534</link><description>With the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources in power systems, the distributed optimal control (DOC) method has been regarded as an effective way to integrally solve the load frequency control and economic dispatch problem in real time. This article proposes a novel DOC method to deal with the nonlinear characteristics of cyber&#8211;physical power systems including physical constraints and time delay. First, based on the integration of the partial primal&#8211;dual gradient algorithm and active disturbance rejection control method, this article develops an active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) based DOC method to improve frequency control performance. Then, the positive projection operators are introduced into the ADRC-based DOC method to realize the generation saturation constraints and thermal limits of tie-lines. The stability is theoretically proved by the Lyapunov function. Furthermore, a delay-compensated extended state observer is designed and used to rederive the DOC method to deal with both physical constraints and time delay. Finally, numeral results are obtained with a real-time hardware-in-loop experiment platform and analyzed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Modulation-Based Semi Dual Active Half Bridge Converter With Coupled Inductor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10910209</link><description>A semi dual active half bridge (DAHB) converter with coupled inductor is proposed for unidirectional low-power applications. This topology comprises three active switches and a diode, reducing the number of required active switches compared with the conventional DAHB converters. Additionally, a coupled inductor is integrated to provide both isolation and energy transfer, eliminating the need for separate input and leakage inductors as well as the transformer. To optimize performance, a hybrid modulation strategy employing a seamless control law by combining pulse width modulation (PWM) and PWM plus phase shift (PPS) modes is also proposed. PWM mode allows the converter to have low current stress, while PPS mode enhances power transfer capability. The proposed control law ensures a seamless transition between the two modes and decouples control variables to simplify implementation. Furthermore, the converter is capable of achieving zero voltage switching on for active switches and zero current switching off for the diode across the full load range and a wide voltage range. Finally, the experimental prototype confirms the validity and effectiveness of the proposed topology and control strategy.</description></item><item><title>Assistive Grid Power Scheme to Enhance Power Balancing Capacity of Solar Photovoltaic CHB Inverter for Grid-Connected Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916494</link><description>Because of their modular design, cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverters are a good fit for grid-connected photovoltaic systems. Power imbalance occurs in the PV system because of partial shading, aging effect, and damage and dusting of panels, and results in overmodulation of the H-bridge modules. Overmodulation of H-bridge modules increases the distortion in grid current and affects the reliability of the system. Majority of the solutions in literature can handle the power imbalance condition when the required modulation index is not more than $\boldsymbol{4/\pi}$. However, during the heavy power imbalance condition, the required modulation is more than $\boldsymbol{4/\pi}$. The popular existing methods to handle heavy power imbalance affect the PV utilization or the system&#8217;s power factor. So, to nullify the heavy power imbalance effectively in the cascaded H-bridge inverter fed single-stage single-phase grid-connected PV system, a assistive grid power scheme is presented in this article. The proposed method enhances the power balancing capacity of the PV system by taking necessary power from the grid and injecting this power into the cascaded H-bridge inverter. A circuit for the proposed method is developed in this article and its operation is elaborated. Furthermore, experimental studies along with simulation results are used in this article to validate the suggested methodology.</description></item><item><title>Transient Stability Analysis and Improvement of Multiinverter-Based Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10908685</link><description>Although the transient stability of grid has been widely researched, the existing approaches focus more on the transient stability of a single type of grid connected inverter, which are not suitable for the islanded microgrid with multiple types of inverters. Therefore, this article proposes a transient stability analysis and improvement method for a multiinverter-based microgrid (MIMG). First, a large signal synchronization model of MIMG is established, which fully considers the dynamic interactions among various types of inverters, the effects of inverter locations and the time-varying of load power. Then, the concept of the feasible region of current reference of grid-following inverters (GFLs) is proposed. It can ensure that the system has stable equilibrium points (EPs). Second, the attraction domain of EPs (ADEP) is calculated by constructing a new Lyapunov&#8217;s function of MIMG. Based on ADEP, a novel stability index is proposed, which considers inverter&#8217;s dynamics and has clear upper and lower limits to accurately evaluate the system stability. Furthermore, a novel current distribution method of GFLs is proposed, which can maximize the attraction domain&#8217;s radius of EPs and then enhance system transient stability in severe faults.

The smart transformer (ST) is an effective solution to overcome these challenges by employing accurate control of both active and reactive power flows. Generally, the low-voltage (LV) converter of ST is controlled using a voltage-oriented control strategy, often facing issues with integral saturation and difficult parameter adjustment. Meanwhile, the DG converters operate in the current control mode, which leads to reduced system stability and poor synchronization, particularly during transient events and weak grid scenarios. To overcome these issues, this article proposes a novel Andronov&#8211;Hopf oscillator (AHO) circuit-based virtual oscillator (VO) control for the ST LV converter and DG converters in the ST-based converter-dominated LV distribution systems. This approach allows for simultaneous active and reactive power control of AHO-controlled LV DG converters, with the ST LV converter operating as a slack unit. Additionally, two integral control laws are incorporated to counter the remaining steady-state power errors caused by system uncertainties. The proposed control strategy is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink software and experimentally validated through a power-hardware-in-loop (PHIL) test bench.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Robotic Skill Learning Approach for Assembly Task With Dynamical System and Broad Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916491</link><description>This study introduces a strategy for robotic peg-hole assembly designed to efficiently transfer skills from a human instructor to a robot, achieved through a series of demonstrations and training sessions.

However, due to the poor working environment, the sampling of the speed signal is limited. Therefore, based on the velocity control strategy of the sliding mode observer and the mathematical model of the DWIG, the shortcomings of traditional sliding mode velocity control are analyzed in this article. Based on the principle that the two sets of windings of a double-winding motor are tightly coupled and the flux link is connected, the mechanical parameters of the traditional sliding mode observer are replaced by those on the power winding side that can be observed in real time, thus reducing the inaccurate observation caused by complex conditions and realizing the precise control of the sliding mode without velocity. The compatibility and efficiency of starting control and generation control of DWIG are improved, and the smooth transition and stable generation of the DWIG are ensured.</description></item><item><title>A Flexible Compensation Control Strategy for High-Frequency Link Matrix Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916481</link><description>High-frequency link matrix converters (HFLMCs) omit a dc-link capacitor, which can achieve power transmission from dc to ac with only one power converter stage.

Capacitors typically operate under dynamic rather than constant stress levels in industrial applications. Quantifying the degradation under dynamic stress is challenging, as it requires consideration of the potential stress interactions. Although such interactions can profoundly affect degradation paths, they are often overlooked, leading to significant deviations between reliability predictions and engineering practices. This article introduces a cumulative degradation model that considers stress interactions to enhance the accuracy of degradation prediction under dynamic stress. This article not only identifies the existence of path dependence in the degradation of electrolytic capacitor parameters but also, building upon this, presents a method for integrating stress interactions with the existing foundation of degradation modeling under constant stress conditions. A path adjustment factor is introduced to enhance prediction accuracy and provide a detailed methodology for the experimental and data analysis required for its estimation. Experimental evidence confirms the practical applicability and accuracy of the method. Compared to conventional models, the proposed method considerably enhances computational accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Low Carbon Economic Energy Management Method in a Microgrid Based on Enhanced D3QN Algorithm With Mixed Penalty Function</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10839632</link><description>In this paper, an enhanced dueling double deep Q network algorithm with mixed penalty function (EN-D3QN-MPF) for microgrid energy management control is developed.

Small-signal stability is a representative issue. Though, existing frameworks either ignore the uncertainties of renewables, or only focus on the worst case. In this regard, this paper establishes a small-signal stability constrained stochastic-robust optimal power flow (OPF) model, which aims to optimize the expected cost of scheduling results with respect to the probability distributions of uncertainties while ensuring the small-signal stability requirement even in extreme scenarios. However, the synergy of uncertainties and the complicated small-signal stability mechanism significantly increase the solving difficulty. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework to overcome this challenge. First, we solve the stochastic OPF without small-signal stability constraints. For those results that do not meet the stability requirements, we use them as initial points to locate the effective boundary of the OPF feasible region where the robust small-signal stability requirement is satisfied. The effective boundary location is realized in an iterative manner. Then, in the neighborhood of this effective boundary, we construct a linear surrogate expression to represent the original robust small-signal stability constraint with Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and sample weighted support vector machine (swSVM). Finally, we solve the OPF model with the surrogate constraint. Moreover, we further propose a constraint correction strategy to guarantee the stability requirement. Case studies verify that the proposed method can acquire economical operation schemes and meet the robust small-signal stability requirement at the same time.</description></item><item><title>A Self-Supervised Pre-Learning Method for Low Wind Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10839636</link><description>As wind power is becoming a major energy source of power systems, the risk of power shortages due to its intermittent low power output is growing. Accurate forecasting of low wind power is crucial for mitigating these impacts. However, conventional methods struggle with few-sample issues due to the infrequent occurrence of low wind power, limiting accuracy improvements. To address this, a self-supervised pre-learning method is proposed to forecast low wind power occurrence period and output, leveraging the similarities and differences among low output samples to enhance forecasting accuracy. Low wind power output is decomposed into low wind power events (LWPE), which represent the occurrence timeframe, and low wind power processes (LWPP), which represent the power sequences. For LWPE forecasting, a siamese residual shrinkage network based on contrastive learning is introduced. This network pre-learns LWPE features from sample pairs to mitigate the impact of imbalanced sample distribution. For LWPP forecasting, a pattern recognition-based embedded forecasting framework is proposed, embedding typical LWPP fluctuations into the prediction network to improve fit under limited sample conditions. A case study on 3 wind farm clusters shows that this method improves LWPP forecasting accuracy from 84.99%-86.6% to 89.97%, outperforming traditional methods without pre-learning.</description></item><item><title>Estimation of Stability Region for Grid-Forming Inverters Considering Switching Characteristics via Constructing Damping-Reflected Energy Functions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10843855</link><description>Grid-forming (GFM) inverters have been widely used as the interface between renewable energy sources and power grid. During low voltage ride through (LVRT) period, to limit the fault current, GFM inverters will experience the switching of control strategy, which makes the transient stability of GFM inverters exhibit different features from that of synchronous generators (SGs). In this paper, considering the switching characteristics induced by virtual impedance (VI), the framework of predicting the transient stability of GFM inverters during the fault period and after fault clearance is established from the perspective of energy. To reduce the conservativeness of the stability region, a uniform energy function considering the damping dissipation and the dynamics of reactive power control loop is constructed for the transient stability analysis of GFM inverters. Compared with existing approaches, the stability region estimated by the proposed energy function can intuitively show the effect of damping, and effectively reduce the degree of conservatism in transient stability prediction. Finally, simulation and hardware-in-loop experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method in the transient stability prediction of GFM inverters with switching characteristics.</description></item><item><title>A Decentralized Demanded Power Tracking and Voltage Control Method for Wind Farms Based on Data-Driven Sensitivities</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10848501</link><description>Efficient power dispatch in wind farms (WFs) hinges on precise demanded power tracking. This study proposes a decentralized WF power tracking and voltage control method based on data-driven sensitivities (DDSs). This method relies only on local operational variables for model predictive control (MPC), achieving near-global optimal solutions. With a backpropagation algorithm, a new sensitivity calculation method is designed to yield DDSs by computing the gradients of a global mapping model (GMM). The voltage DDSs can be derived simply by calculating the gradient of the voltage GMM and can replace the voltage sensitivities in traditional MPC methods. The power DDSs establishes linear relationships between the power outputs of different wind turbines (WTs), simplifying the WF state-space equations to local prediction models for reducing the quadratic programming dimensions. The three control modes designed based on DDSs enable control without WF line parameters, reduce computational complexity, or combine both effects. The variable spacing constraint linearization method transforms nonlinear constraints into linear ones, addressing the nonlinear coupling between control variables. Testing on a WF with 32 WTs in MATLAB/Simulink demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method comparable to centralized control methods.</description></item><item><title>Approximately Adaptive Distributionally Robust Optimization for Energy and Reserve Dispatch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10849978</link><description>This paper proposes two novel paradigms of approximately adaptive distributionally robust optimization (AADRO) for the energy and reserve dispatch with wind uncertainty. The piecewise linear policy-based AADRO (PLP-AADRO) approximates the adaptive optimization-based recourse decision as piecewise affine adjustment, while the piecewise value function-based AADRO (PVF-AADRO) approximates the quadratic recourse problem as piecewise linear recourse problems. Moreover, an equal probability principle is developed to achieve a high-quality segmentation of the wind power ambiguity set. Consequently, the distributionally robust quadratic cost constraint can be decomposed into decoupled piecewise constraints, allowing the dispatch problem to be formulated as a less-iterative or even non-iterative program. The two-stage AADROs with polyhedron supported uncertainties are first recast precisely as tractable forms with semidefinite constraints, by employing duality theory and S-lemma. Then, the distributionally robust cost constraint in PVF-AADRO is handled by dual vertex generation, and the bilinear terms in both AADROs are addressed by alternating optimization. Numerical simulations verify the efficiency of AADROs in approximating the strict adaptive distributionally robust optimization, and their adaptability in different cases is discussed.</description></item><item><title>Inertia Transmission Control of Full-Power Converter Variable-Speed Pumped Storage System for Grid Frequency Support</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10852016</link><description>Full-power converter variable-speed pumped storage (FPC-VSPS) is a promising technique for flexible power regulation in small-scale distributed hydroelectric power plants. However, conventional vector control limits the synchronous motor of the FPC-VSPS from providing inertia support to the power grid. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces an inertia transmission control for FPC-VSPS based on the concept of DC voltage synchronization. Firstly, the control incorporates the DC capacitor power equation into the GSC control. To enable inertia transmission from the FPC-VSPS synchronous machine, the DC capacitor dynamics are fed into both the speed and torque control of the MSC. Secondly, a torsion spring-rigid body equivalent model is introduced based on the inertia transmission process, analyzing the effects of physical parameters, control coefficients, and transmission delays on the inertia transmission performance. Theoretical analysis and simulation results reveal that the inherent physical differences and transmission delay have a negative impact on the effectiveness of the inertia transmission. Consequently, a DC capacitor design method based on inertia matching is proposed, accounting for the constraints of physical inertia matching, system stability, and operational security. Finally, simulations and experiments prove the necessity of inertia matching and verify the effectiveness of the proposed control to cope with frequency fluctuations in both pumping and generating modes.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Grid-Forming Undersea Pumped Storage to Enable 100% Renewable Offshore Oilfield Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854915</link><description>To advance carbon reduction of the offshore oilfield power system (OOPS), the grid-forming undersea pumped storage system (GFM-UPSS) emerges as a promising solution. This paper introduces a novel framework for a 100% renewable OOPS utilizing the GFM-UPSS. Firstly, the control strategy of the GFM-UPSS is presented. It consists of the grid-side converter (GSC), machine-side converter (MSC), and reversible pump-turbine (RPT) to achieve frequency and voltage regulation. A steady-state model is then developed detailing the water head, power, and volume of the spherical shell. In addition, the paper explores the converter parameter impacts on the GFM-UPSS transient model and derives the closed-form solutions. With the steady-state model, an optimal sizing method is presented and economic advantages in the marine environment are studied for the GFM-UPSS. Finally, EMT simulations are conducted to assess the frequency &amp; voltage stabilities and verify the effectiveness of the GFM-UPSS in enabling a 100% renewable OOPS. The optimal sizing results show that construction costs, mainly for OWP, are dominated and are influenced by sphere radius, placement depth, and start-stop cycles, while a 2.5 capacity ratio between OWP and GFM-UPSS consistently emerges as optimal. Moreover, analysis of transient stability shows that it improves with higher frequency &amp; voltage modulation coefficient and lower virtual impedance. The impact of RPT and MSC, mainly on frequency regulation, is determined by the DC droop coefficient and turbine inertia.</description></item><item><title>A Coordinated Adaptive SMC Method for Frequency Regulation Control in Power Systems With Multiple Wind Farms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10855531</link><description>The extensive integration of renewable energy resources inevitably gives rise to the complex and uncertain power system, where the somber matter of frequency instability becomes apparent. This article presents a coordinated adaptive radial basis function neural network (RBFNN)-based sliding mode control (CAR-SMC) to reduce the frequency deviation and oscillation of the uncertain power system comprising multiple wind farms. Firstly, the SMC is aimed at establishing the upper layer control law of the frequency regulation controllers. Then, the uncertainties are represented with RBFNN, and an adaptive law is employed to estimate the uncertainties online rapidly and realize the free-chattering of SMC. Furthermore, since a single SMC is only capable of handling a single control input system, a power distribution law based on momentum is proposed to implement the multiple control inputs of the AR-SMC, and also coordinate the frequency regulation abilities of wind turbines and energy storage systems (ESSs). Eventually, the proposed CAR-SMC is validated on a modified IEEE 39-bus system. The simulation results demonstrate that CAR-SMC can enhance the frequency stability in the presence of disturbances and uncertainties during steady-state operation, as well as in under-frequency and over-frequency scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Short-Term Spatio-Temporal Wind Speed Prediction Based on OWT-STGradRAM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10869841</link><description>Taking into account the orientation and distance characteristics of wind turbine stations in wind farms can improve the accuracy of wind power prediction.

However, current methods are affected by the intermittent, non-stationary and stochastic nature of solar energy and thus cannot satisfy the requirement of high-precision forecasting. To this end, we propose a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) forecasting method based on bubble entropy and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) regularization, called BesFCM. This method first utilizes bubble entropy to fuse two mode decomposition methods to improve the representation of PV data to capture effective features with significant stability and discriminative ability, then employs a FCM with a combination of fuzzy logic, neural networks, and expert systems to model solar PV power generation, and finally develops a high order FCM learning method based on SCAD regularization to alleviate the overfitting problem, enhancing the robustness and generalization ability of forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate that the BesFCM achieves the best overall performance on PV power datasets from multiple sampling intervals in multiple regions of Belgium compared to multiple state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness for solar power generation forecasting, providing support and reference for improving the quality of smart grid dispatch and reducing spare capacity reserves.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Suppression for Temporary Overvoltage Considering Dynamic Interactions Between LCC-HVDC and Renewable Energy Plants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10874178</link><description>Temporary overvoltage (TOV) severely restricts the development and utilization of renewable power resources (RPRs), especially when RPRs are delivered through the line commutated converter-based high voltage direct current (LCC-HVDC) system. To reveal the TOV mechanism for the sending system during commutation failures (CFs), the transient process of the system is partitioned into different stages, where the evolution of the system trajectories is analyzed. On this basis, the variation of AC voltage and DC current considering complex dynamic interactions between LCC-HVDC and renewable energy Plants (REPs) during repetitive CFs (RCFs) is clearly quantified. After revealing the impact of control parameters of both REPs and the LCC-HVDC on the TOV during RCFs, a collaborative optimization method for control parameters is proposed for TOV suppression. Moreover, when the blocking after the RCF tends to be inevitable, the optimal blocking moment is determined to inhibit the TOV caused by HVDC blocking. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed methods are verified with EMT simulations of a typical benchmark system.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Modeling and Switching Control of Electric Vehicle Aggregation for Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10878811</link><description>The aggregation and control of massive electric vehicles (EVs) are crucial for grid frequency regulation (FR). However, challenges such as disordered charging, high computational and communication burdens need to be addressed. To this end, a hierarchical hybrid modeling and switching control method for EV aggregation (EVA) is proposed. For modeling, a hybrid state set for EVs comprising three discrete states and one dynamic state is established at the local level. The dynamic state's flexibility allows EVs to charge orderly while considering user demands. At the aggregation level, a Markov-based EVA state space model is designed, integrating the user's willingness-to-pay (WTP) index and hybrid state. It estimates the EVA's FR capacity (FRC) with a lower communication burden and reduces computational burden by simplifying control dimensions. For control, a model predictive control (MPC)-based state switching method is designed at the aggregation level, considering user's FR willingness and power cancellation issue. Furthermore, a predictive compensation mechanism is designed to address model parameter errors resulting from asynchronous control cycles. At the local level, a probabilistic response method is proposed for responding to dispatched control signals, which reduces battery degradation through the state of charge (SOC) based response probability generation.

The strategy includes three layers: the system layer, the ESS operation layer, and the coordination control layer. In the system layer, a detailed frequency response model of the multi-area interconnected system is developed. The intrinsic mech-anisms of timing, depth, and the effect of ESS and conventional generating unit (CGU) in SFR are revealed through the sen-sitivity analysis of the power allocation factor. Furthermore, a sensitivity-based adaptive power allocation strategy for ESS and CGU is proposed, which improves the SFR effect while reducing the ESS power and maintaining the state of charge (SOC). In the ESS operation layer, the ESS is divided into two components for integration, employing a monotonic charge-discharge strategy to reduce lifetime degradation caused by frequent charging and discharging, thereby enhancing operational efficiency. In the coordination control layer, considering the power prediction and the ESS operating state, a SOC optimization strategy based on the double-input fuzzy control (DIFC) is proposed. It further dynamically corrects the power allocation factor based on fuzzy rules, optimizing the SOC level to ensure the bidirectional SFR capability of ESS under all conditions. The case studies validate the overall SFR performance of the proposed strategy with different scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Spatiotemporal Graph Contrastive Learning for Wind Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10879260</link><description>Accurate and robust wind power forecasting plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety and stability of the power system. Hybrid spatiotemporal forecasting models based on graph convolutional networks have received widespread attention due to their advantages in spatial feature extraction. However, these methods are susceptible to the quality of the generated graph due to data noise and missing issues, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid deep learning model based on spatiotemporal graph contrastive learning to address the above issues. Specifically, the model's encoder combines an adaptive graph convolutional network with LSTM to capture fine-grained spatiotemporal dependencies. To enhance the robustness of the encoder against data noise, we apply feature-level and topology-level data augmentation techniques to the model's input and design two contrastive learning auxiliary tasks from the temporal and spatial dimensions, respectively. Furthermore, to capture more comprehensive spatial correlations, we construct an adaptive graph by fusing the static graph with a learnable parameter matrix. Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.</description></item><item><title>A Carryover Storage Valuation Framework for Medium-Term Cascaded Hydropower Planning: A Portland General Electric System Study</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884034</link><description>Medium-term planning of cascaded hydropower (CHP) determines appropriate carryover storage levels in reservoirs to optimize the usage of available water resources. This optimization seeks to maximize the hydropower generated in the current period (i.e., immediate benefit) plus the potential hydropower generation in the future period (i.e., future value). Thus, in the medium-term planning, properly quantifying the future value deposited in carryover storage is essential to achieve a balanced trade-off between immediate benefit and future value. To this end, this paper presents a framework to quantify the future value of carryover storage, which consists of three major steps: i) constructing a deterministic model to calculate the maximum possible hydropower generation that a given level of carryover storage can deliver in the future period; ii) extracting the implicit locational marginal water value (LMWV) of carryover storage for each reservoir by applying a partition-then-extract algorithm to the constructed model; and iii) developing a set of analytical rules based on the extracted LMWV to effectively calculate the future value. These rules can be seamlessly integrated into medium-term CHP planning models as tractable mixed-integer linear constraints to quantify the future value properly, and can be easily visualized to offer valuable insights for CHP operators. Finally, numerical results on Portland General Electric's CHP demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented framework in aiding medium-term CHP planning to identify suitable carryover storage strategies.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Hydrogen Production Dispatch of Networked Hydrogen-Based Microgrids via a Distributed Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884064</link><description>Hydrogen has drawn significant attention due to its long-term storage capability and wide industrial applications. How to efficiently utilize renewable energy to maximize hydrogen production of a group of spatially distributed electrolyzers is a fundamental problem urgently needed to be solved. This paper is the first to attempt to address the problem by proposing a hydrogen production dispatch (HPD) model for hydrogen-based microgrids with proton exchange membrane electrolyzers. Considering the limited communication and privacy requirement of distributed energy systems, a distributed hydrogen production dispatch framework is constructed. The original nonconvex optimization problem is transformed into a convex form. Furthermore, it is proven that the marginal hydrogen production benefit of each electrolyzer should be equal for the optimal hydrogen production dispatch via Lagrangian duality. By setting the marginal hydrogen production benefit as a consensus variable, a novel distributed consensus-based dispatch algorithm is developed, in which an event-triggered communication scheme is introduced to alleviate the communication burden. It is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm achieves linear convergence. Results of the case study indicate that the proposed strategy yields the optimal hydrogen production benefit, which is increased by 9.43% compared to on-site hydrogen production and demonstrates excellent solving efficiency especially for large-scale systems.</description></item><item><title>Transient Frequency-Voltage Support Strategy for VSC-MTDC Integrated Offshore Wind Farms Based on Perturbation Observer and Funnel Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884062</link><description>To address the transient frequency and voltage stability challenges posed by low-inertia offshore wind farms (OWFs) connected through voltage source converter (VSC) based multi-terminal high voltage direct current (VSC-MTDC) system, a nonlinear perturbation observer and funnel control-based transient frequency and voltage support (PFTFVS) control strategy is proposed for VSC-MTDC integrated OWFs system.

Typically, the power production from WECs is characterised by pronounced fluctuations at low frequency and high peaks compared to the average. Wave energy test rigs should be able to reproduce these variations to impose realistic conditions to the device under test. Thus, the grid connection of the rig must be sized to cope with high peaks, and additional measures may be required to avoid disturbances on nearby loads and negative effects on voltage quality. The integration of electrical energy storage can smoothen power fluctuations and mitigate these drawbacks, while resulting in lower installation and operating costs. The design methodology indicates how to effectively size the storage unit and which technology to favour based on the type and duration of test campaigns. Numerical simulation results are presented for a dual HIL test rig and operational profiles of three different WEC technologies. For designs with energy storage lifetime shorter than the calendar life, sensitivity analyses indicate that the rig's annual utilisation rate and the level of accelerated testing have a significant effect on the storage energy requirements.</description></item><item><title>Station-Network Cooperative Optimization Planning of Urban Integrated Energy System Considering Heat Storage Capacity of Heat Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891182</link><description>Heat storage capacity of heat network in urban integrated energy system (UIES) has the potential to significantly improve the operational flexibility of the system. To obtain the optimal UIES planning scheme, a UIES station-network cooperative optimization planning (UIES-SNCOP) method considering heat storage capacity is proposed. First, a heat network operation model under constant flow-variable temperature considering flow direction depiction is established for solving the problem that the existing model cannot be directly applied to UIES-SNCOP because the flow direction of pipeline cannot be predetermined. Then, a radial structure-oriented topology model of distribution and heat networks is developed to ensure the radiality of energy supply network while also reducing planning cost. On this basis, a UIES-SNCOP model based on information gap decision theory and stochastic optimization is constructed to realize the co-optimization of the siting and sizing of energy station and topology of distribution and heat networks. Finally, a solution method of UIES-SNCOP model based on relaxation-contraction coupled McCormick envelope is proposed for effectively improving the accuracy of solution result. The planning of UIES is conducted on an urban topology containing 55 nodes to test the performance of the proposed method, and simulation results indicate that the proposed method outperforms other existing methods in terms of reducing planning cost, ensuring radial structure of the energy supply network, utilizing heat storage capacity and enhancing solution accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Two-Stage Adaptive Robust Model for AC Network-Constrained Unit Commitment in Power Systems With Uncertain Wind Power</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891662</link><description>With wind power being extensively integrated into power systems, its inherent uncertainty and variability pose significant challenges to the power system operational security. Traditional robust optimization methods capture the worst-case scenario, which results in overly conservative decisions, with insufficient considerations on AC network constraints in power systems. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a novel adaptive robust AC network-constrained unit commitment (AC-NCUC) model that considers both the AC network security and the uncertainty of wind power output in power systems. More specifically, a convex polyhedral uncertainty set is constructed to characterize the uncertain wind power output. Here, the conservativeness of UC dispatch decisions can be adjusted by modifying the size of the convex polyhedral uncertainty set. Then, we combine Benders&#8217; decomposition and Newton-Raphson methods to solve the AC-NCUC model for the optimal dispatch decisions. Simulation results on the modified IEEE 6-bus and IEEE RTS 79 systems validate the rationality and validity of our proposed approach. The proposed AC-NCUC model effectively maintains the system security while ensuring economic effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Power Control in Wind Farms for Gearbox Load Reduction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891746</link><description>Rapid power and torque fluctuations in time-varying conditions increase the fatigue load and failure rate of wind turbine (WT) gearboxes. In this study, an optimal power control method is proposed for a wind farm (WF) to improve the power flow and service quality, allowing the WF to track the power demand instructions from the transmission system operator while minimizing the fluctuations of vibration displacements inside the gearbox. A comprehensive dynamic model of the gearbox is developed by analyzing the transmission mechanism of key gearbox components, such as the planet carrier, planet gears, sun gears, and spur gears, describing the correlation between the internal vibration and mechanical torque and power output. Then, an optimal power control problem is formulated based on model predictive control to suppress the fatigue load while tracking power. Furthermore, a fatigue evaluation system is built based on the real-time vibration state inside the gearbox to characterize the service quality of WTs and guide the power generation of the WF. This approach provides a safety-oriented boundary regarding the WT fatigue load in the optimal power dispatch issue of WFs to suppress potential WT failures. Case studies in MATLAB/Simulink demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Deterministic Forecasts and Prediction Intervals for Wind Speed Using Enhanced Multi-Quantile Loss Based Dilated Causal Convolutions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891745</link><description>With rising wind power penetration into power systems obtaining wind speed forecasts with associated uncertainty becomes crucial for better planning and dispatch. This study proposes an enhanced multi quantile regression-based loss function specially tailored to train models to generate both deterministic forecast and the corresponding prediction intervals. Though the regression architecture of the model plays an important role in extracting precise forecasts, however, its efficiency is often ignored which may be a downside for short term forecasting scenarios where model training time may also be a significant factor. The present study therefore designed a multi-scale dilated convolution-based architecture for enhanced efficiency. The architecture generates predictions at different scales which are combined using particle swarm optimization to obtain optimal forecasts. The model is trained using the proposed loss function on datasets from both NREL simulations and operational Chinese state grid measurements across three different locations. The proposed model exhibits excellent forecasting performance in comparative experiments with both simulated and real-world operational datasets.</description></item><item><title>Stability Region Estimation and Decentralized Transient Control for Parallel Grid-Tied Grid-Forming Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10892023</link><description>Renewable energyes are highly penetrated in power system through Grid-forming inverter (GFMI). Transient stability of single GFMI system under severe grid fault has been thoroughly analyzed in recent years, but quantitative analysis for parallel grid-tied GFMI system is rarely studied. To fill this gap, the large signal equivalent model of parallel system considering the interaction between inverters is newly built. Based on the model, the Lyapunov function incorporating kinetic energy, potential energy, damping dissipation, and interaction energy is constructed for accurate stability region estimation. Then, the effect of control parameters on stability region is analyzed, indicating that increasing damping, reducing inertia, and lowering reference power of one GFMI can deteriorate stability margin of parallel GFMI system due to the enlarged interaction power, which is distinct from single GFMI system. For this, a decentralized transient control that adaptively adjusts damping, inertia, and reference power is proposed to guarantee transient stability and achieve low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) for parallel system without relying on communication, system information. Finally, simulation and experimental tests validate the correctness of theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of proposed control.</description></item><item><title>Aggregation Feasible Region of Full Power Spectrum Electric Vehicles Based on Polyhedron Projection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10900425</link><description>The aggregation of electric vehicles (EVs) can take full advantage of the power flexibility of EV clusters, based on the aggregation feasible region (AFR) of EVs. However, existing aggregation techniques of conventional distributed energy resources (DERs), exhibit significant inaccuracies or require excessive computational efforts when applied to EVs with high power and small capacity. To solve this problem, an iterative method based on the high dimensional polyhedron projection principle is proposed to derive the exact AFR formula for the full power spectrum of EVs, and the limitations of the existing analytical AFR are revealed. The results reveal that the exact AFR is a set of linear inequalities, whose coefficients can be represented in binary code, and the complexity of the right side is linear with the number of EVs, making it highly conducive to programming calculations. Moreover, this paper proposes a simplified practical AFR based on the exact AFR, which reduces computational complexity. Numerical simulation cases demonstrate that the accuracy of this simplified approach is still higher than that of existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Matrix Adaptive Correction-Based Dynamic Dimensionality Reduction Method for Voltage-Related TSCOPF in Bulk Power Systems With High Wind Power Penetration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10902439</link><description>Transient security-constrained optimal power flow (TSCOPF) is an important class of problems for system operation. Several challenges arise when dealing with bulk power grids, including the large size and complex transient voltage behaviors. This paper aims to address such hurdles by proposing a dynamic dimensionality reduction matrix adaptive correction (DDR-MAC) algorithm, which can effectively evaluate proper Volt/Var levels to guarantee secure system operation. First, this paper performs dimensionality reduction processing at the bus and device levels to obtain a low-dimensional model with dominant modes, which solves the problems of high-order and large computational volumes of differential equations. Moreover, a dimensionality reduction error assessment model is established to ensure reduced-order accuracy. Then, the reduced-order TSCOPF model is equivalently decomposed into a mixed-integer linear optimization model and a combined coefficient correction model for system dynamic constraints and steady-state nonlinear constraints. Furthermore, a secant/tangent sensitivity adaptive correction method is presented to achieve fast computation. The DDR-MAC approach is verified across differently scaled IEEE test systems and the Nordic test system and can improve computational efficiency by 49.07% while offering higher accuracy than traditional computation methods.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Synthetic Inertia Control for Two-Area Power Systems With Wind Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10906542</link><description>Modern power systems may experience decrease in stability due to the increased integration of variable generation sources that depend on power electronics converters. A common control strategy is to incorporate synthetic inertia from wind turbines, typically using state-feedback control in a single-area power system model that assumes uniform frequency. As power systems become more interconnected, different frequency behaviors can emerge in multiple areas, casting doubt on current methods that do not consider multi-area stability. Furthermore, most single-area synthetic inertia methods ignore the limitations of communication systems in real power systems. This paper proposes a decentralized synthetic inertia control strategy for a two-area power system with wind power. This approach accounts for the actual behavior of power systems in different areas and the limitations of communication systems in real scenarios. Numerical results, derived from dynamic models using actual operating data from the Chilean Power System, demonstrate that the decentralized control performs comparably to centralized control in maintaining power system stability and optimizing frequency nadir. However, the decentralized control has the advantage of relying solely on local variables, eliminating the need for communication links between areas during operation.</description></item><item><title>A Unified Strategy for Frequency Regulating and MPPT for Photovoltaic Sources Based on a Novel Three-Parameter Characteristic Curve</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10907967</link><description>The large-scale integration of Photovoltaic (PV) sources may reduce system inertia and power quality, resulting in increased frequency fluctuations and diminished system stability due to lack of the primary frequency regulation (FR) capability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a unified strategy for frequency regulating and Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) for PV sources to provide ancillary services to the power grid. The strategy employs a specifically designed active power control (APC) method to enable rapid and flexible power adjustments of PV sources, with which further FR function may be achieved. The presented APC algorithm adopts an iterative technique with a novel three-parameter PV characteristic curve, making it possible to reconstruct the real-time PV generation model, clarify the relationship between the system frequency, output power, and operating voltage. Its high control accuracy, fast convergence rate, and strong explainability offer significant practical value. Additionally, this adaptive control strategy features autonomous switch between the FR and MPPT modes adapting to real-time irradiation changes, without the need for additional irradiation or temperature sensors. The integration enhances both solar utilization efficiency and the FR capability, while eliminating the controller transitions during operating mode switches. Hardware-in-the-loop tests validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Online Monitoring of Battery Degradation for Enhanced Power Smoothing of PV Power Plants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10908680</link><description>In pursuit of a carbon-neutral future, the integration of photovoltaic (PV) power plants into the electrical power grid is expanding. Although beneficial, this expansion presents challenges due to weather-induced variability, which destabilizes the grid and causes voltage and frequency deviations. A viable solution is the use of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) alongside PV power plants. However, conventional controllers, which lead to uniform and frequent charging cycles, accelerate degradation and reduce efficiency in BESS. To address this, this paper proposes segmenting the BESS units into distinct charging and discharging groups, effectively minimizing battery cycling and enhancing their lifespan. The controller dynamically assigns batteries to each group based on power fluctuation forecasts using a power-sharing model. This model manages battery activation, enables inter-group support, and balances degradation by monitoring BESS charge levels and assessing battery health through an online system. This controller, coupled with a degradation balancing layer, strategically prioritizes units based on their cycling age. The proposed technique was rigorously tested and experimentally validated, demonstrating that it significantly reduces battery degradation to a maximum of 0.099%, in stark contrast to the up to 4.41% observed with conventional controllers.</description></item><item><title>State Transfer Induced Transient Synchronization Instability of GFM-VSC: Analysis and Improvement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909647</link><description>The operation mode of grid-forming voltage source converters (GFM-VSCs) may switch between voltage source mode (VSM) and current source mode (CSM) under some situations such as grid faults, owing to the current limitation control. During the mode-switching process, there is state transfer from the final state of the last mode to the initial state of the next mode, which impacts the transient synchronization stability (TSS) of GFM-VSCs. This paper primarily focuses on analyzing and improving the TSS of GFM-VSCs by considering the effect of state transfer. A novel transient instability mechanism is revealed through the existence analysis of equilibrium points. It clarifies that the state transfer may cause the operating trajectory during faults to bypass the stable equilibrium point in CSM before diverging to the next cycle, thereby resulting in transient synchronization instability. Besides, to further analyze the TSS of mode-switched VSCs considering the dynamics during faults, multiple Lyapunov functions are adopted to derive the TSS criteria and boundaries. It has been identified that lowering the minimum critical current and adjusting the saturated current phase in accordance with virtual power angle (VPA) dynamics can enhance the TSS. Therefore, a VPA feedback-based current limiting strategy is proposed to safeguard GFM-VSCs against overcurrent and ensure the TSS. The validity of the new transient instability mechanism and the efficacy of the proposed strategy are confirmed through simulations of a GFM-VSC connected to an IEEE 39-bus power grid and hardware-in-the-loop experiments.</description></item><item><title>Assessing Dynamic Reserves vs. Stochastic Optimization for Effective Integration of Operating Probabilistic Forecasts</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909649</link><description>Probabilistic forecasting is becoming pivotal in utilities' decision-making processes, offering an accurate portrayal of plausible forecast deviations as opposed to deterministic forecasting which only focuses on the expected forecasted variables. Two methods, dynamic reserve and stochastic optimization, have been used to integrate probabilistic forecasts into power system operational planning. Dynamic reserve predicts system reserve requirements based on observed (from historical observations) or expected (from probabilistic forecasts) uncertainty spreads. This approach has a low computational burden, but it is commitment and dispatch agnostic. Stochastic optimization, on the other hand, considers multiple scenarios simultaneously (from probabilistic forecasts), allocating recourse across the commitment and dispatch variables, but demanding high computational resources and time. The selection between these methods depends on utility requirements and specific situations. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of both methods using a calibrated real-size system representing the Southern Company for medium and high solar penetration levels. Additionally, it proposes a hybrid dynamic reserve and stochastic optimization approach with a risk evaluation pre-scheduling procedure to enhance decision-making.</description></item><item><title>Minimax Regret Robust Co-Planning of Transmission and Energy Storage Systems With Mixed Integer Recourse</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909558</link><description>The growing penetration of renewable energy sources, with intermittent and uncertain nature, brings new challenges to the secure and efficient operation of power systems. Expanding transmission networks and utilizing energy storage (ES) have been introduced as effective solutions to address these challenges. This paper presents a minimax regret robust co-planning model with mixed integer recourse for transmission and ES systems, designed from the perspective of a central planner. The model considers a polyhedral uncertainty set for future peak load growth, while uncertainties in wind farm expansion are addressed through internal scenario analysis. This approach will guarantee the robustness of investment decisions and provide the central planner with a clear picture of the maximum regret among all possible scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed minimax regret framework facilitates strategic planning for ES installation after the resolution of long-term uncertainties. In this paper, we reformulate the model into a standard min-max-min problem, in which the maximization level is only over uncertainties. Subsequently, a five-level solution strategy based on a modified nested column and constraint generation decomposition technique is represented to deal with the intractability and complexity of the problem caused by binary variables of transmission lines and ES blocks. The model is finally evaluated through comprehensive simulation studies to verify its tractability, practicality, and effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>A Dynamic Model-Based Minute-Level Optimal Operation Strategy for Alkaline Electrolyzers in Wind-Hydrogen Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10912757</link><description>Maintaining the export power of wind-hydrogen systems within a stable range is critical for power system security. However, this is challenged by the mismatch between large time-scale of alkaline electrolyzer (AWE) scheduling strategies and the short-term fluctuations of wind power. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel minute-level optimization strategy for AWE operation. Developing effective small time-scale strategies requires a detailed consideration of AWE dynamics. To this end, we first introduce its steady-state electrochemical characteristics and third-order dynamic models for both temperature and Hydrogen-to-Oxygen (HTO) ratio. Based on these refined models, we develop an AWE optimization framework that enables electrolysis power to track minute-level wind power fluctuations by dynamically adjusting fine-grained variables, such as the lye flow rate, cooling flow rate, and pressure, at 1-minute intervals. To overcome the computational challenges posed by the detailed modeling, we propose an improved model predictive control (MPC) framework. This framework incorporates model simplifications to improve computational efficiency, along with an optimization-simulation iterative procedure to ensure operational feasibility. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed strategy extends the AWE load range by 13.8% and reduces wind power curtailment by 15.06%. Additionally, synergies among control variables enable the system to achieve a balance between operational efficiency, stability, and security, highlighting the potential of this approach to enhance the performance of wind-hydrogen integrated systems.</description></item><item><title>Promote Data Sharing in Integrated Power-Traffic Networks: A Coalition Game Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10910214</link><description>Accurately estimating spatial-temporal electric vehicles' (EVs) charging demands is crucial for the secure and economic operation of power systems. At present, the distribution system operator (DSO) relies on historical data collected at each charging station to estimate future EV charging demand. However, the station-level forecast disregards EVs' spatial correlations within traffic networks (TNs) and might suffer significant forecast error, forcing the DSO to make conservative scheduling at the expense of operation economics. To this end, this paper proposes to leverage cross-sector information (i.e., traffic demand data and network parameters in TNs) to enhance forecast accuracy and avoid over-conservative operations. To facilitate the data sharing among the DSO and TN data holders (i.e., traffic authority and navigation App. companies), we adopt the Coalition Game theory to uncover how these entities could cooperate to benefit each other, and to fairly allocate the extra profits (i.e., the operational cost reduction induced by the improved forecasts) among themselves. The conditional value-at-risk theory is adopted to model the risk-averse behavior of the DSO. In case studies, we reveal the non-negligible impact of TN condition variations on EV charging distributions. Moreover, numerical results show that sharing high-quality traffic data contributes to the reduction in DSO's operating cost by utmost 20.8% as compared to the current practice without data sharing.</description></item><item><title>An Optimization Framework for Component Sizing and Energy Management in Electric-Hydrogen Hybrid Energy Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10915713</link><description>This paper proposes an optimization framework to address the component sizing and energy management problems in an electric-hydrogen hybrid energy storage system connected to a wind turbine. The total cost of the hybrid system is minimized using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. In particular, four decision variables are optimized: the electrolyzer (EL) size, the supercapacitor (SC) size, and two parameters in the energy management strategy (EMS). To determine the power split factor for the wind power, the EMS introduces an artificial potential field (APF) and defines a virtual force based on the SC state of charge (SOC). Two APF parameters are optimized to tune the power allocation between the EL and the SC: the shaping parameter of the virtual force and the basis parameter of the power split factor. Since the cutoff frequency of the low pass filter (LPF) in the EMS is adaptively updated based on the optimized APF parameters, the proposed framework is referred to as the &#8220;OP-APF&#8221; framework. The effectiveness of the OP-APF framework is validated by performing MATLAB and real-time simulations. Compared to three baseline frameworks, OP-APF is more effective in reducing the system total cost, controlling the SC SOC, and alleviating the EL degradation.</description></item><item><title>Photovoltaic Power Prediction Considering Multifactorial Dynamic Effects: A Dynamic Locally Featured Embedding-Based Broad Learning System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916943</link><description>Accurate photovoltaic power (PVP) prediction is a prerequisite for the efficient and stable operation of new power systems. While existing research has extensively explored the relationship between global factors such as temperature, irradiance, and photovoltaic power, the local dynamic impacts of these factors are often overlooked, which may reduce the accuracy of predictions. To address this issue, this paper considers the dynamic interrelationships among multiple factors and proposes a dynamic locally featured embedding-based broad learning system (DLFE-BLS) algorithm for PVP prediction. Firstly, a novel dynamic phase space reconstruction method (DPSR) is proposed to characterize the dynamic properties of multivariate data. Furthermore, a dynamic local featured embedding (DLFE) algorithm is introduced to extract local dynamic features from multivariate data. Finally, by integrating the dynamic reconstruction and dynamic feature extraction processes into the broad learning system (BLS) framework, we propose the DLFE-BLS algorithm to improve the accuracy of PVP prediction. Case studies have shown that DLFE-BLS outperforms other models in terms of prediction accuracy. Additionally, it has the highest accuracy when applied to transfer prediction.</description></item><item><title>Optimal VSG BESS Sizing for Improving Grid-Following Converter Stability Under Various Dispatch Scenarios and Grid Strengths</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10924310</link><description>As renewable energy integration increases, ensuring stability of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) in weak grids is crucial, as grid-following (GFL) converters often become unstable under such conditions. Integrating virtual synchronous generator (VSG) batteries has shown potential to improve GFL stability, but determining the optimal size of the VSG required for stability remains an open question. Existing research typically relies on small-signal or impedance models for stability analysis, which are only valid at a single operating point and do not consider the full range of operating conditions, including various dispatch scenarios and grid strengths. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel methodology to visualize the system's stable operating region, offering insights into stability boundaries across various real power and grid impedance variations. Additionally, it introduces an optimal VSG battery sizing strategy that accounts for these variations, ensuring stability while minimizing VSG capacity. The strategy's effectiveness is validated through comprehensive PSCAD simulations, demonstrating its reliability across a wide range of real power and grid impedance operating points.</description></item><item><title>Fast Centralized Model Predictive Control for Wave Energy Converter Arrays Based on Rollout</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10923686</link><description>Centralized control of wave energy converter (WEC) arrays for grid-scale generation can achieve higher energy production than decentralized (independent) control, due to its capability of fully exploiting mutual radiation effects. However, the state-of-the-art centralized model predictive control (CMPC) is significantly more computationally challenging than decentralized MPC (DMPC), since the number of control moves to be optimized grows in proportion to the number of WECs. In this paper, a fast CMPC controller is proposed, whose idea is to optimize only the first few control moves while rolling out future system trajectories using a fixed controller. A linear, two-degree-of-freedom (2-DoF) controller with a sea-state-dependent control coefficient tuning strategy is further proposed to serve as the rollout controller. It is shown that the proposed rollout-based CMPC (R-CMPC) can maintain almost the same energy production as conventional CMPC under a wide range of sea states, while significantly reducing the optimization dimension (in the studied case, by a factor of 6), enabling ultra-fast online computation (about 40 times faster than conventional CMPC).</description></item><item><title>Energy Management of Multi-Energy Communities: A Hierarchical MIQP-Constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10923740</link><description>This paper proposes a hybrid mixed-integer quadratic programming-constrained deep reinforcement learning (MIQP-CDRL) framework for energy management of multi-energy communities. The framework employs a hierarchical two-layer structure: the MIQP layer handles day-ahead scheduling, minimizing operational costs while ensuring system constraint satisfaction, while the CDRL agent makes real-time adjustments. The goal of this framework is to combine the strengths of CDRL in addressing sequential decision-making problems in stochastic systems with the advantages of a mathematical programming model to guide the agent's exploration during the training and reduce the dependency on opaque policies during real-time operation. The system dynamics are modeled as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), which is solved by a model-free CDRL agent built upon the constrained policy optimization (CPO) algorithm. Practical test results demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in improving the optimality and feasibility of the real-time solutions compared to existing stand-alone DRL approaches.</description></item><item><title>Complex Variable Design for Power Control of Grid-Forming Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854804</link><description>The analysis and design of the grid-forming (GFM) power loop and decoupling control can be challenging due to the coupled high-order system, where active and reactive power controls are typically designed separately using a dual-input-dual-output model.

Using the measured input/output data of the MG, a data-driven dynamic linearization model related to disturbances is built at each operating point of the closed-loop control system. Next, we develop a robust recursive regression method to learn the dynamic linearization parameter that is updated online. To estimate the lumped disturbance, an adaptive disturbance observer with an observer gain updated online is introduced. Subsequently, the adaptive data-driven cooperative controller with an iterative structure is developed. This method can effectively regulate the voltage and frequency of the islanded MG with adaptability to system changes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through both simulations and field tests in a real 100% PV powered islanded microgrid.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Data-Driven Frequency Control With Minimal Cost for Renewables Dominated Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045213</link><description>This paper proposes an adaptive data-driven frequency control with minimal cost for renewables-dominated microgrids, which does not rely on its accurate model. The Koopman operator provides the theoretical basis for the global linearization of nonlinear systems, and the extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) is the most computationally efficient method for its approximation. However, insufficient disturbance in normal cases cannot excite all system modes, causing EDMD to overfit the estimated model and deteriorate the performance of the data-driven method. To address this issue, this paper develops adaptive extended dynamic mode decomposition (AEDMD). AEDMD reduces data requirements by extracting dominant dynamic modes through the persistent excitation condition and principal component analysis. It solves the issue of insufficient input excitation by designing the control matrix with the assistance of the control-affine structure of grid-forming converters. This paper utilizes model predictive control (MPC) to achieve rapid frequency recovery and minimize generation cost by coordinating different types of distributed resources. In addition, the stability of the control system is theoretically clarified. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on several systems.</description></item><item><title>State-Space Variation Induced Instability During Mode Switching in Multi-Source DC Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11051022</link><description>DC bus signaling strategy is a common solution for achieving multi-mode autonomous operation in multi-source DC microgrids. This strategy often results in two different types of mode switching, which are classified based on whether state-space variation occurs before and after the switch. This paper investigates the voltage instability caused by state-space variation during mode switching of multi-source DC microgrid. Firstly, this paper analyzes how the dynamic behavior of the mode switching influences system stability and provides a state-space switching stability analysis method. The switching process may cause the system state to deviate from the region of attraction (ROA), thereby triggering system instability. Additionally, the mechanism of state-space variation induced instability during mode switching is revealed: mode switching involves mutual coupling among the adjustment processes of different source control strategies. This coupling exacerbates power imbalance, ultimately leading to system instability. To improve stability, an extended mode scheduling control method has been proposed by introducing transition modes to address the power imbalances during the mode switching. Finally, the experimental results verify the analytical mechanism and control method.</description></item><item><title>Applications and Services of Solid-State Transformers in Active Distribution Networks&#8212;A Critical Review</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11016957</link><description>Distribution systems have traditionally received the least attention in the bulk picture of power systems; they are yet the most &#8220;critical component&#8221; as they directly impact customers&#8217; perception and utilities&#8217; reputation. While transmission systems have seen abundant literature, innovations, and applications of power electronic-based devices to optimize their performance, distribution systems still require more attention toward a flexible and dynamic scheme to cope with volatile energy consumption and production.

Traditional Distribution Network Reconfiguration (DNR) is formulated as an optimization problem that determines optimal switch states for network conditions. With the increasing variability introduced by distributed energy resources (DERs), real-time DNR research has evolved toward continuously identifying optimal switch states over time. However, in practical operations, the simultaneous change of multiple switches can compromise system stability, making it essential to optimize the sequential order of individual switch operations. This study introduces a new DNR formulation that integrates sequential switching optimization into real-time applications, enabling fast and stable operation under dynamic conditions. To achieve this, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for sequential optimization and develop an agent learning environment that incorporates constraints on conditional loop networks and individual switching conditions, newly introduced in the DSDNR problem. The proposed algorithm is validated through case studies, including unbalanced systems, demonstrating that optimized sequential switching prevents partial outages, voltage instability, and line overloading. Furthermore, the results confirm that the method ensures stable system operation even in high-DER variability environments.</description></item><item><title>Iterative and Accelerated Techniques for Distributed Robust Service Restoration Strategy in Flexible Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045214</link><description>The integration of power electronic devices and distributed energy resources (DERs) into distribution networks is crucial for enhancing service restoration performance through flexible power regulation. However, the complex operational requirements pose challenges in coordinating them during power outages. To leverage the potential application value of multiple resources, this paper proposes a distributed robust restoration strategy that incorporates iterative and accelerated techniques. A soft open point integrated with energy storage is introduced and optimized alongside the local DERs. The distributionally robust optimization (DRO) method is used during the implementation of the recovery strategy, facilitating the participation of intermittent renewable sources. These measures collectively enhance system resilience. Subsequently, a distributed robust service restoration framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is employed for multiregional networks, allowing the robust model to be solved in a distributed manner. To ensure the computability of the model with numerous integer variables, relaxation iterations and induced acceleration processes have been developed within the algorithms to effectively nest DRO and ADMM, thereby significantly improving the model&#8217;s convergence and efficiency. Two test systems, the IEEE 33-bus system and a large-scale IEEE 123-bus system, were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model and approach.</description></item><item><title>Meteorological-Electrical Integrated Real-Time Resilience Assessment for Power Systems Based on Deep Learning Methods</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11063459</link><description>Recent widespread power outages caused by extreme weather events have elevated expectations for power system resilience, thereby emphasizing the critical need for proactive resilience assessment. However, given the uncertain pathways and intensities of such events, along with the extensive range of potential failure scenarios, achieving real-time resilience assessment remains challenging. This paper proposes a meteorological-electrical integrated real-time resilience assessment method for power systems to efficiently quantify the resilience level and precisely identify vulnerable areas against imminent typhoon disasters. Firstly, a novel synergistic downscaling approach for typhoon nowcasting models is proposed. This method combines deep transposed convolutional neural networks and statistical downscaling approaches to provide wind speed forecasts with higher spatial resolution. Spatiotemporal mismatches between typhoon nowcasting models and power systems are then addressed through geographical alignment and multi-timescale coordination. Based on the aligned wind speeds and component fragility models, an edge-adapting, physics-informed ChebNet-based deep learning method is developed to attain efficient and accurate resilience assessment of power systems. This method calculates system resilience metrics and component vulnerability indexes throughout the event, enabling vulnerable area identification. Numerical simulations are conducted on the IEEE 39-bus system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through comparisons.</description></item><item><title>N-1 Evaluation of Integrated Electricity and Gas System Considering Cyber-Physical Interdependence</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029084</link><description>The deepening digitalisation of infrastructure has significantly increased the interconnection between power systems (PS) and gas systems (GS), rendering integrated electricity and gas systems (IEGS) more vulnerable to cyber-physical contingencies (CPC). This paper pioneers the investigation into N-1 contingency evaluation for cyber-physical IEGS to identify critical failures that pose threats to operational security. To accurately model various CPCs in IEGS, we introduce a nonlinear partial differential-algebraic equation (PDAE) model, which redefines CPCs as discontinuities and abrupt changes in simulation boundaries. We further propose a variable-coefficient analytical method (VC-AM) designed to robustly and efficiently handle these reformulated boundaries during CPC simulations. Building on this foundation, an N-1 evaluation framework is established to explore the contingency impact propagation and detect resultant violations, incorporating several performance indexes to quantify and rank the impacts of diverse contingencies. Case studies reveal that cyber-physical interdependence notably amplifies the effects of contingencies, underscoring the potential of VC-AM for real-time N-1 evaluation. In contrast, traditional methods are hindered by high computational complexity and convergence challenges.</description></item><item><title>A Distributed Market-Aided Restoration Approach of Multi-Energy Distribution Systems Considering Comprehensive Uncertainties From Typhoon Disaster</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029621</link><description>The increasing deployment of multi-energy distribution systems (MDSs) necessitates the coordinated restoration of power and thermal loads under disasters. Nevertheless, existing research often overlooks the inherent uncertainties of disasters and the potential of market mechanisms, resulting in risks of over-investment and inefficient allocation of flexible resources. Thus, this paper presents a distributed market-aided restoration approach for MDS considering the comprehensive uncertainties from typhoon disasters. First, a stress intensity interference theory combined with a structural fragility model is utilized to characterize the uncertainty of distribution line damage caused by typhoons. Second, a tractable operational model for MDS, incorporating numerous auxiliary variables, is introduced to simplify the constraints of power and thermal networks. Then, a risk-averse two-stage restoration framework is developed to manage comprehensive uncertainties from both line damage and renewable generation. Meanwhile, a Cournot Nash-based joint bidding model of multi-energy microgrids is designed as a market-aided strategy to facilitate the restoration of MDS. Further, a distributed algorithm named alternating search procedure is utilized to protect participants&#8217; privacy and alleviate the computation burdens. Finally, case studies based on real statistics of the 2024 super typhoon &#8220;Yagi&#8221; in China validate that the proposed method creates a win-win situation for all stakeholders.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Heat and Electricity Dispatch Based on an Encrypted Equivalent Modeling Method of Heating Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11032138</link><description>The dispatch problem of integrated energy systems faces a contradiction between the unified modeling and privacy protection issues as various energy systems belong to different sectors. An encrypted equivalent modeling method is proposed to construct the feasible region of district heating system (DHS) considering its thermal inertia and elasticity. A sensitivity modeling method is adopted to equivalently construct the feasible region of DHS and hide its absolute state information. The relative state information and structural parameters of DHS is further reduced and encrypted through the redundancy-constraint-elimination technology and an equivalent constraint-transformation technique. Then, based on the DHS equivalent model, a non-iterative dispatch model was constructed for thermal and power systems. The dispatch model can fully utilize the elasticity of DHS and guarantee to obtain the global optimization. Case studies verifies the equivalence of the proposed encrypted feasible region model of DHS and the improvement in solving efficiency for the optimal dispatch problem. The solution time is reduced by two orders of magnitude compared to the heat-power iterative solution method. The redundancy-constraint-elimination technology further reduces the solution time by more than half. Economy and flexibility improvement brought by the elasticity of DHS to power systems are also verified.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Capacity Planning for Integrated Charging Microgrids Along Highways Considering Seasonal Fluctuation and Risk Management</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11037299</link><description>Upgrading highway service stations to integrated electric-hydrogen charging microgrids (IEHCMs) has become a significant aspect of coordinated decarbonization in the energy and transportation sectors. However, the increasing integration of variable renewable energy and charging loads intensifies uncertainties within the IEHCMs, potentially leading to energy imbalances on multiple timescales, thereby introducing a need for flexible and reliable options. This paper proposes a novel two-stage capacity planning method for interconnected IEHCMs that considers energy sharing. The method incorporates year-round operation based on a reconstructed full-scenario time series and a conditional value-at-risk model with extreme scenario tail risk characteristics. Photovoltaic generation, interconnected DC lines, and short-term and seasonal hydrogen storage resources are optimally allocated to provide a solution for the IEHCMs that balances reliability and economics, managing fluctuations on multiple timescales while keeping risk below acceptable levels. Numerical results show that the proposed model helps integrate renewables for future highway service stations and provides more reliable planning results.</description></item><item><title>SocioDiff: A Socio-Aware Diffusion Model for Residential Electricity Consumption Data Generation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11021430</link><description>Disadvantaged communities face disproportionate energy burdens, yet they remain underrepresented in electricity consumption datasets. This lack of data may limit the development of targeted assistance programs and energy policymaking, thereby perpetuating systemic disparities and increasing the risk of energy poverty. To address this pressing issue, we propose SocioDiff, a novel diffusion-based model for generating synthetic residential electricity consumption data that incorporates socio-demographic information. SocioDiff introduces the Socio-aware SSSD process, which integrates social attributes into the data generation workflow. SocioDiff employs a two-step diffusion process to separately capture global trends and household-specific details to ensure representative and diverse synthetic consumption data. Additionally, adversarial training is used to improve the representation of disadvantaged communities. Experimental results using the Irish Energy Regulatory Commission dataset show that SocioDiff achieves a 63.59% improvement in Maximum Mean Discrepancy compared to traditional methods and leads to a 4.4% improvement in downstream load forecasting performance. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating socio-demographic features for generating more equitable and inclusive consumption data and supporting the development of fairer energy models and policies for disadvantaged communities. The generated dataset and documentation are publicly available at https://github.com/Intelligame/SocialDiff.</description></item><item><title>Load Frequency Control for Integrated Electrical-Water System Considering Water Hammer Effect</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11022760</link><description>Demand response (DR) is a valuable tool in load frequency control (LFC) of power systems, especially in improving the system&#8217;s regulating capacity. The pumps, with their rapid response capabilities, can be effectively utilized as a DR resource to further enhance LFC performance. However, improper adjustment of pumps will cause the accumulation of pressure pulsations throughout the water distribution system (WDS), resulting in the water hammer effect. To address this issue, this paper introduces a water hammer feedback loop in LFC with DR to balance the power system stability as well as WDS operational safety. With the wave tracking method (WTM), the proposed LFC method enables efficient modeling of the hydrodynamic process with low computational complexity and acceptable accuracy. A model predictive control (MPC) based optimal control algorithm is also developed to adjust the pumps and generation units. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits significant improvement on the performance of pressure pulsation regulation. Results also show the enhanced stability and effective pressure fluctuation mitigation in the electric-water coordinated control.</description></item><item><title>BRM-Based Joint Resource Management for Demand-Side Communication in Smart Grid Considering Resource Coupling Effects</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11022749</link><description>Demand response plays a pivotal role in maintaining supply-demand balance in smart grids, relying on reliable two-way communication between the control center (CC) and consumers. However, the uncertainty introduced by data surges poses challenges to communication reliability, leading to load tracking pressure and additional costs for system stability. This paper proposes a computing-network convergence communication architecture that integrates the advantages of edge computing and cooperative relaying technologies. By deploying edge computing devices (ECDs) on the user side for edge data processing, the proposed framework mitigates the adverse effects of data surges and enhances demand-side communication performance. Furthermore, considering the limitations of resources, we develop a bandwidth release model (BRM) based on Amdahl&#8217;s Law and hardware performance limitations to analyze the coupling effects between communication and computation resources. On this basis, a QoS-constrained resource sharing mechanism is established. The dynamic interaction between the utility company (UC) and the telecom operator (TO) is characterized by using a Stackelberg game, allowing for balanced allocation of communication and computation resources. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy significantly improves system communication quality and economic efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Hardware-in-the-Loop Experimental Testbed Using Air Conditioners for Grid Balancing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11023557</link><description>Driven by the need to offset the variability of renewable generation on the grid, development of load control is a highly active field of research. However, practical use of residential loads for grid balancing remains rare, in part due to the cost of communicating with large numbers of small loads and also the limited experimentation done so far to demonstrate reliable operation. To establish a basis for the safe and reliable use of fleets of compressor loads as distributed energy resources, we constructed an experimental testbed in a laboratory, so that load coordination schemes could be tested at extreme conditions. This experimental testbed was used to tune a simulation testbed to which it was then linked, thereby augmenting the effective size of the fleet. Modeling of the system was done both to demonstrate the experimental testbed&#8217;s behavior and also to understand how to tune the behavior of each load. Implementing this testbed has enabled rapid turnaround of experiments on various load control algorithms, and year-round testing without the constraints and limitations arising in seasonal field tests with real houses. Experimental results show the practical feasibility of an ensemble of small loads contributing to grid balancing.</description></item><item><title>Unsupervised Power Load Super-Resolution Based on Contrastive and Internal Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11032179</link><description>Power load super-resolution technology aims to recover power load time series data with a high resolution from low-resolution power load data, providing a more accurate representation of actual power load. Existing deep learning-based load super-resolution methods require paired low- and high-resolution load data to train a model, and the model is used to perform load super-resolution tasks on the unseen low-resolution load data. Nevertheless, these approaches have limited applicability in real-world scenarios where high-resolution data is difficult to obtain, which makes training the model infeasible. Motivated by this, this paper proposes a new system to overcome this limitation. Supported by self-learning techniques, the system can generate load data with a desired high resolution without using high-resolution load data to train the load super-resolution model (i.e., the model can only be trained by the low-resolution load data). The system is also equipped with an unsupervised noise identification module, enabling the system to effectively identify diverse noise signals in the load sampling process and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Experiments and comparison studies are conducted on a real-world dataset to validate the effectiveness of the proposed technology, and the results demonstrate the technology can achieve a comparable performance to supervised load super-resolution methods and has high adaptivity to load super-resolution tasks with different scaling factors.</description></item><item><title>Communication Accessibility Oriented Deployment Strategy of Hybrid IoT Terminals for Dispatching Large-Scale Flexible Loads in Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11032171</link><description>The global power system transition highlights the potential contribution of flexible loads as regulation resources for addressing fluctuations from emerging renewable energies. To dispatch flexible loads accurately and instantly, the power systems impose higher requirements of communication accessibility on local access services in communication systems, i.e., massive terminal access, frequent interaction, and cost-efficient accessibility. Thus, to enhance communication accessibility, this paper proposes a bi-level optimization framework to deploy hybrid Internet of Things (IoT) terminals for dispatching large-scale flexible loads by load aggregators to provide regulation resources in power systems. The framework includes: 1) a deployment strategy of hybrid IoT terminals considering various communication performances; 2) a bi-level optimization model integrating the interaction between the power system regulation scheme and the communication system deployment strategy; 3) an iterative algorithm addressing communication demands of load aggregators and the communication performance of different IoT terminals. Moreover, the numerical results demonstrate the proposed strategy can provide effective communication accessibility and further improve local access services.</description></item><item><title>Renewable Energy Following Strategy via Quantified Aggregated Heterogeneous Electric Vehicle Flexibility</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11037515</link><description>The rapid expansion of renewable energy (RE) generation brings environmental and economic benefits. However, the mismatch of the RE generation pattern and load profile introduces the imbalance between energy supply and demand, posing challenges to modern smart grids. While RE generation is inherently less controllable, the emergence of controllable loads, particularly electric vehicles (EVs) with their flexible charging and discharging capabilities, offers a promising solution to dynamically adjust energy consumption to match RE availability. To this end, this paper proposes a RE following mechanism for EV aggregator (EVA), enabling coordinated charging and discharging of EVs. First, we mathematically quantify the aggregated flexibility of EVs using an affine transformation of convex polytopes. This approach improves computational efficiency and accuracy in aggregating individual heterogeneous EV flexibility with different parameters. Then, a RE following mechanism for the EVA is formulated, treating the quantified EV flexibility set as an operating envelope. Two RE following evaluation methods, namely, Euclidean norm and cosine similarity, are used to assess the RE following effectiveness. Finally, we propose a pricing strategy accommodating various charging and parking decisions of EVs based on a combined framework of time-of-use (TOU) pricing and intraday-block pricing (IBP), incentivizing EV participation in RE following. The numerical results show that the proposed RE following mechanism significantly improves RE utilization, leading to an average increase of 62.04% in the RE consumption ratio and a 13.35% boost in average profits compared to the other two cases without RE following strategies.</description></item><item><title>ExDiffusion: Classifier-Guidance Diffusion Model for Extreme Load Scenario Generation With Extreme Value Theory</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11062498</link><description>Extreme load scenario generation is essential for power system planning and security assessment. However, the challenges of limited data and complex external features in extreme events make it difficult for existing methods to generate realistic and diverse extreme load scenarios. To address the challenges of data scarcity and feature complexity, this paper proposes a novel scenario generation method, ExDiffusion, to generate diverse and high-quality load scenarios for both extreme and normal conditions, under limited data. This method enables effective modeling of the medium and tail behavior in time series load data by integrating the classifier-guidance diffusion model with the autoregressive model, leveraging Extreme Value Theory (EVT). Firstly, the method introduces an extremeness measure to synthesize load-level labels and augment the data via the diffusion model. A classifier-guidance diffusion model is then developed to reduce the dimensionality of the input features and guide the diffusion model to generate tailored scenarios, thereby reducing feature complexity and increasing the diversity of generated scenarios. Furthermore, extreme scenarios are modeled using the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD), refining the loss function of the diffusion model to facilitate the generation of realistic extreme load scenarios. The experiments on real-world data demonstrate that the proposed method has superior performance compared with existing methods in terms of accuracy, diversity, and effective generation of normal and extreme load scenarios, which demonstrates the potential of ExDiffusion as an efficient approach for extreme scenario generation.</description></item><item><title>Secondary Frequency Regulation via EV Aggregation-Based Virtual Power Plants: A Mean Field Game Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029625</link><description>This paper proposes a scalable mean field game (MFG) strategy for virtual power plants (VPPs) to coordinate large-scale electric vehicles (EVs) in providing secondary frequency regulation services. Firstly, in order to estimate the frequency regulation capability of the geographically dispersed EVs aggregated by the VPP, a joint data- and model-driven rolling evaluation approach based on a temporal multi-graph fusion neural network (TM-GCN) is designed, providing an essential basis for the subsequent optimal bidding and regulation signal decomposition. It is a challenging task to incentivize large-scale heterogenous and self-interested EVs to proactively response to the time-critical frequency regulation command. Therefore, a scalable MFG is formulated for the VPP to rapidly decompose the secondary frequency regulation signals and revenues among numerous EVs, effectively breaking through the curse of dimensionality. The existence and uniqueness of the mean field game equilibrium (MFGE) are validated utilizing the Brouwer fixed-point theorem and the contraction mapping theorem. Moreover, a distributed solution algorithm is developed to search for the MFGE, which exhibits good convergence performance across varying numbers of aggregated EVs. Comparative studies have validated the superiority of the proposed methodology in distributing secondary frequency regulation tasks across large EV fleets while maximizing VPP&#8217;s economic benefits.</description></item><item><title>Non-Iterative Coordinated Optimal Dispatch of Distribution System and Microgrids via Fast Approximation Equivalent Projection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11036544</link><description>Developing a coordinated optimal dispatch (COD) strategy for distribution systems (DS) and accessed microgrids (MGs) is one of the solutions to enhance the flexible operation of power systems. Under the premise of the operational autonomy of MGs, existing COD studies can be classified into iterative methods that allow for independent decision-making in DS and MGs, and non-iterative methods based on the operational region (OR) modeling of MGs. However, the iterative methods hardly guarantee computational convergence and efficiency, while non-iterative methods struggle to solve equivalent projections with high-dimensional ORs. To this end, a fast approximation progressive vertex enumerations (FAPVE) algorithm-based non-iterative COD approach is proposed, where the high-dimensional OR considering time coupling characteristics can be formed effectively. First, a reliable outer normal vectors calculation method along with a vertices and normal vectors count limiting mechanism are introduced to enhance the computational efficiency and stability of the FAPVE algorithm. Second, a time-decoupling method for day-ahead MGs&#8217; OR based on initial MG decisions is presented to ensure the applicability of the proposed algorithm to day-ahead COD problem. Statistical analysis verifies the computational efficiency and accuracy of the FAPVE algorithm, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed time-decoupling method based on non-iterative framework.</description></item><item><title>Frequency Reserve Service From Heat Pumps and Electrolyzers in Power Systems: A Sealed-Bid Auction Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11036542</link><description>With the increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs), power system inertia is steadily declining, leading to more pronounced frequency variations during disturbances. Therefore, in future low-inertia grids, frequency reserve service (FRS) from the controllable load sector will become increasingly critical. While much research has focused on FRS from RESs and Active Controllable Loads (ACLs), such as Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) and Electric Vehicles (EVs), the potential of Passive Controllable Loads (PCLs) has been largely overlooked. Additionally, there is a lack of an appropriate framework in the literature to determine the optimal price and quantity of FRS from each supplier. Hence, this paper addresses these gaps by investigating FRS from heat pumps (HPs) and electrolyzers, two key PCLs expected to play crucial roles in future power grids. Furthermore, a sealed-bid auction (SBA) framework is proposed to determine the optimal price as well as quantity of FRS from various suppliers, using nadir point deviation (NPD) and the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) criteria of the frequency response. According to the results, when the system inertia decreases from 5 seconds to 2 seconds, the required FRS reserve increases from 0.07 p.u. to 0.24 p.u., and the FRS price approximately doubles. Finally, the analyzed case studies show the effectiveness of the HPs and electrolyzers as well as the developed market model to improve the frequency response of the system.</description></item><item><title>Strategic Utilization of Cellular Operator Energy Storage for Smart Grid Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11049663</link><description>The innovative use of cellular operator energy storage enhances power grid resilience and efficiency. Traditionally used to ensure uninterrupted operation of cellular base stations (BSs) during grid outages, these storage can now dynamically participate in the energy flexibility market. This dual utilization enhances the economic viability of BS storage systems and supports sustainable energy management. In this paper, we explore the potential of BS storage for supporting grid ancillary services by allocating a portion of their capacity while ensuring Ultra Reliable Low Latency (URLLC) requirements, such as meeting delay and reliability requirements. This includes feeding BS stored energy back into the grid during high-demand periods or powering BSs to regulate grid frequency. We investigate the impacts of URLLC requirements on grid frequency regulation, formulating a joint resource allocation problem. This problem maximizes total revenues of cellular networks, considering both the total sum rate in the communication network and BS storage participation in frequency regulation, while considering battery aging and cycling constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the power compensation capabilities of a cellular network while balancing communication and frequency regulation requirements. By optimizing reliability and delay parameters, the system enhances energy efficiency and contributes to the stability of the power grid.</description></item><item><title>RoadPowerFM: Graphormer-JEPA-Based Foundation Model for Road-Power Coupling Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11030813</link><description>Coupling effects in road-power coupling networks (RPCNs) attract increasing attention, as they are crucial for addressing the road-power intertwined challenges caused by the rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs).

This paper develops a multiple-time-scale coordinated deep expert system framework that predicts the load demand of public, highway, and bus EVCSs. In the framework, the expert inference engine generates both the quarter-hourly and monthly predictions. For quarter-hourly load predictions, a stack ensemble learning strategy is proposed to combine heterogeneous neural network methods in a scalable, modular manner. Then, the multivariate data, regularized according to EVCS types and TOU rates, is processed via seasonal and trend decomposition using Loess (STL), and the daily profiles are grouped through multivariate time series K-Means clustering to ensure the consistency of the STL trend. For monthly energy predictions, a multi-matrix elastic net using blockwise coordinate descent is designed to correlate the remainder predictions (offered by the short-term engine and aggregated into monthly intervals) and the trend component (with cluster labels of ECVS types and TOU rates). In the case study, a real-world dataset with volatility is used, such that the proposed framework is implemented to show that forecast combinations can leverage multiple preferences, and short-term predictions can improve monthly performance.</description></item><item><title>An Equity-Aware Residential EV Charging Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11039745</link><description>The shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) in the near future is undeniable. With the integration of EVs, rising charging demands pose voltage challenges to the distribution grid. The voltage-based controlled EV charging proposed by the existing literature to manage the distribution system voltages usually has inherent locational disadvantages and can lead to inequitable or unfair EV charging. This paper proposes EqV-Volt charging control, which is an equity-aware, var-supported, voltage-based local EV charging control with no communication requirements. It uses a small percent of bi-directional charger capacity to provide var support to local point-of-charge voltage, and the EV is charged with the maximum possible charging power. The proposed charging control combines volt/watt and volt/var control based on local voltage feedback. A mathematical model of control is formulated, and its stability analysis, along with the model validation, is provided. A charging equity index is introduced to quantify equity awareness of charging control. The proposed control provides fair EV charging and keeps system voltage within stability limits. Validation is provided through multi-day phasor simulations in MATLAB/Simulink on a modified IEEE 33-bus system with 1440 EVs.</description></item><item><title>Edge Computing-Enabled Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading in a Local Energy Community</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11021432</link><description>Local energy communities establish a platform for prosumers and consumers to share surplus generation via peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. Traditional optimization techniques for energy management problems necessitate precise models and accurate predictions. In contrast, reinforcement learning has gained widespread attention as it can handle system uncertainties without relying on models. However, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches for P2P energy trading involve a large volume of communications and computations, hindering the practical deployment of decision-making algorithms on edge devices whose communication and computation resources are very limited. To this end, this paper proposes an efficient and privacy-preserving MARL approach for edge computing-enabled P2P energy trading. Specifically, we design an information interaction framework that shares representations rather than sensitive observations to protect the privacy of various agents. In addition, we develop an event-triggered communication approach that controls the frequency of interactions through a gating mechanism to reduce communication overhead among agents. To save the memory footprint of each agent, we investigate an evolutionary training method that updates the networks using perturbation without backward gradient computation. Case studies on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our proposed method yields significant efficiency improvements while maintaining high decision-making performance.</description></item><item><title>Partial Information Perturbation-Based Specified Time Consensus With Asynchronous Switching: A Distributed Energy Dispatching Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11011922</link><description>With the widespread integration of distributed renewable energy, traditional centralized dispatching architectures face challenges in robustness and flexibility. It is essential to develop distributed energy optimization strategies to enhance the efficient utilization of renewable energy. Nevertheless, the exchange of information in distributed dispatching task execution entails potential risks of sensitive data exposure. This paper aims to investigate an improved privacy masking-based distributed privacy-preserving specified-time consensus algorithm for the economic dispatch problem (EDP) in energy systems (ESs). Therein, a privacy protection mechanism suitable for directed graphs is proposed by integrating state decomposition mechanisms and privacy masking techniques, ensuring both the accuracy of optimal solutions for EDP and the generality of communication topologies. Under this mechanism, a consensus algorithm with specified time performance is introduced, eliminating complex parameter constraints associated with predefined time bounds in distributed tasks. Additionally, an asynchronous switching law is incorporated into the privacy-preserving consensus protocol, allowing the algorithm to better adapt to environmental changes and dynamic parameter adjustments. Finally, the proposed method is applied to solve EDP in combined heat and power (CHP)-based ESs, demonstrating its excellent convergence and privacy performance.</description></item><item><title>Quantum Computing for Stochastic Economic Dispatch in Renewables-Rich Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11015516</link><description>Scenario-based stochastic optimization is a prevalent method for the economic dispatch of renewables-rich power systems. To reduce the time and space complexities for generating massive scenarios and solving pertinent mixed-integer stochastic optimization efficiently, quantum computing can provide critical assistance. To this end, we first propose the unified quantum amplitude estimation (UQAE) to generate massive scenarios with quadratic acceleration by a few qubits, after which the dimension of state variables embedded in the two-stage stochastic optimization also decreases exponentially. Then, by utilizing quantum-classical Benders decomposition, we accelerate the mixed integer master problem in the first stage on quantum processing units, while convex subproblems are solved on central processing units. Especially considering limited qubits in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, we propose to reduce the scale of master problem by scenario clustering and cut selection using the customized quantum approximation optimization algorithm (QAOA). Mathematically, we not only prove the decreases of complexities by UQAE-QAOA but also give the feasible ranges of penalty factors for transforming constrained problems into Ising models. Finally, we perform numerical experiments on modified IEEE systems to test the efficiency and accuracy of UQAE-QAOA, as well as the scalability of the designed quantum scheme.</description></item><item><title>LCL-AKA: Lightweight Authentication and Key Agreement Protocol for Power IoT</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11016791</link><description>The rapid adoption of power Internet of Things (PIoT) systems has made security a critical concern, particularly as existing certificateless authentication and key agreement (CL-AKA) protocols face three fundamental limitations that hinder their practical deployment: excessive computational overhead from multi-round interactions, inadequate protection against advanced cryptanalytic attacks, and inflexible architectures unsuitable for dynamic grid environments. To tackle the previously mentioned challenges, this paper proposes lightweight authentication and key agreement protocol (LCL-AKA) for PIoT. Firstly, this protocol efficiently completes the process of identity authentication and session key agreement within a single round of communication interaction, significantly reducing computational costs and improving communication efficiency.

These attacks, especially when launched from multiple points, present serious risks to the stability and security of the LFC system by corrupting critical measurement data. This paper proposes novel multipoint FDI attack detection and defense methods based on temporal analysis neural networks to increase the resilience of LFC systems under attack. Specifically, a data-driven dual-layer long short-term memory (DL-LSTM) attack detector is designed for efficient detection of multipoint FDI attacks. The method leverages a hierarchical LSTM architecture to capture temporal dependencies effectively and identify attack patterns within time series data. Moreover, a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU)-based defense method is proposed to mitigate the impact of such attacks, leveraging its superior performance in time series data prediction to ensure effective postattack defense. The proposed detection and defense mechanism is validated through simulations on a smart grid with three-area LFC systems, incorporating the practical complexities of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) links, renewable energy sources (RESs), and system nonlinearities, demonstrating its effectiveness in attack detection and its promising applicability to complex power grid environments.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Asynchronous Federated Learning for Digital Twin Driven Smart Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11036541</link><description>The smart grid represents a revolutionary advancement, ushering power systems into an era of enhanced intelligence. Unlike traditional power networks, smart grids demand superior real-time performance, security, and accuracy. However, their development faces significant challenges, including delays in device status updates, malicious station attacks, and a lack of user trust, which impede service quality improvements. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Privacy-Preserving Smart Grid distributed Collaborative computing system (PPSG) that integrates blockchain and asynchronous federated learning technologies. A digital twin framework tailored for smart grids is designed, enabling real-time simulation and reflection of electrical devices&#8217; states and behaviors, thereby enhancing service responsiveness. Additionally, to tackle non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data and outdated local models, a dual dynamic aggregation factor asynchronous federated learning scheme is introduced, improving service accuracy. The &#8220;Proof of Contribution&#8221; blockchain consensus algorithm is employed to assess contributions to computational tasks and utilize stochastic processes to mitigate election fraud, thereby strengthening security. Extensive comparative experiments on Non-IID datasets and heterogeneous devices demonstrate PPSG&#8217;s superior learning performance, efficiency, and reliability. Furthermore, experiments using real power grid datasets validate its practical applicability, scalability in large-scale node environments, and feasibility for real-world deployment.</description></item><item><title>Edge Resilient Control for Feeder Automation System Under Hybrid Attacks: A Hybrid Physical Model-Driven and Data-Driven Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045218</link><description>The extensive application of the distributed feeder automation system (DFAs) is a prominent feature of the power distribution system (PDS). To enhance the resilience of DFAs to cyberattacks and hybrid attacks (contains both physical and cyber-attacks), this paper proposes an edge resilient control approach (ERCA) for DFAs, which integrates attack detection and mitigation. Two key modules are developed: 1) Edge Cyberattack Detection and Correction Module (ECDCM), achieving quick cyberattack detection and correction based on machine learning and physical constraints; 2) Consensus-based Fault Section Localization Module (CFSLM), which incorporates causality function related to agent overcurrent states and fault location to correctly localize the fault section in hybrid attack scenarios. In addition, the effective boundaries of ERCA are theoretically deduced in this paper, which proves that ERCA can retain resilience to cyberattacks and hybrid attacks even if undetected cyberattacks exist due to the failures of machine learning-based detection submodules. Finally, the proposal&#8217;s effectiveness and performance are tested and verified using the IEEE 123-bus system and the real two-feeder test platform with DFAs. By adopting ERCA, outages and load losses caused by cyber attacks are 100% avoided, and the fault caused by physical attack is correctly isolated with more than 97.6% reliability in 100,000 times-level Monte Carlo Numerical simulations of hybrid attacks.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Resilient Unit Commitment Supported by Battery-Electric Locomotives Under Decision-Dependent Uncertainties</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11073155</link><description>Battery-electric locomotives (BELs) offer a promising solution for long-distance energy exchange in power systems. To address the challenge of random transmission line failures under uncertain routing before hurricanes, this paper proposes a proactive resilience-enhancing scheduling strategy that adeptly integrates unit commitment (UC), energy storage plants, and BELs. The problem is formulated as a two-stage distributionally robust optimization (T-DRO) model with risk aversion. To manage decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) arising from BEL routing decisions and distributional ambiguity caused by limited outage information during hurricanes, an event-based decision-dependent ambiguity set (DD-AS) with  $L_{1}$  distance is developed, which captures random failures in both transmission lines and railway networks to construct a decision-dependent sample space. Using Lagrangian dual method, the optimization problem is reformulated and decoupled into deterministic master problems and subproblems. An enhanced Benders decomposition algorithm with hybrid cuts techniques is designed to solve the proposed T-DRO under event-based DD-AS. The advantage of this algorithm over classical Benders decomposition method is theoretically interpreted. The proposed model and algorithm are tested on the modified IEEE reliability test system (RTS) under a hurricane to verify their effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>Enhanced GAN-Based Joint Wind-Solar-Load Scenario Generation With Extreme Weather Labelling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11012665</link><description>The high penetration of renewable energy and frequent extreme weather events bring significant uncertainty to the operation and planning of power systems. The extreme scenarios exhibit high impact and low probability characteristics, posing a challenge in providing sufficient and reliable samples for power system decision-making. The existing scenario generation methods struggle to balance the generation efficiency and interpretability. The causality between meteorological factors and power system operation has not provided effective guidance for the extreme scenario generation. In this paper, firstly, the mechanism analysis and sample construction of extreme scenarios were achieved through meteorological factor extraction, meteorological-scenario causality test and scenario clustering. Secondly, an enhanced GAN model considering training stability is established. The physical constraints of power systems are used to ensure the effectiveness of generated scenarios. Finally, a statistical analysis considering the individuals and the whole samples is conducted. The accuracy evaluation method of the generated scenarios is proposed. The robustness of the model is validated based on accuracy.

Given the intrinsic uncertainty and variability associated with various connected resources as well as their aggregated representation, generating diverse load scenarios is of great significance for system planning, operation, and control. However, traditional time series statistical methods, in the absence of supplementary meteorological data, have limited capabilities in accurately generating load scenarios. To address such issues, this paper proposes an Optical Flow Denoising Diffusion Transformer model (OFDDT) to generate representative load scenarios. Specifically, the optical flow denoising diffusion module is adopted to capture load fluctuation characteristics influenced by the temperature, while the Transformer module integrates variability and historical load features to generate load profile scenarios. Case studies using real data demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in such load scenario generation tasks, outperforming traditional generative artificial intelligence models.</description></item><item><title>EnergyDiff: Universal Time-Series Energy Data Generation Using Diffusion Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11049025</link><description>High-resolution time series data are crucial for the operation and planning of energy systems such as electrical power systems and heating systems. Such data often cannot be shared due to privacy concerns, necessitating the use of synthetic data. However, high-resolution time series data is difficult to model due to its inherent high dimensionality and complex temporal dependencies. Leveraging the recent development of generative AI, especially diffusion models, we propose EnergyDiff, a universal data generation framework for energy time series data. EnergyDiff builds on state-of-the-art denoising diffusion probabilistic models, utilizing a proposed denoising network dedicated to high-resolution time series data and introducing a novel Marginal Calibration technique. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that EnergyDiff achieves significant improvement in capturing the temporal dependencies and marginal distributions compared to baselines, particularly at the 1-minute resolution. EnergyDiff&#8216;s universality is validated across diverse energy domains (e.g., electricity demand, heat pump, PV), multiple time resolutions (1 minute, 15 minutes, 30 minutes and 1 hour), and at both customer and transformer levels.</description></item><item><title>Load Frequency Control of Multi-Microgrids Based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Integrated With Online Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11075888</link><description>The integration of wind power into microgrids significantly increases the complexity of the microgrid&#8217;s dynamical behavior and introduces higher levels of uncertainty. This paper addresses load frequency control (LFC) in wind-diesel multi-microgrids by exploiting a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) method. The proposed method derives coordinated control strategies for multiple LFC controllers by combining offline centralized learning with online learning. During offline centralized learning, a neural network based on Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is applied to learn the dynamical behavior of the multi-microgrids. The LSTM-based network updates actor networks to estimate the optimal control policy from the global action-value function. Online learning integrates with offline training, allows the LSTM-based network to adapt to dynamic changes of the microgrid and bridges the gap between training and real-time application. Simulations on a wind-diesel three-microgrid and the New England 10-generator 39 test bus validate the method&#8217;s effectiveness in improving the control performance of the microgrid.</description></item><item><title>Topology Guided Network Clustering and Allocation of Edge Estimation Points for Monitoring of Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11039110</link><description>Managing extensive measurement sets in the power system for state estimation (SE) leads to communication burden and delays. To address the above challenge, this paper explores the concept of edge computing, offering robust support for real-time SE. The method involves dividing the large-scale network into clusters, ensuring balanced cluster sizes in the three-phase distribution network, thereby reducing SE runtime. Additionally, edge estimation points (EEPs) are strategically allocated to minimize distances to the data sources and other EEPs, effectively reducing communication delays. Building upon this approach, a constrained multi-objective optimization problem is formulated with four objectives in the network, incorporating limited measurements from microphasor measurement units ( $\mu $  PMUs) and remote terminal units (RTUs). The paper introduces a modified Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), which combines guided radial mutation and trait crossover and utilizes partition topologies to expedite optimization. It reduces mathematical formulation complexity through gene regulation and real value encoding for improved efficiency. A comprehensive analysis of the IEEE 123 and 37-bus systems has been conducted, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed formulations in addressing the specified objectives and adeptly managing associated trade-offs.

We leverage the ability of the LLM to perform in-context learning and create a topology-adaptive surrogate model for power flow calculation. The surrogate model is then integrated with a long short-term memory-based load forecaster and a model predictive control (MPC) scheme to achieve the optimal inverter control that adapts to frequent topology changes. Unlike many existing works that assume fixed-topology grids or require the knowledge of all possible topologies when training a model, the proposed in-context MPC method tackles the distribution voltage control problem under various topologies and adapts to unknown topologies with limited data requirement for fine-tuning. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated on a modified IEEE 123-bus test system.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Charging Coverage Strategy of UAV Based on Improved Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10946855</link><description>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as flight service platform are promising to deliver continuous required coverage to target users through efficient charging strategies. The agility-and-resilience of UAVs allow them to be rapidly assigned in accordance with mobile user status and charging strategies that require energy-efficient scheduling without compromising the current quality of service. However, as the limited coverage radius and endurance, efficiently scheduling multi-UAVs to adaptively charge, considering service fairness, and minimizing the replacement consumption of UAVs is difficult. Therefore, a multi-objective charging coverage problem is designed to address these factors, which involves the constrained Pareto dominance principle. Subsequently, an assisted deep reinforcement learning model based on the survival incentive (ADRL-SI) is proposed to adaptively charge UAVs while taking into account user fairness and energy-efficient deployment. ADRL-SI adopts a multi-objective particle swarm optimisation approach to assist different agents in learning. The survival incentive mechanism is responsible for securing the UAVs with minimum residual energy. Finally, simulation results display that the proposed ADRL-SI is more advantage than current DRL-based methods in the matter of user service level, UAV energy efficiency, adaptive charging security, and system convergence.</description></item><item><title>Averaging-Based Energy Management Strategy for Hybrid Battery-Ultracapacitor Energy Storage System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10974583</link><description>Considering a battery as the energy source for steady average current and an ultracapacitor as the dynamic energy buffer, this paper proposes a novel control strategy based on average current demand. The methodology averages the demand current over a time window to determine battery current, combined with rules to maintain the ultracapacitor's state of charge above 50%. However, the battery current is significantly affected by the averaging time window. A small window causes fluctuations, while a large one imposes unwanted currents to control the ultracapacitor's state of charge. As so, by optimizing the averaging window, this strategy minimizes battery current stress and power loss. Simulations under an urban driving cycle compare the proposed strategy with a sole-battery configuration, dynamic programming (benchmark), and rule-based approaches (original strategy). The simulation results indicate that the proposed strategy smooths battery currents, achieves over 75% of dynamic programming's effectiveness in extending battery life, and reduces computational burden and memory usage by over 85%. The strategy's low computational burden, and causal nature enable real-time control, which is demonstrated practically on an experimental setup.</description></item><item><title>AoI and Energy Minimization for LEO Satellite-Terrestrial Networks: A Constrained Multi-Objective Optimization Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11018200</link><description>In this paper, we investigate a LEO-satellite-terrestrial network designed to provide high-rate transmission services, on the constraints of limited energy and the stringent timeliness requirements of terrestrial user equipments (UEs).

By decoupling the problem, it develops an innovative matching algorithm for user pairing problem, followed by a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with space division and coverage detection strategy (MOSC) for both optimizing power and beamwidth. These algorithms are executed iteratively with a relatively small number of iterations.

However, due to the densely deployed APs, the high hardware costs and power consumption become the bottleneck of UCN. To address this issue, we introduce a low-cost and high-gain reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into downlink UCN, where passive RISs are deployed to assist the downlink transmission from APs to users. To achieve the energy efficient communication in proposed RIS-assisted downlink UCN, a global energy efficiency optimization problem is formulated with respect to user association, phase shift and downlink power allocation. Due to the non-convexity of the formulated problem, we first deal with the user association problem through linear conic relaxation method. Then the phase shift as well as power allocation are optimized alternately, where phase shift is optimized through fractional programming method and power allocation is tackled by constructing a surrogate function. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm could bring about 375% gain on energy efficiency comparing to the &#8220;No RIS&#8221; benchmark algorithm, which also corresponds to about 165% spectral efficiency gain.</description></item><item><title>Structured Tensor Decomposition Based Channel Estimation and Double Refinements for Active RIS Empowered Broadband Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10962559</link><description>Channel parameter recovery is critical for the next-generation reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered communications and sensing. Tensor-based mechanisms are particularly effective, inherently capturing the multi-dimensional nature of wireless channels. However, existing studies assume either a line-of-sight (LOS) scenario or a blocked TX-RX channel. This paper solves a novel problem: tensor-based channel parameter estimation for active RIS-aided multiple-antenna broadband connections in fully multipath environments with the TX-RX link. System settings are customized to construct a fifth-order canonical polyadic (CP) signal tensor that matches the five-dimensional channel. Four tensor factors contain redundant columns, rendering the classical Kruskal's condition for decomposition uniqueness unsatisfied. The fifth-order Vandermonde structured CP decomposition (VSCPD) is developed to address this challenge, making the tensor factorization problem solvable using only linear algebra and offering a relaxed general uniqueness condition. With VSCPD as a perfect decoupling scheme, a sequential triple-stage channel estimation algorithm is proposed based on one-dimensional parameter estimation. The first stage enables multipath identification and algebraic coarse estimation. The following two stages offer optional successive refinements at the cost of increased complexity. The closed-form Cram&#233;r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived to assess the estimation performance. Herein, the noise covariance matrix depends on multipath parameters in our active-RIS scenario. Numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of proposed algorithms under various evaluation metrics. Our results also show that active RIS can significantly improve channel estimation performance compared to passive RIS.</description></item><item><title>EE Maximization With Imperfect CSI at Transmitter in BackCom NOMA System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948118</link><description>This article presents a novel model within a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system comprising a multi-antenna access point (AP) and multiple single-antenna backscatter devices (BDs) and user equipments (UEs), where the channels from AP to UEs and BDs to UEs are characterized by imperfections. The core objective of this study is to optimize energy efficiency (EE) while ensuring the quality of service (QoS) for both uplink and downlink users. To achieve this, the article employs the Dinkelbach method to address the fractional programming challenge, leverages the S-procedure and Bernstein-type inequality (BTI) for managing channel uncertainties, utilizes semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to tackle the non-convexity arising from the quadratic form of the beamforming matrix, and applies sequential rank-one constrained relaxation (SROCR) to circumvent the computational complexity introduced by Gaussian randomization. Additionally, for the specific case of resource allocation with a single BD, a closed-form expression is derived. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the non-robust scheme in terms of EE, significantly enhancing the system's stability and robustness.</description></item><item><title>AoI Minimization for Air&#8211;Ground Integrated Sensing and Communication Networks With Jamming Attack</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10949709</link><description>Air-ground integrated sensing and communication (AG-ISAC) networks utilize unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with ISAC units as aerial platforms in next-generation wireless systems, which can sense ground status information to the base stations (BSs) for further decision-making. Given that effective decisions rely on timely sensed data, the Age of Information (AoI) serves as a metric that precisely reflects the timeliness and effectiveness of the sensing and communication (S&amp;amp;C) process. However, recent research has paid little attention to AoI minimization in AG-ISAC networks, particularly in the presence of malicious attackers attempting to interfere S&amp;amp;C operations. To address this research gap, this paper considers AG-ISAC networks with S&amp;amp;C jamming attacks, a mission ISAC UAV senses tasks and transmits the sensed data to the BS, while a mobile UAV attacker sends jamming signals to degrade S&amp;amp;C performance and increase AoI. To solve this, we jointly design the trajectory and S&amp;amp;C transmit power of the mission UAV to mitigate S&amp;amp;C performance degradation to minimize the AoI. Nonetheless, the NP-hard and dynamic long-term nature of the formulated problem poses significant challenges. To tackle this troublesome problem, we develop an efficient solution using the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique. Specifically, we propose a twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3)-based trajectory design and power control algorithm (TD3-TP). In addition to this, we incorporate a reward-shaping mechanism to speed up the convergence of the algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate our algorithm achieves the fastest training speed and minimum AoI under attacks relative to four benchmark methods.</description></item><item><title>Jamming Power Allocation for MIMO Radar Localization Aided by Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948115</link><description>As a promising technology, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can customize the wireless channel through the adjustmentof its phase, and strengthen the localization performance and anti-jamming capability of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radar. Thus, it is imperative to investigate a jamming strategy against the RIS-aided MIMO radar localization system. In this paper, we consider a jamming power allocation problem for RIS-aided MIMO radar based on cram&#233;r-rao bound (CRB) criteria. To this end, we first derive the CRB regarding target location estimation of RIS-aided MIMO radar in the presence of jammers. Subsequently, we formulate the jamming power allocation problem to maximize the minimum of the average CRB of RIS-aided MIMO radar via jointly optimizing the jamming power and RIS phase under the power budget and peak power constraints. Due to the variable coupling and high non-convexity of CRB, the optimization problem is extremely challenging to tackle. To solve the non-convex problem, we develop an alternating iterative algorithm with respect to the jamming power allocation and RIS phase design optimization subproblems. Specifically, we first transform the jamming power allocation subproblem into the form of linear programming for solution. Then, the RIS phase design subproblem is relaxed by the arithmetic-harmonic mean inequality to circumvent the complex matrix inversion, and converted into a fractional programming problem that can be solved through quadratic transformation approach. Owing to a degeneration of the solution induced by the inequality relaxation, we further propose a tightening-relaxation strategy to improve the solution quality, and re-optimize the RIS phase based on the previously derived solution. The ultimate solution can be achieved by alternately optimizing the jamming power and the re-optimized RIS phase. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Task Offloading in Dynamic Energy Splitting STAR-RIS Assisted NOMA-MEC Systems With Decomposition Based Multi-Agent DRL</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10960616</link><description>This paper explores a system that integrates non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with mobile edge computing (MEC), supported by a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) in energy splitting (ES) mode. We aim to address the challenge of minimizing energy consumption over the long-term by modeling it as a non-convex optimization problem. To simplify the resolution of this complex issue, we introduce a decomposition approach using a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique. Specifically, we decompose the problem into the sub-problems of computational resource and power allocation, and phase shifting, amplitude coefficient, offloading ratio, and time optimization. Based on theoretical derivations, we determine the optimal computational resource and power allocation for the given phase shifting, amplitude coefficient, offloading ratio, and time. Then, we propose a multi-agent twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm to jointly optimize phase shifting, amplitude coefficient, offloading ratio, and time for each time slot. Simulation outcomes demonstrate that the decomposition-based multi-agent TD3 (DB-MATD3) algorithm achieves faster convergence compared to conventional centralized DRL approaches. Compared with other existing methods, the proposed task offloading strategy, which employs the ES-based STAR-RIS, achieves energy savings of 28.7% to 40.8%.</description></item><item><title>Multi-PRF Waveform Design for Integrated Sensing and Communication System With Range Ambiguity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948377</link><description>In this correspondence, we focus on the range ambiguity in the integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system, which leads to large errors for target ranging. Firstly, we construct transmitted signals with multiple pulse repetition frequencies (multi-PRF) by changing the number of communication symbols across multiple coherent processing intervals (CPIs). This approach is based on the full-duplex ISAC nodes, which sequentially transmit sensing signals and communication symbols within each pulse repetition interval (PRI). Then, we formulate the power allocation problem in the proposed system by maximizing the sensing signal-to-interference ratio (SSINR) under communication rate constraints and provide a closed-form optimal solution. After equalizing the power of sensing and communication signals, the target can be detected at each PRF. Finally, we use the target's observed delay at each PRF for range ambiguity resolution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system has a larger unambiguous area and is more effective in facilitating the detection of a long-range target in comparison to the existing ISAC systems.</description></item><item><title>STAR-RIS-Aided NOMA for Secured xURLLC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11026781</link><description>Short packet-based advanced Internet of things (A-IoT) in six generation (6G) calls for not only the next generation of ultra-reliable low-latency communications (xURLLC) but also highly secured communications. In this paper, we aim to address this objective by developing a downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system with untrusted user. However, there exist two key problems: The confidential/private message for the far user will be exposed to the untrusted near user with successful SIC; The restrictive trade-off among reliability, security and latency poses a great challenge in achieving secured xURLLC. In order to solve these issues, we introduce simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS), which provides additional degree of freedom to enable a secure and fair decoding order and achieve a desired trade-off among reliability, security and latency. To fully reveal the trade-off among reliability, security and latency, we characterize the reliability and security via decoding error probabilities. A leakage probability minimization problem is modeled to optimize the passive beamforming, power allocation and blocklength subject to secure successive interference cancellation (SIC) order, reliability and latency constraints. To solve this complex problem, we explore its intrinsic properties and propose an algorithm based on majorization minimization (MM) and alternative optimization (AO).

In this paper, we propose a novel SC framework based on the concept of deep compression (DC) of DNN considering the strictly limited memory footprint of a mobile device, namely, DeCo-MeSC. In our proposed DeCo-MeSC framework, an initial part of a target DNN (up to so-called the split layer) for the mobile device is compressed with the DC technique to satisfy the memory constraint, while the remaining part of the target DNN (after the split layer) for a cloud server is uncompressed, yet fine-tuned to compensate for the performance loss due to the compression of the initial part. Furthermore, the jointly optimal pair of the split layer and data rate is determined efficiently to maximize the end-to-end inference accuracy under both the end-to-end inference latency and memory constraints. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme performs markedly better than the existing schemes.</description></item><item><title>The Impact of Spectral Irradiance Aggregation Into Kato Bands and PV-Bands on Estimates of Photovoltaic Spectral Effects</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11121565</link><description>Full-resolution spectral irradiance data can comprise upwards of 2000&#8211;3000 data points at a single time step. Given that photovoltaic (PV) modeling is regularly performed with subhourly time resolutions over multiyear periods, incorporating spectral effects can become challenging both in terms of file sizes and computational burden. For this reason, spectral irradiances are sometimes aggregated into a limited number of wavelength bands (or wavebands), such as the 32-band grouping known as Kato bands that is used in the IEC 61853 series of standards on &#8220;PV module performance testing and energy rating.&#8221; To test the impact of such aggregation, measured, and modeled spectral irradiance data from two sites in the United States&#8212;Tempe, Arizona and Golden, Colorado&#8212;are used to assess the impact on PV spectral effect estimates of aggregating spectral irradiances into Kato bands and into two other sets of wavebands known as PV-bands. Calculations using the aggregated spectra are compared with those using the full-resolution spectra, for crystalline silicon and cadmium telluride modules. Each of the three sets of wavebands yields negligible errors of less than 0.1% in the spectral derate factor, which characterizes long-term spectral effects. This indicates that both Kato bands and PV-bands should be sufficient for the purposes of PV energy rating. Meanwhile, a recent version of PV-bands performs best for evaluating the instantaneous spectral mismatch factor, leading to errors of less than 0.2% across all time steps for both sites and PV module technologies, while instantaneous errors for Kato bands reach magnitudes of up to 1.4%.</description></item><item><title>Voltage-Matched All-Perovskite Double- and Triple-Junction Solar Modules for Building-Integrated Photovoltaics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045357</link><description>We designed multijunction solar modules for installation on building walls, in which all the submodules are composed of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells, adopting the monolithically series-interconnected structures. Prior to considering concrete module configurations, we elucidated that the impacts of temporal and regional variations in the solar spectra on the vertically wall-installed modules are more notable than those on the modules installed on rooftops and in solar farms at the optimal tilt angles. As a result, the annually averaged conversion efficiencies for the double-junction (2J) modules of the conventional two-terminal configuration and other configurations that require the current matching between the top and bottom modules are notably degraded. By contrast, the voltage-matched (VM) 2J modules, in which the submodules yielding approximately the same maximal-power voltages (VMP) are connected in parallel, ensure high conversion efficiencies close to those for the four-terminal (4T) 2J modules even when wall installed because VMP is less sensitive to solar-spectrum variation than the photocurrents. The single output of the VM 2J modules is practically a great advantage over the dual output of the 4T 2J modules. An improved variant: the series&#8211;parallel-connecting VM triple-junction modules, in which the two-terminal middle/bottom modules are parallel connected with the top modules, further improve the conversion efficiencies under all the installation conditions.</description></item><item><title>A Solar PV-Based Compact EV Charging Solution for On-Board Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029121</link><description>This work is focused on a solar photovoltaics (PV)-based onboard charger using reconfigured motor windings. In the proposed scheme, the motor windings and traction converter switches form a three-phase interleaved buck converter (IBC). The IBC is interfaced with the solar PV and acts as the maximum power point tracking converter. The IBC reduces the current ripple at the battery side and improves the battery cycle life. Through IBC, a large amount of current at the battery side is paralleled in three inductors of the IBC, which reduces the on-state losses in the switches and copper loss in the inductors. Therefore, it is possible to increase the power level of the onboard charging system as high as that of the propulsion system with enhanced compactness of the system while reducing the cost. Moreover, the applied control strategy reduces the current sensor requirements in IBC and eliminates the proportional&#8211;integral controller, which is another major advantage of the proposed system compared to conventional control of the IBC. Furthermore, the switches are subjected to zero current switching. Finally, the real-time experiment of the proposed system was accomplished using the OPAL-RT platform for 6 kW of charging power.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Methodology for Solar Tracker Performance Assessment and Energy Loss Quantification</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11062883</link><description>The optimal functioning of large-scale photovoltaic installations relies on effective monitoring of tracking systems.

Aerial infrared thermography has enabled fast and robust fault detection in utility-scale PV plants. In this article, we explore two key approaches to improve inspection efficiency: increase the flight altitude and deploy swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles. A larger imaging distance expands the field of view but reduces fault detectability and georeferencing accuracy. In this work, we study the tradeoff between inspection efficiency and data quality for automatic fault detection and localization. The YOLO11 machine learning model was trained to detect defects in thermal images, and its performance was evaluated to vary imaging distances and camera pitch angles. Fault detection remained robust up to approximately 80 m, but georeferencing error became the primary limiting factor. Finally, we conduct a UAV swarm-based inspection of a PV plant, integrating automatic fault detection and localization, and compare the results with ground truth data.</description></item><item><title>RHT_NoC: A Reconfigurable Hybrid Topology Architecture for Chiplet-Based Multicore System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11026095</link><description>Chiplet-based system-on-chip (SoC) architectures, leveraging 2.5-D/3-D integration technologies, provide scalable solutions for a wide range of applications. Achieving high performance and cost-effectiveness in these systems relies heavily on optimizing die-to-die interconnect topologies and designs, which are essential for seamless interchiplet communication. This article introduces a reconfigurable hybrid topology (RHT) architecture designed for chiplet-based multicore systems. RHT achieves high performance and energy efficiency by dynamically reconfiguring the network topology to traffic variations, adaptively selecting transport subnets, and optimizing link bandwidth allocation, thereby minimizing congestion and maximizing packet throughput. Furthermore, RHT leverages global traffic information to dynamically combine Torus loops, maximizing opportunities for rapid packet transmission delivery while guaranteeing minimal hop counts. Moreover, RHT accelerates packet transmission via bufferless combined loops, extending the continuous sleeping periods of routers, improves power gating efficiency, and significantly reduces static power consumption. Simulation results indicate that the Mesh-DyRing achieves over a 40% reduction in network latency and more than a 20% decrease in power consumption overhead compared to the baseline design. When compared to WiNoC, an advanced hybrid wired-wireless topology design, the Mesh-DyRing-PG configuration reduces power consumption by 56.2% while maintaining equivalent average network latency.</description></item><item><title>A Trifilar Transformer-Based Class-F23 VCO With Noise-Circulating Technology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10993331</link><description>This article presents a low-phase noise (PN) trifilar transformer-based Class-F23 voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) with noise-circulating technology.

A large gain and dead-zone free phase detector (PD) is proposed. When the DLL reaches the locked state, the phase error between the two input signals of the PD can be reduced to 0.53 ps (0.095&#176;), which has an 18-time improvement compared to the conventional DLL. Therefore, the SPO of the entire DLL can be effectively reduced to be less than 0.87 ps. Furthermore, the auxiliary circuit, consisting of a large phase difference detector (LPDD) and fast-adjusting branches (FABs), accelerates the DLL&#8217;s locking process to 42 clock cycles and improves the locking speed by 4.1 times. Designed by a standard 180 nm CMOS technology, the DLL occupies an area of  $106.1\times 93.3~\mu $ m.

Backside power delivery network (BSPDN) has been introduced in the industry for 2-nm node with passive wires. In this work, we propose adding active components (power transistors) to the backside of silicon in a back-end-of-line (BEOL)-compatible fabrication process. The goal is to enable 12&#8211;0.7-V voltage downconversion at the backside of silicon (near the point of load, i.e., the frontside logic compute die) to minimize the IR drop and improve overall system-level conversion efficiency. This work leverages a hybrid monolithic 3-D (M3D)dc-dc converter architecture combining switched-capacitor (SC) and synchronous buck converter topologies with BEOL-compatible active and passive devices. The design employs amorphous tungsten-doped indium oxide (IWO) transistors, which offer high breakdown voltage and tunable threshold voltages, supporting both enhancement and depletion modes for efficient switching. With the experimentally calibrated compact models, the simulated hybrid converter design achieves 12&#8211;0.7-V conversion with a peak efficiency of 95.6% at a power density of 330 mW/mm2, demonstrating the feasibility of M3D SC dc-dc converters for next-generation power management in high-performance edge devices.</description></item><item><title>A Compact High-Speed Capacitive Data Transfer Link With Common Mode Transient Rejection for Isolated Sensor Interfaces</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11021663</link><description>In this article, a compact differential data transfer link architecture for isolated sensor interfaces (SIs) and immune to common mode transients (CMTs) is presented.

While various machine learning (ML) algorithms have been applied to the  $\mu $ -arch DSE problem, the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) remains underexplored. In this article, we propose a novel RL-based approach to address the reduced instruction set computer V (RISC-V) CPU  $\mu $ -arch DSE problem. This approach enables dynamic selection and optimization of  $\mu $ -arch parameters without relying on predefined modification sequences, thus significantly enhancing exploration flexibility. To address the challenges posed by high-dimensional action spaces and sparse rewards, we use a discrete soft actor-critic (SAC) framework with entropy maximization to promote efficient exploration. In addition, we integrate multistep temporal-difference (TD) learning, an experience replay (ER) buffer, and return normalization to improve sample efficiency and learning stability during training. Our method further aligns optimization with user-defined preferences by normalizing PPA metrics relative to baseline designs.

The proposed nMOS array dynamically detects the PSN and creates a pathway, channeling the PSN forwarded through the digitally controlled resistor (DCR) directly to the ground. To support the proposed power supply noise compensation (PNC) technique in wide-range operation, the output bits from the digital loop filter (DLF) control not only the DCR but also the total transconductance of the nMOS array. The supply-sensing amplifier (SSA) between the supply and the gates of the nMOS array amplifies supply noise to lower the voltage headroom, allowing the DCO to run faster. Fabricated in 40-nm CMOS technology, the prototype DPLL demonstrates an rms jitter of 1.27 ps under 1 MHz, 20-mVPP sinusoidal noise, while the rms jitter without the regulator is measured as 3.26 ps.

PPFDs have high harmonic rejection, but suffer from limited power efficiency and conversion gain, mainly due to second-harmonic feedback. Conventional harmonic reflectors (HRs) minimize this undesired feedback introducing a common-mode second-harmonic resonance, at the price of increased area and reduced bandwidth. In the proposed design, the HR is embedded into a transformer-based input-matching network to decouple the differential-mode inductance from the common-mode inductance. This results in a more compact design, with higher output power and improved power efficiency. A common-gate transistor is stacked with the push-push pair to further boost the output power while reusing the same current. Two PPFDs are cascaded without additional power amplification stages. The quadrupler, implemented in 28-nm CMOS, achieves a peak output power of 0 dBm and peak power efficiency of 5% at 77 GHz and the 3-dB bandwidth is from 70 to 86 GHz.</description></item><item><title>A 94.7-dB Dynamic Range Fully Passive Switched-Capacitor Low-Pass Filter With Enhanced Selectivity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884547</link><description>In this article, a passive gain-boosting technique is employed to improve the bandpass gain, input-referred noise, and area usage of a charge-rotation switched-capacitor (CRSC) filter. In addition, a passive feedback network is introduced, creating a sharp transition between the passband and stopband, thereby enhancing noise and linearity performance compared to prior work employing active feedback. Furthermore, the utilization of the pipeline technique raises the sampling frequency to match the clock frequency. The proposed filter is fabricated in 0.18- $\mu $ m CMOS technology. Operating from 1.8 V, the measured power dissipation of the filter is 1.52 mW. By applying a 250-MHz clock, the cutoff frequency of the filter can be tuned from 428 kHz to 6.75 MHz, while the dc gain is fixed at 1.33 dB under different bandwidth settings. For a 3-dB cutoff frequency of 2.35 MHz, the measured in-band IIP3 and IIP2 are 25 and 56 dBm, while the out-of-band IIP3 and IIP2 are 22.4 and 71.4 dBm, respectively. The input-referred integrated noise over 110 kHz&#8211;2.35 MHz is  $8.58{\mu }$ Vrms. Compared to prior art, the proposed filter presents competitive noise performance, area usage, and dynamic range (DR).</description></item><item><title>A 4 &#215; 32 Gb/s 1.8 pJ/bit Collaborative Baud-Rate CDR With Background Eye-Climbing Algorithm and Low-Power Global Clock Distribution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10870359</link><description>This article presents design techniques for an energy-efficient multi-lane receiver (RX) with baud-rate clock and data recovery (CDR), which is essential for high-throughput low-latency communication in high-performance computing systems. The proposed low-power global clock distribution not only significantly reduces power consumption across multi-lane RXs but is capable of compensating for the frequency offset without any phase interpolators (PIs). To this end, a fractional divider (FDIV) controlled by CDR is placed close to the global phase locked loop. Moreover, in order to address the suboptimal lock point of conventional baud-rate phase detectors, the proposed CDR employs a background eye-climbing algorithm (ECA), which optimizes the sampling phase and maximizes the vertical eye margin (VEM). Fabricated in a 28 nm CMOS process, the proposed  $4 \times 32$  Gb/s RX shows a low integrated fractional spur of &#8722;40.4 dBc at a 2500 ppm frequency offset. Furthermore, it improves bit-error-rate (BER) performance by increasing the VEM by 26 mV.

The low-noise front end utilizes a capacitor assisting triple-winding transformer (CTTF) to expand bandwidth and suppress noise. An injection-locked oscillator driven by a delay-locked loop is used to generate the quadrature clocks without using the divider and the associated high-frequency clock. The hybrid baseband filter consisting of passive RLC and active-RC biquad simultaneously achieves high linearity and flexible gain/bandwidth adjustments. The analog baseband circuitry employs a feedforward compensated transconductance amplifier that greatly relaxes the power-bandwidth trade-off. To mitigate the impact of complex and frequency-dependent quadrature error (I&#8211;Q mismatch) arising from I-to-Q clock overlap, the receiver applies separate RF- $G_{m}$  to drive I and Q passive mixers. Fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process, the proposed receiver exhibits a noise figure of 2.1&#8211;5.4-dB and 30&#8211;72-dB adjustable conversion gain, &gt;20-dBm in-band OIP3, &gt;16-dBm out-of-band OIP3 with a total power consumption of 104&#8211;199-mW at 1-V supply.</description></item><item><title>A Six-Phase Harmonic-Rejection Digital Transmitter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10808172</link><description>This article presents a six-phase cell-reused digital transmitter (DTX) using 1/3 duty-cycle local oscillator (LO) signals for harmonic rejection. The 1/3 duty-cycle square wave ideally generates no 3rd-order component, thus facilitating the on-chip method to improve 3rd-order harmonic rejection (HR3). The six-phase architecture is realized with cell-reused technique and Doherty load modulation to produce higher output power and 18 efficiency peaks on the complex plane. Switch-off resistance control is implemented in the digital power amplifier (DPA) to optimize its linearity. A multi-phase injection-locking (MPIL)-based multi-phase LO generator (MPLG) is introduced for accurate and low-noise LO generation. Fabricated in 28-nm CMOS technology with a compact core size of 0.86 mm2, this DTX realizes 28.3- and 27.7-dBm peak output power with 41.0% and 28.5% peak system efficiency (SE) at 0.9 and 1.7 GHz, respectively.

The baud-rate CDR reduces the burden of multi-phase clock generation and distribution, thus reducing the power consumption of clocking circuits. A pattern-based phase detector (PBPD) is proposed in the clock recovery path to address the transition density (TD) reduction caused by the baud-rate operation. The PBPD optimizes patterns that provide phase information, increasing TD by  $4{\times }$  compared with the conventional baud-rate PD, Mueller-M&#252;ller phase detector (MMPD). In addition, the number of comparators required for data recovery is reduced by one per unit interval (UI) by sharing the comparators used for CDR. The CDR prototype fabricated using a 28-nm CMOS is verified using PRBS31 pattern, where a bit error ratio less than 3e-8 is achieved under 5.6-dB channel loss at 0.83-pJ/b energy efficiency while occupying only 0.011 mm2.</description></item><item><title>A 78.2-dB Dynamic Range Shunt-Based Current Sensor for BLDC Motor Control With 2.75-&#956;s Conversion Time and 0.4-mm&#178; Active Area</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10792655</link><description>This article presents a shunt-based current sensor (CS) designed for brushless dc (BLDC) motor control. The proposed sensing system digitizes the current flowing through an external 12-m $\Omega $  resistor by sampling the resulting voltage drop by means of an accumulation-based sample-and-hold (S/H) circuit followed by a SAR-assisted  $\Sigma \Delta $  incremental analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The employment of an accumulation technique within the S/H circuit allows to amplify the input signal while effectively mitigating the  $kT/C$  noise contribution, leading to a significant improvement to the dynamic range (DR) of the readout. The proposed ADC architecture, on the other hand, allows achieving the target resolution in a relatively fast conversion time, essential feature needed to meet the stringent latency requirement imposed by the considered application. The sensor was fabricated in a standard 130-nm CMOS process, occupies a silicon area of 0.4 mm2, and draws 6.7 mA from a 1.5-V supply. Over a &#177;4-A input current range and a  $- 20~^{\circ }$ C to  $100~^{\circ }$ C temperature range, it achieves a worst case gain error of &#177;0.8%.

By adding the output of the first-stage phase detector (PD) to that of the second-stage PD, the noise and power overhead from the first-stage voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) can be suppressed, without relying on blocks such as high-speed delay lines that need to operate with a much higher bandwidth than the noise component that is being canceled.

However, FP-CIM with FP32/FP16/BF16 data format incurs a performance bottleneck due to the large storage requirements and MAC power. The emerging POSIT data format exploits dynamic bit width that adapts to varied data distributions, enabling using a low-bit-width to reach nearly the same accuracy performance as conventional high-bit-width FP (POSIT $8~{\approx }$  FP16/BF16). Therefore, a POSIT-based CIM exhibits inherent advantages over the traditional FP-CIM. Despite the theoretical superiority, the dynamic property of POSIT introduces huge exponent processing overhead, cell underutilization of the CIM array, and redundant logic toggles in mantissa addition for POSIT-base CIM. This article presents a POSIT-based digital CIM (PD-CIM) macro with three features to tackle the above challenges: 1) a bi-directional regime processing unit (BRPU) simplifies the complicated codec logic to reduce the energy overhead in dynamic exponent processing; 2) a critical-bit pre-compute-and-store (CPCS) CIM utilizes the spare CIM cells caused by the dynamic bit-width of mantissa to improve cell utilization of the CIM array; and 3) a cyclically alternating computing-scheduling unit replaces the bit-wise addition of dynamically aligned mantissas with bit-wise OR to save logic toggles power. Fabricated in a 28 nm CMOS technology, PD-CIM occupies an area of 1.41 mm2. It reaches an 83.23 TFLOPS/W peak energy efficiency at POSIT(8,1) for ImageNet classification on the vision transformer base (ViT-B) model.

The proposed  $\Delta \Sigma $  CIM macro involves three main innovations at the architecture and circuit levels: first, it replaces absolute inputs with deltas computed from consecutive input values, resulting in a notable 35.8% reduction in energy consumption for the CIM array; second, the delta matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) implemented by  $\Delta \Sigma $  CIM array can self-adaptively shift the analog CIM outputs to be NZM distributed, facilitating streamlined centralized data processing; and third, the introduction of a least significant bit first (LSB-first) ADC, whose number of conversions adjust dynamically based on instantaneous input values, allows for efficient analog output conversion of highly concentrated NZM analog data without compromising full-scale range or precision. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) analog SRAM-based CIM macros, this work achieves superior area-energy efficiency product by  $1.25{\times }$  with up to 21.38 TOPS/W and 1.44 TOPS/mm2 at full precision of 8b input, 8b weight, and 24b output, through bit-serial inputs and shifter-and-adder.</description></item><item><title>An 800-MHz 8.17-TOPS/W 0.63-TOPS/mm2 Memory-Utilization-Aware CNN Accelerator Featuring a Memory Stationary Dataflow</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10873361</link><description>Increasing the on-chip memory utilization (OCMU) is crucial for an area-efficient deep neural network accelerator. We propose a memory stationary (MS) dataflow to ingeniously combine the input and output features in a single memory block in a cyclic manner, significantly increasing the OCMU. The MS dataflow also reduces the feature memory access by 78.0%. Furthermore, residual paths in a ResNet model require large feature buffering. We introduce layer-wise clipped-asymmetric residual distillation (LCARD) quantization, removing the residual paths with minimal accuracy degradation. It dynamically assigns different feature/weight bit-widths for different layers, further enhancing the OCMU by  $3.2{\times }$  and throughput by  $4.5{\times }$  from a fixed bit-width (FBW) approach. We also present an MS gating (MSG) to skip the ineffective channels that improve the OCMU by  $1.2{\times }$  and throughput by  $1.3{\times }$ . Fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process, the proposed accelerator exhibits an 8.17-TOPS/W peak energy efficiency and a 0.63-TOPS/mm2 peak area efficiency at 800 MHz and 0.9 V while requiring only a 120 kB on-chip static random-access memory (SRAM) for the ResNet-50.</description></item><item><title>A 0.5-V 125-MHz 256-Kb 22-nm SRAM With 10-aJ/bit Active Energy and 10-pW/bit Shutdown Power</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10820858</link><description>Conventional low-voltage (LV) static random access memories (SRAMs) utilizing separate read-and-write assist circuits sacrifice access speed too much, leading to poor energy efficiency. Overlaying additional assist circuits to enable power-saving modes can exacerbate speed loss and energy inefficiency. This work proposes a coordinated read-write-hold-retention-shutdown (SD) assist circuit design for SRAMs to improve speed at low VDD and reduce leakage current in active and power-saving modes. This leads to overall power reduction and enhanced energy efficiency. The implemented 22-nm 256-Kb SRAM can operate down to 0.45 V, with the minimum energy point at 0.5 V. At 0.5 V, TT corner, and  $25~{^{\circ }}$ C, the measured maximum frequency ( $f_{\max }$ ) is 125 MHz with a 10 aJ/bit active energy, representing a 6.25 higher frequency with a 91% energy reduction, compared to the state-of-the-art 0.5-V SRAM in 28-nm bulk CMOS. The SRAM has a 12 pW/bit deep-sleep power and a 10 pW/bit SD power at 0.5 V.</description></item><item><title>A 28-nm Software-Defined Accelerator Chip With Circuit-Pipeline Scaling and Intrinsic Physical Unclonable Function Enabling Secure Configuration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856925</link><description>As emerging applications raise ever-boosting and varying computational demand, the reconfigurable accelerator is becoming prevalent due to balanced performance, efficiency, and flexibility. Although the functions of its processing elements (PEs) and interconnections can be defined by a high-level software program, the circuit parameters are mostly managed by hardware or the compiler, leaving opportunities for in-depth optimization and novel features. Considering that the circuit adjustment is of great value in terms of low power and security, this article presents a novel software-defined accelerator named cross-domain software-defined chip (CDSDC), of which most chip properties including circuit parameters, logic, and pipelines can be programmed synergistically by software at runtime. With this design scheme, CDSDC provides new features including: 1) dynamic pipeline-voltage-frequency scaling (DPVFS), which combines pipeline reconfiguration with voltage-frequency scaling to generate an optimal chip configuration for various applications; 2) intrinsic physical unclonable function (PUF), which leverages the uniform PEs as measured circuit delay elements by adjusting the circuit parameters, extracting the entropy of manufacturing process variation, and taking response bits as a PUF; and 3) device-binding confidential configuration, which uses the intrinsic PUF and ASCON algorithm to encrypt/decrypt configuration. The CDSDC has been implemented in silicon as a 28-nm Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) HPC+ 1P8M 6-mm2 test chip, operating at peak 400 MHz and 0.9 V, achieving a peak energy efficiency of 51 GOPS/W. It improves performance and efficiency for cross-domain patterns of computation by DPVFS.

The proposed design is composed of digital and analog loops of which the transient response is dictated by the digital portion. A fast approximation algorithm leveraging charge distribution reduces settling time significantly compared to linear and SAR approaches. A wide load range droop detector further improves transient response with negligible power overhead. The analog assisted circuits continuously provide current in response to the load current change without disturbing the loop dynamic. Implemented in a TSMC 180-nm standard CMOS technology, the LDO supports a 430 mA maximum load and ensures loop stability without external capacitors. It achieves a 480 mV undershoot at 430 mA with 100 ns edge time,  $49~\mu $ A quiescent current, and settling times of 225 ns and 260 ns for undershoot and overshoot at  $C_{L}=0$  pF when a 10-MHz clock is used.

While Sturdy MASH (SMASH) reduces the need for precise analog/digital matching in MASH, it reintroduces stability concerns and distortion in integrators due to larger signal swings. This brief presents a modified SMASH design with an efficient architecture that includes one active integrator and three passive ones. Compared to SMASH, the proposed design achieves a flatter signal transfer function (STF) and lower distortion across a wide band. The quantization noise from the first active integrator is filtered by a passive switched-capacitor filter (SCF) before being fed to a second-order passive noise-shaping (NS) quantizer. The structure can be transformed into a cascade of integrators with feedforward (CIFF) delta-sigma modulator (DSM) that traditionally requires a high-gain block. A fourth-order DSM was designed in 65 nm technology for performance validation and comparison, demonstrating an 89.5 dB SNDR and 92.8 dB dynamic range (DR) within a 500 kHz bandwidth using a 25 MHz clock with OSR =25. The simulated modulator power consumption is  $290~\mu $  W, yielding a Schreier FOM of 181.9 dB.</description></item><item><title>Secure Controller Area Network (CAN) Transceiver With Embedded Authentication Support</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10902476</link><description>The growing number of security threats and vulnerabilities in automotive and industrial control systems motivates the design of Controller Area Network (CAN) bus components with enhanced security measures while maintaining compatibility with existing standards and allowing for interoperability with non-enhanced systems. We present such an enhancement that is implemented by replacing standard CAN bus transceivers with a new transceiver that permits automatic authentication of CAN frames. The theoretical basis of our approach is based on incorporating a secondary communications channel in a virtual manner that simultaneously transmits an authentication signature with each CAN frame. To implement the authentication mechanism, a new backward-compatible transceiver is described, designed and validated that implements the virtual channel through selectively delaying the rising edges in a Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ) waveform that encodes a CAN frame at the physical layer. Novel aspects of the CAN transceiver include the use of use of authentication signature generators and comparators, rising edge time-based modulator/demodulator circuitry, and phase-preserving rail converters. The mixed-signal transceiver circuit was fabricated using a  $0.18\mu $ m CMOS process and operation was validated over PVT corner cases and with non-secure transceivers to demonstrate backward compatibility.</description></item><item><title>Designing Low-Loss Single-Inductor Multiple-I/O (SL-MI/O) CMOS Power Supplies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964411</link><description>Switched-inductor power supplies are valued for their high efficiency despite the bulkiness of off-chip inductors. When designing compact systems like portable consumer electronics and wireless microsensors, single-inductor topologies are therefore preferred. Specifically, single-inductor multi-input and multi-output (SL-MI/O) power supply designs pose unique challenges that have yet to be fully addressed. This paper aims to provide design guidelines for maximizing efficiency in the design of SL-MI/O systems, especially in the sub-5W domain. To simplify the choice between NFETs and PFETs for the multitude of power switches in SL-MI/Os, which is not straightforward, an intuitive metric called the Favorability Index (F ${}_{\mathrm {NP}}$ ) is proposed. A new, optimal supply voltage theory is also presented, suggesting that the most efficient voltage to supply power switches&#8217; gates is around twice the threshold voltage (v ${}_{\mathrm {T}}$ ). The paper also proposes using dynamic selectors in gate drivers. This allows for blocking cross conduction without increasing vSUP drastically, ensuring efficiency. A two-transistor selector is recommended as a simple implementation, and the tradeoffs are discussed. An example topology is designed using guidelines proposed by the paper to demonstrate the design flow and efficiency improvements.</description></item><item><title>Design of a Contingent Decision Equalizer Using Analog-in-Time Processing for PAMN Wireline Receivers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10880483</link><description>The need to rapidly increase per-lane data rates to meet system bandwidth demands has led to the adoption of digital equalization schemes in wireline transceivers. However, for short reach applications, mixed-mode designs offer better power and area efficiency, especially if their complexity explosion with data rates can be alleviated. This paper presents a new hybrid linear/nonlinear equalizer that unfolds the popular recurrent equalization architecture to remove any fundamental timing constraints in the wireline receiver. The modular multi-stage architecture drastically reduces the receiver complexity and enable real-time architecture tuning to improve energy efficiency. This paves the way for continual data rate enhancement with improved circuit performance. To ensure reliable performance in advanced CMOS processes, time-domain analog signal processing is used. This choice also enables linear energy scaling with data rate and allows proportional power scaling with degree of equalization. A 3-tap realization of the receiver fabricated in 28 nm CMOS process achieved a data rate of 52 Gb/s with an efficiency of 1.0 pJ/b and BER below 1e-4 with moderate ISI where channel loss at Nyquist is less than 12 dB.</description></item><item><title>Optimization of DTC-Based and Harmonic-Mixer-Based Fractional-N PLLs: Comparative Analysis of Jitter and Power Trade-Offs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10918863</link><description>As phase-locked loop (PLL) architectures become increasingly complex, optimizing the jitter and power performance through calculation alone is becoming more challenging for fractional-N PLLs. To find the most suitable PLL architecture that meets the jitter-power requirements of various applications, a simple and widely-applicable method is in demand to find the optimal jitter-power relation of different PLL architectures. In this paper, we propose the use of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) to optimize the jitter and power of PLLs, specifically focusing on two popular fractional-N PLL architectures: digital-to-time converter (DTC)-based and harmonic-mixer (HM)-based PLLs. By applying the MOEA, we can achieve optimal jitter and power relationships for both architectures, and the observed trends in jitter and power are explained and supported with calculations.</description></item><item><title>A 500-kS/s Continuous-Time Linear-Exponential Incremental ADC Achieving 90.1-dB DR and 103.1-dB SFDR</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10849806</link><description>This article presents a continuous-time (CT) linear-exponential incremental ADC (IADC) that achieves 15-bit resolution at 250kHz bandwidth with 40 cycles for one conversion. It is based on an energy-efficient CT linear-exponential IADC, which alleviates the requirements of the power-hungry input buffer and loop filter. The proposed IADC employs a coarse 9-bit first-order IADC followed by a fine 8-bit cyclic ADC. The first-order IADC performs the coarse conversion by linearly accumulating input signals, resulting in a small thermal noise penalty. The residual quantization noise is exponentially reduced by the cyclic ADC, significantly shortening the conversion cycle. The cyclic ADC achieves the required accuracy by reconfiguring the loop filter of the coarse IADC and effectively compensating for the excessive loop delay. The prototype CT IADC is fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process. With a 20MHz clock, it achieves 88.6-dB SNDR, 89.3-dB SNR, 90.1-dB DR, and 103.1-dB SFDR at a conversion rate of 500 kS/s. It consumes only 2.4 mW from a 1.2 V supply. It achieves the Schreier FoM (SNDR) of 168.8dB.</description></item><item><title>An 80 MS/s 70.8 dB-SNDR Radiation-Tolerant Semi-Time-Interleaved Pipelined-SAR ADC for Space Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10836806</link><description>In addition to the conventional ADC design tradeoffs between power, speed, and accuracy, radiation tolerance is the fourth factor for ADCs used in radiation environments. This paper describes radiation-tolerant (RT) ADC design tradeoffs and design strategies. Then, the paper introduces a 13-bit RT pipelined-successive-approximation register (pipelined-SAR) ADC fabricated in 65 nm CMOS technology based on the concluded tradeoffs. To further improve the ADC power efficiency, a semi-time-interleaved (Semi-TI) structure is employed. Besides, the ping-pong auto-zeroing (AZ) scheme is implemented in the residue amplifier (RA) to reduce the TID-induced offset while maintaining low power dissipation. The proposed ADC is designed and hardened against Single Event Effects (SEEs) and Total Ionizing Dose (TID) effects from the structure to layout levels. All sub-blocks were examined, and only the critical blocks were hardened to avoid over-hardening. From the measurement results, the prototype ADC attains an 80 MS/s sampling rate and achieves 70.8-dB SNDR and 80.3-dB SFDR at the Nyquist input frequency. With a total power consumption of 13.8 mW, the prototype ADC establishes a state-of-the-art Walden Figure of Merit of 60.7 fJ/conv step, yielding an efficiency comparable to non-RT ADCs with similar specifications. Irradiation tests validate the consistent performance of the ADC up to a cumulative dose of 500 krad (Si) in X-ray testing, while laser testing indicates a robust SEE threshold and swift post-SEE recovery.</description></item><item><title>A 0.3-mm2 1.3 &#956;W Wireless Monitoring System IC for Hermeticity Testing of Biomedical Implants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10851714</link><description>Advances in bioelectronic medicine have led to a reduction in implant size and notable improvements in energy management and data transmission techniques. Bulky titanium casings traditionally used to shield implant electronics are being gradually replaced by more streamlined materials, primarily composed of polymers and thin film ceramics. This transition offers numerous advantages, including a smaller form factor, enhanced flexibility, and the facilitation of wireless power and data transmission.

The focus of this design is on area- and power efficiency, as well as multi-purpose usage for various catheters. It contains 32 individual analog front-ends and 12 bit SAR ADCs operating at 40MS/s to enable off-chip digital beamforming. The analog front-end is programmable in power, bandwidth, gain and can be partially bypassed. The front-end bypass and slew-rate can be dynamically adjusted to save power during a receive period. On-chip supply regulation is included, which can be duty-cycled between receive periods to power down the system and save power. This leads to a power supply consumption between 4.5 and 14.1mW when always on, or between 0.37 and 1.15mW when duty-cycling at an 8% ratio. When operating at maximum power, an SFDR of 57.5dB and SNR of 56.1dB are achieved.The ADC performance can optionally be improved by clocking the array in 4 separate clock phases, resulting in lower peak currents, less power supply disturbance and an overall linearity improvement of 6dB.

In recent works, DCIM macro based on approximate computing mitigates the adder tree overheads, however, it faces a trade-off between power and neural network (NN) accuracy. The trade-off becomes more complicated in array-level CIM architecture since output channels of NN model have different sensitivities to approximation errors. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous approximate DCIM-based accelerator design framework that achieves a good energy-accuracy trade-off for a specific NN model. The framework includes three key features: 1) Evolutionary algorithm-based search finds cost-efficient approximation points by pruning the design space. 2) Genetic algorithm-based channel-wise mapping creates heterogeneous approximation methods that effectively reduce DCIM energy consumption while maintaining high accuracy. 3) A hardware generation strategy decides the number of DCIM macros and their sizes, resulting in an energy-efficient DCIM-based accelerator tailored for the given NN model. Experimental results show that employing the proposed heterogeneous channel-wise mapping significantly enhances the energy efficiency compared to a homogeneous mapping. Moreover, the proposed framework can produce heterogeneous DCIM-based accelerators that consume less energy than state-of-the-art approximate DCIM approaches.</description></item><item><title>State-of-the-Art ASCON ASIC Achieving 4.3 Gbps@0.8V and 3.5Tb/J@0.6V Outperforming AES by 25 Times</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854668</link><description>NIST selected ASCON as the standard Lightweight Cryptography (LWC) algorithm in 2023.

The conventional von Neumann architecture, in which large quantities of data are transmitted between processing units and memory units, creates a bottleneck in AI applications. In-memory computing (IMC) offers an efficient solution to this problem by enabling computations within memory units, thus reducing the need for data transmission. This paper proposes a multilogic sense amplifier (MSA) with a dynamic reference voltage (DRV) generation circuit (hereafter denoted as MSA-DRV) to enhance the performance and reduce the power consumption of static random-access memory (SRAM)-based IMC. The proposed MSA-DRV performs six logic operations, namely the AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR, and XNOR operations, within an SRAM array by using a novel DRV circuit. The DRV circuit enables the voltage threshold to be adaptively changed according to the requirements of different operations. Experimental results indicated that the proposed MSA-DRV had lower computational latency (on average 29.9% lower) and power consumption (on average 30.6% lower) than did a conventional sense amplifier design and reconfigurable assist sense amplifier. Thus, the proposed design can overcome the von Neumann bottleneck to facilitate high-speed, energy-efficient data processing, which is crucial for AI-based and other data-intensive applications.</description></item><item><title>OFQ-LLM: Outlier-Flexing Quantization for Efficient Low-Bit Large Language Model Acceleration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10924797</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, becoming essential to modern intelligent computing. Their large memory footprint and high computational cost hinder efficient deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is a promising technique to alleviate this issue and accelerate LLM inference. However, the presence of outliers impedes the advancement of LLM quantization to lower bit levels. In this paper, we introduce OFQ-LLM, an algorithm-hardware co-design solution that adopts outlier-flexing quantization to efficiently accelerate LLM at low-bit levels. The key insight of OFQ-LLM is that normal data can be efficiently quantized in a slightly reduced data encoding space, while the rest encoding space can be used for flexible outlier values. During quantization, we use rescale-based clipping (RBC) to optimize accuracy for normal data and group outlier clustering (GOC) to flexibly represent outlier values. At the hardware level, we introduce a memory-aligned outlier-flexing encoding scheme to encode activations and weights in LLMs at a low bit level. The outlier-normal mixed hardware architecture is devised to leverage the encoding scheme and accelerate LLMs with high speed and high energy efficiency. Our experiments show that OFQ-LLM achieves better accuracy compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) low-bit LLM PTQ works. OFQ-LLM-based accelerator surpasses the SOTA outlier-aware accelerators by up to  $2.69\times $  core energy efficiency, up to  $3.83\times $  speed up and  $2.44\times $  energy reduction in LLM prefilling phase, and up to  $2.01\times $  speed up and  $2.88\times $  energy reduction in LLM decoding phase, with superior accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Memristor-Emulator-Based Crossbar Array for Object Detection and Recognition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948485</link><description>Object detection and recognition are crucial for autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and human-computer interaction.

This is the first-ever recognition mechanism of its kind. We also perform handwritten digit recognition using a  $64 \times 4$  size array using grayscale conversion. The proposed system&#8217;s robustness is validated through process corner simulations, noise analysis, and temperature analysis. We also show the accuracy of our design for the digit recognition task using a confusion matrix plot, and the accuracy turns out to be 82.5 %. Our pioneering approach using a CMOS memristor-emulator STDP crosspoint array-based architecture achieves minimal energy consumption per neuron block, which amounts to  $\approx ~2.59$  pJ per neuron block and an overall energy budget of 663.66 pJ for the entire system considering the object recognition task.</description></item><item><title>Knowledge Distillation and Contrastive Learning for Detecting Visible-Infrared Transmission Lines Using Separated Stagger Registration Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10820014</link><description>Multimodal transmission-line detection (TLD) and other vision-related tasks in smart grids have garnered increasing attention due to advances in deep-learning technologies and escalating need for reliable power supplies. However, current TLD methodologies encounter several limitations. First, complex weather conditions often introduce substantial background noise, resulting in inaccurate object detection. Second, high parameter counts of extant models impede their deployment in real-world applications. Third, insufficient data samples results in overfitting and instability. To address these challenges, we proposed a separated stagger registration network (SSRNet-S $^{\ast } $ ), augmented with knowledge distillation (KD) and contrastive learning, specifically designed for RGB-T TLD. This method integrates a separated stagger registration mechanism into the fusion module to investigate relationships between cross-modal features. This approach enhances feature representation and effectively reduces background noise. Additionally, we devised a joint training framework incorporating KD and contrastive learning and proposed a hierarchical distillation strategy to compress the model while mitigating the impact of limited data samples. Complementary features were captured at various stages of SSRNet-S $^{\ast }$  by employing three levels of distillation. Extensive experiments on a TLD dataset demonstrated that both SSRNet-T and SSRNet-S $^{\ast }$  (with KD) outperform state-of-the-art methods. When using P2T-Large and P2T-Tiny as backbone networks in SSRNet-T and SSRNet-S $^{\ast }$ , respectively, the number of parameters decreased from 68.37M to 15.06M, and the computational floating-point operations decreased from 26.99G to 3.01G. Our code and results are available at https://github.com/WangYuSenn/SSRNet-KD.</description></item><item><title>NoCiPUF: NoC-Based Intrinsic PUF for MPSoC Authentication</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10966467</link><description>Modern Multi-Processor-Systems-on-Chips (MPSoCs) use Network-on-Chips (NoCs) as a scalable and efficient communication fabric. The applications running on these devices rely on frequent communication with central database servers, which are vulnerable to impersonation attacks by adversarial clones. We propose NoCiPUF, a novel NoC-based intrinsic Physically-Unclonable-Function (PUF) framework for MPSoCs authentication. We re-use the circuit switched nature of NoC with path-pairs as challenges to obtain secret responses, collectively called challenge-response-pairs (CRPs). Due to the random nature of manufacturing variations, equal hop paths exhibit unequal delays. We leverage the delay differences of flits traversing in equal-hop paths to generate unique responses. NoCiPUF is fully-synthesizable and readily scalable as it requires changes only at the behavioral level. To counter Machine-Learning (ML)-based modeling attacks on PUFs, we provide a comprehensive technique and reduce the prediction accuracy to ~52%. NoCiPUF framework incurs low area (0.76%) and power (1.14%) overheads and has no impact on NoC performance in normal mode due to independent authentication mode. Obtained responses have near-ideal PUF metrics and are verified against the NIST randomness test suite. This scheme offers high number of CRPs in larger NoC networks (&gt;0.74 million CRPs in  $5 \times 5$  mesh), proving its scalability.</description></item><item><title>Hardware Implementation of Projection-Aggregation Decoders for Reed-Muller Codes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10778655</link><description>This paper presents the hardware architecture and implementation of two variants of projection-aggregation-based decoding of Reed-Muller (RM) codes, namely unique projection aggregation (UPA) and collapsed projection aggregation (CPA).

The existing quaternion least mean square (QLMS) and quaternion maximum correntropy criterion (QMCC) algorithms are based on stochastic gradient descent and gradient ascent methods, respectively. Due to their reliance on instantaneous gradient approximations, these approaches exhibit slower convergence characteristics. To circumvent this limitation, quaternion recursive least square (QRLS) algorithm is proposed in the literature, which exhibits fast convergence and achieves lower MSE. However, the QRLS algorithm is based on minimum MSE (MMSE) criterion which optimizes error-energy, and is thus not a sufficient statistic for impulsive noise. In this paper, we propose novel non-MMSE criterion based recursive algorithms, namely quaternion recursive maximum correntropy criterion (QRMCC) and quaternion recursive maximum Versoria criterion (QRMVC). The proposed QRMCC and QRMVC algorithms exhibit robustness against impulsive/non-Gaussian distortions due to the inclusion of higher order error statistics. Simulations are presented for quaternion-valued channel estimation, which indicate that the proposed QRMCC and QRMVC algorithms deliver improved convergence compared to existing approaches. Lastly, the convergence of the proposed algorithms is analyzed with performance-validation using relevant computer simulations.</description></item><item><title>UniDec: A Unified Factor-Graph-Based Decoder Fully Compatible With 5G NR LDPC/Polar Codes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11039498</link><description>In comparison to 4G, 5G wireless needs to support a broader range of applications. Therefore, both low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and polar codes have been standardized by 5G new radio (NR) to fulfill the requirements of data channel and control channel, respectively. Usually, LDPC/polar decodings are implemented by separate hardware, leading to low area efficiency. Though decoders which can handle both codes have been proposed, how to compromise between throughput and efficiency has always been a persistent dilemma due to the absence of a unified and smooth integration methodology. To this end, by fully utilizing the common parts of graph-theoretic algorithms for both codes, this paper presents a unified decoder (UniDec) which is fully compatible with 5G NR LDPC/polar codes. This UniDec enables three key approaches: 1) unified processing nodes for both codes, 2) configurable permutation networks with multi-parallelism, and 3) flexible scheduling for 5G NR parameter configuration, guaranteeing both high data throughput and area efficiency. Implemented in 40nm CMOS, the UniDec attains a maximum of  $33.64\times $  throughput and  $5.98\times $  area efficiency compared to its multi-mode counterparts. Even compared with the state-of-the-art (SOA) dedicated ones, the UniDec still maintains a competitive edge in terms of throughput, energy, and area efficiency. It is noted that this methodology can be generalized to other factor-graph based signal processing algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Flexible Quadrature Spatial Modulation: Transmission, Detection, and Implementation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856548</link><description>In the conventional spatial modulation schemes, such as spatial modulation (SM) and quadrature SM (QSM), the number of the transmit antennas must be an integer power of 2, which limits the spectral efficiency and raises the hardware cost. To overcome the antenna limitation, a new modulation method, namely flexible QSM (FQSM), is proposed in this paper. Computer simulation results show that in contrast to the existing SM-like schemes, the proposed FQSM can provide better bit error rate (BER) performance under the same bit per channel use (bpcu). To further make the implementation of the FQSM systems feasible, a low-complexity symbol detection algorithm with matrix merging, group-based Givens rotation, candidate searching, symbol estimation, and likelihood estimation (LE) is introduced. Furthermore, the corresponding very-large-scale integration (VLSI) architecture is also proposed. Finally, the results of simulation and computational complexity reveal that the proposed symbol detection algorithm can offer the near-optimal BER performance with lower computational complexity, compared to other related detection methods. The results of the VLSI architecture implemented under the TSMC 90-nm CMOS technology at an operating frequency of 625 MHz show that the proposed hardware requires 554.37 KGEs and performs a 1562.5 Mbps detection throughput.</description></item><item><title>A Soft-Switching Boost-Type Resonant Forward Converter With Load-Adaptive Efficiency Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829499</link><description>This paper presents a fully soft-switching resonant forward converter, whose primary side adopts an active-clamp structure to achieve adjustable on-time of the main switch, and the secondary side adopts a boost switch to achieve boost-type voltage gain regulation and high efficiency. Based on proper resonant parameter design, the voltage across the resonant capacitor, as well as the drain-source voltage of the secondary boost switch, can decrease to zero each cycle, allowing zero voltage switching for the boost switch. Therefore, the penalty associated with the widened gain range is alleviated. To further improve efficiency, two optimization schemes are proposed to reduce the conduction loss of the boost switch and the core loss of the forward transformer. The experimental comparison with a conventional structure effectively validates that the proposed converter can achieve better efficiency performance, reduced noise, and lower cost while accommodating a wide input voltage range.</description></item><item><title>A Reconfigurable Wireless Power Receiver With Shared-Inductor Buck-Boost Converter for NFC-Powered Battery-Less Electronic Shelf Label</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10849767</link><description>This paper proposes a reconfigurable wireless power receiver for NFC-powered battery-less electronic shelf label (ESL). It achieves both 13.56-MHz AC-DC regulating rectification and 1-MHz DC-DC buck-boost conversion by sharing the receiver coil and power stages. Considering that wireless power may not always be sufficiently available, the rectifier employs a storage capacitor to ensure charging stability under conditions of low input received power. Additionally, a bi-directional buck-boost converter (BD-BBC) has been proposed to achieve dual-output by sharing a core with a rectifier. It also enables the regulation of output voltage across a broad range of input voltages, thereby enhancing system design flexibility. For the storage capacitor serving as the input source for the BD-BBC, its utilization can also be improved. The chip is fabricated using a 0.18- $\mu $ m CMOS process. The measurement results demonstrate a peak AC-DC rectification efficiency of 92.3% and a peak DC-DC conversion efficiency of 80.2% across a wide input voltage range.</description></item><item><title>An Improved Dual-Output Five-Level Buck PFC Rectifier With Reduced Switch Count</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10922116</link><description>Research on power converters featuring multipurpose capabilities holds a lot of potential in power electronics.

Finally, a detailed comparative assessment is included to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed topology.</description></item><item><title>Analysis of Inductor Current Ripple Minimization in PV-Fed Modular Multilevel DC-DC Converter With Distributed MPPT Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964387</link><description>Modular multilevel DC-DC converters find extensive use in power electronics due to their utilization of a single inductor, the potential for serial connection of N number of sub-modules (SMs), and a modular design. Recent research indicates that minimizing ripple in inductor current is feasible by maintaining a fixed interleaving angle of  $\frac {100}{N}$  % between the SMs during equal duty ratio operating conditions. This study explores the application of these converters in photovoltaic (PV) systems incorporating individual maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control. In this context, individual MPPT control imposes varied duty ratio conditions on the SMs, arising from differences in the sources of each SM, especially in instances of partial shading condition (PSC). This variability can potentially influence the current ripple within the system. This article conducts a thorough theoretical analysis to derive the optimal interleaving angle criteria for minimizing current ripple under conditions of unequal duty ratios. Additionally, a control strategy is proposed to integrate angle optimization with MPPT control based on the derived conditions. Further, it is observed that operating the converter at this optimal angle leads to a significant reduction in ripple current, by a factor of at least  $\frac {1}{N}$ . The MATLAB/PLECS simulations and experimental results verify considerable improvements in ripple reduction compared to the conventional interleaving angle method, both during steady-state and PSC.</description></item><item><title>Enabling Long Chain Lengths and High-Throughput for Time-Domain Neuromorphic Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10912655</link><description>This brief investigates the limitations on throughput and delay chain length in time-domain neuromorphic computing and proposes solutions to overcome these challenges.

A reconfigurable pre-filter-amplifier (RPFA) structure is proposed to pre-process the output current of the harmonic generator. By switching between two modes, the RPFA effectively filters out the undesired harmonics and amplifies the desired 4th harmonic. Therefore, both the harmonic rejection and locking range of the ILFQ are improved. In addition, a load tank based on a three-coil coupled transformer and an impedance-boosting transformer is designed to further extend the locking range, increase the output power, and reduce the DC power consumption. The measured results show that the proposed ILFQ achieves a 31.9% locking range (28.4 GHz to 39.2 GHz). Across the whole locking range, the measured 1st/2nd/3rd harmonic rejection ratio (HRR) is better than 42.4/37.4/15 dBc, respectively. Within the range of 28.4 to 36.2 GHz, &gt;29 dBc 1st/2nd/3rd HRR is achieved. The measured maximum DC power consumption is 13.3 mW.</description></item><item><title>SPECTRUM1k &#8211; 75 &#956;m Pixels Pitch IC With In-Pixel Histogramming for X-Ray Color Imaging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11046196</link><description>A new single photon-counting IC prototype called SPECTRUM1k with pixel matrix  $40\times 24$  and pixel pitch  $75~\mu $ m is developed by the Microelectronics Group of the AGH University of Krakow as a solution for X-ray color imaging. The chip, produced in CMOS 40nm technology, is made up of 960 individually configured pixels, each composed of an amplifier, an analog-to-digital converter, and  $64\times 12$ -bit memory cells that allow one to perform in-pixel energy histogramming.

A customized convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to extract the information of the linear and the third-order nonlinear gain errors of RA with dither injection. Compared to traditional correlation-based calibration algorithms, the proposed method can significantly improve convergence speed and robustness against dither capacitor mismatch. Compared with previous neural network-based calibration techniques which are commonly used for foreground calibration, the proposed method can operate in background to follow error variations without any risk of signal fidelity problems. Off-chip validation with a silicon-proven 14-bit 1.3 GS/s pipelined ADC shows that, after calibration, the SNDR and SFDR are improved from 46.6 dB and 55.2 dB to 63.1 dB and 80.4 dB, respectively. Moreover, the proposed method takes only 75K samples to reach convergence, whereas traditional algorithms require several to hundreds of millions of samples to achieve convergence ( $10{^{{2}}} \sim 10{^{{4}}}$  times faster). The implementation result shows that the power consumption of the proposed calibrator is 34.8 mW at 1.3 GHz clock frequency.</description></item><item><title>Calibration-Free Edge-Computing IMC Macro With Direct Current-to-Digital Conversion</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045166</link><description>In-memory computing (IMC) has emerged as a promising solution to the &#8220;memory wall&#8221; problem of traditional Von Neumann architectures by integrating computation directly within the memory.

However, as the bit width of the operands increases, the area and latency of stochastic circuits also need to increase exponentially to meet the precision requirements, resulting in a decrease in performance. This brief introduces a low-cost and high-speed parallel approximate stochastic computing multiplier (PASCM), which takes binary streams as both inputs and outputs. The PASCM is suitable for multiplication operations with multi-bit width. In order to further enhance the accuracy of the PASCM, an error compensation mechanism has been proposed.

The LACM buffer effectively regulates current flow across different load conditions, minimizing power loss while ensuring stable operation. Additionally, a sample-and-hold (S/H)-based BGR is implemented to eliminate noise propagation from the supply voltage  $(V_{\mathrm { SYS}})$  to the reference voltage  $(V_{\mathrm { REF}})$ , further enhancing PSRR. The proposed system was fabricated using a 0.18- $\mu $ m CMOS process.</description></item><item><title>Small-Signal Modeling of an S-S Compensated IPT System Under Frequency Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11048620</link><description>Frequency modulation is widely utilized in inductive power transfer systems and is also included in the Qi standard for low-power chargers. This brief examines small-signal modeling and simplification methods using an example of an S-S compensated system under frequency modulation. Initially, it develop models for the resonant components under frequency perturbation, which subsequently help in constructing the model of the resonant tank. By incorporating the models of the inverter and rectifier, it derives a sixth-order model for the entire system. The pole-zero analysis helps simplify this sixth-order model to a third-order and a first-order model. Experimental results show that these models can accurately predict the system&#8217;s control-to-output gain up to 1/2, 2/5, and 1/10 of the switching frequency. These models effectively illustrate the impacts of circuit parameters and the trade-offs between accuracy and complexity.</description></item><item><title>Bumpless Transfer Control for Discrete Semi-Markov Switching Power System With Cyber Attack</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11048984</link><description>In this brief, the bumpless transfer control is studied for power system under cyber attack with stochastic switching rule. Transient failures of power lines and dynamic switching of circuit breakers are accurately modeled by introducing semi-Markov chain. Due to the randomness of denial-of-service attack, a Markov chain is introduced to characterize the attack behavior. In order to solve the issue of stochastic switching in system operation and the impact caused by cyber attack, a comprehensive bumpless transfer rule is proposed, which is applicable to both the switching instant and the switching interval. By combining semi-Markov kernel and Lyapunov function method, a state feedback controller with no disturbance transfer performance is designed and its effectiveness is verified by numerical example.</description></item><item><title>Hardware Trojan Design With Low Overhead and High Destructiveness for STT-MRAM-Based CIMs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10883655</link><description>To overcome the von Neumann bottleneck, computing-in-memories (CIMs) have emerged as a design trend. On the other hand, with the globalization of the semiconductor supply chain, hardware Trojans have become a significant security concern. While there have been some studies on hardware Trojan designs for embedded memories in the past, there is no literature addressing hardware Trojan designs for CIMs. In this article, we propose a hardware Trojan design for spin transfer torque magnetoresistive random access memory (STT-MRAM)-based CIMs that can disrupt computing-mode operations. Our trigger circuit can evade detection during post-manufacturing memory testing, and our payload circuit can disrupt over 99% of CIM operations. Experimental results also demonstrate that compared to the original peripheral circuits of STT-MRAM-based CIMs, the area overhead and power overhead (at the TT process corner) caused by our inserted hardware Trojan are only 1.023% and 0.123%, respectively. Therefore, our hardware Trojan can easily hide within the peripheral circuits.</description></item><item><title>MULSAM: Multidimensional Attention With Hardware Acceleration for Efficient Intrusion Detection on Vehicular CAN Bus</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10883332</link><description>Controller area network (CAN) protocol is an efficient standard enabling communication among electronic control units (ECUs). However, the CAN bus is vulnerable to malicious attacks because of a lack of defense features. In this article, a novel vehicle intrusion detection system (IDS) is developed. The challenge is that existing techniques of IDSs rarely consider attacks with small-batch, which are characterized by their small attack scale and concealed attack patterns, posing a significant threat to driving safety. To solve this problem, we developed an algorithm model that merges multidimensional long short-term memory (MD-LSTM) and self-attention mechanism (SAM), shortly named MULSAM. The MULSAM model was compared with other baseline models, including stacked long short-term memory (LSTM), MD-LSTM, etc. Experiments show that our approach has the best-detection accuracy (98.98%) and training stability. Further, to speed up the inference of MULSAM on edge, the hardware accelerator is implemented on FPGA devices using technologies, such as parallelization, modular, pipeline, and fixed-point quantization. Experiments show that our FPGA-based acceleration scheme has a better-energy efficiency than the CPU platform. Even with a certain degree of quantification, the acceleration model for MULSAM still displays a high-detection accuracy of 98.81% and a low latency of 1.88 ms.</description></item><item><title>LIDS: A Lightweight Intrusion Detection System for Controller Area Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891731</link><description>Controller area network (CAN) is widely adopted in automobiles and susceptible to cyber attacks with the development of intelligent connected vehicles. While neural networks have demonstrated high accuracy in detection of such attacks, they consume a large amount of resources, hence unsuitable to be directly used for the automotive domain. In this work, we propose a lightweight intrusion detection system (LIDS) for CAN. It first filters out denial-of-service (DoS) and Fuzzy attacks through list screening, following which, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model is deployed to predict Impersonation attacks. Leveraging this combination, the detection accuracy is kept and the resources required are significantly reduced. LIDS is able to run on small hardware with 520-kB memory and CPU of 240 MHz. Its power consumption is one order of magnitude lower than the existing works, thus an excellent candidate for protection of CAN in automobiles.</description></item><item><title>Online Training and Inference System on Edge FPGA Using Delayed Feedback Reservoir</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10883335</link><description>A delayed feedback reservoir (DFR) is a hardware-friendly reservoir computing system. Implementing DFRs in embedded hardware requires efficient online training. However, two main challenges prevent this: 1) hyperparameter selection, which is typically done by offline grid search, and 2) training of the output linear layer, which is memory-intensive. This article introduces a fast and accurate parameter optimization method for the reservoir layer utilizing backpropagation and gradient descent by adopting a modular DFR model. A truncated backpropagation strategy is proposed to reduce memory consumption associated with the expansion of the recursive structure while maintaining accuracy. The computation time is significantly reduced compared to grid search. In addition, an in-place Ridge regression for the output layer via 1-D Cholesky decomposition is presented, reducing memory usage to be 1/4. These methods enable the realization of an online edge training and inference system of DFR on an FPGA, reducing computation time by about 1/13 and power consumption by about 1/27 compared to software implementation on the same board.</description></item><item><title>HotReRAM: A Performance-Power&#8211;Thermal Simulation Framework for ReRAM-Based Caches</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10907942</link><description>This article proposes a comprehensive thermal modeling and simulation framework, HotReRAM, for resistive RAM (ReRAM)-based caches that is verified against a memristor circuit-level model. The simulation is driven by power traces based on cache accesses for detailed temperature modeling over time. HotReRAM models power at a fine-grain level and generates temperature traces for different cache regions together with detailed analyses of thermal stability, retention time and write latency. Combining HotReRAM with gem5, a full-system simulator, and NVSim, a power simulator, for ReRAM enables temporal and spatial modeling of crucial ReRAM characteristics. This integration allows designers and architects to analyze various cache characteristics within a single cache bank and address thermal-induced issues when designing ReRAM caches. Our simulation results for an 8-MiB ReRAM cache show that the spatial thermal variance can be as high as 7 K for a single cache bank, whereas the temporal thermal variance is more than 40 K. Such temperature variances impact retention time with a standard deviation of 3.9&#8211;10.2 for a set of benchmark applications, where the write latency can increase by up to 14.5%.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Cartesian Genetic Programming-Based Automatic Synthesis Framework for Reversible Quantum-Flux-Parametron Logic Circuits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10907912</link><description>Reversible computing has garnered significant attention as a promising avenue for achieving energy-efficient computing systems, particularly within the realm of quantum computing. The reversible quantum-flux-parametron (RQFP) is the first practical reversible logic gate utilizing adiabatic superconducting devices, with experimental evidence supporting both its logical and physical reversibility. Each RQFP logic gate operates on alternating current (AC) power and features three input ports and three output ports. Notably, each output port is capable of implementing a majority function while driving only a single fan-out. Additionally, the three inputs to each gate must arrive in the same clock phase. These inherent characteristics present substantial challenges in the design of RQFP logic circuits. To address these challenges, this article proposes an automatic synthesis framework for RQFP logic circuit design based on efficient Cartesian genetic programming (CGP). The framework aims to minimize both the number of RQFP logic gates and the number of garbage outputs within the generated RQFP logic circuit. It incorporates the specific characteristics of the RQFP logic circuit by encoding them into the genotype of a CGP individual. It also introduces several point mutation operations to facilitate the generation of new individuals. Furthermore, the framework integrates circuit simulation with formal verification to assess the functional equivalence between the parent and its offspring. Experimental results on RevLib and reversible reciprocal circuit benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</description></item><item><title>A Framework for Near Memory Processing With Computation Offloading and Load Balancing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10887357</link><description>Due to the increasing demand for off-chip data transfers, the traditional Von-Neumann architecture faces challenges with modern data-intensive applications, leading to the memory-wall problem. Near-memory processing (NMP) provides a solution by placing computation units near the main memory, which reduces off-chip data transfers and improves system performance. Under this paradigm, some portions of the application are transferred and executed on the NMP side, known as computation offloading. This article introduces a novel computation offloading approach for NMP-enabled 3-D memory systems, considering several critical factors collectively, including data locality information at the last-level cache and execution time estimation of the offloadable portions, which have not been collectively explored in existing studies. Further, this article proposes two different load-balancing strategies to distribute workloads among the NMP cores in the 3-D memory, thereby improving overall performance further. Extensive experiments using a variety of applications from different application domains demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our approach achieves a maximum speedup of  $2.34\times $  and  $1.91\times $  compared to traditional and state-of-the-art approaches, respectively. The proposed approach also reduces off-chip data transfers by nearly  $5.3\times $  compared to traditional computing architectures. Furthermore, the best-proposed approach reduces energy consumption by 26% (maximum) and 21% (average) compared to various state-of-the-art approaches.</description></item><item><title>Re-Meltrix: A Reconfigurable Processing-in-Memory Architecture Based on RRAM and Function Synthesis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10883646</link><description>The reconfigurable processing-in-memory (PIM) architecture has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its versatility and ability to overcome storage limitations. However, it faces challenges, such as overly complex mapping and routing caused by the fine granularity of basic logic units, and the inclusion of numerous redundant devices to achieve reconfigurability. To address these issues, we have designed a software-hardware co-design reconfigurable PIM architecture called Re-Meltrix. Its hardware architecture uses an resistive random-access memory array as the foundation, combined with well-designed peripheral circuits. Maintaining a controllable area, it integrates logic, storage, ternary content-address memory, and interconnection modes into a unified tile architecture and implements two-level independent interconnection within and between tiles. This approach achieves a single tile logic capacity multiple times that of the most advanced reconfigurable PIM architectures currently available, thereby resolving mapping and routing difficulties at the hardware level. Our proposed function synthesis, combined with the hardware architecture, specifically optimizes two-level interconnection separation and module segmentation, further reducing interconnection complexity and improving tile usage efficiency. Experiments have demonstrated that our architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art Liquid Silicon by 2.00&#8211; $4.31\times $  in performance and reduces power consumption by 29%&#8211;68%. Compared with the previously published Meltrix, the area has decreased by 15%&#8211;35%, with the area and power consumption remaining almost unchanged.</description></item><item><title>SpikeSpec: An On-Chip Learning Neuromorphic Accelerator for Spectrum Sensing With Triplet-Boosting and Hardware Friendly Loss Function</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891704</link><description>Spectrum sensing (SS) is a pivotal function in next-generation (G) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, tasked with detecting and characterizing the occupancy or availability of frequency bands within the radio spectrum. Conventional SS techniques are hindered by challenges, such as hardware complexity and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) wall, leading to suboptimal performance in environments with high-noise levels. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), particularly liquid state machines (LSMs), are highly effective for developing energy-efficient accelerators, as they efficiently capture temporal dependencies in primary user frequency spectrums with a reduced number of trainable parameters. This article introduces an innovative field programmable gate array (FPGA) accelerator based on LSMs, featuring fully integrated on-chip learning capabilities for SS. Our accelerator leverages reward-based spike timing-dependent plasticity (R-STDP) to discern temporal correlations within the related frequency band. Although traditional R-STDP methods face convergence difficulties during on-chip learning, the introduced approach overcomes this challenge with a novel, hardware-efficient loss function. This mechanism which is also hardware friendly, facilitates accelerated convergence with reduction of training period of about 46.67% in SS classification for hardware implementation. Moreover, we implemented a fully asynchronous, low-latency, unsupervised triplet-based spike-time-dependent-plasticity (STDP) learning mechanism in the LSM accelerator reservoir, which improves training accuracy by about 3.88% in high-noise channels while enhancing reconfigurability. Furthermore, we investigated various encoder mechanisms to identify the most efficient encoder architecture for our LSM, leading to an accuracy increase of 6.11%. Our optimized LSM architecture achieved 1.27 times and 2.01 times the LUT and register counts, respectively, compared to the basic fixed-reservoir LSM on the Virtex-707 FPGA.</description></item><item><title>Co-ViSu: Accelerating Video Super-Resolution With Codec Information Reuse</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891735</link><description>High-resolution (HR) videos have gained popularity with the widespread adoption of high-definition displays. Super-resolution (SR) techniques aim to recover HR frames from low-resolution (LR) frames. While deep neural network (DNN)-based SR methods have outperformed traditional techniques in quality, they face performance challenges. FPGA-based SR accelerators have been developed to optimize the performance and power efficiency. However, most of these accelerators process only uncompressed video frames and perform per-frame DNN inference, overlooking the temporal-spatial information inherent in compressed video bitstreams. We propose a novel compressed video SR workflow that includes a codec information reuse algorithm and a dedicated FPGA accelerator named Co-ViSu. Our approach leverages the observation that non-key frames can be reconstructed using codec information and HR key-frames, significantly reducing DNN computations. The Co-ViSu algorithm employs subpixel interpolation to enhance high-frequency details and an MV-aware method to improve SR reconstruction quality. The Co-ViSu hardware integrates decoder, SR, and encoder engines within a parallel pipeline architecture, utilizing codec information reuse to bypass non-key frame decoding, eliminate complex DNN computations, and accelerate encoding processes. Experimental results demonstrate that Co-ViSu achieves performance improvements ranging from  $3.6\times $  to  $9.4\times $  and a  $4.2\times $  gain in energy efficiency with minimal quality loss compared to traditional flow. Additionally, Co-ViSu offers a  $2.1\times $  increase in throughput compared to state-of-the-art solutions.</description></item><item><title>QuantTPM: Efficient Mixed-Precision Quantization Framework for Tractable Probabilistic Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891740</link><description>Tractable probabilistic models (TPMs) can perform reliable probabilistic inference and enhance the reasoning capabilities of edge devices, such as aiding decision-making for autonomous vehicles. To deploy TPMs in edge scenarios with constrained hardware resources and energy, efficient quantization algorithms are necessary. However, the traditional quantization methods for neural networks are not applicable to TPMs due to the irregular model structure and highly varying data distribution. To address the issues, we propose QuantTPM, a mixed-precision quantization framework designed to enhance the energy and resource efficiency of TPM inference. First, we reformulate the irregular model structure into a unified format, as irregular structures are inefficient for hardware implementation. Second, we divide the reformulated model graph into hierarchical levels, so as to assign appropriate quantization bit-widths for different levels with varying precision requirements. Third, we decompose the entire mixed-precision quantization search into several steps with smaller search spaces, so as to reduce the algorithm complexity and save search time. Compared with state-of-the-art works, our mixed-precision quantization framework achieves, on average,  $3.7\times $  weight compression,  $6.0\times $  resource efficiency, and  $4.8\times $  energy consumption, while maintaining competitive accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Optimizing DNN Inference on Multi-accelerator SoCs at Training-Time</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10892247</link><description>The demand for executing deep neural networks (DNNs) with low latency and minimal power consumption at the edge has led to the development of advanced heterogeneous systems-on-chips (SoCs) that incorporate multiple specialized computing units (CUs), such as accelerators. Offloading DNN computations to a specific CU from the available set often exposes accuracy vs efficiency tradeoffs, due to differences in their supported operations (e.g., standard versus depthwise convolution) or data representations (e.g., more/less aggressively quantized). A challenging yet unresolved issue is how to map a DNN onto these multi-CU systems to maximally exploit the parallelization possibilities while taking accuracy into account. To address this problem, we present ODiMO, a hardware-aware tool that efficiently explores fine-grain mapping of DNNs among various on-chip CUs, during the training phase. ODiMO strategically splits individual layers of the neural network and executes them in parallel on the multiple available CUs, aiming to balance the total inference energy consumption or latency with the resulting accuracy, impacted by the unique features of the different hardware units. We test our approach on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, targeting two open-source heterogeneous SoCs, i.e., DIANA and Darkside. We obtain a rich collection of Pareto-optimal networks in the accuracy versus energy or latency space. We show that ODiMO reduces the latency of a DNN executed on the Darkside SoC by up to  $8\times $  at iso-accuracy, compared to manual heuristic mappings. When targeting energy, on the same SoC, ODiMO produced up to  $50.8\times $  more efficient mappings, with minimal accuracy drop  $(\lt 0.3\%)$ .</description></item><item><title>Reconfigurable Radiation-Hardened SRAM Cell Design for Different Radiation Environments</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10879546</link><description>This article proposes a novel and effective 14-transistors (14T) reconfigurable radiation-hardened static-random access-memory cell design under the SMIC 65-nm process, featuring a unique memory reconfigurability architecture with two operation modes, namely the high reliability (HR) mode and the triple-time memory (TTM) mode for meeting different radiation environmental requirements. The proposed HR mode provides strong protection of the memory arrays in harsh radiation environments. Compared with the traditional triple modular redundancy (TMR) structure, the proposed HR mode reduces area overhead by 30%, delay by 37%, and power consumption by 16%. The TTM mode uses the enable (EN) circuit to expand the capacity threefold in less harsh radiation environments, avoiding the area wastage caused by the traditional TMR structure. By implementing the two innovative operation modes, the proposed design overcomes the limitations of the traditional TMR structure, reducing area overhead while retaining the radiation hardening capability. In addition, this article presents a mode-switching mechanism composed of a detection circuit and an EN circuit. The detection circuit can detect errors in the reconfigurable architecture. With the proposed mode-switching mechanism, two operation modes can switch in response to different radiation environments. Besides, to ensure the normal operations of the TTM mode in radiation environments, the proposed 14T cell serves as a bitcell in the memory reconfigurable architecture. Compared with typical existing designs, such as radiation-hardened based design, writability enhanced, and dual interlocked storage cell (DICE) cells, the proposed 14T cell design has better delay, critical charge, and higher hold static noise margin.</description></item><item><title>An Improved Two-Step Attack on Lattice-Based Cryptography: A Case Study of Kyber</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10922732</link><description>After three rounds of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) strict evaluations conducted by NIST, CRYSTALS-Kyber was successfully selected in July 2022 and standardized in August 2024. It becomes urgent to further evaluate Kyber&#8217;s physical security for the upcoming deployment phase. In this brief, we present an improved two-step attack on Kyber to quickly recover the full secret key, s, by using much fewer power traces and less time. In the first step, we use the correlation power analysis (CPA) to obtain a portion of guess values of s with a small number of power traces. The CPA is enhanced by utilizing both Pearson and Kendall&#8217;s rank correlation coefficients and modifying the leakage model to improve the accuracy. In the second step, we adopt the lattice attack to recover s based on the results of CPA. The success rate is largely built up by constructing a trial-and-error method. We deploy the reference implementations of Kyber-512, -768, and -1024 on an ARM Cortex-M4 target board and successfully recover s in approximately  $9\sim 10$  min with at most 15 power traces, using a Xeon Gold 6342-equipped machine for the attack.</description></item></channel></rss>
