The proposed method considers the effect of bus bar inductance, unequal diode junction capacitance, baseplate capacitance, and common mode (CM) choke tied between the heat sink and midpoint of the dc link capacitor on snubber losses and turn-off voltage mismatch across series-connected diodes. In addition, the effect of hard-switched turn-on across complementary SiC mosfets has been considered on snubber loss and dynamic voltage balancing across SiC JBS diodes. The following steps have been used to simplify the RC snubber design: modeling the switching transition across series-connected 10 kV SiC JBS diodes and 10 kV SiC mosfets on two-level clamped inductive switching test setup, modification of snubber capacitor and switching transition model for 3L-NPC topology, using the experimental data, and modification of snubber resistor using experimental data from 3L-NPC setup with CM choke. Key design parameters obtained from the proposed model have been compared with the experimentally obtained data, which validates the accuracy of the model. Experimental results at the 7 kV dc bus show that the designed RC snubber constrains the turn-off voltage mismatch, snubber loss, and turn-on transition time within the specified limit.</description></item><item><title>Demonstration of High Avalanche Capability in 1200&#8201;V-Rated SiC Junction Barrier Schottky Diodes With Record Avalanche Energy Density</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10302375</link><description>In this letter, high-performance 4H-SiC junction barrier Schottky diodes with state-of-art single-pulse avalanche energy density by adopting recessed anode and termination regions structures have been demonstrated.

The proposed system operates in inductive power transfer-electric field communication mode, thus reducing the crosstalk between the power channel and communication channel. This letter proposes a novel communication channel construction method based on the single capacitor coupling principle, which can effectively extend the communication distance without additional mechanisms. The extended communication distance enables precommunication before charging and maintaining communication after completing charging, which is critical for undersea dynamic equipment. The resonant condition and transmission characteristics of the communication channel are analyzed. Two MHz communication bands are constructed to achieve full-duplex communication based on frequency division duplexing. Finally, the proposed undersea SWPDT prototype has a maximum output power of 1.2 kW and can maintain 1-Mb/s full-duplex communication within a range of 50 cm.</description></item><item><title>gEOL: A Gradient-Based End-of-Life Criterion for Power Semiconductor Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10342744</link><description>This letter proposes a gradient-based end-of-life (EOL) criterion for power semiconductor modules under power cycling tests.

Redistributed layers (RDLs) are realized by integrating flexible printed circuit boards (PCBs) onto gallium nitride (GaN) high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) dies to enlarge the electrode area and the clearance between them. GaN HEMTs with RDLs are sandwiched between a multilayer PCB and an active metal brazing (AMB) board. Additionally, components like decoupling capacitors, gate driver, digital isolator, and isolated power supply are integrated into this package. Silver sintering processes are employed to maintain consistent processing temperature for multiple interconnections, addressing reliability concerns associated with conventional multi-temperature gradient soldering methods. Furthermore, sintered silver significantly improves both electrical and thermal performances. Power and thermal managements are decoupled by using a PCB and an AMB substrate, resulting in low parasitic inductances, minimal thermal resistance, and electric field shielding. The experiment-measured power loop inductance is as low as 0.54 nH, and the simulated thermal resistance from GaN die to AMB board bottom is only 0.05 &#176;C/W. A detailed description of manufacturing processes, thermal performance test, and dynamic switching performance with circuit-level simulated verification is provided in this letter.</description></item><item><title>Performance Enhancement of Switched-Capacitor-Based Bridgeless Buck PFC Rectifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10349944</link><description>This letter presents an enhanced hybrid switched-capacitor-based buck power factor correction (HSC-BPFC) rectifier suited for high-efficiency applications. The suggested pulsewidth modulation strategy results in a five-level voltage waveform at its input ac terminals. Therefore, a lower volt-second on the input inductor results in a smaller inductor size and lesser current ripple. In addition, compared to equivalent contemporary design, the reduced switching transitions of all devices within a line-frequency cycle result in reduced power losses. Also, the semiconductor devices and energy storage components incur lesser current stress and have decreased conduction losses. Furthermore, the comparative analysis reveals the enhanced performance of the proposed rectifier. The practicality of the proposed HSC-BPFC rectifier is verified through the experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Effects of Triangular Wave Injection and Current Differential Terms on Multiparameter Identification for PMSM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10356830</link><description>Permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) has been widely used in industry in recent years because of its simple structure, high power density, and high efficiency. Accurate electromagnetic parameters of PMSM are of great significance in many fields, such as control system design, fault diagnosis, and condition monitoring. However, when the motor is in steady-state operation, the traditional identification method will have the issues, such as model accuracy, rank deficient, and the incompletely observable.

In this article, event-based constant on/off-time digital CMC architectures are proposed in a three-level flying-capacitor (3L-FC) boost converter, which offers inherent current loop stability, fast transient performance, and active flying-capacitor voltage balancing with stable periodic behavior using one voltage sample per switching cycle. Furthermore, a unified discrete-time (DT) framework is proposed, which is used to derive accurate DT large- and small-signal models. The model accuracy is verified using SIMPLIS switch simulation, and fast-scale stability boundaries are obtained using the root locus plot of the closed-loop poles. A hybrid design approach is presented using continuous-time and DT small-signal models for a balanced tradeoff between simplicity and accuracy. An adaptive on/off-time approach is adopted to regulate the switching frequency and also to retain high load efficiency. A 100-W 12/48-V 3L-FC boost converter prototype is developed in the laboratory.

Hybrid synchronization control (HSC) is proposed from a new perspective to achieve a higher compatibility, which coalesces the dq-axis voltage loop between the phase-locked loop-synchronized control and PSC. The HSC has the advantages of high flexibility, strong adaptability of grid, and adjusted dynamic characteristics. To better describe the system, considering the implemented rotor speed control and drivetrain model, the linearized small-signal model of the HSC DFIG-WTs is established to reveal the electromechanical dynamic interaction between the strength of grid and drivetrain system. Theoretical analysis shows that two resonant peaks in the system appear, which correspond to the torsional oscillations of the drivetrain and low-frequency oscillations of the electrical system. In addition, an appropriate position is selected to increase the torque damping to fulfill the stability requirements of HSC-DFIG WTs. Finally, the correctness of the theoretical analysis is verified using the hardware-in-the-loop experiment.</description></item><item><title>A Simplified Implementation With Improved Dynamic Performance of PWM Plus Phase-Shift Control for Four-Switch Buck&#8211;Boost Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10325639</link><description>The four-switch buck&#8211;boost converter possesses features that enable both voltage step-up and step-down, and positive output voltage.

A hybrid energy storage system (HESS) helps to suppress dc bus fluctuation due to periodical power demand of PPL within a short time. A common practice is to handle transient and steady power separately with high-power-density and high-energy-density units. This article proposes a novel communication-free pulsed power distribution method for the HESS consisting of battery and supercapacitor (SC) units; the battery unit only provides dc power, while the SC unit provides an ac component of pulsed power. To track the high-frequency ac component, active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is applied to the SC unit. Taking dual-active-bridge converters as the interfaces, a detailed design process is presented. Besides, the frequency-domain model illustrates the mechanism of dc&#8211;ac power distribution, and a comparison with proportional&#8211;integral control shows the advantage of ADRC in fast ac power tracking. With the proposed control strategy, the current surge to the battery unit is significantly reduced and the droop characteristics are unaffected when PPL works. Finally, an HESS testbench supplying 10&#8211;150 Hz 1 kW PPL is built to verify the proposed pulsed power distribution and tracking method.</description></item><item><title>Remote Multinodal Voltage Unbalance Compensation in Islanded AC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10345787</link><description>Microgrids (MGs) are exposed to voltage quality deterioration due to the presence of voltage unbalance. To deal with this problem, existing solutions based on distributed generation (DG) units interfaced by power electronics offer two type of strategies for voltage unbalance compensation depending on whether the compensation is performed at one remote node or at multiple local nodes. The first type is limited to a single node, and the second type is limited to apply at the DG units output (locally). This article presents a multinodal control scheme where DGs can compensate for voltage unbalance at multiple remote nodes of the MG, thus overcoming both state-of-the-art strategies limitations. In particular, negative-sequence voltage is eliminated at as many remote nodes as the number of available DG's. A systematic approach for the multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) nature of the problem is presented covering three aspects. First, a square MIMO control strategy is established and a feasibility test is derived to assess whether the problem can be solved. Second, the cross-coupling interaction between the multiple controllers is minimized by optimally selecting, which DGs will contribute to mitigate the remote unbalances. Third, stability and transient dynamics are analyzed. Laboratory experimental results corroborate the control performance.</description></item><item><title>Seamless Entry Control Strategy for Redundant Modules of High-Frequency Bus Electric Energy Router</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10347522</link><description>With the rapid development of renewable energy, high-frequency bus electric energy router that provides multiple ports for different sources and loads is gaining attention, and the application of redundant modules for electric energy router is necessary to improve the reliability of the system. However, the strong coupling characteristics of the common high-frequency bus structure can cause transient current dc bias and current fluctuation for redundant modules during the entry stage, which may result in overcurrent, device damage, and failed entry of redundant modules. This article proposes a partial module high-frequency current model to analyze the causes of transient current dc bias of redundant modules when entering into normal operation and designs a seamless entry control strategy for redundant modules to eliminate the current dc bias and achieve rapid entry into steady-state operation, which can remove the high-frequency current sampling process to simplify the control system. The feasibility of the proposed control strategy is verified by offline simulation and hardware-in-loop real-time simulation platform.</description></item><item><title>Differentiation-Triggered TVC and Quasi- Zero-Delay Phase Shedding for Joint Transient Enhancement of a Multiphase Voltage Regulator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10356664</link><description>For multiphase voltage regulators (MPVRs) with conventional phase shedding and transient voltage clamping (TVC), transient response is limited by intrinsic clamping error, reduced converter loop feedback and phase shedding delay. To address the issues, this article proposes differentiation-triggered TVC (DTVC) and quasi-zero-delay phase shedding (QZDPS) schemes for joint transient enhancement of the MPVR. To eliminate the intrinsic clamping error, the DTVC scheme adopts a dv/dt circuit to detect output voltage differentiation in advance. Besides, converter load response is accelerated by saturated drive modulation in synchrony with the DTVC current injection. To take full advantage of multiphase current slew rate, the QZDPS is achieved with instant load estimation. Furthermore, to make DTVC compatible with QZDPS, the state transition logics for multiphase drive modulation are established with DTVC transient flags and QZDPS signal. It allows for a joint transient enhancement that pushes the load transient response of the MPVR to the physical boundary. According to experimental results, the proposed scheme improves the transient voltage deviation and response time by 38% and 75%, respectively. Along with the enhanced transient, the transient energy loss is reduced by 66%.</description></item><item><title>Prediction Window Selection in FCS-MPC for Two-Level VSI Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10360290</link><description>Semiconductors in power converters are operated in switched-mode. For a given sampling frequency, a digital controller computes the next actuation according to several objectives. Typically one desires to regulate current or voltage values with minimal error and harmonic distortion. Higher switching frequency of the semiconductor is helpful as the granularity of the problem is improved and the harmonic spectrum is shifted toward high-order harmonics that are easier to filter with passive elements. However, the switching losses increase. Finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) is proven to be an excellent control method with a great ability to maximize harmonic quality in terms of the switching frequency, particularly when the controller is configured to consider long prediction horizons. Nonetheless, in order to avoid computational overruns, the prediction horizon and the sampling frequency cannot be indefinitely increased. In this article, the tradeoff between these two parameters is studied, providing guidelines on FCS-MPC tuning for different configurations.</description></item><item><title>Dual Mode Control Scheme for DAB Based Solid-State Transformer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10361575</link><description>This article proposes a dual mode control (DMC) scheme for a dual active bridge based solid-state transformer.

The conventional harmonic damping method that increases the input conductance of PFC converter becomes less effective, due to the reverse blocking of the front-end diode rectifier in the PFC converter. To tackle this challenge, this article proposes an adaptive harmonic conductance control (AHCC) that can automatically achieve maximum harmonic mitigation for PFC converters at light loads, and no extra sensor is needed. In this approach, the critical value of harmonic conductance, beyond which the harmonic distortion is inversely amplified by the reverse blocking of diode rectifier, is identified first. Then, a method for online detection of the critical harmonic conductance is developed, which ensures the minimum harmonic distortion of PFC converters at light loads. Finally, the effectiveness of the AHCC approach is validated by experimental tests of 0.9 kW boost PFC converter modules under varying loads, distorted grid voltages, and paralleled operations.</description></item><item><title>Design of Double-LCC-Compensated Wireless PMSM System With Variable DC-Link Voltage Considering Efficiency Optimization and Dynamic Improvement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10374275</link><description>This article proposes a novel control strategy considering the efficiency optimization and dynamic improvement for dual-side LCC compensated wireless permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) system with variable dc-link voltage.

However, due to inherent transient and steady-state voltage imbalance issues, such a design imposes challenges, especially at elevated switching frequencies, where increased $dv/dt$ is required. This article proposes a hybrid gate driver for series-connected Silicon Carbide (SiC) mosfets, which consists of a turn-on stage with a traditional voltage source gate driver (VSGD), and a turn-off sequence combining a Current Source Gate Driver (CSGD) and a Voltage Source Gate Driver (VSGD). The proposed hybrid gate driver can actively control the turn-off $dv/dt$ and $di/dt$ of the switch by adjusting the amplitude of the gate current in the Current Source Gate Driver (CSGD) stage, as well as balance the voltages of the serialized switches by adjusting the timing delays in the driver. This adaptability enables switching loss control of the devices. The proposed driver has been experimentally validated for two series-connected SiC mosfets. From experiments, it is shown that a voltage imbalance below 2% can be achieved at direct current (DC)-voltage of ${\text {1.5}} \,{\text {k}}{\text {V}}$ and that switching speeds can be adjusted between 20 and ${\text {70}} \,{\text {k}} {\text {V}}$/&#181;s, while the turn-off switching energy can be reduced by up to 41%.</description></item><item><title>Optimized Pulse Patterns With Bounded Semiconductor Losses</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10330786</link><description>This article proposes the computation of three-level optimized pulse patterns (OPPs) that achieve not only low harmonic load current distortions (load-friendly operation) but also low semiconductor losses (converter-friendly operation). To this end, the conduction and switching losses are modeled as a function of the OPP switching angles and the amplitude and phase of the converter current. By minimizing the current harmonics subject to an inequality constraint on the semiconductor losses, OPPs are derived that achieve minimal current distortions with a guaranteed upper bound on the semiconductor losses, thus ensuring the safe operation of the semiconductor switches within their thermal limits. Detailed numerical results for a medium-voltage system consisting of a neutral-point-clamped converter and an inductive load verify the benefits of this approach.</description></item><item><title>Transformer-Less Hybrid Series Static Compensator and its DC Capacitor Voltage Balance Technique Using Zero-Sequence Voltage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10330687</link><description>The hybrid series converter (HSC) has enhanced the operating modulation-index (MI) range compared to the parallel hybrid converter (PHC). However, the HSC is underutilized when employed for applications such as HVdc. The parallel chain links (PCLs) of the HSC generate rectified voltage of fixed amplitude, whereas the series chain links (SCLs) serve as voltage wave-shaping circuit. The maximum output voltage of the HSC is equal to the PCL rating. Moreover, HSC (and also PHC) demands three single-phase transformers for their operation and consists of series/director switches (DSs) that undergo high voltage and dv/dt stress. This article intends to extract all the advantages inherent with the HSC and utilize it to its maximum ability by restructuring and operating it as a transformer-less hybrid-series static compensator (THSSC). The SCLs of the THSSC act as a voltage-aiding circuit and reduce voltage stress across DSs. In addition, the THSSC has a lower energy storage requirement and requires fewer submodule capacitors and switching devices. During unbalanced grid conditions, capacitor voltages related to different phases of the THSSC tend to divert from reference. The required quantity of zero-sequence voltage (ZSV) is injected into the PCL and SCL of all three phases to govern capacitor voltages. The expression for reference ZSV is derived by using the feed-back and feed-forward methods. The converter's working principle and capacitor voltage control technique are authenticated using experimental results obtained under different grid voltage conditions.</description></item><item><title>Model and Control of a Current-Fed Dual Active Bridge Based Ultrawide-Voltage-Range Auxiliary Power Module for 400 V/800 V Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10334052</link><description>As the counterparts of alternators, the auxiliary power modules (APMs) in electric vehicles (EVs) play an irreplaceable role in bridging the high-voltage (HV) propulsion system with the low-voltage (LV) auxiliary system. With the increasing demands of fast charging, the HV propulsion system is seeing an evolution from the 400 to the 800 V system. Adapting to such trends, the APM faces the challenge of a much wider input voltage range, particularly in EVs with a reconfigurable battery pack. This article proposed a reconfigurable current-fed dual active bridge (CFDAB) based converter. It accepts a record-wide input voltage from 180 to 900 V and an output voltage from 6 to 16 V. The closed-form solutions of switching current are with consideration of coupled inductor current, the key characteristics of CFDAB, and simple control to secure zero-voltage switching and minimize the switching current. Design implementation is also discussed in this article. A 3-kW prototype with a peak efficiency of 97% was built and tested. The experimental results proved the feasibility of using the proposed topology and control for the ultrawide APM applications.</description></item><item><title>A Double PS-PWM Strategy for Improving Total Output Current Quality in Parallel Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10336725</link><description>This article proposes a double phase shifted pulsewidth modulation (PWM) strategy to improve the quality of total output current in multiple parallel converters for the photovoltaic application with the advantage of being easy to implement/extend. Different from phase shifted PWM (PS-PWM), the additional modified angles are deduced and added in the initial phase shifted angles of carriers. The better total output current with lower total harmonic distortion can be achieved by modifying the phase shifted angles of carriers in each converter twice. The harmonic spectrum analysis shows that the proposed method could provide superior total output line voltage and total output current quality than conventional PS-PWM. The correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified by the experiments in parallel three-phase two-level and three-level converters.</description></item><item><title>Modulation-Enhanced Nearest-Level Quantization for a Wide Output Bandwidth</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10336557</link><description>Multilevel converters have enabled various applications that are not possible with conventional two-level converters. Many of these applications, however, need a high output bandwidth, often approaching the switching rate limit of the transistors, with high quality, e.g., to actively stabilize and dampen a dc grid or specifically excite certain molecules or neural circuits in medical applications. A high bandwidth approaching the switching rate challenges existing modulation methods: carrier-based switching modulation is fine at low frequencies but experiences interaction between the carrier and the signal at the upper end of the spectrum; fundamental-frequency switching, such as nearest-level modulation, perform well at high frequencies but cause intolerable distortion for low-frequency contents. We propose a hybrid modulation concept that can combine any methods from these two classes. It passes the error of a fundamental frequency method through a filtered switching modulator to combine the high output quality of the latter with the high bandwidth of the former. We optimize the filter to avoid under-modulation of the signal with the carrier of the modulator and to achieve the minimum overall distortion throughout a wide output bandwidth. We demonstrate the performance experimentally with a cascaded-bridge converter and compare it with the best prior arts. This technique ensures a usable output bandwidth up to 100% of the switching rate and maintains a total distortion level below 3%.</description></item><item><title>Unidirectional Hybrid Multilevel Rectifier Family for MV/HV Applications: Analysis and Comparative Evaluation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10336537</link><description>Medium voltage (MV) and high voltage (HV) rectifiers demonstrate lower cost and volume as well as reversal power protection compared to the bidirectional counterparts in the unidirectional ac/dc applications, such as HVdc transmission, MVdc shipboard system, subsea oil and gas production power systems, etc. Traditional modular multilevel converter (MMC) is good candidate, but suffers from large number of submodules (SMs) and capacitor size. Recently, the hybrid multilevel rectifiers (HMRs) consisting of the HV diode and MMC structure have evolved and gained significant interests. The HV diode could replace some SMs in MMC, implying improved power density and efficiency. In this article, three typical HMR topologies are selected, and each of them uses a different configuration and offers unique advantages. Therefore, this article illustrates the operation principles, and gives the comparative performance evaluation of these HMRs based on key metrics such as device number, capacitor energy storage requirement, and semiconductor losses. In this way, the favorable working conditions of these HMRs could be identified, and the most suitable applications for each configuration could be suggested. The simulation as well as the experimental results are provided to validate these HMRs. Overall, the presented analysis can provide a point of reference and a useful framework for the future developments of HMRs.</description></item><item><title>Switching Optimized Modulation for Direct Three-Level Matrix Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10347536</link><description>A direct three-level matrix converter (DTMC) has much lower switching frequency harmonic content than a conventional matrix converter (MC). Existing literature for controlling the former relies on the indirect approach of mathematically decomposing the converter into a two-level front-end converter and a three-level neutral-point-clamped inverter. The switching sequence for these two converters is independently synthesized before merging them to get the switching sequence for the DTMC. This decomposition obfuscates the redundancies in the switching vector duty cycle equations that govern this converter. The indirect approach produces significantly higher switching losses in the DTMC than the conventional MC despite having additional voltage levels, as demonstrated in this article. A new switching-loss optimized modulation strategy is proposed to overcome this limitation. The proposed method does not rely on mathematically decomposing the converter, thus being able to exploit the redundancies in the duty cycle equations. The proposed strategy leads to much lower switching loss than a conventional MC while retaining the benefit of lower harmonic content.

In this article, an Si/wide-bandgap (WBG) coupled half-bridge (CHB) is proposed, which coordinates the hybrid-frequency interleaved Si and WBG phase operation by a coupled inductor. By optimal configuring the coupling coefficient, the un-compensable, and low-frequency fluctuations of power quality issues can be completely addressed. Meanwhile, the HFIO controller is redesigned from the perspective of the modulated model predictive control, and the implementation can be greatly simplified under the selected optimal coefficient. A 3.3 kW Si insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT)/SiC mosfet CHB totem-pole bridgeless PFC (TPBPFC) prototype is built as a case study to validate the proposed design concept. In comparison to conventional Si/SiC HHB TPBPFC, the proposed Si/SiC CHB TPBPFC can achieve a maximum 64.7% total harmonic distortion (THD) reduction, demonstrating the same low ripple and THD performance as full high-frequency two-phase all-SiC design in all operating ranges while with 16.7% cost reduction.</description></item><item><title>A Multilevel-DC-Link Converter With Single-Device Modules in Series for VSC-HVDC Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10366859</link><description>Voltage-source-converter-based high-voltage dc transmission (VSC-HVdc) is widely applied in the fields such as offshore wind power transmission, and modular multilevel converter (MMC) is a common converter for it. The large capacitors and numerous devices in MMC limit its technical economics. In comparison, the multilevel dc-link converter with single-device-modules in series (abbreviated as MDC) proposed in this article may have advantages in terms of volume, as well as the potential in cost and efficiency. The single-device modules (SDM) solve the problems on both voltage sharing and floating supply. The current model of MDC is analyzed, and the commutating process in MDC is discussed in detail. The SDMs perfectly match with the characteristics of the quasi-soft switch in MDC, maintaining energy balance during operation without overvoltage or undervoltage. Finally, a high-power MDC prototype of 6.2 MVA is innovatively implemented and comprehensively tested to verify the theoretical commutation analysis and feasibility of the proposal. The research is helpful for promoting the application of MDC in VSC-HVdc, thus further improve the competitiveness of VSC-HVdc.</description></item><item><title>Characteristic-Based Design of an LCC Resonant Converter With a Capacitive Filter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10366831</link><description>The LCC resonant converter with a capacitive output filter is a popular topology for variable load applications, although the simultaneous design requirements of wide load range, soft switching, and low conduction loss are not clearly tackled in available design strategies. In this article, the existing time-domain analysis of the converter is extended in a normalized design-oriented fashion. The proposed extension to boundary modes lends itself to the derivation of critical converter characteristics such as the soft switching range. A dimensionless converter and load characteristic-based design algorithm with parameter decoupling is developed to meet the load requirements. The design algorithm reduces the converter rms current while meeting practical requirements of zero-voltage switching and constraints on switching frequency across the load range. The proposed design method is validated using circuit simulations incorporating series dissipative nonidealities and the transformer magnetizing inductance, and also on a 160-W laboratory prototype with switching frequency within the designated limits and $&gt;96\%$ experimental efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Automatic Impedance Matching With Dual Time-Scale P&amp;O in Fully Self-Powered Electromagnetic Vibration Energy Harvesting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10295564</link><description>Most of electromagnetic vibration energy harvester (EVEH) systems are only focused on resistance matching at resonant frequency. However, the EVEH will have complex output impedance at nonresonant frequencies. Pure resistance matching cannot fully extract the maximum power at nonresonance. This article is the first to propose an automatic and fully self-powered complex impedance matching EVEH system. The characteristics of the output impedance of the EVEH are analyzed, and it is found that the impedance will be distributed on a circle. An impedance-circle-based perturb-and-observe (P&amp;amp;O) method with dual time-scale is proposed. It perturbs the central angle with a short time-scale for fast response to vibration frequency change, and perturbs both angle and diameter with a long time scale to adapt to the slow aging and wear-out of the EVEH. Such dual time-scale P&amp;amp;O improves the speed and accuracy of complex impedance determination. Besides, a fully self-powered milliwatts impedance control scheme with an inductor-less H-bridge ac&#8211;dc converter is designed. Experiments show that the designed system can realize complex impedance matching control stably and quickly. The maximum improvement of the output power of the converter reaches 25% compared to resistance matching scheme at nonresonant frequencies. Under the excitation acceleration amplitude of 3 m/s2 at the resonant frequency, the system generates the maximum power of 10.11 mW with the overall system efficiency reaching 82.2%. It is the first time the automatic complex impedance matching is realized in millipower fully self-powered EVEH.</description></item><item><title>Mini-LEGO CPU Voltage Regulator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10329461</link><description>This article presents the design and optimization of a miniaturized 48-V-to-1-V, 240-A linear-extendable group operated point-of-load (LEGO-PoL) CPU voltage regulator module (VRM)&#8212;Mini-LEGO&#8212;with a volume of 30 mm&#215;11.2 mm &#215; 8.4 mm.

To allow ripple minimization under asymmetric conditions, phase shifts between the switch timings of phases have to be appropriately adjusted. This study presents a method based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) that can provide the required phase shifts to minimize ripple under asymmetric conditions. To obtain a machine learning dataset, the set of optimal phase-shift angles minimizing the common output capacitor current ripple is analytically obtained for two asymmetric interleaved boost converters. Then, a small-scale computationally efficient ANN is developed using the dataset to predict the optimal phase shift according to real-time operating conditions. The proposed method is experimentally validated. The proposed method predicts the optimal phase-shift angle in 28.4 $\mu \text{s}$ and the prediction is updated every 100 $\mu \text{s}$ to achieve ripple minimization.</description></item><item><title>Current Sharing Analysis of Three-Phase Interleaved LLC and Optimization Method to Reduce the Influence of Stray Inductance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10354528</link><description>Three-phase interleaved LLC is widely used because it can increase power capacity and reduce output current ripple. However, this article found that the three-phase interleaved LLC with all the resonant components using the delta connection (full-&#916; type) has poor current-sharing characteristics. This article establishes the current sharing analysis model of three-phase interleaved LLC, explains the reasons for its poor current sharing effect, and proposes that changing the resonant capacitor to Y-type (&#916;-Cr-Y type) can improve the current sharing effect. Further, to reduce the influence of stray inductance asymmetry on the current sharing, taking the &#916;-Cr-Y type as an example, this article deduces the equivalent circuit model including stray inductance and proposes a current sharing optimization method without additional components. The proposed method can obtain the stray inductance of the three-phase resonant tank. Based on the stray inductance, the resonant inductance can be adjusted to obtain a better current-sharing effect. Finally, the proposed model and optimization method are verified by simulation and experiments. Compared with the full-&#916; type, the proposed &#916;-Cr-Y type shows higher current balance performance, and the proposed optimization method can further reduce the line current unbalance factor by more than 85%, and the phase current unbalance factor by more than 60%.</description></item><item><title>Multifrequency Single-Stage Hybrid Switched-Capacitor Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10356855</link><description>The hybrid switched-capacitor converter (SSC) has unique advantages in the application of high-fixed-ratio dc&#8211;dc conversion. To meet the requirements of the load or input fluctuation range, the fixed-ratio hybrid SSC needs to build a two-stage structure with the traditional dc&#8211;dc converter. This article presents a multifrequency single-stage hybrid SSC with a modular design. The conventional resonant switched-capacitor circuit and buck circuit are modularly improved; different modules can operate at different frequencies. Modules with different operating frequencies are combined by means of the switched-capacitor structure. By increasing the switching frequency of the mixed switched-capacitor part in the prototype, the volume and weight of the passive components are significantly reduced, and the power density is improved. In addition, the frequency of the hard switching part is kept lower, reducing the switching loss of the inverter and improving the system efficiency. An experimental prototype consisting of two modules with a step-down ratio of 3&#8211;7 is constructed. The peak efficiency of the prototype reaches 96.79% at 48-V input.</description></item><item><title>A Bandwidth-Boosted Hybrid LDO With Spike-To-Time Converter for Near-Threshold Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10374258</link><description>A fully integrated output-capacitorless hybrid low-dropout regulator (HLDO) with enhanced transient response and tight regulation, able to operate at ultralow supply, is proposed in this article. The proposed HLDO contains a dual-control-loop structure to separate the proportional and derivative controls. A spike-to-time converter is used in the derivative control loop to convert the output transient spikes into digital signals and then activates the digital control loop to adjust the output current rapidly to speed up the recovery of output. In the proportional control loop, an analog controller based on the ring-amplifier structure with the proposed compensation scheme utilizes a hybrid algorithm to achieve a rippleless output. The proposed HLDO is fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process with a regular threshold voltage of about 0.45 V. The chip area is 0.0302 mm2. The total on-chip capacitance is 4.4 pF. The minimum supply voltage is as low as 0.5 V with a minimum dropout voltage of 20 mV. At 1-V supply, the measured undershoot at the output is 142 mV and its settling time is 17 ns when the output current increases from 100 &#956;A to 300 mA in 5 ns. The figure-of-merit is 2.05 fs.</description></item><item><title>Enhanced-Magnetizing-Impedance Coreless Transformer With Virtual Magnetic Permeability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10342791</link><description>The main difference between coreless transformer (CLT) and conventional ferrite-core transformer is the magnitude of the magnetizing impedance. This article proposes a CLT with virtual magnetic permeability (CLTVMP). The CLT is based on a novel overall-resonance principle of a series of intermediate coils to maximize the magnetizing impedance, which is different from the existing multicoil resonance principle. The generalized overall-resonance condition is first proposed. Due to the addition of the intermediate resonant coils, the magnetizing impedance is effectively increased. It is like that magnetic permeability virtually exists in the coupling magnetic field. The introduced virtual magnetic permeability concept is very suitable for characterizing the proposed CLT and beneficial to evaluate the performance of the intermediate resonant coils in restoring ferrite core case. And the virtual magnetic permeability formula is derived and presented. Furthermore, the conventional equivalent circuit for multiwinding transformer is not suitable and accurate in the coreless case, thus the precise equivalent circuit model and equivalent transformation ratio for the CLTVMP are theoretically derived by a new method. The loss model is also provided. Additionally, a 500 W, 101.9 kHz experimental prototype is constructed to validate the theory and the implementation in a 500 W resonant converter is provided.</description></item><item><title>Permeability-Adjustable Nanocrystalline Flake Ribbon in Customized High-Frequency Magnetic Components</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10364869</link><description>Fe-based nanocrystalline ribbon is an alternative to the ferrite for high-frequency magnetic cores due to its low hysteresis loss and high magnetic saturation. The drawback of the Fe-based nanocrystalline ribbon is its high conductivity. Crushing the homogenous ribbon to restructure a nanocrystalline flake ribbon (NFR) can reduce the conductivity while maintaining other superior magnetic properties of the noncrushed nanocrystalline ribbon. So far, several previous works have proven that the NFR can replace the ferrite in the dual active bridge and wireless power transfer system. However, seldom of these works mention the detailed mechanism of the NFR. In this article, the structure and manufacturing process of the NFR are introduced. The effect of the relative permeability and the crushing pattern on the magnetic properties of NFR has been quantitatively reported. A dual-permeability core formed by two types of NFR has been demonstrated for an inductor. Comparison has been made to inductors using the ferrite core (N27, N87, DMR44) in a similar size. Experiment results show that the dual-permeability NFR core has a lower core loss and higher magnetic saturation than the ferrite counterparts at frequencies from 100 to 300 kHz.</description></item><item><title>Computationally Efficient Cascaded Predictive Control for Hybrid-Inverter Fed Open-Winding PMSM Drive With Fast Partial Preselection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10345694</link><description>In this article, a computationally efficient cascaded model predictive control (CMPC) is put forward for the hybrid-inverter fed open-winding permanent magnet synchronous motor (OW-PMSM) drive, which significantly reduces the computational burden and eliminates the weighting factors. The hybrid-inverter consists of a main inverter (MI) and a compensatory inverter (CI), which are respectively powered by a voltage source and a floating capacitor. Hence, an additional weighting factor is required to tradeoff the control of OW-PMSM and the floating capacitor. To avoid the tedious tuning work, a cascaded two-stage structure is designed to coordinate the multiobjective control. However, the weighting factor is eliminated at the cost of the increased number of evaluations. To this end, a fast partial preselection strategy is proposed, which evaluates only the voltage vectors (VVs) of CI in the first stage and then evaluates the VV combinations of both MI and CI in the second stage. With the proposed scheme, the number of VV combinations to be evaluated is decreased from 64 to 32, where the total computational burden is lowered by 48%. Finally, experiments are carried out on a 500 W OW-PMSM drive to prove the effectiveness of the proposed CMPC.</description></item><item><title>Extending the Operation Range of Electric Spring With Dual Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10347465</link><description>As an emerging technology for power demand side management, electric spring (ES) is used to improve the power quality of the grid containing a high proportion of renewable energy sources (RES). Most of the existing ESs are connected in series with noncritical loads (NCL) to form smart loads, whose power consumption can follow the variation of RES power generation automatically. However, the structure of the direct series connection between ES and NCL limits the operating range of ES. In order to solve this problem, an improved ES topology based on dual inverters, called DI-ES, is proposed. The structure of the dual inverters allows DI-ES to have two output ports, one of which is connected in series with NCL for reactive power compensation and the other output port is connected in parallel with the NCL for active power compensation. DI-ES changes the traditional structure of ES in series with NCL, and improves the power compensation capability and flexibility of ES. In this work, the topology, operating principle, and control method of DI-ES are introduced in detail. The effectiveness of DI-ES has been verified by simulation and experiment results.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Model of AC&#8211;AC Dual Active Bridge Converter Using the Extended Generalized Average Modeling Framework</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10368368</link><description>The ac&#8211;ac dual active bridge (DAB) converter is an advanced bidirectional two-port grid interface converter that facilitates active and reactive power flow control between two grids without a dc-link capacitor. This article presents a novel modeling approach for the ac&#8211;ac DAB converter using the extended generalized average modeling (EGAM) technique. Unlike the conventional generalized average modeling (GAM) framework, the ac&#8211;ac DAB converter's dynamic state variables, including the leakage inductor current and ac grid side LC filters, exhibit grid and switching frequency components, making the standard GAM framework unsuitable for dynamic modeling involving two distinct excitation frequencies. Furthermore, the 2-D GAM (2D-GAM) framework, although capable of capturing the dynamics of two frequencies and their cross interactions, fails to handle product terms involving double fourier series (DFS) states resulting from the switching terms in the ac-ac DAB converter. To address these challenges, the EGAM technique is proposed, which involves transforming the DFS product terms in the time domain into the 2D-convolution of their discrete fourier images (DFI) in the frequency domain. As a consequence of this analysis, it is shown that in an ac&#8211;ac DAB converter, the power is transferred in the grid-switching sideband frequency components at the bridge level. The effectiveness of the EGAM modeling framework is demonstrated through extensive simulation and hardware experiments, and the results are compared with PLECS results, validating the accuracy and efficacy of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>An Accurate and Intelligent Approach to Predicting the Power Device Fatigue Failure Process</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10342764</link><description>It is significant to study power device package fatigue failure as it seriously affects the reliability of power systems. Nevertheless, the research of the power device failure process is insufficient. In this article, an accurate and intelligent approach is proposed to predict the power device fatigue failure process with multiple fatigue sampling method (MFSM) and minimal component unit method (MCUM). The MFSM is proposed to accurately build the power device lifetime model. It is accomplished through the multiple sampling fatigue morphology evolution process of solder layers combined with the fatigue parameter. Morphology evolution is detected by scanning acoustic microscope technology under an accelerated lifetime test. The fatigue parameter is obtained through finite-element analysis (FEA) by establishing each sampling geometry model. Then, the lifetime model is determined by their same failure area fraction (Fs). In particular, digital image processing is applied to describe solder layer shapes in detail, which is also the key to building a real FEA geometry model. The MCUM is utilized to complete the prediction of failure process, where solder layers are divided into minimal units and the FEA solution and location information of each unit are known. Based on the lifetime model, the failure area can be determined and the fatigue failure process can be finished intelligently by cosimulation. The proposed method is accurate and intelligent enough in predicting the failure of solder layers, which is more helpful for planned device management.</description></item><item><title>Short-Circuit Protection for SiC MOSFET Based on PCB-Type Rogowski Current Sensor: Design Guidelines, Practical Solutions, and Performance Validation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10345734</link><description>In this article, a robust short-circuit (SC) protection circuit using Rogowski current sensor (RCS) for SiC mosfet-based power conversion systems is proposed, along with the detailed theoretical design guidelines of the proposed RCS.

However, there is a potential risk of overlooking the ineffectiveness of the fault location under light load conditions. This article presents an analytical model that reveals the fault phenomena and mechanisms specific to light load scenarios. A crucial finding is the strong coupling among faulty arm current, voltage deviations between faulty and healthy submodules, and load conditions. Ignoring this effect can result in underperformance of the fault location, such as seriously delayed detection or missing detection. To address this issue, a current-reshaping-based solution is proposed to ensure optimal fault location performance across the full power range. The effectiveness of the proposed analysis and method is validated through simulations and a downscale experimental platform.</description></item><item><title>A Cascaded Multilevel Modular Energy Router Hybrid Photovoltaic and Energy Storage With Improved Power Balance Capability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10297551</link><description>Cascaded H-bridge (CHB) converter has become an attractive topology for future large-scale photovoltaic (PV) plants in medium-voltage microgrids. However, the unequal irradiation and aging degree of PV arrays will lead to imbalanced and inconsistent output power between the three phases. This article presents a novel approach to integrating PV and energy storage (ES) systems inherent in microgrids, utilizing a hybrid CHB-based energy router (HCHB-ER), which is configured with a limited number of submodules to connect with the centralized ES. The proposed topology can handle serious interphase power imbalance and respond to grid-side power scheduling, without the appearance of overmodulation and common-mode voltage rise caused by traditional zero-sequence voltage injection methods. Under the three major constraints from the modulation level, the centralized energy storage maximum intrapower regulation boundary and submodule configuration ratio are analyzed in detail. Additionally, the power imbalance regulation capability of the proposed HCHB-ER across various configuration ratios is thoroughly evaluated and compared with the zero-sequence injection methods. Finally, the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed strategy are verified by simulations and experiments.</description></item><item><title>Hardware-Based Modulation Strategy to Suppress the Leakage Current for Transformerless Odd-Module Cascaded H-Bridge Inverter in PV System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10328388</link><description>Transformerless cascaded H-bridge (CHB) grid-connected inverters are widely used in engineering due to its advantages in volume, cost, and efficiency. However, the lack of electrical isolation results in a leakage current loop between the system and earth, creating additional electromagnetic interference and safety issues First, the CHB model with parasitic capacitance is established, and proved that the leakage current of odd-module CHB (OM-CHB) cannot be suppressed solely by modulation. Then, a new hardware-based pulsewidth modulation (HB-PWM) strategy is proposed to suppress the leakage current of OM-CHB. In the proposed strategy, two new redundant states are created by adding two power switches in the intermediate module. These extra switching states are applied to the HB-PWM strategy, which can eliminate the high-frequency component of the sum of parasitic capacitive voltage (SPCV), thus, suppress the leakage current, and available generalizes to CHB with arbitrary odd-module. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a MATLAB/Simulink simulation model and an experimental prototype with a rated power of 550 W. The experimental results show that the SPCV of the proposed method does not contain high-frequency components, and the value of the leakage current meets the standard of VDE 0126-1-1.</description></item><item><title>A Communication-Less Secondary Control Method for Parallel Grid-Forming Inverters in Islanded Microgrids Based on Mode Switching</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10342714</link><description>The grid-forming inverters based on droop control show greatly vitality in microgrid applications owing to their excellent power sharing and frequency supporting ability. However, to obtain good power sharing dynamics required by the grid code, the droop control will introduce inevitable frequency and voltage deviations. Thus, an additional secondary control is indispensable to cancel these deviations so that the power quality requirement can be satisfied. In this article, a mode switching based communication-less secondary control method is proposed for islanded microgrids. In this method, after being triggered by obvious frequency or voltage deviations, the secondary control switches to the first operating mode and uses proportional regulator to maintain power sharing among grid-forming inverters. Subsequently, the secondary control switches to the other two modes in turn and adjusts droop offsets to dissolve the frequency and amplitude deviations of point-of-common-coupling voltage. The mode switching is controlled by preset timer so that no communication is required. Compared to the traditional methods, the proposed method can greatly improve the frequency and voltage regulation accuracy and avoid the accurate power sharing performance of droop control being deteriorated by the accumulated integral error. Meanwhile, the influence of the trigger delay can also be obviated. Hardware experiments are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Sequential SISO Stability Analysis Model for Grid-Connected Converters by Considering the Impact of Power Flow Direction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10360226</link><description>For grid-connected converters operating under nonunity power factor, their $dq$ admittances become off-diagonal due to emerging of the coupling admittances. Consequently, the grid-connected converter systems become multi-input multioutput (MIMO) systems whose stability analysis becomes challenging. To avoid the multivariable nature for system stability analysis, by considering the impact of power flow direction and converter admittance characteristics, this article formulates a sequential single-input single-output (SISO) stability analysis model for grid-connected converter systems. Compared with the existing SISO models, the proposed one offers salient features as follows. 1) Different power flow directions correspond to different stability analysis sequences and system minor-loop gains. 2) It possesses a more clear physical meaning and explicitly identifies the contributions of different parts, including the $d$-axis subsystem, the coupling of the $d$-axis subsystem with the $q$-axis subsystem, and the $q$-axis subsystem to the system stability. 3) The proposed system minor-loop gain never contains any RHP pole and therefore, the system stability analysis and oscillation mechanism illustration are greatly simplified. Furthermore, the classical control theory can be introduced to guide the system analysis and design. Simulation results are presented to validate the accuracy of the proposed sequential SISO model.</description></item><item><title>An Impedance-Source-Based Soft-Switched High Step-Up DC&#8211;DC Converter With an Active Clamp</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10366868</link><description>This article proposes a high step-up dc&#8211;dc converter based on a trans-inverse impedance-source structure, in which the voltage gain of the converter is increased by using a lower number of turns ratio of the coupled inductors (CI) windings. The proposed converter achieves a very high voltage gain and a very low voltage stress on the switches. An active clamp is incorporated into the topology of the proposed converter, helping to absorb the energy of the leakage inductances of the CI, and to recycle that energy to the output of the converter to further increase the voltage gain. Furthermore, the active clamp is used to realize soft turn on for the main switch of the converter. Additionally, the clamp switch also turns on under zero voltage switching condition. Apart from the soft turn on of the switches of the proposed converter, the diodes of the converter also turn off with a minimized reverse recovery power loss because of the controlled current falling rate of these diodes with the leakage inductance of the CI. The operation principle, steady-state analysis, and comparison are presented in this article. Also, the analysis is verified using a 200 W, and 20 V to 400 V experimental setup.</description></item><item><title>State of the Art on Power Conditioning for Piezoelectric Energy Harvesters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10368345</link><description>In recent years, interface circuits of piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) for power conditioning have been significantly advancing.

However, the low-load inefficiency of alkaline water electrolyzers (AWEs) results in a narrow operating range (usually 40%&#8211;100% of rated power), which makes AWEs hardly follow the fluctuating photovoltaic (PV) power over a wide range. Focusing on this issue, this article proposes a multimode self-optimization electrolysis converting (MMSOEC) strategy and its prototype converter to enhance the efficiency of AWEs. Through the proper combination of dc power and pulse power, the proposed MMSOEC technique can reshape the excitation electric field of AWEs; in this way, the performance of AWEs is greatly enhanced. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is verified through a commercial AWE directly driven by PV arrays. Experimental results show that the efficiency enhancement can be up to 15.4% under the low-load condition as compared to the conventional pure dc power supply.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Rectifier-Less Synchronous Electric Charge Extraction and Inversion Interface Circuit for PE Energy Harvesters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10373931</link><description>A novel rectifier-less synchronous electric charge extraction and inversion (ReL-SECEI) interface circuit for Piezoelectric energy harvesters is proposed in this article.

The independent control of multiple coils usually needs the multiple inverters or additional switches, which increases the size and component count of the WPT system. In this article, a WPT system with novel TX coil driving circuit is proposed for high misalignment tolerance and low component count. The proposed circuit allows a single inverter with only two switches to control the magnetic field of two TX coils independently, which helps achieve the low component count and compact size. In the propose WPT system, two decoupling square coils are adopted as the bipolar transmitter and each of the coil is driven by one switch. When the receiving coil is misaligned, the two coils of the transmitter can distribute the output power according to the different positions of the receiving coil by the proposed driving circuit, thus ensuring a fixed total output voltage, namely high misalignment tolerance. Moreover, the detailed theoretical analysis and design approach are given in this article and the proposed circuit is compared with the existing approaches.

The full-bridge active rectifier can eliminate extra dc&#8211;dc converters for output regulation with less voltage stress than resonant rectifiers, such as Class E, &#934; rectifiers. However, the lack of the synchronous phase control method is the core challenge for full-bridge active rectifier in 6.78-MHz WPTSs. Meanwhile, the increasing switching losses and reverse conduction losses of the gallium nitride high electron mobility transistors are the main constraints on the efficiency of the system. This article proposes an adaptive synchronous driving phase control (ASDPC) method of the GaN-based full-bridge rectifiers in 6.78-MHz WPTS. With the proposed method, the full-bridge rectifier can obtain the maximum output power in the critical zero voltage switching operation over a wide load range. A 50-W 6.78-MHz WPTS is built to verify the effectiveness and stability of the proposed ASDPC method. The dc&#8211;dc efficiency is improved in the wide load range of 8&#8211;50 &#937; (11.8&#8211;54.57 W) and reaches 87.18% at Po = 44.9 W. Compared to the system without ASDPC, the efficiency can be improved by 5.2% at light load and 3.1% at heavy load.</description></item><item><title>A High-Interoperability Optimal Frequency Control Method for the AGV Dynamic Wireless Charging Systems Without Communication</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10328460</link><description>In this article, a communication-free optimal frequency control method for the dynamic wireless charging system of automated guided vehicle with high interoperability is proposed.

Combined with the topology structure switching strategy of nodes, the power transfer direction can be flexibly adjusted according to the position of load nodes. On this basis, the power transfer routes are optimized for the goal of maximum efficiency. And the breadth-first search algorithm is adopted to optimize the power transfer routes based on its fast search speed.

In this article, harmonic current suppression strategies based on improved carrier phase-shifted (CPS) PWM and the extended state observer (ESO) are proposed. Aiming at the minimum total harmonic distortion of the grid-side current, the universal guidelines for the optimal CPS angle with the number of rectifiers are proposed. To suppress the low-order harmonics, multiresonance controllers are introduced into the disturbance estimation loop of the ESO, whose output is used for feed-forward compensation. The effectiveness of the strategies is verified by hardware-in-the-loop simulation and experiments.</description></item><item><title>Series Connected Open-End Winding Generator for Higher Voltage DC Supply</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10163973</link><description>High-voltage dc is popular for transmission of large volume of power over long distances due to several advantages. Medium voltage dc transmission are becoming de facto standard in offshore wind generation and in similar cases where long cable lengths are required for transmitting power from the source to the usable destination. Several schemes have been proposed for generating the high dc bus voltage from the lower voltage ac generators at the offshore platform. However, size, weight, and maintenance are the major deciding factors. This article proposes a scheme of generating suitable dc voltage from a lower voltage synchronous generator without using transformers or boost converters. It uses an open end winding permanent magnet synchronous generator. The voltage outputs from each winding are converted to boosted dc by individual 1-phase pulsewidth modulation converters, whose dc bus are connected in series to convert to a higher dc bus voltage. This permits conversion to much higher voltage dc employing semiconductor switches of lower voltage rating. Simulation and experimental verification are presented to validate the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>A Zero-Sequence Component Injection PWM Scheme for Three-Level Neutral Point Clamped Rectifiers With Unbalanced DC-Link Voltages</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10185997</link><description>This article investigates the operating characteristics of three-level neutral-point-clamped rectifiers with unbalanced dc-link voltages.

However, one big challenge is the mismatch of overvoltage withstand capability of electromagnetic transformer and converters in the HTs. The limited overvoltage capacity of the converter limits the overall performance of the HT in overvoltage events in the power grid. To address this issue, a novel voltage-clamped submodule (VCS) scheme is proposed for enhancing overvoltage withstand capability of high-voltage HT. The voltage-clamped circuit, which consists of a gap and a metal oxide varistor, ensures the safe operation of the VCS without the risks of breakdown during overvoltage period. Thus, this scheme allows the high-voltage HT to take advantage of the surge resistance of electromagnetic transformers and keep the enhanced controllability normally during transient surges. An experimental platform was built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed VCS, and simulation results demonstrated the usefulness of the high voltage HT with proposed scheme in power delivery systems subjected to different transient surges.</description></item><item><title>A High-Order Harmonic Compound Rotor Based Brushless Dual-Electrical-Port Dual-Mechanical-Port Machine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10195929</link><description>The brushless dual-electrical-port dual-mech- anical-port machine (BLDDM) is increasingly developed as an effective power split device for continuously variable transmission due to its compactness and high control flexibility.

However, the unsuppressed torque ripple of IPMSM will cause declined torque quality, increased vibration, and reduced reliability. This article presents a novel composed T-shaped notching rotor to suppress torque ripple for IPMSM. The mathematical models of cogging torque and winding factors considering T- shaped notches are established, respectively. Although the principle of the novel rotor design is clearly explained by mathematical models, the accurate dimensions of the composed T-shaped notch are difficult to calculate. Therefore, two-dimensional finite element analysis and multiobjective design optimization are employed to calculate the T-shaped notch dimensions. The electromagnetic performance of the proposed rotor machine is compared with that of the commonly notching rotor machine. In addition, the mechanical strength of the novel rotor is verified by calculations of stress and deformation. Finally, the proposed prototype with a novel rotor is fabricated, and extensive experiments are conducted. The results show that the torque ripple of IPMSM can be significantly reduced by the novel composed T-shaped notching rotor.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Highly Efficient Torque-Sharing Algorithm for Dual Stator Winding Induction Machines for Various Speed Regions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10168138</link><description>This article proposes a novel and highly efficient torque-sharing algorithm for dual stator winding induction machines (DSWIMs). This algorithm introduces three modes of operation for DSWIMs based on the command speed and the required load power. Implementing this algorithm makes accurate flux calculation and control possible in very low-speed regions, including zero speed. In higher speed regions, if one of the winding sets is able to supply the required power solely, the other is switched off to augment the overall efficiency. In higher required powers, both winding sets cooperate to supply the load torque, and the required electromagnetic torque division between the two winding sets is fulfilled based on their power ratings. This guarantees overloading avoidance in various operation conditions. Moreover, the optimal flux condition is guaranteed in various speed regions free of the torque sharing. In addition, this algorithm is general and can be implemented in direct torque control and field-oriented control schemes in various reference frames. The proposed algorithm has been experimentally implemented in a 3.3-kW vector-controlled DSWIM drive system. In this flux and speed control system, the flux is controlled such that a search-based maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) algorithm is realized. The proposed MTPA strategy is insensitive to DSWIM parameters and load variations.

The current-source charge pump (CS-CP) PFC converter has the advantages of simple structure, easy control, and low cost, but it can only obtain a high power factor (PF) over a narrow input range. The operation principle of the CS-CP PFC converter and the input voltage range are analyzed in this article. In order to obtain a high PF over a wide input voltage range, in this article, a variable turn ratio CS-CP PFC converter is proposed.

Some of these topologies have two series capacitors at the dc bus with a mid-point connection to the windings. Parameter mismatch due to manufacturing differences will cause voltage unbalance on these capacitors, which can lead to safety and reliability concerns. However, the well-known capacitor balancing strategies proposed for other topologies are not applicable to these new resonant multiwinding topologies.

One of the drawbacks of conventional resonance tuning methods is that only increment of capacitor is allowed. Even if some conventional tunings allow both increment and reduction of capacitance, they fail zero-voltage switching (ZVS) at the increment of capacitance, which practically limits their tuning range. To solve the issue, we propose an automatic tuning resonant capacitor (ATRC), which can both increase and decrease the resonant capacitor. The tuning mosfets achieve zero-voltage turn-on (ZVS) both at the capacitor-reduction mode and the capacitor-increment mode. These two (decrement/increment both are possible, and ZVS for both modes) are the advantages compared to conventional autotuning methods. Additionally, low dv/dt turn-off is achieved at capacitor-increasing mode in proposed method. Hence, the delivered power and overall efficiency is improved. The proposed method is suitable for any LC network to solve the detuning problem. A 200 W prototype is fabricated and tested experimentally. The measurement results show that the proposed ATRC can improve the overall PTE by 25%&#8211;63% point when the operating frequency is detuned ranging 75&#8211;125 kHz for 100 kHz nominal LC resonant frequency.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Practical Evaluation of Dimmable Passive Light-Emitting Diode Drivers for Smart Lampposts</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10199135</link><description>Passive light-emitting-diode (LED) drivers have recently been adopted by the lighting industry in street lighting applications due to their high robustness against extreme weather conditions, long lifetime, and high percentage of recyclable components.

Besides, those methods can only achieve simplex communication. To solve these problems, this article proposes a single coil half-duplex communication EM-SWPDT system using a novel multifrequency modulation, which can enhance data transmission performance. By modulating the conduction angle of the converter with desired signal frequency, the steady state and sinusoidal fluctuating states are realized, which compose different data wave, respectively. Because the data transmission relies on frequency information instead of amplitude information, the load voltage drop can be reduced. And the phase-shifting equivalent current model is constructed to evaluate the influence of data transmission on load voltage. Since the data modulation is performed by the converters of wireless power transfer system, additional auxiliary data circuits, such as signal generators and wave trappers are omitted and branch crosstalk is reduced. Therefore, the influence of data transmission on power transmission efficiency is weak. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed EM-SWPDT system with a novel multifrequency modulation is verified by experimental platforms.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Voltage Stiffness Control Technique for a Virtual Oscillator-Based Grid- Forming Controller</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10163995</link><description>Voltage stiffness is a vital parameter for grid-forming inverters. With a very high voltage stiffness, an inverter picks up all the reactive power demands of the point of common coupling. In contrast, with a very low voltage stiffness, the inverter does not participate in voltage regulation at all. Hence, any grid-forming controller should be able to control voltage stiffness dynamically. Virtual oscillator-based controllers (VOCs), the latest and most advanced grid-forming controllers, provide all the steady-state functionalities of the conventional droop controllers and, in addition, time-domain synchronization with a connected network. However, existing VOCs cannot control voltage stiffness dynamically. As a result, limiting reactive power output during a higher voltage sag, especially when connected to a weak grid, is challenging for VOCs. The only existing solution for a VOC in such conditions is to enter into current control mode, which leads to ineffective synchronization, output power oscillation, and, finally, inefficient grid-forming operation. Integrating a dynamic voltage stiffness controller inside a VOC is not as straightforward as a droop controller. Because, unlike phasor-based droop controllers, VOCs have time-domain implementation. In this article, we introduce virtual impedance-based dynamic voltage stiffness control technique for VOCs with systematic design procedures and rigorous stability analysis.</description></item><item><title>High-Efficiency Time-Division Multiplexing Modulation Technology for Modular Multiactive Bridge Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10194423</link><description>In this article, a time-division multiplexing (TDM) modulation technology is proposed to enhance the efficiency of modular multiactive bridge (MMAB) converters in multiport power electronic transformers over a wide operating range. The TDM modulation retains the simplicity of single phase-shift (SPS) modulation while achieving efficiency improvement by adopting different structures (i.e., half-bridge and full-bridge) under different operating conditions with dc bias capacitors. However, determining the optimal structure under the same operating condition poses a significant challenge due to the strong coupling among MMAB ports. To address this issue, this article analyzes a dual-active bridge converter to investigate the steady-state characteristics of different structures, including the root-mean-square current and zero-voltage switching. By decomposing the MMAB converter into different transmission branches, the optimal combination structure of half-bridge and full-bridge are selected based on the branch powers, forming a simple and efficient TDM modulation technology. Finally, an experimental prototype of a four-port MMAB converter is established and tested. The results demonstrate that the proposed TDM can increase efficiency up to 19.09% compared to SPS, validating the correctness and effectiveness of the theoretical analysis.</description></item><item><title>Efficiency Enhancement for Alkaline Water Electrolyzers Directly Driven by Fluctuating PV Power</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10163951</link><description>Hydrogen production from photovoltaic arrays is a promising way to fully utilize the solar energy and to relieve consumption pressure of the power system. The low-cost and mature alkaline water electrolysis is suitable for large-scale hydrogen production. However, the low-load inefficiency of alkaline water electrolyzers greatly limits their operation range (usually 40%&#8211;100% of rated load). Hence, alkaline water electrolyzers are hard to follow the fluctuating photovoltaic power in full range. Focusing on this problem, this article analyzes the inefficiency mechanism of low-load alkaline water electrolyzers. It is found that through modifying the excitation electric field, the low-load performance of alkaline water electrolyzers can be greatly enhanced. Based on this, an optimal current pulsewidth modulation control strategy and the corresponding prototype converter are proposed to regulate alkaline water electrolyzers directly driven by photovoltaic arrays. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a 2 Nm3/h commercial alkaline water electrolyzer. Experimental results show that compared to the conventional dc power supply, 1) the maximum efficiency improvement can exceed two times, and 2) the alkaline water electrolyzer can follow the fluctuating photovoltaic power well.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Power Balancing Control Method for Energy Storage DC/DC Parallel Supply System With Low-Frequency Pulsed Load</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10197235</link><description>For the energy storage dc/dc parallel supply system with low-frequency pulsed load, an unbalanced dynamic power distribution problem will occur due to the inconsistent dc inertia of each converter, even resulting in a severe continuous low-frequency power oscillation. For this, a dynamic power balancing control method is proposed to reshape their dc inertia to be consistent and realize dynamic power balancing distribution among multiple converters without low-frequency power oscillation.

This is achieved by distributing the active power among the submodules. Although multiple methods have been proposed for this purpose, they face the challenge of rendering optimal active power distributions that maximize balancing speed while meeting power constraints in the battery energy storage system. To overcome this challenge, a model predictive control scheme is developed in this article. The proposed method is remarkably robust against parametric uncertainties (battery voltage, capacity, etc.), as evidenced by its ability to tolerate a substantial 50% uncertainty in the parameters, resulting in a mere 0.05% steady-state error. Furthermore, because the predictive control can be executed at a low frequency, the computational burden is comparable to other existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Event-Triggered Hybrid Anti-Islanding Protection Scheme Based on Q-Axis Disturbance Injection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10190124</link><description>Distributed generators are required to be integrated with sophisticated anti-islanding protection system (AIPS). However, most conventional AIPS fails to detect unintentional islanding event during perfectly matched loading conditions. To overcome this issue, in this article, a hybrid islanding detection algorithm has been proposed based on the rate of change of kinetic energy and root-mean-square value of absolute frequency deviation at the point of common coupling (PCC). The methodology presents a significant contribution prior to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of the disturbance injection mechanism through the q-axis current control loop of the grid-tied inverter. The method activates the disturbance signal injection mechanism only when an unintentional islanding event is suspected based on monitoring certain parameters at the PCC. This mechanism has been proposed to have zero nondetection zone, very fast operation, straightforward implementation, and significantly less impact on the power quality and stability of the power electronics system. The performance of the proposed method has been evaluated by conducting 200+ islanding and nonislanding case studies in simulation as well as an experimental platform. The proposed method is robust, accurate, and fast enough to detect an islanding event cleverly with a detection time as small as 120 ms.</description></item><item><title>A Current-Stress-Optimized Design Method for Dual Active Bridge Converters With Improved ZVS Capability Under Wide Output Voltage Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10185988</link><description>In dual active bridge (DAB) converters, the current stress seriously impacts the switching losses, and thus is tightly relevant to the efficiency. This article proposes a design method for the parameters of magnetic components, i.e., the inductance and the turns ratio of DAB converters, which is on the basis of an optimal triple-phase-shift control. The objective of this method is to minimize the current stress to the utmost extent and ensuring the soft switching under specific wide output voltage conditions, thus greatly improving the efficiency. At beginning, a mathematical model of the current stress is established in this article. Then, the optimization method of the parameters of magnetic components is classified into two cases according to the given operating conditions, and the boundaries and constraints of both cases are presented. Finally, an intuitive design process of magnetic components is presented.

The proposed approach utilizes a multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) technique to coordinate multiple control objectives. During the offline training stage, each DRL agent supervises a submodule (SM) of the DCSST, and outputs real-time actions based on the received states. Optimal phase-shift ratio combinations are learned using triple phase-shift modulation, and soft actor-critic (SAC) agents optimize the neural network parameters to enhance controller performance. The well-trained agents act as fast surrogate models that provide online control decisions for the DCSST, adapting to variant environmental conditions using only local SM information. The proposed distributed configuration improves redundancy and modularity, facilitating hot-swap experiments. Experimental results demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed multiagent SAC algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Impedance Specifications for Stability Design of Grid-Connected DC Distribution Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10195858</link><description>In practical application, it is more expected that the impedance-based stability criteria can provide intuitive system design guidance. However, the existing stability criteria for the complicated systems always aggregate all equipment/subsystem impedances. As a result, it is difficult to determine the port impedance specification that each equipment/subsystem should meet to ensure the system stability and a certain stability margin. In this article, the impedance specifications for the stability design of grid-connected dc distribution power systems are proposed. First, the stability conditions for impedance specification design are presented based on the dc-side subsystem impedance ratio criterion. On this basis, the ac-side admittance specifications and dc-side impedance specifications are proposed to ensure system stability. The former is used to constrain the ac-side admittance of voltage-source converter (VSC), and the latter restricts the dc-side impedance of grid-connected VSC and the input impedance of each converter-based load. The proposed impedance specifications are mainly related to grid impedance, transmission power, dc-bus voltage, two specific frequencies, and the required stability margin. As long as the proposed impedance specifications are met, the whole system must be stable and has sufficient stability margin. Finally, the case studies and experiments validate the proposed impedance specifications.</description></item><item><title>Power Balancing Strategy for Cascaded H-Bridge Inverter in a Grid-Connected Photovoltaic System Under Asymmetrical Operating Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10183673</link><description>Cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverter is a well-established technology for photovoltaic systems. Power imbalance occurs in the system because of the environmental dependence of photovoltaic modules, damage and dusting of panels, and the ageing effect. Subsequently, the power handled by H-bridge modules is unequal. As a result of power imbalance, the H-bridge modules carrying higher power are likely to get overmodulated, increasing the distortion in grid current. Due to this, reliability of the system is affected. The ability of existing harmonic compensation techniques to counter this issue is limited to a modulation index of $4/\pi$. In the view of this adversity, a voltage alteration method along with an optimization algorithm is proposed in this article to alleviate the power imbalance issue. The presented simulation and experimental results validate the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Design and Implementation of an Interleaved High Efficiency and High Voltage Gain Converter With Minimum Switch Count for Renewable Energy Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10173751</link><description>This article proposes a new nonisolated, interleaved, high step-up, soft-switching converter for renewable energy applications. The proposed converter is a boost topology designed to have a continuous input current with low ripple. It employs no auxiliary circuit or extra switches to achieve soft-switching, and the voltage stress on the power switches is reduced. By using the transformer's leakage inductance, the power diodes&#8217; reverse recovery current problem is tackled without the need for an extra snubber circuit. The proposed converter has been analyzed and compared with similar topologies. Experimental results from a 400-W prototype with a 30&#8211;300 V conversion ratio are presented, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed converter, which is well-suited for use with renewable energy sources.</description></item><item><title>Controllability Analysis and Controller Design of Higher Order Novel Switched Inductor&#8211;Capacitor DC&#8211;DC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10173740</link><description>Performance analysis and controller design of novel switched inductor&#8211;capacitor high-gain dc&#8211;dc converters that are formed by a switch&#8211;diode&#8211;inductor&#8211;capacitor network (SDLCN), viz., converter A and converter B are presented in this article. Using the proposed structure of the components to form the SDLCN, the converters A and B have continuous input current, better efficiency due to lower voltage and current stress, and minimum component count compared to some of the conventional dc&#8211;dc converters. To analyze the controllability of these converters, a switched linear system model is developed for the proposed converters. For better accuracy, the effect of parasitic elements is considered in the model. The controllability is validated by experiments on a 380 V, 50 kHz, and 200 W laboratory prototype. From the switched linear system model, a small-signal model and nominal transfer functions are obtained, and validated experimentally. Using the stability boundary locus technique and Kharitonov's first method, the PI controllers are designed. This technique selects a resilient performance zone for closed-loop converter operation by considering source and load-side disturbances. The developed PI controllers are implemented in the Xilinx System Generator and the closed-loop performance is validated experimentally.</description></item><item><title>Current-Referencing Electrified Synchronous Machine to Emulate a Synchronous Machine via a Voltage-Source Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10203000</link><description>The gradual decrease of the grid inertia in contemporary power grids is one of the significant problems caused by the expansion of renewable energy sources. As the inertia provided by the kinetic energy in the rotating mass of conventional fossil fuel-based synchronous generator decreases, the stability of the grid frequency deteriorates. Virtual synchronous machines (VSMs) that emulate the properties of a conventional synchronous machine through voltage-source inverters have gained attention as a solution to support the grid frequency. In this study, a current-referencing electrified synchronous machine (CURESYM) is proposed as a new control method that allows an inverter to have properties of a conventional synchronous machine. The CURESYM supports grid frequency through the inertial and damping responses. In addition, the CURESYM regulates the current in the synchronous reference frame according to the intended transient response, which is separately determined from the inertial and damping responses. A droop control was also implemented via current references independent of the damping response. The performance of the CURESYM is verified through experiments. Furthermore, the advantages of the CURESYM are examined by comparing with existing VSM topologies.</description></item><item><title>s-Domain Model of Single-Sampling and Multisampling DPWM DC&#8211;DC Converter Based on Discrete-Time Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10163961</link><description>This article proposes a general s-domain model of the single-sampling and multisampling digital pulsewidth modulation (DPWM) dc&#8211;dc converter. The proposed model has two main characteristics. First, the PWM delay is modeled by both time delay and state feedback rather than the time delay only. The time delay and state feedback are decided by the type of converters and carriers together. Therefore, the proposed model can explain the different effects of the PWM delay in different converters and carriers. Then, the time delay in the proposed model is decided by the switching frequency rather than the sampling frequency. Therefore, the multisampling cannot reduce the time delay of DPWM, which introduces ripples instead. For different converters and carriers, the influence of the ripple is varying. Therefore, based on the proposed model, the multisampling does not always improve the stability of converters, which is more in line with the actual situation. Compared with existing models, the proposed model reflects the complex effects of the PWM delay more accurately. To demonstrate these advantages intuitively, the stability of basic converters is judged by the proposed method, whose results are compared with existing models and experiment results.</description></item><item><title>Observer-Based Variable Impedance Control Using Moving Horizon Estimation for Robot Machining Thin-Walled Workpieces</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10188400</link><description>Adaptability is one of the most important survival and living abilities in nature and human society, which needs to perceive the environment and regulate self-behaviors. To empower robots in manufacturing with this ability, an observer-based variable impedance control scheme is proposed in this article. It senses changes in environmental properties during contact and utilizes the observations to guide the decisions of the robot controller. Specifically, we developed a real-time moving horizon based robot-environment observer, which uses historical information to predict the current impedance parameters of the external contact environment and robot internal joint disturbances simultaneously. Then, a variable impedance control law is designed to eliminate state tracking errors and decrease machining vibration. The stability of the closed-loop system is theoretically proven. Experiments on machining thin-walled workpieces validate the efficacy of the proposed method, where the robot exhibits compliant force behavior resulting in superior workpiece surface roughness among various comparison methods.</description></item><item><title>Moobot: A Miniature Origami Omnidirectional Jumping Robot With High Trajectory Accuracy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10191042</link><description>Trajectory control is important for jumping robots because it helps them to overcome different obstacles; however, integrating actuators and sensors exhibiting small scale and high accuracy remains challenging. No insect-scale jumping robots have yet demonstrated accurate trajectory following. Here, we propose a miniature origami omnidirectional jumping robot (Moobot) capable of high-accuracy feedback control of its jumping trajectory. The robot is based on a four-bar origami structure and shape memory alloys. Two strain gauges and an inertial measurement unit were used to control the jumping force and takeoff angle, respectively, and a reliable jumping mechanism and novel supporting leg were designed to improve jumping stability and trajectory accuracy. Unlike typical externally powered miniature robots, we constructed a 5 cm, 6 g untethered prototype. The error and the standard deviation of the jumping distances were both less than 1.5 cm; this represents a significant improvement relative to all previous insect-scale jumping robots. Furthermore, we integrated the yaw control and conducted omnidirectional jumping experiments, showing that Moobot was capable of accurately traversing different platforms from all directions.</description></item><item><title>An Energy-Based Anisotropic Vector Hysteresis Model for Rotational Electromagnetic Core Loss</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10188384</link><description>In this article, a model that describes the anisotropic behavior and core loss of electrical steel sheets over a wide range of rotational excitation is developed. Based on the definition of the effective field, the macroscopic anisotropy field is deduced from a weighted average of the magnetocrystalline energy of a single crystal. An anisotropic vector hysteresis model is then proposed by applying the effective field to the energy-based model. Experimental measurements are used to fit and validate the model. Either alternating or rotational measurements with a maximum magnetic flux density 1.55 T under 10 Hz are employed to fit the model parameters and the remaining set of measurements is used for validating the model accuracy. The results show that the model can naturally account for the drop in the rotational losses at high flux densities regardless of whether it is identified from alternating or rotational measurement data. The generality of the model is demonstrated through continuous angle results and modeling of another material.</description></item><item><title>Modulated FCS-MPC Based on Zero-Sequence Component Injection Algorithm and Vector Synthesis Algorithm With NPP Deviation Suppression</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10191041</link><description>Conventional finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) for three-phase three-level (3P-3L) converters suffers from cumbersome weighting factor design, variable switching frequency, and performance compromise in neutral point potential (NPP) and current. This article proposes a modulated FCS-MPC to eliminate weighting factor, fix switching frequency, and combine NPP balance performance with current tracking performance for 3P-3L T-type converter. First, a vector synthesis algorithm with NPP deviation suppression is adopted to improve vector accuracy for current tracking, and reduce NPP deviation by redundant vector duration time adjustment. Second, a zero-sequence component injection algorithm is proposed, which determines zero-sequence component amplitude according to capacitor charge balance algorithm, and balances NPP without weighting factor. Third, a dual carrier modulation mode is adopted to produce desired switching signals with constant frequency. Finally, advantages of proposed FCS-MPC are verified by simulation and experiment.</description></item><item><title>Novel Shielding Technology and Interleaving Technology Realizes EMI CM Noise Suppression Base on Cascaded Power Module</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10195249</link><description>In this article, a cascaded power module adopts novel shielding technology and interleaving technology to realize electromagnetic interference (EMI) common mode noise current suppression.

Z-source circuit breakers (ZSCBs) have provided a promising solution with fast, autonomous, and arcless fault clearances. To further provide bidirectional operation capability and enhanced performance, a bidirectional ZSCB based on coupled inductors is proposed and well designed in this article. It can offer bidirectional power flow and fault disconnections in a compact size.

However, influenced by noise and mutation information, vibration-based prediction methods remain in the preliminary phase for precise prediction of power transformer. To address this issue, a contrastive adversarial sparse model is proposed to predict the progress of power transformer faults in the early phases. First, a sparse transformer improves the feature extraction ability of the bidirectional recurrent gated network to reduce noise and extracts significant information from original signal. Then, the mutation information is suppressed by a contrastive adversarial method, based on which discrimination layer predicts the power transformer fault. Finally, to constrain the network, a contrastive loss based on feature matching is proposed to learn more extra information distinct from sparse transforms. Datasets are collected using wireless vibration sensors from a 10-kV real power transformer. Under an identical parameter setting, experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms comparison algorithms in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient, symmetric mean absolute percentage error, and mean absolute error. Especially, the RMSE of the proposed model is 0.0242, exceeding the performance of the conventional model in power transformer fault prediction.</description></item><item><title>Leak Detection for Natural Gas Gathering Pipelines Under Multiple Operating Conditions Using RP-1dConvLSTM-AE and Multimodel Decision</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10190156</link><description>Real-time leak detection for natural gas gathering pipelines is critical to guarantee the safe transportation of energy in the source of production. Since leak samples are scarce in real pipelines, modeling healthy data becomes one of the mainstream solutions. However, due to the lack of prior knowledge of leaks, more effective feature learning for multivariate time series (MTS) of pipeline data is a prerequisite for reliable leak detection. Moreover, in-service gathering pipelines usually involve multiple operating conditions (MOCs), where the leak characteristics of MOCs could be significantly different. This poses a serious challenge to accurate leak detection. To address the abovementioned problems, we propose a hybrid leak detection method for gathering pipelines under MOCs. First, anomaly processing and long&#8211;short sequence construction are designed to provide high-quality data for leak detection. Then, reconstruction- and prediction-one-dimensional convolutional long short-term memory autoencoder is proposed to enhance the feature learning for MTS. Based on the learned features, a multimodel decision scheme with one-class support vector machine is developed to deal with leak detection under MOCs. Finally, experimental results on supervisory control and data acquisition data obtained from real-world natural gas gathering pipelines demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Combined Model-Based and Data-Driven Fault Diagnosis Scheme for Lithium-Ion Batteries</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10203013</link><description>Diagnosing potential faults is of great importance to ensure reliability of battery management systems. This is because a current or voltage sensor fault often results in an inaccurate state-of-charge estimate. A temperature sensor fault will cause abnormal thermal management. A battery internal resistance (BIR) fault can lead to an increase in energy and power losses, capacity fading, and further degradation of health. In addition, frequent data transmission to fault diagnosis unit will cause a great waste of communication resources. To this end, a combined model-based and data-driven fault diagnosis scheme for lithium-ion batteries is proposed in this article. First, a model-based fault estimation method with sliding mode observer is developed to estimate the voltage, current, and temperature sensor faults. By integrating an adaptive event-triggered mechanism, the communication resource costs are alleviated. Second, a data-driven gap metric approach is presented to detect the BIR fault. By combining the model-based and data-driven strategies, the fault diagnosis logic is put forward to isolate the BIR fault. Finally, several experiments of the single cell and the battery pack are conducted to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the developed method over the existing results.</description></item><item><title>Detecting Intelligent Load Redistribution Attack Based on Power Load Pattern Learning in Cyber-Physical Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10190177</link><description>The massive integration of advanced cyber technologies with power grids has expanded the attack surface area of cyber-physical power systems (CPPSs), where timely detection is of paramount importance for their safe and reliable operation. However, most studies on securing CPPS rarely considered resource constraints, resulting in the unsatisfactory performance of security solutions in practical applications. To gain insight into attack behavior in realistic scenarios, this article fully develops the concept of load redistribution (LR) attacks and designs an intelligent version that considers both concealment property and resource limitation. Then, aiming to develop an effective countermeasure, this article provides a novel attack detection method based on power load pattern learning, which consists of a power load predictor and subsequent attack detector, to determine the existence of intelligent LR attacks. Specifically, a multichannel power load predictor based on the SARIMAX model is proposed to capture both temporal and spatial correlations of power load data for accurate prediction. Using augmented features, a dictionary-learning-based attack detector that can handle the class imbalance problem by unsupervised learning is capable to detect the intelligent LR attacks. Finally, experiments on numerical simulation and the CPPS-HITL platform are conducted to verify the effectiveness and practical availability of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive-Optimization-Based Digital Simulation Database for Nonuniform Aging Diagnosis of Transformer Insulation System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10196011</link><description>The trend toward intellectualization is pervasive in the field of power equipment fault diagnosis.

The simulation model is developed in the current work using distributed relaxation circuits and fast Fourier transforms, and the electric parameters used are identified using adaptive iteration particle swarm optimization. Finally, verification established that the extended simulation model was capable of simulating the FDS of a system with nonuniformly assigned aging states.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel adaptive rectifier system with stabilized output dc power against dynamic power densities. A novel detection circuit is designed to identify the frequency range and receiving power level. Then the received RF power is amplified to the saturated level by referring to the detected frequency and power information for adaptive dc biasing control for an integrated power amplifier. Doing so makes the input power to the rectifier constant regardless of the power and frequency variations. The experimentally validated system can output a stabilized power under the time-varying power range of &#8722;10 to 0 dBm and location varying within 0.5 m at 1.8, 2.1, and 2.6 GHz. Compared with conventional designs, this system has realized stabilized and enhanced conversion efficiency (61% at 1.8 GHz, 64% at 2.1 GHz, and 53% at 2.6 GHz) and therefore could be adopted for wireless powering distributed sensors and Internet of Thing (IoT) devices continuously and steadily at flexible conditions.</description></item><item><title>Mitigating the Impact of Photovoltaic Power Ramps on Intraday Economic Dispatch Using Reinforcement Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10080978</link><description>The rapid growth of large-scale photovoltaic (PV) power generation has received considerable attention, where a major challenge is that PV power ramp events can adversely affect the operations of integrated power systems. Therefore, effective forecast and dispatch methodologies are critical. However, it is relatively difficult to predict an accurate PV power ramp rate. Another issue is that, since forecast and dispatch are typically considered in research as two separate problems, forecast modeling does not involve the knowledge of dispatch. In this case, unbiased PV forecast is unpractical for PV ramp events, increasing their negative effects. Besides, such a unified optimization with both forecast and dispatch cannot be solved easily since the problem is strongly nonlinear. Motivated by these challenges, a reinforcement forecasting framework is proposed for intraday economic dispatch in this study. First, the PV power ramp rate forecasting is categorized into two tasks of multi-classification and class expectation prediction, where the class continuity is considered in order to improve the forecast distribution. Next, a reinforcement learning agent is established for connecting PV forecast and system dispatch, which adjusts PV power generation schedules based on real-time system feedbacks. Comparative studies are conducted on an intraday system dispatch environment with energy storage. The results of the studies indicate that the proposed framework can provide higher economic benefits than those under benchmark schemes.</description></item><item><title>Hardware in the Loop Wave Energy Converter Control Under Control Faults and Model Mismatch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122770</link><description>Ocean wave energy conversion is operated in a challenging environment featuring massive and impulsive stresses and is subjected to large amounts of biofouling and marine growth. As most wave energy converter technologies are off-shore, operation, maintenance, and repair costs may be significant. Therefore, any cost-effective control and operation of Wave Energy Converters (WECs) must be robust to faults and changes in the operational environment. This paper presents a Bayesian policy gradient-based WEC control approach that is responsive and adaptive to faults in controller feedback, controller actuation, and changes in the plant model. The controller is tested via Hardware in the Loop real-time testbed. The results show that the proposed control is capable of adapting its policy to the loss of information from one or two sensors and recovering nearly full power operation. In the case where sensor loss occurs, after the loss of plate excitation force estimation and displacement sensors, the power decreases to 215.2 kW from 252.7 kW before recovering to 238.4 kW mean power over 20 minutes. Moreover, the Bayesian RL-based control model proves its adaptability by compensating a large portion of power loss due to PTO failures and rapid changes to the dynamic system because of non-destructive damage to the float structure.</description></item><item><title>Grid Forming Fast Frequency Response for PMSG-Based Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10091242</link><description>Electric power systems are undergoing a rapid transition from fuel-based generation using synchronous generators to renewable generation interfaced by power electronics. In this context, a key challenge is using renewable generation with limited controllability to contribute to power system stability. In this work, we investigate grid-forming control of permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) wind turbines. The proposed control and curtailment strategy supports the entire spectrum of standard functions of grid-following (e.g. maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and grid-forming control (e.g., primary frequency control) without explicit mode switching. A detailed case study is used to compare the performance of the proposed control at operating points corresponding to MPPT and frequency control with standard grid-forming and grid-following controls. The results demonstrate that (i) the proposed energy balancing grid forming control is self-synchronizing in MPPT mode, (ii) the (limited) energy storage and controllability of wind turbines can be adequately utilized to provide grid support, and (ii) the proposed control exhibits good performance under variable wind speeds and does not result in a significant increase of wind turbine fatigue loads.</description></item><item><title>A Coordinated Optimal Operation of a Grid-Connected Wind-Solar Microgrid Incorporating Hybrid Energy Storage Management Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10089547</link><description>The hybrid-energy storage systems (ESSs) are promising eco-friendly power converter devices used in a wide range of applications. However, their insufficient lifespan is one of the key issues by hindering their large-scale commercial application. In order to extend the lifespan of the hybrid-ESSs, the cost functions proposed in this paper include the degradation of the hydrogen devices and the battery. Indeed, this paper aims to develop a sophisticated model predictive control strategy for a grid-connected wind and solar microgrid, which includes a hydrogen-ESS, a battery-ESS, and the interaction with external consumers, e.g., battery/fuel cell electric vehicles. The integrated system requires the management of its energy production in different forms, i.e., the electric and the hydrogen ones. The proposed strategy consists of the economical and operating costs of the hybrid-ESSs, the degradation issues, and the physical and dynamic constraints of the system. The mixed-logic dynamic framework is required to model the operating modes of the hybrid-ESSs and the switches between them. The effectiveness of the controller is analyzed by numerical simulations which are conducted using solar and wind generation profiles of solar panels and wind farms located in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Such simulations, indeed, show that the proposed strategy appropriately manages the plant by fulfilling constraints and energy requests while reducing device costs and increasing battery life.</description></item><item><title>Probabilistic Prognosis of Wind Turbine Faults With Feature Selection and Confidence Calibration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10114598</link><description>With the ever-increasing expansion of the installed capacity of wind power generation, reliable condition monitoring for wind turbines (WTs) has become increasingly important. To this end, this paper proposes a probabilistic WT fault prognosis (WTFP) scheme to output reliable fault probabilities in addition to class predictions. First, a multivariate time series (MTS) based mutual information estimator (MIE) is developed to integrate with combinational optimization, selecting features that contain more beneficial temporal data patterns for WTFP. Then, a multi-fault prognosis model for WTs is trained based on the selected features and MTS learning network. Next, a confidence calibration (CC) post-processing module is appended to re-construct the mapping relation between network logits and posterior probabilities by minimizing negative log-likelihood, thereby calibrating confidence estimates to approximate the true correctness likelihood as much as possible while keeping the high accuracy of the trained MTS learning network. These components finally drive a comprehensive WTFP model. Test results on the field data of WT verify the efficacy of MTS-based MIE and CC, and show that the proposed probabilistic WTFP scheme can provide more reliable probability estimates, contributing to better decision-making.</description></item><item><title>On Power Control of Grid-Forming Converters: Modeling, Controllability, and Full-State Feedback Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10111054</link><description>The popular single-input single-output control structures and classic design methods (e.g., root locus analysis) for the power control of grid-forming converters have limitations in applying to different line characteristics and providing favorable performance. This paper studies the grid-forming converter power loops from the perspective of multi-input multi-output systems. First, the error dynamics associated with power control loops (error-based state-space model) are derived while taking into account the natural dynamical coupling terms of the power converter models. Thereafter, the controllability Gramian of the grid-forming converter power loops is studied. Last, a full-state feedback control design using only the local measurements is applied. By this way, the eigenvalues of the system can be arbitrarily placed in the timescale of power loops based on predefined time-domain specifications. A step-by-step construction and design procedure of the power control of grid-forming converters is also given.

Many recent studies demonstrate the effectiveness of power control of smart inverters for voltage regulation purposes. However, how to fully incentivize demand-side participation in voltage regulation is yet to be answered. This article seeks to address this challenge by designing a comprehensive voltage regulation incentive scheme for customers to control their smart inverters in unbalanced radial distribution networks. A three-phase residential network from a Distributed Network Service Provider (DNSP) in Australia is modelled in the open-source distribution system simulator OpenDSS with real load and PV data, and an control algorithm to optimize the households' smart inverters in a distributed fashion is developed using game theory. The proposed algorithm is implemented in MATLAB, which is guaranteed to approach the optimal solution. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves better voltage regulation performance as the widely adopted localized voltage-var droop control method and, at the same time, with lower costs to the prosumers.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Carbon Footprint Management of Electric Vehicles and Emission Abatement in Electricity Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122732</link><description>Electric vehicles (EVs) are believed to play an important role in mitigating carbon emissions in the transportation sector. However, EVs may still cause carbon emissions in the power sector if they are charged by electricity generated from burning fossil fuels like coal. Researchers have focused on managing emissions on the power generation sector. However, the underlying driver of carbon emissions is the demand of consumers. Given this background, a probabilistic carbon footprint management strategy is proposed for EVs in this paper. First, the conventional deterministic carbon emission flow model is extended to a probabilistic one (PCEF) to track the carbon footprint of EVs considering various kinds of uncertainties based on non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) and the two-point estimation method (2PEM). Second, a stochastic chance-constrained carbon footprint management model for EV charging is presented to address the carbon obligation allocation of EVs from the perspective of consumption and provide a technical basis for demand-driven stimulation to reduce carbon emissions. Third, an efficient method is proposed to solve the formulated chance-constrained problem based on nonparametric Bayesian modeling and inference. The proposed model and method are demonstrated by the IEEE 39-bus power system. The feasibility of the proposed PCEF model is validated. According to simulation results, the computation speed of the proposed PCEF model is enhanced from 3456.8 seconds to 1341.3 seconds compared with the Monte Carlo simulation by sacrificing the accuracy within 2%. Besides, the proposed emission control strategy can attain a better emission control performance compared with the other state-of-art methods.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Modeling of Microgrid Transient Dynamics Through Modularized Sparse Identification</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10115474</link><description>Modularized sparse identification (M-SINDy) is developed in this paper for effective data-driven modeling of the nonlinear transient dynamics of microgrid systems. The high penetration of power-electronic interfaces makes microgrids highly susceptible to disturbances, causing severe transients, especially in the islanded mode. The M-SINDy method realizes distributed discovery of nonlinear dynamics by partitioning a higher-order microgrid system into multiple subsystems and introducing pseudo-states to represent the impact of neighboring subsystems. This specific property of the proposed algorithm is found to be very useful while working with re-configurable and scalable microgrids. The governing equations of the subsystems are identified through regression by mapping the nonlinear system's data to a linear system in a large functional space. The effectiveness of the M-SINDy method is tested and validated through numerical examples and comparisons with other existing identification models on a typical islanded microgrid. The method can simultaneously compute the governing equations of different subsystems and is examined to be robust to measurement noises and partial observations. This paper highlights the advances of data science in providing a potent tool for modeling and analyzing higher-order nonlinear microgrid systems. Dynamic discovery of system transients from measurements can be beneficial for designing control strategies that improve the overall microgrid stability and reliability.</description></item><item><title>Encoding Carbon Emission Flow in Energy Management: A Compact Constraint Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122721</link><description>Decarbonizing the energy supply is essential and urgent to mitigate the increasingly visible climate change. Its basis is identifying emission responsibility during power allocation by the carbon emission flow (CEF) model. However, the main challenge of CEF application is the intractable nonlinear relationship between carbon emission and power allocation. So this article leverages the high approximation capability and the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) representability of the deep neural networks to tackle the complex CEF model in carbon-electricity coordinated optimization. The compact constraint learning approach is proposed to learn the mapping from power injection to bus emission with sparse neural networks (SNNs). Then the trained SNNs are transformed equivalently as MILP constraints in the downstream optimization. In light of the &#8220;high emission with high price&#8221; principle, the blocked carbon price mechanism is designed to price emissions from the demand side. Based on the constraint learning and mechanism design, this article proposes the carbon-aware energy management model in the tractable MILP form to unlock the carbon reduction potential from the demand side. The case study verifies the approximation accuracy and sparsity of SNN with fewer parameters for accelerating optimization solution and reduction effectiveness of demand-side capability for mitigating emission.</description></item><item><title>An Improved PSO-Based MPPT Technique Using Stability and Steady State Analyses Under Partial Shading Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122737</link><description>Partial shading (PS) conditions create challenging issues for the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms in photovoltaic (PV) systems such as getting stuck in the local maximum power points (LMPP), slow tracking time and fluctuations in the generated power during tracking the global maximum power point (GMPP). To address these issues, this article brings contributions by proposing an improved PSO-based MPPT technique tailored for PS conditions. First, to highlight the weakness of the traditional PSO-MPPT technique, its stability and steady state behavior in the PS conditions is analyzed in depth. Second, the required criteria to achieve a stable response are obtained. Finally, a novel technique to estimate the convex area of the power versus voltage (P-V) curve is presented where the GMPP is located using two voltage boundaries. The performance of the proposed MPPT technique is experimentally validated. The results highlight the capabilities of the proposed technique in finding the GMPP with a rapid convergence and small fluctuations. The proposed MPPT is applicable to most PV inverters under any PS conditions.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Dimensional Economy-Durability Optimization Method for Integrated Energy and Transportation System of Net-Zero Energy Buildings</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10123098</link><description>With the increasing penetration of renewable energy and zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), the integrated energy and transportation system (IETS) is considered a promising solution for achieving net-zero energy buildings (NZEBs). However, the tight coupling and the conflict of interests between the transportation and energy systems increase the difficulty of collaborative operation scheduling. Therefore, this article proposes a multi-dimensional economy-durability (MDED) optimization method for IETS of NZEBs. The multidimensionality includes multiple subjects of energy, transportation, and IETS, and multiple time scales of day-ahead and intraday. In the day-ahead stage, the comprehensive cost-optimal scheduling strategy with joint intelligent parking lot (IPL) is constructed for the collaborative operation of IETS. In the intraday stage, two scheduling strategies are applied to satisfy the operation of the transportation and energy systems, respectively. For the transportation system, a coordinated scheduling strategy based on charging service satisfaction (CSS) is presented to coordinate ZEVs demands with diverse vehicle types and service manners. And for the energy system, a rolling optimization strategy based on a dynamic economy-health matrix (DEHM) is designed to track the day-ahead scheduling plan. The results indicate that the proposed method resolves the conflict between the charging needs and the comprehensive cost of the IETS system. In addition, the economic potential and coordination capability of fast charging services in IETS coordinated scheduling are verified. Finally, the proposed DEHM has significant advantages for the system cost and health compared to the conventional weighting matrix.</description></item><item><title>An Analytical Polytope Approximation Aggregation of Electric Vehicles Considering Uncertainty for the Day-Ahead Distribution Network Dispatching</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10124003</link><description>The integration of large-scale heterogeneous electric vehicles (EVs) into the distribution network increases the system management complexity significantly. Due to the flexible charging/discharging operation and shiftable energy consumption during the parking time, EVs possess a great dispatching potential for the distribution network. This article develops an analytical polytope approximation (APA) aggregation model to efficiently depict the dispatchable regions of large-scale EVs with uncertainties and proposes a bilevel cooperative optimization approach for EV aggregators to participate in the distribution network day-ahead optimal scheduling. Uncertainties of EVs are modeled by chance constraints with different confidence levels to accommodate various regulatory requirements. The proposed approach can obtain large-scale EVs dispatchable capabilities with minimum flexibility loss and realize the regulation command disaggregation without violations. Numerical case studies are conducted on IEEE 33-bus and 141-bus distribution networks based on real data sets, which show that the proposed approach outperforms other state-of-art methods in terms of low operation flexibility conservatism, high system economics, and computational efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Allocation of Dynamic Operating Envelopes in Distribution Networks: Technical and Equitable Perspectives</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10123018</link><description>A Dynamic Operating Envelope (DOE) specifies the available capacity to import/export power for Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) or connection points of a distribution network in a time interval without violating its physical and operational constraints. This article proposes a two-stage, top-down approach to allocate DOEs in MV-LV (medium voltage-low voltage) integrated distribution networks. In the first stage, Distribution System State Estimation (DSSE) and Capacity Constrained State Optimisation (CCSO) techniques are employed to allocate DOEs at transformer connection points. Using network data from available metering infrastructure, DSSE estimates the current operational state of the network, whereas CCSO facilitates the DOE allocations at transformer connection points considering technical, soft-equitable and equitable perspectives. In the second stage, the allocated DOEs, containing available aggregate export/import power, are distributed among DERs of LV networks ensuring network integrity. Real-world data of an Australian MV-LV network is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approach. Test results show that technical perspective can offer maximum allocated export/import power, whereas, minimum disparity of allocated power among different connection-points is attained for equitable perspective. Further, insightful performance studies of DOE and existing fixed export policies are conducted considering the condition of present as well as future power systems expecting substantial proliferations of renewables.</description></item><item><title>Optimal HVAC Energy and Regulation Reserve Scheduling in Power Markets</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10132017</link><description>This paper considers the optimal scheduling of the hourly energy consumed and regulation reserve capacity offered by a Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) system participating in a day-ahead electricity market. We formulate an Integrated hourly energy and regulation reserve Scheduling and Deployment (ISD) problem that optimizes the hourly costs and benefits resulting from the power consumed, the regulation reserve capacity offered, the occupant thermal comfort utility, and the expected Intra-Hour Costs (IHCs) due to HVAC's imperfect tracking of the regulation signal broadcasted by the Independent System Operator every few seconds. Addition of the IHCs to the objective function is the major innovation of this paper. It enables optimal HVAC scheduling to internalize expected regulation signal tracking error cost traded-off against incremental occupant thermal discomfort that may result from perfect tracking. The cost causation circle closes by noting that a high hourly regulation reserve offer may result in higher expected IHCs by increasing the associated tracking error and the incremental occupant discomfort. The paper's innovation is achieved by (i) estimating an analytic function of the hourly HVAC scheduling decision and state variables that approximates the expected IHCs, and (ii) including this exogenously estimated analytic function in the objective of the hourly ISD optimization problem. Non-convexities introduced to the optimization problem resulting from high fidelity HVAC model and the inclusion of the expected IHCs, are addressed efficiently through piecewise convex relaxations that provide tight optimality bounds. Extensive numerical results are provided to demonstrate the applicability and performance of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>A Rule-Based Bionic Energy Management System for Grid-Connected Community Microgrid Using Peer-to-Peer Trading With Rapid Settlement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10129832</link><description>This article applies the bionics theory to the design of energy management system (EMS) for the grid-connected community microgrid. Drawing lessons from the humoral regulation mechanism, a rule-based bionic EMS is proposed for the grid-connected community microgrid, with the aim of keeping the supply-demand level of the system approaching self-sufficiency in real time, so as to reduce the dependence of the community microgrid on the utility grid and improve the local utilization of distributed generations in the community microgrid. To realize the bionic EMS, a novel peer-to-peer trading model with rapid settlement is proposed. Fuzzy control is used to cope with the complex real-time control issue, and the basic principles of the adopted fuzzy controller are to maintain the supply-demand ratio close to 1 and extend battery life. Simulation results demonstrate that the bionic EMS has the ability to keep the real-time supply-demand level of the grid-connected community microgrid approaching self-sufficiency. Compared with the optimization-based EMS, the bionic EMS has excellent real-time performance and good robustness, and does not rely on prediction data. Experimental results on the testbed are consistent with the simulation results and validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the bionic EMS in the practical applications.</description></item><item><title>Target Voltage Iterations Based Global Flexible Power Point Tracking Algorithm Under Partial Shading Photovoltaic Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10144415</link><description>Global flexible power point tracking (GFPPT) is proposed to realize the flexible power point tracking (FPPT) of photovoltaic systems under partial shading conditions (PSC). Because the working process of GFPPT is similar to global power point tracking (GMPPT), the performance of GFPPT can be improved by applying the existing advanced GMPPT algorithm. However, the improvement of GFPPT is limited while applying the existing advanced GMPPT algorithm directly. So, a target-voltage-iterations (TVI) based GFPPT algorithm is proposed in this article to further increase the performance of GFPPT during PSC. Compared with the advanced GFPPT algorithms, the proposed TVI-based GFPPT algorithm shows the advantages of fast-tracking speed and little energy difference during the tracking by skipping the voltage section without the reference power. Followed by theoretical analysis, the simulation and experimental evaluation validate the claimed advantages of the proposed TVI-based GFPPT algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Voltage Control and Renewable Accommodation Using Spatial-Temporal Graph Information</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10143277</link><description>Renewable energy resources (RERs) have been increasingly integrated into distribution networks (DNs) for decarbonization. However, the variable nature of RERs introduces uncertainties to DNs, frequently resulting in voltage fluctuations that threaten system security and hamper the further adoption of RERs. To incentivize more RER penetration, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based strategy to dynamically balance the trade-off between voltage fluctuation control and renewable accommodation. To further extract multi-time-scale spatial-temporal (ST) graphical information of a DN, our strategy draws on a multi-grained attention-based spatial-temporal graph convolution network (MG-ASTGCN), consisting of ST attention mechanism and ST convolution to explore the node correlations in the spatial and temporal views. The continuous decision-making process of balancing such a trade-off can be modeled as a Markov decision process optimized by the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm with the help of the derived ST information. We validate our strategy on the modified IEEE 33, 69, and 118-bus radial distribution systems, with outcomes significantly outperforming the optimization-based benchmarks. Simulations also reveal that our developed MG-ASTGCN can to a great extent accelerate the convergence speed of DDPG and improve its performance in stabilizing node voltage in an RER-rich DN. Moreover, our method improves the DN's robustness in the presence of generator failures.</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid Model for Long-Term Wind Power Forecasting Utilizing NWP Subsequence Correction and Multi-Scale Deep Learning Regression Methods</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10144668</link><description>The accuracy of long-term wind power forecasting (WPF) is crucial for the efficient operation of grid systems. However, wind power generation is highly stochastic and intermittent due to the influence of weather, which makes long-term WPF less effective. Numerical weather prediction (NWP) data contains valuable weather forecast information, which can mitigate the negative effects of stochastic weather fluctuations on WPF. However, the accuracy of NWP data decreases over time, and multiple NWP data can have redundancy and errors that make it challenging to extract valid information. Reducing the variety and errors in NWP data and using more effective information extraction methods are essential for improving long-term WPF performance. In this article, we propose a novel long-term WPF hybrid model that corrects NWP wind speed and uses multi-scale deep learning regression prediction to exclude excessive NWP data. We use only the corrected NWP wind speed data to establish a nonlinear mapping relationship with actual power data. The validation case study shows that our proposed model reduces the mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) by 65.0% and 43.8%, respectively, compared to the current state-of-the-art time series forecasting model in a seven-day forecasting scenario.</description></item><item><title>An Optimal Wind Farm Operation Strategy for the Provision of Frequency Containment Reserve Incorporating Active Wake Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10158926</link><description>This study proposes a novel operation strategy for wind farms' optimal Frequency Containment Reserve (FCR) provision that simultaneously distributes FCR and optimally controls wake formation. The power reserve allocation is dynamically decided at the wind farm supervisory control level, considering the intermittent wind power and direction, grid frequency stochasticity, and the aerodynamic complexity of the wake. A two-stage stochastic programming approach supports decision-making for an optimal contribution to day-ahead energy/FCR markets considering sub-hourly wind power and grid frequency uncertainty. Moreover, a novel method is used to reduce the computational complexity by employing a data-driven surrogate model of wake formation in the optimizer. This surrogate model consists of a neural network trained on the Gauss-Curl-Hybrid wake model in FLORIS. This deep learning approach allows fast estimation of the wake control parameters, i.e., the optimal yaw angles and axial induction factors. Then, a coevolutionary-based multi-objective particle swarm optimization searches for the optimal deloading of the WTs and maximizes the total power production and kinetic energy while minimizing wake. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on the C-Power wind farm layout in the North Sea. Simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the wind farm's overall performance for different operational conditions.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Frequency Regulation of Multi-Terminal HVDC-Linked Grids With Deloaded Offshore Wind Farms Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10145805</link><description>This paper proposes a new decentralized strategy for optimal grid frequency regulation (GFR) in an interconnected power system, where onshore grids and offshore wind farms (OWFs) are linked using a multi-terminal high-voltage direct-current (MTDC) system. In the proposed strategy, grid- and OWF-side optimal controllers are developed to coordinate the operations of synchronous generators and the MTDC converter, and the OWF and the MTDC converter, respectively, thus achieving optimal generator power and deloaded OWF power sharing of the interconnected grids and minimizing frequency deviations in each grid. Full-order dynamic models of an MTDC-linked grid and an OWF are implemented, and given each dynamic model, grid- and OWF-side decentralized linear quadratic Gaussian regulators are designed for optimal GFR of the MTDC-linked grids and supporting GFR through optimal deloading operation of the OWFs, respectively. Eigenvalue analyses are conducted with a focus on the effects of system parameter uncertainties and communication time delays. Comparative case studies are also performed to verify that the proposed strategy improves the effectiveness and stability of real-time GFR in MTDC-linked grids under various conditions.</description></item><item><title>A Coordinated Consensus Control Strategy for Distributed Battery Energy Storages Considering Different Frequency Control Demands</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10146450</link><description>With the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs), ensuring frequency stability is becoming urgent for the power system. The distributed battery energy storage systems (DBESs) is one of the promising solutions to this problem. In this paper, a consensus control-based strategy is proposed for coordinating the DBESs to participate in the frequency regulation. Firstly, the system frequency response (SFR) model with the DBESs is introduced, and different frequency control demands are analyzed in detail, based on which the designing principles of the strategy are elaborated. Then, a revised dead band of frequency response is proposed to improve the frequency control performance under severer and more frequent RESs power fluctuation, reduce the possibility of frequency variation crossing the thresholds, and fully utilizes the DBESs&#8217; frequency regulation capability. Further, a developed consensus strategy derived from droop control is proposed, which enables the DBESs to participate in different frequency control demands simultaneously. The proposed strategy can prolong the service time when DBESs involved in frequency control as an aggregator, avoid unexpected energy exhaustion during frequency regulation, and reduce the frequency variation. The performance of the proposed control strategy is validated by the simulation cases with different operating scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Physics-Aware Degradation Model of Lithium-ion Battery Energy Storage for Techno-Economic Studies in Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10154547</link><description>Power system operation and planning decisions for lithium-ion battery energy storage systems are mainly derived using their simplified linear models. While these models are computationally simple, they have limitations in how they estimate battery degradation, either using the energy throughput or the Rainflow method. This article proposes a hybrid approach for lithium-ion battery system modeling suitable for use in power system studies that enhances representation of battery degradation at a reasonable computational cost. The proposed hybrid model combines a physics-based model for improved degradation estimates with a simple and linear energy reservoir model commonly used to represent a battery storage system. The advantage of constructing the battery model with this vision is that it allows its smooth integration into the mixed-integer optimization frameworks. The proposed model is evaluated using both power- and energy-based use cases from the electrical grid. The simulations demonstrate that degradation could be reduced by 45% compared to other modeling strategies while generating the same level of operation profits. The net result of using the proposed hybrid model could be an extended lifespan through better informed planning and operating decisions for energy storage assets.</description></item><item><title>A Novel ANN-Based GMPPT Method for PV Systems Under Complex Partial Shading Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10148801</link><description>In this article, a new two-stage global maximum power point tracking (GMPPT) algorithm based on artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed. The novel ANN architecture is presented first, which requires fewer sampling points than other ANN-based GMPPT approaches, thereby reducing both the tracking time and power loss involved in the tracking. In addition, it does not require costly illuminance or temperature sensors and can be realized using a low-cost digital signal controller. According to the simulation results, the proposed method has the best performance among all methods in terms of tracking speed, tracking accuracy, and tracking loss for all the three tested shading patterns (SPs). The simulated results of 252 SPs show that the performance indexes (PIs) of the proposed method are the best among all the compared methods, which are: the average tracking time 0.18 seconds, average power loss 0.01 W. In addition, the proposed method can correctly predict the GMPP positions of all 252 SPs. Furthermore, the PIs of the proposed method are also the best among all the compared methods according to the experimental results, which are: the tracking speed 0.21 seconds, tracking accuracy 99.66%, and tracking loss 12.58 W, all the above are average values.</description></item><item><title>Frequency Reserve Allocation of Large-Scale RES Considering Decision-Dependent Uncertainties</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10147366</link><description>The proliferation of renewable energy sources (RES) imposes significant challenges on system frequency dynamics. By synthetic inertia and droop control, RES units can provide fast response to sudden frequency events. However, the reserved power and available power of RES units are featured as decision-dependent uncertainties (DDUs), posing challenges to both post-contingency frequency security and system balancing under normal conditions. This article develops a frequency-constrained unit commitment and reserve allocation (FC-UC&amp;amp;RA) model that co-optimizes the reserve allocation and energy dispatch among synchronous generators and RES units. An analytic frequency dynamic model is embedded in the FC-UC&amp;amp;RA problem to accurately assess the system's frequency performance under heterogeneous responses of synchronous and inverter-based units with limited reserve deliveries. To cope with the DDUs stemming from RES generation capabilities scheduled as reserves, a robust FC-UC&amp;amp;RA model is proposed and an adaptive column and constraint generation (C&amp;amp;CG) algorithm is developed to solve the DDU-integrated robust optimization. Comparative case studies verify the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed model and solution approach.</description></item><item><title>Data-Based Control Synthesis and Performance Assessment for Moored Wave Energy Conversion Systems: The PeWEC Case</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10149212</link><description>With a model-based control strategy, the effectiveness of the associated control action depends on the availability of a representative control-oriented model. In the case of floating offshore wave energy converters (WECs), the device response depends upon the interaction between mooring system, any mechanical parts, and the hydrodynamics of the floating body. This study proposes an approach to synthesise WEC controllers under the effect of mooring forces building a representative data-based linear model able to include any relevant dynamics. Moreover, the procedure is tested on the moored pendulum wave energy converter (PeWEC) by means of a high-fidelity mooring solver, OrcaFlex (OF). In particular, the control action is computed with and without knowledge of the mooring influence, in order to analyse and elucidate the effect of the station-keeping system on the harvested energy. The performance assessment of the device is achieved by evaluating device power on the resource scatter characterising Pantelleria, Italy. The results show the relevance of the mooring dynamics on the device response and final set of control parameters and, hence, a significant influence of the station-keeping system on control synthesis and extracted mechanical power.</description></item><item><title>Coordinated Power Smoothing Control Strategy of Multi-Wind Turbines and Energy Storage Systems in Wind Farm Based on MADRL</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10158038</link><description>The randomness and volatility of wind power greatly affect the safety and economy of the power systems, and the wake effect of the wind farm aggravates the wind energy loss and the wind power fluctuation. Taking into consideration the wake effect of the wind farm, a new coordinated wind power smoothing control strategy for multi-wind turbines (M-WT) and energy storage systems (ESS) is proposed. The proposed method is based on a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL), in which the relationship between output power and wake effect is firstly analyzed, and a power smoothing control model of the M-WT and ESS is established. MADRL is then introduced to optimize the power control of M-WT and ESS. In order to further increase the learning and training efficiency, an improved MADRL algorithm based on the partitioned experience buffer and prioritized experience replay is proposed, where the experience buffer is divided into positive, negative, and neutral experiences, and the experiences are sampled according to experience priority. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified on the SimWindFarm platform. The results show that the proposed control strategy can maximize the economic benefits while further smoothing wind power fluctuations and increasing power generation.</description></item><item><title>Local Energy Market Design for Power- and Hydrogen-Based Microgrids Considering a Hybrid Uncertainty Controlling Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10159501</link><description>Despite the significant merits of plugin electric vehicles (PEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), their enormous rise has posed serious challenges in terms of energy supply. This research proposes a sustainable energy platform to integrate PEVs and FCEVs under the concept of microgrid (MG) with power and green hydrogen as energy carriers, so-called integrated power, and hydrogen MG (IPHMG). In addition, a decentralized market clearing model is developed to enable the nearby IPHMG to interact in a local energy market (LEM). The LEM is run by a central manager for both power and hydrogen. To do so, the mobile edge computing (MEC) system is proposed to move the computation from a central cloud server to decentralized edge servers, causing to reducing the computational burden and increasing data security and privacy. Moreover, the fast alternating direction method of multipliers (fast-ADMM) is employed to decompose the problem. Further, this work advances the state-of-the-art in uncertainty management by introducing a tri-level uncertainty controlling approach to fully consider the uncertain parameters. According to the obtained results, the community of IPHMGs could reduce 5.86% of total cost by trading energy in the LEM and the presented hybrid uncertainty management model could protect the community against uncertainties by reducing the total cost by 8.08%.</description></item><item><title>Stochastic Planning for Power Distribution System Resilience Enhancement Against Earthquakes Considering Mobile Energy Resources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10184456</link><description>Earthquakes, which are high-impact low-probability extreme events, can cause severe damage to electrical infrastructure. This article studies the stochastic planning of resilient power distribution systems (PDSs) against earthquakes. Specifically, the portfolio of resilient measures including hardening distribution lines (DLs), and investing Mobile Emergency Generators (MEGs) and Mobile Energy Storage Systems (MESSs) are investigated in a stochastic environment. A stochastic spatial seismic damage model is developed to geographically characterize the random damages of earthquakes. Based on the stochastic model, the PDS planning problem is formulated as a risk-averse two-stage stochastic bi-level programming problem. The upper-level minimizes the total investment cost and the expected interruption cost. The lower-level minimizes the expected loss of load through MEG and MESS coordination, including co-allocation and energy exchange. To solve this problem, a scenario aggregation method based on graph theory and community detection is proposed to reduce the size of scenario set, and an endogenous uncertainty relaxation method is developed to address the DL hardening decision-dependent uncertainty. Then, the PDS planning problem with minmax form is reformulated into a standard bi-level programming problem with minmin form. A decomposition method is also proposed to break up the problem into two separate sub-problems to speed up the computation. The effectiveness of the proposed PDS planning strategy against earthquakes is evaluated through case studies based on the IEEE 37-Node Test Feeder and the IEEE 123-Node Test Feeder.</description></item><item><title>Distribution Network Planning Towards a Low-Carbon Transition: A Spatial-Temporal Carbon Response Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10179921</link><description>Recently, the ambitious targets of emission reduction worldwide have triggered a new trend to focus on low-carbon planning in not only the transmission networks but also the demand-side distribution networks. The existing planning approaches aim to effectively obtain a trade-off solution between emission reduction targets and system economic benefits. In this article, the distribution system planning method with a specific emission reduction target is proposed, in which the emission target is embedded in the objective function via the exterior point method rather than considered as a constraint. Simultaneously, a spatial-temporal carbon response model is proposed, which is based on geographically dispatchable loads (GDLs) incorporating distributed data centers (DDCs) and mobile energy storage systems (MESSs). This model can be extended to further mitigate system emissions without changing the current system framework. The proposed planning method is tested on the modified IEEE 33-bus and 123-bus benchmark systems. According to the simulation results, the impact on system cost and emission results owing to specific emission reduction targets and spatial-temporal carbon response model are analyzed. The results demonstrate that the proposed model and method can achieve a reduction in emissions of more than 30% within 5% of increasing system costs. The effectiveness and scalability of the proposed model have also been verified.</description></item><item><title>On the Low Risk of SSR in Type III Wind Turbines Operating With Grid-Forming Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10197565</link><description>We have shown in previous work that the risk of subsynchronous resonance between wind power plants with Type III wind turbines and series-compensated transmission lines is low when the wind turbines are operated in grid-forming (GFM) mode instead of the standard grid-following mode. This article explains the fundamental mechanism behind the improved damping characteristics by modeling the positive- and negative-sequence impedances of Type III wind turbines in GFM control mode. It is discovered that the GFM control naturally acts against the negative resistance behavior of Type III wind turbines at subsynchronous frequencies that results from an interaction between the rotor-side converter current controller and negative slip. The developed impedance models in the sequence domain and the improved damping behavior are verified using PSCAD simulations of a 2.5-MW Type III GFM wind turbine.

Due to their nature, EVPLs offer some advantages that public charging stations cannot offer. The availability of numerous EV batteries over a long period in the EVPL means that the storage capacity of EVs in EVPLs could be utilized in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) schemes through the installation of bi-directional chargers (BD) that allow injection of power back into the grid. However, it is imperative to determine the optimal number of BD in an EVPL given their high costs and the lack of clear evidence that many EV users will participate in the provision of V2G programs. Therefore, this article aims to develop a model for the optimal design of a V2G-capable EVPL via which the financial model of V2G services and V2G incentive-participation scheme for EV users are incorporated in the decision of installing different types of chargers. The model integrates a multi-mode objective that allows for the maximization of EVPL owner profit and/or EVPL social responsibility using control parameters incorporated in the model. The model also decouples the intertwined economic dynamics of EV charging and V2G services in the EVPL via revenue models targeting each service separately. This allows optimal pricing of services with respect to the invested capital. Actual survey data and historical operating information are used to verify the validity and feasibility of the model. The results show that the proposed model effectively meets design targets and charging/discharging requirements. By providing V2G services, including DR services to the grid, the profit margin of EVPL owners can increase by up to 12.16%.</description></item><item><title>Novel Fast-Speed Partial-Shading-Tolerant Flexible Power Point Tracking for Photovoltaic Systems With Explicit Key Points Estimation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10223421</link><description>Recent power curtailment-based photovoltaic (PV) flexible power point tracking (FPPT) algorithms mainly adopted intricate curve fitting or sophisticated curve-scanning mechanisms to ensure the grid supportive functionalities under partial shading conditions (PSCs), showing the limitations of mathematical solidity or system dynamics improvement. Accordingly, a novel fast-speed partial-shading-tolerant FPPT (PST-FPPT) algorithm is proposed in this article. Regarding the proposed scheme, a modified explicit PV model is developed to express the key operation points with the assistance of several representative current-voltage samples from the initialization process, which is beneficial to computational burden reduction and irradiance sensors removal. Additionally, to guarantee the tracking speed to system dynamics, a set point estimation-based direct voltage regulation strategy is proposed in this article, eliminating the redundant searching in approaching the predefined power command. Simulation and experimental evaluations under various PSCs and operational circumstances validated the effectiveness of the proposed control.</description></item><item><title>Power-Transfer-Distribution-Factor-Based Sensitivity Factors for Integrated Energy Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10236470</link><description>The stronger the electric power, district heating and gas system are linked in an integrated energy system (IES) the larger their flexibility potential but also their complexity. To ensure a secure system operation, the effect of a coupling unit's power change on the overall system state must be analyzed before the power change is carried out. Otherwise, coupling units can unintentionally cause limit violations in one energy system. Currently, for such analyses a power flow calculation must be performed, which is computational expensive and time-consuming. This article presents sensitivity factors extending Power Transfer Distribution Factors from electric power system analysis to IES. The sensitivity factors include the dynamic behavior of district heating and gas systems as we derive the sensitivity factors from a joined quasi-steady-state power flow calculation. In two case studies we profoundly test the applicability of the IES sensitivity factors, their accuracy, and limitations. We show that the sensitivity factors are on average ten times faster in estimating a new system state after a unit's power change compared to a power flow calculation. Also, the sensitivity factors can provide good estimates and have a higher accuracy than sensitivity factors which are derived from a steady-state power flow calculation.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Grid-Support Strategy With Inverter-Interfaced Distributed Generators for Short-Term Voltage Stability Improvement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10207767</link><description>With the increasing integration of renewable energy sources into distribution networks, short-term voltage stability (STVS) has become a prominent issue. Considering grid impedance and maximum rated current, a novel dynamic voltage support (DVS) control strategy for inverter-interfaced distributed generators (IIDGs) is proposed in this article for improving STVS. Furthermore, the impact mechanism of load dynamics and load spatial distribution on the STVS-support strategy are elucidated. For maximizing the STVS of the system, due to the difficulty of obtaining analytical closed-form expressions, a practical optimization method for multi-IIDG is proposed for the optimal control parameters. The optimization is solved alternately based on the time-domain simulation (TDS) and the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) algorithm. The STVS is evaluated by a proposed quantitative indicator. According to the operation state of the system, the control strategy can be adjusted online. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified based on two test systems. Compared with other DVS capabilities, the STVS is further improved by considering distributed dynamic loads. The applicability and computational efficiency of the proposed method are discussed under various key conditions.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Fault Ride-Through Operation Strategy Based on Model Predictive Control for High Power Wind Turbine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10210001</link><description>This article presents an advanced fault ride-through control strategy based on model predictive control (MPC) of high-power wind turbine (WT), which is able to provide voltage support for power grid under symmetrical and asymmetrical grid faults. An optimal cost function is first established to realize multi-objective control of wind power converter, considering current regulation, neutral-point voltage balance, and switching frequency control. The flexible positive and negative sequence control (FPNSC) method is applied to generate the current references complying with converter current and voltage limitations. Simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experimental verification are implemented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed fault-ride through operation strategy. The verification results show that the proposed strategy is able to effectively support voltage and implement fault ride-through (FRT) during grid faults with optimized neutral-point voltage and average switching frequency. The proposed MPC strategy can address different fault conditions with good adaptivity. It thus enhances the operation performance of high-power WT during faults events.</description></item><item><title>A Fault Ride-Through Method for LVDC Networks With Photovoltaic Energy Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10214031</link><description>Fault ride-through (FRT) is key to DC distribution networks for both avoidance of system blocking and improvement of the safety of flexible DC devices in the face of faults. This article proposes an FRT method for low-voltage DC distribution networks with a photovoltaic energy storage system, which achieves rapid fault detection and constraint of fault current contributed by DC solid-state transformers (DCSST), making non-blocking FRT viable. An inductor-based current-limiting module (CLM) is designed to cooperate with capacitors on the output terminal of a DCSST to restrain current and maintain voltage in the wake of faults. The system voltage can recover to a stable level swiftly after the FRT process under temporary faults. Correspondingly, permanent faults can be reliably isolated by DC circuit breakers after a reasonable FRT delay to minimize their impacts. Finally, a DC distribution network with a CLM is modeled in PSCAD/EMTDC and a hardware-in-the-loop test platform to verify and validate the overall effects and performance of this proposed method. Consequently, effectiveness and superiority of this method is justified in the test, where the results highlight its quick, stable and controllable fault current suppression capabilities compared with existing FRT methods under various fault conditions.</description></item><item><title>Coordinative Planning of Public Transport Electrification, RESs and Energy Networks for Decarbonization of Urban Multi-Energy Systems: A Government-Market Dual-Driven Framework</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10225407</link><description>Synergy among renewable energy sources (RESs), energy network (EN) expansion and electrified transport provides a potential pathway toward low-carbon energy systems. However, the ambition of deep decarbonization may not be achieved by connecting all stakeholders through single market-wise effort. To this end, this article presents a coordinative planning framework of public transport electrification (PTE), RESs and ENs for decarbonization of urban multi-energy systems (UMESs). The framework is formulated as a three-level programming and driven by both government incentives and market signals. In the upper-level, the investment decision models of RESs, ENs and PTE are developed. Particularly, public transport hubs (PTHs) are viewed as flexible multi-energy demands whose potential of implementing demand response is incorporated in PTE planning model. In the middle-level, a carbon emission-security assessment subproblem is proposed, where market equilibriums are captured by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions; then the nested Benders decomposition and Lagrangian relaxation approach are utilized to synthetize capacity incentives paid by governments. In the lower-level, a hybrid energy pricing mechanism is designed to obtain integrated energy-carbon prices. The above hierarchical model is solved by an iterative algorithm where all investors update their planning decisions in a decentralized manner based on customized government incentives and market prices. Numerical studies prove that our proposed approach can effectively coordinate all stakeholders and promote the low-carbon transition of UMESs.</description></item><item><title>SoilingEdge: PV Soiling Power Loss Estimation at the Edge Using Surveillance Cameras</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268055</link><description>Solar panels are exposed to various pollutants in outdoor environments, such as dust, sediment, and bird excrement, which can cause the power generated by the panels to drop by up to 50%. To accurately estimate the power generated by photovoltaic (PV) systems, it is necessary to take into account the effects of soiling on the panels. In this article, we propose a deep learning approach that uses edge devices such as micro-controllers to estimate the power loss due to soiling based on images captured by surveillance cameras. The proposed model, called SoilingEdge, is based on MobileNet and has been implemented on several platforms, including CPUs, edge tensor processing units (EdgeTPUs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and vision processing units (VPUs). We present a comparative study of the performance of SoilingEdge on these different platforms and show that FPGA offers a balanced compromise between cost and inference performance, while VPU is the most cost-effective option, but has a slower execution time. Furthermore, the article also investigates the interpretability of the model through the visualization of attention maps, thus providing useful insights for researchers and engineers in understanding the model behaviors.</description></item><item><title>Impact of Battery Ramp Rate Limit on Virtual Synchronous Machine Stability During Frequency Events</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10234653</link><description>The fast growing penetration of renewable energy sources has led to increasing retirement of conventional power plants, which affects operational stability of electricity networks. Therefore, researchers have proposed virtual synchronous machine (VSM) techniques for inverter-based renewable generators to address the related instability issues. However, most of the studies consider a stiff or infinite DC source of VSMs, which does not reflect the reality of battery storage with limited ramp rates. In this article, a thorough investigation has been conducted to evaluate the impacts of VSM battery ramp rates on system stability during frequency events. Then, the mechanism of VSM instability with slow ramp rates has been analysed. The results show that the system may lose stability during the frequency events since the ramp rate significantly impacts the energy delivered during such contingency. The eigenvalues analysis has also been performed to investigate the impact of ramp rate limit on system stability. Potential solutions are proposed after analysing the mechanism of this instability, such as reducing the AC voltage control speed. This also reveals that VSMs with DC ramp rate restriction can not achieve a high AC voltage loop bandwidth as the traditional synchronous machines.</description></item><item><title>Rapid Active Power Support by Regional PV Aggregation Considering Physical Topological Correlation and Communication Delay</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10243633</link><description>Harnessing the rapid active power regulation potential of aggregated distributed photovoltaics (PVs) to support the bulk power system is crucial under high-penetration PV scenarios. In this article, based on a hierarchical architecture, the optimization and control strategies of distributed PVs are proposed to realize rapid active power support. In the upper level, to achieve reliable and rapid active power allocation, an optimal active power flow model incorporating the prediction uncertainty of distributed PVs and active power transmission loss is constructed, which can be solved in real-time by Chebyshev graph convolutional network (ChebNet). In the lower level, given the electrical interaction between distributed PVs, the optimal active power tracking of the distributed PVs is realized through reference voltage and current tracking control. Further, a delay-dependent distributed coordinated $ H_{\infty }$ controller is designed to achieve stable tracking in the presence of communication delays and load perturbations. Finally, simulations are performed on the modified IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 118-bus test systems, and the results verify the effectiveness and superiority of ChebNet, as well as the good accuracy, tracking speed, and robustness of the proposed control method.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Modeling and Stability Control Strategy of Integrated Energy System in Multi-Time Scales</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10239532</link><description>In this article, the overall framework of integrated energy system (IES) is established including the integrated dynamic models of electricity, gas, and heat networks. The operation mechanism, dynamic coupling, energy flow constraints, and multi-time scale coordination of IES are fully considered as the basis of stability control. Then, an innovative multi-time-scale stability control strategy is proposed to simultaneously control the dynamic stability of voltage, frequency, flow, pressure, and temperature based on discrete model predictive control (DMPC). The outputs of outer loop control in long-time scale are regarded as the model inputs and control objectives for the inner loop control in short-time scale. The optimal solutions of electricity, heat, and gas are simultaneously obtained without decoupling based on the established integrated dynamic models. The proposed stability control method simplifies and unifies the stability control mode of different energy forms. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the proposed scheme can synchronously achieve the control objectives (frequency/voltage/temperature/mass flow/pressure regulation).</description></item><item><title>Analysis of Wave Energy Conversion for Optimal Generator Sizing and Hybrid System Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10258409</link><description>The effective integration of offshore wind and wave energy is highly challenging due to their distinct intermittency characteristics. The power take-off (PTO) level power smoothing in the wave energy converter (WEC) is needed to reduce its power variations and optimize the generator and associated converter sizing. However, there is a lack of understanding of the impact of mechanical storage systems at the PTO on the WEC operation; hence, a guide on the selection of the electrical generator rating under a wide range of wave climates is missing. This article addresses these research gaps by using a representative point absorber WEC with a hydraulic PTO system. A general method of selecting the optimum generation system rating is proposed from the technical and economic viewpoints. In addition, the impacts of two mechanical storage systems (added inertia and gas accumulator) on WEC system efficiency and availability are investigated under four distinct levels of practical wave climates (399 sea states). It is shown that both mechanical storage methods can effectively reduce the generator ratings but their impacts vary under different wave climates. It is also concluded that the storage systems have limited impact on the optimal generator ratings, while wave specifications at various sea locations present a greater impact.</description></item><item><title>A Dynamic Equivalent Energy Storage Model of Natural Gas Networks for Joint Optimal Dispatch of Electricity-Gas Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10261292</link><description>The development of energy conversion techniques enhances the coupling between the gas network and power system. However, challenges remain in the joint optimal dispatch of electricity-gas systems. The dynamic model of the gas network, described by partial differential equations, is complex and computationally demanding for power system operators. Furthermore, information privacy concerns and limited accessibility to detailed gas network models by power system operators necessitate quantifying the equivalent energy storage capacity of gas networks. This article proposes a multi-port energy storage model with time-varying capacity to represent the dynamic gas state transformation and operational constraints in a compact and intuitive form. The model can be easily integrated into the optimal dispatch problem of the power system. Test cases demonstrate that the proposed model ensures feasible control strategies and significantly reduces the computational burden while maintaining high accuracy in the joint optimal dispatch of electricity-gas systems. In contrast, the existing static equivalent model fails to capture the full flexibility of the gas network and may yield infeasible results.</description></item><item><title>Protection of Doubly Fed Induction Generator-Based Wind Turbines Against Loss of Excitation of the Rotor Winding</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10265142</link><description>The doubly fed induction generator-based wind turbine (DFIG-WT) has an excitation system in the rotor winding (RW), provided from the machine terminal through a back-to-back converter which may be lost partially and/or completely due to the fault in the rotor-circuit. Accordingly, this article outlines a novel protection system for DFIG-WT against loss of excitation (LOE) of the RW. For this purpose, two parameters of the reactive power (Qs) and DC-link voltage (Vdc) have been comprehensively analyzed theoretically and through typical simulation studies. The results show that, although they have the potential for detecting the complete LOE (CLOE), the partial LOE (PLOE) cannot be detected by means of them. Hence, to precisely detect the CLOE, the derivative of multiplication of the parameters has been implemented. On the other hand, further exploration to find the suitable parameter to address the PLOE show that, the stator current (Isr) considering the proper settings, can be the most suitable indicator. The results from evaluation of the developed algorithm on a typical test system in MATLAB/Simulink (2017b) environment show its reliability and swiftness in addressing the LOE events.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Sizing and Siting of BESS in High Wind Penetrated Power Systems: A Strategy Considering Frequency and Voltage Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10269003</link><description>Battery energy storage system (BESS) is a prominent option to provide frequency and voltage support in high wind penetrated power systems. However, the high investment cost of BESS makes its optimal allocation a critical issue. To address this issue, this article proposes an optimal sizing and siting strategy of BESS in high wind penetrated power systems considering the coordinated frequency and voltage control. The key feature of this strategy lies in the fact that the control scheme is incorporated into allocation process, thus achieving the optimal allocation in a dynamic context. Specifically, the allocation problem is a linear programming problem with the objective of minimizing BESS investment cost. Meanwhile, the control scheme is established based on model predictive control (MPC) with the aim of frequency and voltage grid support. The MPC control problem is then embedded into the linear allocation problem, resulting in an integrated multi-objective optimization problem, which links the allocation domain and control domain. The generalized Benders decomposition is introduced to decompose the integrated optimization problem into a master problem and a set of subproblems, which can be solved iteratively and alternately. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Feedback Based Online Aggregate EV Power Flexibility Characterization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286155</link><description>As an essential measure to combat global warming, electric vehicles (EVs) have witnessed rapid growth. Flexible EVs can enhance power systems' ability to handle renewable generation uncertainties. How EV flexibility can be utilized in power grid operation has captured great attention. However, the direct control of individual EVs is challenging due to their small capacity and large number. Hence, it is the aggregator that interacts with the grid on behalf of the EVs by characterizing their aggregate flexibility. In this article, we focus on the aggregate EV power flexibility characterization problem. First, an offline model is built to obtain the lower and upper bounds of the aggregate EV power flexibility region. It ensures that any trajectory within the region is feasible. Then, considering that parameters such as real-time electricity prices and EV arrival/departure times are not known in advance, an online algorithm is developed based on Lyapunov optimization techniques. We provide a theoretical bound for the maximum charging delay under the proposed online algorithm. Furthermore, real-time feedback is designed and integrated into the proposed online algorithm to better unlock EV power flexibility. Comprehensive performance comparisons are carried out to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Joint Granular Model for Load, Solar and Wind Power Scenario Generation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286981</link><description>The main thrust of the article is the development of a joint stochastic model for electricity demand, and wind and solar power production in a given region. The model hinges on special statistical data analysis techniques including the estimation of heavy tail distributions, graphical LASSO fitting procedures, and conditional Monte Carlo simulations. Assuming the availability of point forecasts, we model the deviations from these forecasts instead of modeling the actual quantities of interest. The resolution of the model is determined by the resolution of the forecast data. For the sake of illustration, we implement our model and the corresponding simulation algorithms on data made available by NREL for the Texas region with hourly time resolution, load data at the zone level, and wind and solar power production at the generation asset level. Our numerical simulations confirm that the dependencies identified through the fitting algorithm are consistent with the relative locations of the production assets and the geographical load zones over which the data were collected.</description></item><item><title>A New Closed-Loop Solar Power Forecasting Method With Sample Selection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10288077</link><description>In this article, a new short-term solar power forecasting method is proposed which has a closed-loop structure composed of point-estimating and range-classifying parts. If the forecasts generated by these parts for solar power are inconsistent, the feedback loop sends appropriate signals to them to correct their predictions. The feedback loop iterates until consistent forecasts are generated for the solar power by the point-estimating and range-classifying parts. This enables the proposed closed-loop forecasting method to enhance its solar power prediction accuracy and reliability. Furthermore, a novel sample selection approach, different from feature selection methods, is devised to mine the historical data for finding the most informative training samples for training the proposed forecasting engine. The effectiveness of the proposed solar power forecasting method is illustrated by testing it on some real-world solar farms and comparing its results with the results of several state-of-the-art solar power prediction methods.</description></item><item><title>On the Forecastability of Solar Energy Generation by Rooftop Panels Pointed in Different Directions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10169105</link><description>By increasing the penetration of small-scale rooftop solar panels, forecasting their output has become important to both homeowners and distribution systems operators. In many areas, the roof of residential houses is not such that all solar panels are installed pointing in one direction; so, they are installed pointing in different directions. In this letter, the effect of this phenomenon on the forecastability of the day-ahead solar panels' power output is experimentally investigated. To perform day-ahead energy forecasting, a feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) is created using historical data and weather conditions of a similar day along with the forecast weather conditions of the day for which the forecast is to be performed. A similar day selection algorithm based on Euclidean distance is used to determine the reference day. Two forecasting approaches have been compared: forecasting each panel output and forecasting the total output. Moreover, Long short-term memory (LSTM) is used to validate the conclusion made by the feedforward ANN. The results evidently show that considering different directions of the solar panels increases the forecastability of the rooftop solar power plant.</description></item><item><title>Control Solution to Over-Modulation of DFIG Converter for Asymmetrical Fault Ride Through</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10119222</link><description>This letter proposes a control solution to mitigate the problem of converter over-modulation in doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbine generators (WTGs). Overmodulation is a critical reason in failing to ride through asymmetrical faults and inject positive- and negative-sequence reactive currents (I1R and I2R) per grid code requirements. Analytical expressions are first proposed to independently calculate the transient, positive- and negative-sequence current components. The I2R injection factor is then optimized to mitigate the problem of steady-state over-modulation. The transient components are eliminated in the inner-loop control to mitigate the problem of transient over-modulation. The proposed control solution is validated with EMT-type simulations. The results show that the transient performance and the fault ride through (FRT) capability are significantly improved.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Stochastic Frequency Constrained Micro-Market Model for Isolated Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10103548</link><description>With the developments of isolated microgrids (IMGs) and prosumers in remote areas, energy trading has emerged as a critical aspect of IMGs. However, the lack of an upstream network and the low inertia of the system may threaten the secure operation of these networks. This paper proposes a Micro-Market  $(\mu \text{M}$ ) model for IMGs that includes a precise hierarchical control structure. To address the IMG&#8217;s low inertia and high intermittency of renewable energy sources (RES), the proposed  $\mu \text{M}$  manages the active-reactive power and schedules primary and secondary active reserves to maintain the frequency within in a predefined range. Additionally, a bidirectional linearized AC power flow is established to schedule the reactive reserve and the proposed model is formulated as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear problem (MILP) to maximize social welfare (SW) over the next 24 hours. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, the  $\mu \text{M}$  is tested on an IMG based on a CIGRE medium-voltage benchmark system, and different operational cases are simulated. The results demonstrate that the proposed model, which takes into account hierarchical control levels and technical issues of the IMG, is a cost-effective way to maximize social welfare while ensuring the secure operation of the IMG.</description></item><item><title>Coordinated Predictive Secondary Control for DC Microgrids Based on High-Order Fully Actuated System Approaches</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10102303</link><description>The problem of voltage recovery and current balancing has been a hot research topic in the field of DC microgrids. How to build a model that reflects the circuit and component-level control (e.g., inner control loops) characteristics and design a secondary controller based on it to accomplish the above output regulations is the concern of this paper. Accordingly, in this paper, based on the large-signal model of microgrids, the corresponding high-order fully actuated model is developed for DC microgrids, which is not only simple in form but also able to capture the details of the actual power system, such as the relationship between voltage and current. Further, a distributed predictive fully actuated secondary control strategy is proposed based on the developed model to achieve voltage recovery and accurate current sharing. Allowing one to design the secondary controller free from the constraints of physical coupling in the microgrid is one feature of this control strategy, while the other is the arbitrarily assignable closed-loop poles. An analytical model of the closed-loop DC microgrid system with predictive fully actuated secondary control is developed, and the analysis of stability and output current consensus is presented therewith. Extensive tests on a hardware system of a DC microgrid with solar panels and an MPPT controller are performed to validate the performance of the designed controller.</description></item><item><title>A General Framework for the Power Flow Solution in Radial and Meshed AC/DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10109775</link><description>The advent of AC/DC microgrids generated the need to research and develop power flow algorithms to assist in the planning of these microgrids. The main objective of the research carried out in this paper is to present a general framework for the power flow in AC/DC microgrids with multiple interlinking converters. This framework is based on the superposition principle and the solution of small nonlinear subproblem to determine the angular frequency, power flow through interlinking converters and voltages at the reference nodes. This framework was used to derive two algorithms: one based on the Current Summation Method, for radial microgrids, and another based on the Gauss-Zbus Method, for meshed microgrids. Test results with 45 and 906 nodes microgrids showed that the proposed power flow algorithms have: (i) the same accuracy as the Newton-Raphson Method; (ii) good scalability in terms of computational cost; (iii) robustness against random variations in microgrid parameters (the number of iterations varies only from 4 to 5) and branches contingencies; (iv) computational costs savings of 81% to 98% compared to the Newton-Raphson Method; (v) speed up from 5 to 44 times in relation to the Newton-Raphson Method; (vi) fast convergence characteristic.</description></item><item><title>Control of Distributed Converter-Based Resources in a Zero-Inertia Microgrid Using Robust Deep Learning Neural Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10117561</link><description>Considering the evolution of future microgrids (MGs) towards zero-inertia level due to the penetrations of distributed converter-based resources (DCRs), a large number of data produced by these generations will lead the control decisions to be more complicated than conventional power systems. This paper presents a control strategy for a zero-inertia MG with DCRs using a robust deep learning neural network (RDeNN). In a training phase, a sub-space state-based identification method is employed to monitor and analyze the data regarding stability indices, i.e., damping and frequency of dominant modes, and robustness against uncertainties. In addition, a mixed  $H_{2}/H_{\infty }$  control strategy is applied to enhance the training efficacy in the frequency and voltage control loops of DCRs. The trained RDeNN is activated to make quick and effective control decisions by using only measured signals from the MG. Simulation results are verified in the zero-inertia MG (or the grid with 100% DCRs) and compared with several existing control techniques. The study results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed RDeNN in many aspects such as low computational time, require-less physical controller models, fast and flexible stabilizing responses, and high robustness against various time delays, data quality issues, and MG uncertainties.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Secondary Frequency Control of Autonomous Microgrids via Adaptive Robust -Gain Performance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10124785</link><description>This paper presents an innovative passivity-based  $L_{2}$ -gain performance  $(L_{2}$ -GP) adaptive robust control method for the design of primary and secondary frequency control in the low-inertia microgrid with lines and the inverter-interfaced generation. First, by exploiting and analyzing the internal structural properties, the Port-controlled Kuramoto-Hamiltonian model with dissipation for the microgrid system is derived. Combining the dynamics of Kuramoto oscillators with energy viewpoints and following the physical features of dynamic energy coordination in the microgrid, an adaptive robust  $L_{2}$ -GP decentralized secondary control is developed to guarantee frequency restoration and active power sharing. An adaptive mechanism is adopted to estimate the electrical parameters so that the parameter randomness can be overcome and fast transient response, high performance, and robust stability can be achieved. Via local measurements, the decentralized framework accordingly obviates the need of any communication links for information broadcast or exchange. Finally, the comprehensive case studies are presented to validate satisfactory performance under rapid randomness and flexibility during plug-and-play operations.</description></item><item><title>Inverter PQ Control With Trajectory Tracking Capability for Microgrids Based on Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10128154</link><description>The increasing penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) calls for an advanced active and reactive power (PQ) control strategy in microgrids. To enhance the controllability and flexibility of the IBRs, this paper proposes an adaptive PQ control method with trajectory tracking capability, combining model-based analysis, physics-informed reinforcement learning (RL), and power hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments. First, model-based analysis proves that there exists an adaptive proportional-integral controller with time-varying gains that can ensure any exponential PQ output trajectory of IBRs. These gains consist of a constant factor and an exponentially decaying factor, which are then obtained using a model-free deep RL approach known as the twin delayed deeper deterministic policy gradient. With the model-based derivation, the learning space of the RL agent is narrowed down from a function space to a real space, which reduces the training complexity significantly. Finally, the proposed method is verified through numerical simulation in MATLAB-Simulink and power HIL experiments in the CURENT center. With the physics-informed learning method, exponential response time constants can be freely assigned to IBRs, and they can follow any predefined trajectory without complicated gain tuning.</description></item><item><title>Stabilization of DC Microgrids Under Cyber Attacks-Optimal Design and Sensitivity Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10130073</link><description>Due to increased efforts on digitizing the modern power electronic systems and microgrids, their operational reliability and stability are prone to the risk of cyber attacks.

Based on different design requirements, optimal values are theoretically obtained and then tested on microgrids having different parameters in a simulation environment, which justifies the ruggedness of the proposed design approach. We provide a generalized philosophy, which can be easily extended to the overall design, stability and parameter sensitivity of cyber-physical energy systems.</description></item><item><title>Large-Signal Stability Analysis of AC Micro-Grid Under Quadratic Droop Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10138078</link><description>Quadratic droop control is an innovative control strategy for power network, aiming to respect the inherently quadratic nature of reactive power flow. However, the system stability under quadratic droop control has not been addressed completely so far. This paper mainly focuses on the large-signal stability analysis of the AC network under quadratic droop control. We firstly analyze the stability of each equilibrium, it is concluded that the high-voltage equilibrium is stable as long as it exists while all low-voltage equilibria are unstable. Secondly, an analytical energy function for the system under quadratic droop control is established. It is proved that the high-voltage equilibrium is the local minimum of the proposed energy function while all the low-voltage equilibria are saddle points. Thirdly, to estimate the region of attraction (ROA) of the high-voltage equilibrium, an innovative method based on the analytical energy function is proposed. Comparing with the closest UEP method, the proposed ROA method significantly reduce the amount of computations. Simulation results verify the proposed theorems.</description></item><item><title>Aging Rate Equalization Strategy for Battery Energy Storage Systems in Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10136844</link><description>It is urgent to reduce the maintenance burden and extend the service life of recycled batteries used in microgrids. However, the corresponding balancing techniques mainly focus on the state of health (SOH) balancing for unique converter structures or with complex SOH estimators. This paper proposes an aging rate equalization strategy for microgrid-scale battery energy storage systems (BESSs). Firstly, the aging rate equalization principle is established based on the relationship among throughput, state of charge (SOC), and injected/output power of a BESS, which is obtained according to the semi-empirical life model of the battery. Second, based on the established principle, the droop coefficients of energy storage systems (ESUs) are designed in the lower-level control, which can ensure the aging rate equalization of ESUs in one. The upper-level control optimizes the output of multiple microgrids. Then, the stability of the proposed aging rate equalization strategy is proven by a small-signal analysis. The performance analysis shows that the proposed aging rate equalization can also realize SOC balance. Finally, the RTLAB hardware-in-the-loop tests are carried out to illustrate the outstanding performance of the proposed strategy for extending the battery service life and ensuring microgrid operation stability.</description></item><item><title>Reinforcement Learning-Based Integrated Control to Improve the Efficiency of DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10154007</link><description>The hierarchical control of the DC microgrid regulates the terminal voltages of the interfacing converter to achieve proportional load sharing and good voltage regulation at the DC bus. In doing so, the difference of the voltage at different nodes increases which results in higher circulating current and leads to higher losses. In this paper, a Reinforcement Learning Based Integrated Control (RLIC) is proposed which will minimize the circulating current and power losses in the transmission. The proposed RLIC consists of a primary and secondary controller. The primary controller is a robust sliding mode controller which receives the voltage references from secondary controller and regulates the terminal voltage and source current accordingly. The secondary control consists of a proportional integral control (PI), and a Deep Neural Network (DNN) surrogate model with implementation of Q-Learning as reinforcement method. A novel DNN based surrogate model uses the droop value from the PI controller and estimates the power loss and the local and global loading difference for a particular node, for a set of operating condition. This surrogate model is used by the Q-Learning based reinforcement technique which adjusts the droop constants and provide the voltage reference to primary controller to maintain load sharing and reduce the power losses, there-by leading to an improved overall efficiency. The proposed control structure is verified to improve efficiency while maintaining the load sharing and bus voltage regulation.</description></item><item><title>An Extended State Observer Based Adaptive Backstepping Controller for Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10158046</link><description>This paper proposes development of a robust distributed secondary control scheme for a photovoltaic (PV) source integrated and inverter-interfaced islanded AC microgrid (MG). The control objective is to regulate the voltage, frequency, and achieve the desired active and reactive power sharing among the distributed generations (DGs) while supporting plug and play operation (PnP) and handling abnormal situations. The above objectives are to be achieved in face of uncertainties in inverter switching pulses, intermittent nature of PV source, dynamic load changes, and disturbances. A backstepping (BS) controller is designed to track the nominal voltage and frequency, whilst an extended state observer (ESO) is designed to estimate the disturbance. The stability of the MG with ESO-BS controller is proved by using Lyapunov stability theory, and graph theory. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller, both numerical simulation in MATLAB, and experimentation on OPAL-RT at different operating conditions are pursued. The proposed controller is compared with the distributed averaging based secondary control (Simpson-Porco et al., 2015), secondary controller based on MG centralized controller (MGCC) (Shafiee et al., 2014). It is observed that the proposed controller outperforms in terms of enhanced robustness and steady-state performance.</description></item><item><title>Systematic Methods to Eliminate the Transient Circulating Powers in the Multi-VSGs System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10158393</link><description>When multiple virtual synchronous generators (VSG)s operate in parallel in an islanded microgrid, the sudden load power change could lead to significant transient circulating (and oscillating) power. In this paper, the transient circulating power is first analyzed with the two-VSGs small signal model. On this basis, the paper defines parameter design principles that theoretically eliminate all transient circulating power. Due to the line impedances uncertainty in practice, the ideal parameter design is not always available. Then, to suppress the remaining transient circulating power, an enhanced VSG (EVSG) control strategy is further proposed, by deriving and revising a two-VSGs transfer function from load disturbance to power angles difference. The proposed parameter design principles and the EVSG can be applied sequentially, so that the transient circulating power can be systematically suppressed without the side-effects as in existing methods. An experimental platform with 3 VSGs is established. The parameter design principles and the EVSG are thoroughly validated by experimental results. This is also the first time the 3-VSGs experimental results are reported, while all the existing literature has 2-VSGs data. It confirms that the two-VSGs analytical results can be extended to systems with more VSGs.</description></item><item><title>An Edge Computing-Oriented Islanding Detection Using Differential Entropy and Multi-Support Vector Machines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10159133</link><description>This paper presents an edge computing-oriented islanding detection paradigm using multi-support vector machines (SVM) and differential entropy. The proposed methodology can detect islanding events and locate which microgrid was disconnected in a distribution system with microgrid cluster. The proposed method employs multi-SVMs in the cloud to detect and locate potential islanding events in power distribution systems. The accuracy and reliability of the results of SVMs are enhanced by introducing differential entropy for quantitative evaluation. Additionally, the method decomposes the SVM inference process at the edge, enabling edge devices with low computational power and limited resources to support data-driven algorithms without compromising accuracy and speed. An extensive study is performed on the modified IEEE123 distribution system established in real-time digital simulation. Simulation results elucidate that the proposed method can accurately and promptly detect system islanding operations with zero non-detection zone. Comparison with other methods illustrates the superiority of the proposed method in terms of discrimination accuracy, detection time, and reliability.</description></item><item><title>Robust Energy Management for Multi-Microgrids Based on Distributed Dynamic Tube Model Predictive Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10167773</link><description>Multi-microgrids (MMGs) provide an effective modality to integrate high-penetration renewable energy as well as other distributed sources. However, the inherent uncertainties from nature and load demand significantly impact the secure operation of the MMGs system. Considering these challenges, this paper proposes a novel intraday robust energy management framework based on the distributed dynamic tube model predictive control (DD-TMPC) method for autonomous multi-microgrids, which has less conservativeness and more economic efficiency. The proposed strategy can dynamically capture the security operation range of the microgrid system based on the set theory and utilize two cooperative MPC controllers to decompose the original uncertainty optimal problem into two different time scale deterministic uncertainty-free scheduling problems, which have lower computation complexity. Furthermore, in order to better balance the robustness and economy of system operation, a game theory-based intraday distributed energy trading mechanism is designed which considers both the transaction expectations of the market participants and the efficiency of the equilibrium solution. Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed DD-TMPC strategy.</description></item><item><title>Physics-Informed Graphical Representation-Enabled Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robust Distribution System Voltage Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10113230</link><description>The anomalous measurements and inaccurate distribution system physical models cause huge challenges for distribution system optimization. This paper proposes a robust voltage control method that can deal with them by systematically integrating a representation network, the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method, and the surrogate model. The partial observation of the distribution network is first represented as a graph with tree topology that is processed by a physics-informed global graph attention network (GGAT) and a deep auto-encoder (DAE) to achieve informative and robust representation of the real-time and pseudo-measurements. The extracted features are then fed into the soft actor-critic algorithm, during the training of which a graphical-learning-based power flow surrogate model is developed to provide a reward signal for the DRL algorithm. This allows the proposed method to reduce reliance on accurate distribution system parameters. The embedding of the structural information by the GGAT and the informative features extracted by the DAE further enhances the robustness of the proposed method against anomalous measurements. The proposed method is validated using IEEE 33-node and 119-node systems. Simulation results show the robustness of the proposed method against anomalous measurements.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Affinely Adjustable Robust Volt/VAr Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10108906</link><description>Recent years have seen the increasing proliferation of distributed energy resources with intermittent power outputs, posing new challenges to the voltage management in distribution networks. To this end, this paper proposes a data-driven affinely adjustable robust Volt/VAr control (AARVVC) scheme, which modulates the smart inverter&#8217;s reactive power in an affine function of its active power, based on the voltage sensitivities with respect to real/reactive power injections. To achieve a fast and accurate estimation of voltage sensitivities, we propose a data-driven method based on deep neural network (DNN), together with a rule-based bus-selection process using the bidirectional search method. Our method only uses the operating statuses of selected buses as inputs to DNN, thus significantly improving the training efficiency and reducing information redundancy. Finally, a distributed consensus-based solution, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), for the AARVVC is applied to decide the inverter&#8217;s reactive power adjustment rule with respect to its active power. Only limited information exchange is required between each local agent and the central agent to obtain the slope of the reactive power adjustment rule, and there is no need for the central agent to solve any (sub)optimization problems. Numerical results on the modified IEEE-123 bus system validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed data-driven AARVVC method.</description></item><item><title>Multiplexing Power Converters for Cost-Effective and Flexible Soft Open Points</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10109836</link><description>The feasible set of real powers that can be transferred by a three-terminal Soft Open Point (SOP) can be increased by selecting non-uniform power ratings for each of the three ac/dc legs of the SOP, then connecting a multi-terminal switch (multiplexer) to the ac side of each of those converters to facilitate reconfiguration. This paper generalizes this concept, considering the real and reactive power that  $n$  multiplexed ac/dc converters can transfer at an  $m$ -feeder bus. The performance of the device is studied numerically for a number of ac/dc sizing strategies through the volume of the feasible set of power transfers (the &#8216;capability chart volume&#8217;, CCV) and distribution system loss reduction benefits (as an exemplar network service). Upper bounds on device performance are defined by considering the performance of a novel, idealised SOP consisting of a continuum of infinitesimal reconfigurable converters. Results demonstrate that the CCV can be more than doubled, with 99% of the relative performance improvement of the idealised converter achieved with designs consisting of as few as four converters. SOP equipment costs reductions of 24% are reported, with it concluded that reconfigurable, judiciously sized ac/dc legs can yield flexible and lower cost SOPs than conventional, hard-wired approaches.</description></item><item><title>A Simulation-Assisted Proactive Scheduling Method for Secure Microgrid Formation Under Static and Transient Islanding Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122619</link><description>Microgrids (MGs) provide a promising solution to ensure the constant power supply under extreme conditions due to their islanding ability. However, unintentional islanding caused by emergencies may trigger significant a power imbalance in MGs, leading to unsuccessful MG formation in the event that static or transient operational constraints are violated. To address this challenge, we propose a proactive distribution system scheduling method to continue serving critical loads in emergencies by forming reliable MGs. The power flow on the lines is restricted prior to interruption to mitigate the power imbalance in MGs when equipment failures occur. Both static and transient constraints are incorporated into the proposed model to ensure the adequacy of MGs in supplying demands and transient security during the islanding transition. Note that the inclusion of nonlinear transient constraints makes it difficult to solve the model directly. Thus, a two-level simulation-assisted solution approach is presented, where simulation level sends the maximum allowable power imbalance in the MGs to optimization level to determine optimal scheduling schemes. By interfacing with a transient simulation of MGs, the frequency dynamics are exactly incorporated into the constraints. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in secure islanding transition and MG survivability improvement.</description></item><item><title>Chance-Constrained Optimization of Storage and PFC Capacity for Railway Electrical Smart Grids Considering Uncertain Traction Load</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10124245</link><description>To foster the utilization of regeneration braking energy and suppress voltage unbalance (VU), a railway electrical smart grid (RESG), intergraded with power flow controller (PFC) and energy storage (ES), is proposed as an important part of next-generation electrified railways. However, under the uncertain traction load, how to design the optimal size of PFC-ES is a challenge during the planning period. Hence, this paper proposes a chance-constrained two-stage programming approach. The first-stage aims to minimising the overall cost of RESG&#8217;s devices. The second-stage aims to arrange the energy flow of the PFC-ES with the objective of minimising the expected operation cost under the dynamic VU restriction, and the stochastics characteristics of traction load are transformed into a chance constraint by using a scenario approach. Then, traction power predictions are combined with multivariate Gaussian Mixture Model (multi-GMM) model to generate correlated traction power flow scenarios and to assess VU probabilistic metrics distribution with different confidence levels. Finally, a novel algorithm is designed to select the confidence level and violation probability so that the capacity planning results can ensure the high-efficient and high-quality operation of the RESG. Case studies based on an actual electrified railway demonstrate that the proposed PFC-ES sizing approach can reduce the overall cost by up to 13%.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Agent Safe Graph Reinforcement Learning for PV Inverters-Based Real-Time Decentralized Volt/Var Control in Zoned Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10128717</link><description>To realize real-time voltage/var control (VVC) in active distribution networks (ADNs), this paper proposes a new multi-agent safe graph reinforcement learning method to optimize reactive power output from PV inverters. The network is divided into several zones, and a decentralized framework is proposed for coordinated control of reactive power output in each zone to regulate voltage profiles and minimize network energy loss. The VVC problem is formulated as a multi-agent decentralized partially observable constrained Markov decision process. Each zone has a central control agent that embeds graph convolution networks (GCNs) in the policy network to improve the decision-making capability. The GCN extracts graph-structured features from the ADN topology, reflecting the relationship between VVC and grid topology, and can filter noise and impute missing data. The training process includes primal-dual policy optimization to rigorously satisfy voltage safety constraints. Simulations on a 141-bus distribution system demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively minimize network energy loss and reduce voltage deviations, even in the presence of noisy or incomplete input measurements.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Design of Volt/VAR Control Rules for Inverter-Interfaced Distributed Energy Resources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10136392</link><description>The IEEE 1547 Standard for the interconnection of distributed energy resources (DERs) to distribution grids provisions that smart inverters could be implementing Volt/VAR control rules among other options. Such rules enable DERs to respond autonomously in response to time-varying grid loading conditions. The rules comprise affine droop control augmented with a deadband and saturation regions. Nonetheless, selecting the shape of these rules is not an obvious task, and the default options may not be optimal or dynamically stable. To this end, this work develops a novel methodology for customizing Volt/VAR rules on a per-bus basis for a single-phase feeder. The rules are adjusted by the utility every few hours depending on anticipated demand and solar scenarios. Using a projected gradient descent-based algorithm, rules are designed to improve the feeders voltage profile, comply with IEEE 1547 constraints, and guarantee stability of the underlying nonlinear grid dynamics. The stability region is inner approximated by a polytope and the rules are judiciously parameterized so their feasible set is convex. Numerical tests using real-world data on the IEEE 141-bus feeder corroborate the scalability of the methodology and explore the trade-offs of Volt/VAR control with alternatives.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Quasi-Power Differential Protection Scheme for Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10153766</link><description>With the massive integration of distributed generations (DGs), distribution networks gradually become more active and flexible. Conventional overcurrent protection is difficult to adapt to such active distribution networks (ADNs). Current differential protection (CDP) is a good choice for solving this issue, but the multi-branch structure of ADNs especially the unmeasured T-connected load branch affects the protection&#8217;s sensitivity. Therefore, the paper proposes a quasi-power differential protection (QDP) scheme based on Tellegen&#8217;s theorem. First, the feasibility of applying Tellegen&#8217;s theorem to ADNs was analyzed. On this basis, reasonable protection criteria were designed for different scenarios of ADNs. Then, an adaptive protection scheme was established, which can automatically adjust the criteria depending on the presence of T-connected branches within the protected section. Finally, extensive simulations were carried out in an ADN model using PSCAD/EMTDC software. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protection scheme has excellent adaptability to network topologies, fault types, fault resistances, and network structures of ADNs.</description></item><item><title>Supply Restoration of Data Centers in Flexible Distribution Networks With Spatial-Temporal Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10154016</link><description>The reliable operation of Internet data centers (IDCs) is crucial to digitization transformation of society. However, the extreme fault on the IDC-located distribution network is fatal to IDC operation. The evolution of flexible distribution networks (FDNs) can satisfy the deep dependence of IDC on high-quality and reliable power supply. In FDNs, AC/DC feeders with multiple voltage levels can be flexibly interconnected and adjusted by flexible stations (FSs). It is promising to flexibly enhance operation performance of crucial IDCs after fault isolation in FDNs. In this paper, a coordinated supply restoration method of IDCs in FDNs with spatial-temporal regulation is proposed to minimize IDC data-dropping loss under complex faults. First, a spatial-temporal transfer strategy of IDC workloads is precisely formulated and an FS-based network reconfiguration strategy is proposed. Then, a mixed-integer second-order conic programming model is established for efficient solving. Spatial-temporal coordination among the source, network, storage, and demand sides can be realized without violating physical feasibility. Finally, the proposed method is validated on the modified IEEE 33-node and modified IEEE 123-node test cases. Case studies show that total outage loss is effectively reduced with sufficient utilization of available power. Operational performance of FDN is also enhanced under extreme faults.</description></item><item><title>Fast and Generic Energy Flow Analysis of the Integrated Electric Power and Heating Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10098886</link><description>Energy flow analysis is a fundamental tool to determine the network states of the integrated energy systems (IES). For the widely deployed IES with coupled power grids (PG) and heating networks (HN), we still lack a generic tool that can be easily employed to calculate the quasi-dynamic energy flows of it. In this paper, we have developed a generic code package (named as MATHN) for energy flow analysis of the quality-regulated HN. After that, a generic solution framework that leverages MATPOWER and MATHN to realize decomposed energy flow calculation of PG and HN is proposed. Behind the MATHN tool, a model reformulation technique is proposed to eliminate the massive indirect variables of the basic HN model discretized by finite difference, which finally derives a compact matrix formulation (similar to the network equation of power grid:  $\boldsymbol {I}=\boldsymbol {Y}\boldsymbol {U}$ ) for generic description of any HN and also slashes the original model scale by around 20 times. Moreover, the solution strategy behind the MATHN tool further converts this matrix formulation into a standard system of non-homogeneous linear equations, with which some existing well-recognized algorithms can be directly applied for efficient and accurate solution. Case studies on three different scales of test systems demonstrate the generality, efficiency and accuracy of our methods. All the codes and input data are packaged into the MATHN tool and are made open-source for non-commercial use.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Scheduling of Micro-Energy Grid Based on Pareto Frontier Under Uncertainty and Pollutant Emissions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10120983</link><description>With the continuous improvement of micro-energy grid, in order to reduce carbon emissions and environmental pollution, a multi-objective optimization operation strategy considering the distributed energy generation uncertainty, environmental factors, and self-supply rate is proposed in this paper. First, to simulate the uncertainty of distributed energy, we used the three-parameter Weibull distribution to simulate the wind power. Then, for the load side, an innovative electric and thermal comprehensive demand response model is proposed. Different from the traditional micro energy network that only considers the heat energy balance, this paper also considers the thermal inertia of buildings to more accurately describe the characteristic of the heat load. Meanwhile, on the basis of economic factors, the abandon rate of distributed energy, environmental coefficient and self-sufficiency rate are also regarded as three objective functions. Finally, in order to obtaining a set of solutions at the Pareto front, the entropy-weighted TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) method is introduced to obtain the global optimal solution. Simulation study of multiple scenarios shows the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with the method that considers only economic costs, the pollutant emissions are reduced by 50kg and self-power supply rate is increased by 20%.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Model Predictive Consensus Control for Stable Operation of Integrated Energy System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10153774</link><description>The stable operation of the integrated energy system (IES) is affected by the fluctuation of heat or electricity loads, energy or communication problems, and the interaction of different energy networks. To overcome above challenges, firstly, the integrated dynamic models with three-time scales are established for control design, fully considering dynamic behaviors, energy coupling, and constraints of power flow including electrical, heat and gas on network stability. Then, a novel distributed model predictive control (DMPC) consensus algorithm with process control and trajectory control is proposed to achieve stable operation for IES based on second-order cone programming (SOCP). A unified distributed cooperative control mode is formed in IES by implementing the proposed stability control method, which is suitable for different forms of energy. The control design takes into account the different dynamic characteristics of energy equipment and the energy coupling feature, which realizes the multi-scale time cooperation and dynamic process control for IES by tuning the control parameters. The optimal solution is obtained by rolling optimization for achieving frequency/voltage/temperature/pressure/flow regulation and consensus objectives. Finally, the proposed model and method are validated in various simulation scenarios, such as load variation, energy flow variation, nodes removed, and topology change.</description></item><item><title>Exploiting the Flexibility Potential of Water Distribution Networks: A Pilot Project in Belgium</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10113853</link><description>Flexibility, and in particular, energy storage is expected to assume a key role in the efficient and secure operation of the power system, and thus, in the transition towards a carbon-free electricity sector. In this paper, we propose a methodology for exploiting the flexibility existing in water distribution systems from water storage in reservoirs. The methodology relies first on a modelling approach, from which an optimization problem is defined. The resolution of this optimization problem leads to an operating pattern for the pumps. The methodology assumes that all the electricity is bought on the day-ahead market, where the bids are placed by constructing and solving an optimization problem. The uncertain water consumption and the electricity market prices are predicted using machine learning techniques. The methodology is tested on a real-life water distribution network in Belgium and the results from the pilot project indicate a cost reduction up to 11%.</description></item><item><title>Sequential Clearing of Network-Aware Local Energy and Flexibility Markets in Community-Based Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10124246</link><description>In this paper, network-aware clearing algorithms for local energy markets (LEMs) and local flexibility markets (LFM) are proposed to be sequentially run and coordinate assets and flexible resources of energy communities (ECs) in distribution networks. In the proposed LEM clearing algorithm, EC managers run a two-stage stochastic programming while considering random events by scenario generation and network constraints using linearized DistFlow. As one of outcomes, maximum available up- and down-regulations provided by ECs are estimated in LEM and communicated to LFM. In the distributed LFM clearing algorithm, an iterative auction is designed using a dual-decomposition technique (Augmented Lagrangian) which is solved by consensus alternating direction method of multipliers. The LFM algorithm efficiently dispatches the flexibility provided by ECs in operating time while considering flexibility local marginal price as pricing method. Network constraints are included in the algorithm with an AC distribution optimal power flow for dynamic network topology in which branches and buses are decomposed to solve the problem in distributed fashion. The designed LFM algorithm can respond to exogenous and endogenous signals for flexibility requests. The simulation results in a test case display effectiveness of two proposed LEM and LFM algorithms for an efficient provision of flexibility.</description></item><item><title>Carbon-Aware Operation of Resilient Vertical Farms in Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10158433</link><description>Vertical farming is an emerging sustainable solution to enhance the resilience of the food supply and mitigate the carbon emissions of the agriculture sector amidst population growth, geopolitical risks, and climate change concerns. The proximity of food production to consumers enhances food supply resilience. Besides, the potential to leverage renewable resources to energize Vertical Farms (VF s) paves the way to mitigating their food carbon emissions. At the same time, VF s will introduce new challenges and opportunities within Active Distribution Networks (ADN s). While the electricity demand will increase within the ADN, the flexibility in VF &#8217;s electricity demand provides system operators with demand-side management opportunities. This paper proposes a model to explore the demand of various systems within a VF and their coordination with other assets within the ADN, such as Electric Vehicles (EV s) and photovoltaic (PV) systems. To this end, a framework to procure the optimal operation schedule of VF s under demand and solar generation uncertainties with convexified AC power flow constraints is presented. It is shown that the proposed framework also enhances the dispatchability of renewable Distributed Energy Resources (DER s). The formulated two-stage robust optimization problem is reformulated as a Mixed-Integer Second-Order Cone Programming (MISOCP) problem to be solved by reliable off-the-shelf solvers. It is shown that the demand response of VF s can mitigate the carbon emissions of the electricity and agriculture sectors by up to 70% and decrease the operation cost of the electricity network by 10% for the IEEE-33 bus system compared to utilizing an inflexible schedule for VF s.</description></item><item><title>Assessing Quantum Computing Performance for Energy Optimization in a Prosumer Community</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10153446</link><description>The efficient management of energy communities relies on the solution of the &#8220;prosumer problem&#8221;, i.e., the problem of scheduling the household loads on the basis of the user needs, the electricity prices, and the availability of local renewable energy, with the aim of reducing costs and energy waste. Quantum computers can offer a significant breakthrough in treating this problem thanks to the intrinsic parallel nature of quantum operations. The most promising approach is to devise variational hybrid algorithms, in which quantum computation is driven by parameters that are optimized classically, in a cycle that aims at finding the best solution with a significant speed-up with respect to classical approaches. This paper provides a reformulation of the prosumer problem, allowing to address it with a hybrid quantum algorithm, namely, Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), and with a recent variant, the Recursive QAOA. We report on an extensive set of experiments, on simulators and real quantum hardware, for different problem sizes.

To address this issue, a resource aggregator (RA) has emerged to provide flexible solutions through aggregating the prosumers and demand response such as dynamic pricing. This paper proposes an optimal strategy for the RA that dispatches dynamic pricing to the prosumers and leverages the battery system at both RA and prosumer levels. The proposed method is based on a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to optimize each prosumer&#8217;s retail prices and schedule usage of the RA&#8217;s battery power station. An objective reward function is used to maximize the RA&#8217;s profit, minimize the prosumer&#8217;s cost, and maximize the improvement of the duck curve. The performance of the proposed DRL-based strategy was demonstrated by simulation experiments using actual wholesale price, demand, and PV generation data. The results show that the proposed strategy can improve the standard deviation and peak-to-average ratio of net load by up to 57.1% and 23%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Economic Model Predictive Control for Microgrid Optimization: A Review</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10098893</link><description>Microgrids have emerged as a promising solution to integrate distributed energy resources (DERs) and supply reliable and efficient electricity.

To tackle this challenge, a fault current unified calculation (FCUC) method is proposed to achieve high-accuracy and high-speed mathematical analytical calculations of DFIG&#8217;s output fault current during FRT. The proposed FCUC method mainly includes: 1) Whole process unified state space model, which contains transition stage, crowbar protection stage, demagnetization stage, reactive current compensation stage, and dc-chopper protection stage, is established to thoroughly consider FRT&#8217;s different internal protection circuits and control strategies; 2) Stator output fault current is conducted by the unified state space model based on the stator residual voltage and the stator flux linkage; 3) Grid side converter (GSC) output fault current, which considers both injection mode and absorption mode, is developed based on the grid residual voltage and the unified state space model; 4) Fault current contribution mechanism, which is aggregated from both stator and grid side converter, is revealed based on Laplace transform from time-frequency-time domain, and is first expressed as an unified fault current expression. Extensive simulation/experimental/calculation results under different voltage sags have validated the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed FCUC method.</description></item><item><title>High Performance Platform to Detect Faults in the Smart Grid by Artificial Intelligence Inference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10109818</link><description>Inferring faults throughout the power grid involves fast calculation, large scale of data, and low latency. Our heterogeneous architecture in the edge offers such high computing performance and throughput using an Artificial Intelligence (AI) core deployed in the Alveo accelerator. In addition, we have described the process of porting standard AI models to Vitis AI and discussed its limitations and possible implications. During validation, we designed and trained some AI models for fast fault detection in Smart Grids. However, the AI framework is standard, and adapting the models to Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) has demanded a series of transformation processes. Compared with the Graphics Processing Unit platform, our implementation on the FPGA accelerator consumes less energy and achieves lower latency. Finally, our system balances inference accuracy, on-chip resources consumed, computing performance, and throughput. Even with grid data sampling rates as high as 800,000 per second, our hardware architecture can simultaneously process up to 7 data streams.</description></item><item><title>A Fully Distributed ADP Algorithm for Real-Time Economic Dispatch of Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10117499</link><description>This paper proposes a fully distributed approximate dynamic programming (FD-ADP) algorithm framework for real-time economic dispatch of a microgrid (MG). Firstly, a modified distributed consensus-based algorithm (DCBA) framework with power restriction factors is proposed to distributedly obtain the real-time ED decision of MG containing distributed energy resources with linear cost functions, which improves the convergence stability compared with the traditional DCBA framework. Then, combined with the approximate dynamic programming (ADP) theory, a FD-ADP algorithm is proposed to deal with data uncertainties. To this end, the piece-wise linear (PWL) function is applied to approximate the value function, and a distributed slope update approach is proposed to embed empirical knowledge into the value function while ensuring the distributed property in off-line training. With the well-trained PWL function assisting in decision, the distributed real-time ED strategy of MG with approximate global optimality is obtained by the proposed FD-ADP algorithm during the entire schedule horizon (e.g., 24 hours). Finally, case studies on the modified IEEE 6-bus MG system and IEEE 123-bus MG system demonstrate the superiority of solution convergence, validity of distributed training, and optimality of distributed schedule of the proposed FD-ADP algorithm.</description></item><item><title>A Two-Level Coordination Strategy for Distribution Network Balancing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10121816</link><description>Uncertain distributed energy resources and uneven load allocation cause the three-phase unbalance in distribution networks (DNs), which may harm the health of power equipment and increase the operational cost. There are emerging opportunities to balance three-phase DNs with a number of power electronic devices installed in the system. In this paper, we propose a novel two-level coordination strategy to improve the network balancing performance, where soft open points (SOPs) and phase switch devices (PSDs) are hierarchically coordinated in the network. At the upper level, a new type of SOPs with the function of phase switching is designed to explore the cross-phase power transfer ability; at the lower level, PSDs are utilized to flexibly allocate individual loads to specific phases. The two-level coordination strategy is typically formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. To solve the model accurately and efficiently, we develop a successive linearization algorithm to approximate it to a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem at each iteration. On this basis, we propose a heuristic time-independent fixing algorithm to further ease the computational burden by eliminating a large number of integer variables in the MILP problem. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Characteristics Analysis of Current-Controlled VSCs for Periodic Forced Oscillations Excited by Grid Frequency Disturbance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122628</link><description>Uncontrolled forced oscillations can jeopardize the power system security. Most modeling and analysis methods for forced oscillations in previous publications were linearization methods such that some new nonlinear oscillation phenomenon can not be reproduced powerfully. Based on the considerations above, this paper hopes to provide clearer understandings and recognitions to forced oscillations by theoretically reveal the characteristics. First, a dynamic model of the current-controlled VSCs system based periodic forced oscillations is established to describe the relationships between system parameters and intrinsic quantities. Then, the multi-scale method is introduced to derive the mathematical expressions of approximate analytical solutions and relationship equation. Next, these characteristics, containing jumping phenomenon, frequency shift, doubling frequency response, and frequency coupling, are found and described by analyzing the mathematical expressions. Final, all the results are tested and verified on simulations and experiments.</description></item><item><title>Transient Stability of Multiple Phase-Locked-Loop-Type Voltage Source Converters System Based on Amplitude Mapping Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122617</link><description>Compared to the traditional power grids, the multiple converters integration system are more vulnerable to the disturbances from transient events. However, the high-order characteristics of the system model is still a barrier not ignored. Inspired by averaging method of nonlinear vibration, the amplitude mapping model (AMM) is firstly proposed to evaluate the transient stability for multiple phase-locked-loop-type (PLL-type) voltage source converters (VSCs) system in this paper. Specifically, the origin and meaning of amplitude mapping model is introduced. Next, the mathematical model of the PLL-type VSCs system is derived. Based on AMM, the stability evaluation strategy of the PLL-type VSCs system is obtained. After that, the influence of key parameters, including the system gSCR, d-axis current reference, and PLL control parameters, on the system stability and the coupling effect between the VSCs are analyzed. Finally, a 6-VSCs 14-nodes system is applied to verify the correctness of the method proposed in this paper.</description></item><item><title>Battery Energy Storage System Planning Based on Super-Resolution Source-Load Uncertainty Reconstruction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10153756</link><description>Low-time resolution electricity data have been used to drive battery energy storage system (BESS) planning due to data barriers. However, the coarse-resolution time series cannot reflect real power variation, and the planning results may be inappropriate due to the unrealistic representation of source-load uncertainties. To this end, this paper proposes a BESS planning method based on super-resolution (SR) source-load uncertainty reconstruction. The Gramian angular field (GAF) is employed to transform the 1D time series into 2D images to enrich the time dependency of signals. With advanced computer vision (CV), the entropy decrease generative adversarial network (EDGAN) based on information-growth attention is designed to recover the source-load profile from low resolution to high resolution. To depict source-load uncertainties in BESS sizing, a two-stage multi-distributionally robust optimization (2S-MDRO) is established under SR ambiguity sets. Case studies validated the accuracy of the proposed SR method and proved the effectiveness of the proposed sizing model. The recommended time resolution for BESS planning is presented in the comparative results.</description></item><item><title>Fast Tuning-Free Distributed Algorithm for Solving the Network-Constrained Economic Dispatch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10159429</link><description>With the increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) and their participation in the electricity market, it becomes more desirable to apply distributed algorithms for resource allocation in order to address the resulting computational and communicational challenges. Most of the existing distributed algorithms for solving the network-constrained economic dispatch (NCED) problem require the tuning of certain auxiliary parameters. As a result, the robustness of these algorithms against the varieties in DERs is greatly undermined. In this paper, a new distributed algorithm, optimality condition consensus (OCC), is proposed to solve the NCED problem by using distributed power flow (DPF) and ratio consensus as fundamental tools. It inherits the advantages of existing distributed algorithms for the NCED problem but removes the need for parameter tuning to improve performance in practice. The effectiveness of the proposed distributed algorithm in terms of efficiency, scalability, and robustness is demonstrated through detailed case studies.</description></item><item><title>Collective Asset Sharing Mechanisms for PV and BESS in Renewable Energy Communities</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10159415</link><description>The energy sector transition to more decentralized and renewable structures requires greater participation by local consumers, which may be enabled by innovative models such as the setup of renewable energy communities (RECs). To maximize the self-consumption of local renewable energy generated by assets normally connected to the low voltage distribution grid, these RECs typically involve jointly owned assets such as collective photovoltaic solar panels (CPVs) and collective energy storage systems (CESS). This work proposes a novel mathematical model for a REC, accounting for three distinct economic approaches to the redistribution of collective benefits among community members. The main objective of this study is to understand how the participation of community members in collective assets (CAs) can help increase the fairness and equity of RECs. An illustrative REC case comprising members with individual and collective ownership of the assets is used to assess the proposed economic approaches. Extracting several answers, among them that the most advantageous configuration comes from agents with quotas in the CESS and CPV. An important conclusion is that depending on the selected economic approach, the social welfare and agent&#8217;s revenue vary significantly. In any case, CESSs increase equity among REC members.</description></item><item><title>An Active Learning-Based Approach for Hosting Capacity Analysis in Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10167824</link><description>With the increasing amount of distributed energy resources (DERs) integration, there is a significant need to model and analyze hosting capacity (HC) for future electric distribution grids. Hosting capacity analysis (HCA) examines the amount of DERs that can be safely integrated into the grid and is a challenging task in full generality because there are many possible integration of DERs in foresight. That is, there are numerous extreme points between feasible and infeasible sets. Moreover, HC depends on multiple factors such as (a) adoption patterns of DERs that depend on socioeconomic behaviors and (b) how DERs are controlled and managed. These two factors are intrinsic to the problem space because not all integration of DERs may be centrally planned, and could largely change our understanding about HC. This paper addresses the research gap by capturing the two factors (a) and (b) in HCA and by identifying a few most insightful HC scenarios at the cost of domain knowledge. We propose a data-driven HCA framework and introduce active learning in HCA to effectively explore scenarios. Active learning in HCA and characteristics of HC with respect to the two factors (a) and (b) are illustrated in a 3-bus example. Next, detailed large-scale studies are proposed to understand the significance of (a) and (b). Our findings suggest that HC and its interpretations significantly change subject to the two factors (a) and (b).</description></item><item><title>Event-Triggered Distribution System State Estimation: Sparse Kalman Filtering With Reinforced Coupling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10109025</link><description>A novel distribution system state estimation (DSSE) method is proposed for power distribution networks with low-observablity, where the measurements come from only a few distribution-level phasor measurement units (D-PMUs). The proposed DSSE method is event-triggered, which means the state variables are updated based on the information that is extracted from the events in the power distribution system. In this regard, the estimations of the state variables during the previous events are used as priori information to predict the state variables at the current event. Accordingly, a novel data-driven method based on elastic net regression analysis is proposed to learn the event-triggered state transition matrix. The DSSE problem is formulated as a generalized group Lasso problem, which is augmented based on the knowledge on the sparsity patterns of the state variables that are extracted from the analysis of the events. Here, in the absence of direct power measurements, we enhance our ability in sparse recovery by developing a new reinforced physics-based coupling method among the state variables, in which we add a novel set of linear differential power flow equations to the DSSE problem formulation in forms of virtual measurements. Finally, two different approaches are proposed to solve the formulated sparse event-triggered DSSE problem. The first approach is exact but computationally expensive, as it requires conducting a batch alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) analysis. The second approach is approximate, but it is much faster as it works based on a novel modified Kalman filter/smoother in the presence of  $\ell _{1}$ -norm.</description></item><item><title>A Remedy to Losing Time Synchronization at D-PMUs, H-PMUs, and WMUs in Event Location Identification in Power Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10130079</link><description>Recent advancements in synchronized sensor technologies has introduced an unprecedented level of visibility in power distribution systems. Apart from the Distribution-level Phasor Measurement Units (D-PMUs), a.k.a. micro-PMUs, that have been widely used in recent years, other synchronized sensors have also been developed in this field, including Harmonic Phasor Measurement Units (H-PMUs) and Waveform Measurement Units (WMUs). However, in practice, it is common for these sensors to lose time synchronization over some periods of time and for different reasons. In this paper, we propose new and customized solutions to tackle loss of time synchronization in D-PMUs, H-PMUs, and WMUs, whereby addressing the unique challenges in each case. Our focus is on solving the event location identification problem, for different types of steady-state and transient events. We show that, our methods can maintain high accuracy in event location identification, despite losing time synchronization, whether we use D-PMUs, H-PMUs, or WMUs.</description></item><item><title>ORCA: Outage Root Cause Analysis in DER-Rich Power Distribution System Using Data Fusion, Hierarchical Clustering and FP-Growth Rule Mining</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10140164</link><description>Power outages have been an inevitable part of power delivery systems. In case of large scale outages with conflicting information in the distribution network with distributed energy resources (DER), recognition of the root causes becomes increasingly complex. Root cause detection is very important for routing the crew and for faster restoration. Number of studies have been conducted on analysis of the outages, planning predictive actions, and improving the restoration process for minimization of the load outages using various statistical and data processing. A comprehensive methodology with the ability to find root causes in quick and efficient manner is still missing. This work proposes an Outage Root Cause Analysis (ORCA) tool, with various internal modules. The proposed ORCA utilizes the available data from diverse set of sensors (Distribution Phasor Measurement Units, metering and relay) within the distribution system (DS) to: a) aggregate using data fusion algorithm: an Ensemble Extended Kalman Filter (EEKF) approach, b) classify events at broader level (fault, breaker operation or cyber-attack with/without load outage) using hierarchical agglomerative clustering in online and offline manners, and c) narrow down the outage root cause to the possible nuanced identified causes (vegetation, animal, weather, wildfire, protection, equipment failure, planned) using the available historical data and the Frequent Pattern-Growth data mining approach. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach compared to the other existing key approaches using two different test systems and multiple outage with different locations case scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Tariff Bounding and Cooperation Stability in Power-Traffic Nexus: A Social Entity Perspective</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10109826</link><description>The growing interdependence between power distribution networks (PDNs) and transportation networks (TNs) has driven recent research on power-transportation coordination. This paper identifies three important gaps in current literature. First, the upper-bounding issue of the tariff-based incentives (road toll, charging service fee, etc) is not well addressed, which might raise drivers&#8217; dissatisfaction or compromise system performance. Second, the TN-PDN cooperation is generally built upon a simple assumption without any guarantee on its existence or stability. Third, the autonomy of network operators in tariff setting, operating goals, and data privacy is overlooked in prevailing bi-level social-cost-minimization frameworks. To bridge the above research gaps, this article proposes a novel tri-level framework where a social entity (SE) at the upper level sets the tariff bound towards the lowest social cost and dispenses subsidies towards a stable TN-PDN cooperation, network operators at the middle level jointly manage TNs and PDNs towards the optimal status, and travelers at the lower level decide charging&amp;amp;route choices to minimize individual travel cost. Cooperative Game Theory is adopted to characterize the cooperation and cost allocation between the middle-level operators, while the Core size is introduced to quantify the coalition stability and to guide the SE&#8217;s subsidization. A slope-identification based algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve the tri-level problem in a privacy-preserving manner, and a geometric analysis is conducted to deduce the Core size and the required subsidies. Extensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methods.</description></item><item><title>A Fast Polytope-Based Approach for Aggregating Large-Scale Electric Vehicles in the Joint Market Under Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10121812</link><description>The aggregation of electric vehicles (EVs) has been advocated as an effective means to manage and control large-scale plug-in EVs. However, the efficient aggregation is challenging due to the heterogeneity and uncertainty of individual EVs. To cope with this challenge, this paper puts forth a fast polytope-based aggregation approach, which could deal with the time-coupled, uncertain, and heterogeneous individual EV models. First, the feasible region of each EV&#8217;s power profiles is expressed as a polytope under H-representation considering various operational constraints. To improve the aggregation efficiency, H-representation reconstruction and polytopic projection processes are designed to address the heterogeneity of EVs. The uncertainties of EVs are modeled by the distributionally robust joint chance-constrained programming. The original individual and aggregate feasible region of EVs are subsequently inner approximated by the homothets of a basic prototype. Last, a day-ahead optimal bidding model for charging service provider in a joint market, including energy, peak-shaving and reserve markets, is developed. Numerical simulation results based on real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed aggregation method can improve both the computation efficiency and accuracy of approximate feasible region.</description></item><item><title>A Bilevel EV Charging Station and DC Fast Charger Planning Model for Highway Network Considering Dynamic Traffic Demand and User Equilibrium</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122631</link><description>The rapid electric vehicle (EV) adoption and relatively short EV driving range urge city planners to expand charging infrastructure (i.e., EV charging stations (EVCSs) and direct current fast chargers (DCFCs)) in the highway network for supporting long-distance intercity EV travels. To properly address distinct roles as well as interactions of the EVCS planner, traffic network, power distribution networks (PDNs), and drivers, this paper explores a bilevel planning model in which the upper level determines EVCS and DCFC construction plans and the two lower-level subproblems describe the user equilibrium-based traffic assignment model of the traffic network and the operation model of PDNs. Moreover, the statistical charging time is modeled in the traffic network subproblem as a function of statistical charging demand and the number of DCFCs, leveraging the macro traffic pattern and micro charging behavior of individual drivers with balanced accuracy and computational complexity. The proposed model also captures the impacts of social factors, charging infrastructure, and driver behaviors on dynamic EV traffic demands. Reformulation and linearization techniques are applied to convert the proposed bilevel problem into a tractable single-level mixed-integer linear programming model for effective computation. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested on an intercity highway network with multiple PDNs. The findings from numerical case studies highlight the important interplay among the construction plans of EVCSs and DCFCs, the PDN constraints, the user equilibrium traffic network, and the EV drivers. Case studies illustrate the feasibility and necessity of considering the number of DCFCs to calculate the macro-perspective charging time in the user equilibrium traffic network model. The dynamic traffic demand, induced by social factors and traffic demand elasticity, was also found to be a crucial factor in reshaping EV traffic. Thus, properly considering these important factors would lead to a more accurate quantification of traffic demands and ultimately result in a more reasonable charging facility construction plan.</description></item><item><title>A Game-Theoretic Approach for Electric Vehicle Aggregators Participating in Phase Balancing Considering Network Topology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10124247</link><description>With the increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs), uncontrolled charging of single-phase plug-in EVs will result in severe three-phase unbalance problem in distribution networks. To solve the problem, a phase balancing (PB) scheme performed by EV aggregators (EVAs) based on the linear multiphase power flow model is proposed in this paper. In the scheme, the PB compensations are provided to encourage EVAs to help the distribution system operator reduce the phase unbalance of the entire grid. Considering all EVAs are selfish and rational, the PB scheme is formulated as a game problem, in which each EVA competes with other EVAs to determine its charging strategy to minimize the charging cost minus the PB compensation. The consideration of coupling voltage constraints leads this game model to a challenging generalized Nash equilibrium problem (GNEP). By employing the theory of variational inequality, the properties of solutions for the GNEP are investigated. Furthermore, a two-level distributed algorithm is designed to find the unique variational solution, a fair and stable solution. Finally, comprehensive case studies are conducted on the IEEE-13 and IEEE-123 test systems to corroborate that the proposed PB game model can effectively mitigate voltage unbalance and cut EV users&#8217; costs.</description></item><item><title>EV Charging Command Fast Allocation Approach Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning With Safety Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10143999</link><description>Efficient real-time management of electric vehicle (EV) charging in a charging station (CS) is vital to the integration of large-scale EVs in power grids. It faces critical challenges such as frequent changes in the grid&#8217;s dispatch commands, the complexity of EVs&#8217; costs, and the uncertainties in the EVs&#8217; charging/traveling behaviors and in the future dispatch commands. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based allocation approach that optimally and efficiently allocates the grid&#8217;s commands to the EVs and controls their charging in real time. It includes two stages. Stage 1 includes a data-driven EV cost quantification method, which efficiently quantifies the EVs&#8217; flexibility contributions with long-term return consideration. Stage 2 proposes a high sample efficiency DRL-based allocation method, which optimizes the EVs&#8217; charging and addresses the EV- and grid-related uncertainties. The proposed allocation has a fast computational speed. Finally, to address the security risk due to DRL&#8217;s stochastic exploratory actions, two safety modules are developed which ensure the EV charging security and the allocation accuracy. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed strategy are verified by comparing its performance against multiple benchmark approaches.</description></item><item><title>Hamlet: Hierarchical Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning Method for Charging Power Control of Electric Vehicles With Dynamic Quantity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10159127</link><description>Electric vehicle (EV) is emerging as an effective choice to reduce carbon emissions in the modern transportation system. However, the large access of EVs brings tremendous passive influence on the stability and performance of power grid operation. Thus, it is valuable to investigate the charging power management method to improve charging experience of EV drivers while maintaining normal bus voltage of the power system. This paper builds the charging power control problem of multiple EVs as a hierarchical Markov decision process (MDP) model and propose a hierarchical multi-objective reinforcement learning method (Hamlet) to obtain the real-time charging power control decisions. Specifically, by treating EVs with the same remaining charging time as the same agent, this paper addresses the dynamic state and action spaces issue and significantly reduce the input dimension of both state and action spaces. Besides, this paper quantifies drivers&#8217; anxiety about the battery volume and distributes the comfort reward over the entire charging interval, which overcomes the delayed comfort reward issue. In order to alleviate the influence of multiple objectives on training stability, this paper develops a multi-objective learning method to dynamically adjust the optimization direction. Simulation results on IEEE 33 bus and 69 bus test feeders prove the validity of the proposed method in mitigating voltage fluctuation, minimizing bill payment and maximizing battery comfort.</description></item><item><title>An Augmented Lagrangian-Based Safe Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Carbon-Oriented Optimal Scheduling of EV Aggregators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10163488</link><description>This paper proposes an augmented Lagrangian-based safe off-policy deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for the carbon-oriented optimal scheduling of electric vehicle (EV) aggregators in a distribution network. First, practical charging data are employed to formulate an EV aggregation model, and its flexibility in both emission mitigation and energy/power dispatching is demonstrated. Second, a bilevel optimization model is formulated for EV aggregators to participate in day-ahead optimal scheduling, which aims to minimize the total cost without exceeding the given carbon cap. Third, to tackle the nonlinear coupling between the carbon flow and power flow, a bilevel model with a carbon cap constraint is formed as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). Finally, the CMDP is efficiently solved by the proposed augmented Lagrangian-based DRL algorithm featuring the soft actor-critic (SAC) method. Comprehensive numerical studies with IEEE distribution test feeders demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve a fine tradeoff between cost and emission mitigation with a higher computation efficiency compared with the existing DRL methods.</description></item><item><title>A Resilience Enhanced Secondary Control for AC Micro-Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10104161</link><description>Communication-based distributed secondary control is deemed necessary to restore the state of islanding AC microgrids to set points. As its limited global information, the microgrids become vulnerable to cyber-attacks, which by falsifying the communicating singles, like the angular frequency, can disturb the power dispatch in the microgrids or even induce blackout by pushing the microgrids beyond the safe operation area and triggering the protection. To make the microgrids more cyber secure, adaptive resilient control for the secondary frequency regulation is proposed. It assumes that each converter is communicating with its adjacent converters. With the proposed control, the weight of the communication channel being attacked is automatically reduced, and the more the communicating signals are falsified, the further the weight of that communication channel is weakened. The proposed approach does not rely on attack detection and thereby is easy to implement; Besides, it still works when challenged by a combination of multi-attack signals; Moreover, it applies to multiple communication lines getting attacked cases. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed resilient control scheme are validated by both simulations and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Cyberattack on Phase-Locked Loops in Inverter-Based Energy Resources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10108042</link><description>This article reveals power grid vulnerabilities by manipulating the phase-locked loop (PLL) in an inverter-based energy resource (IBER). An attacker can exploit the off-nominal frequency operation of a power grid coupled with stability and tracking properties of an IBER PLL to manipulate the inverter and grid operations during strong and weak grid conditions. Employing a modified IEEE-14 bus system, simulation studies show that PLL-based attack can cause: (i) revenue losses to IBER operators in weak and strong grid conditions, (ii) voltage limit violations and voltage profile deterioration at IBER bus under weak grid condition, and (iii) system-wide power-angle instability under weak and strong grid conditions. To detect the PLL-based attack, we propose attack severity index (ASI) by generating a detection error signal from local grid voltage measurements and PLL estimation. The attack is mitigated by incorporating security as an integral part of the PLL design, yielding a security-aware PLL.</description></item><item><title>Reliability Analysis of Cyber&#8211;Physical Energy Hubs: A Monte Carlo Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10109148</link><description>In this paper, the reliability of cyber-physical energy hubs (CPEHs) is evaluated based on the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method. Previous works in the related literature are generally focused on the physical layer of energy hubs (EHs). However, the security of EHs heavily relies on the reliable and safe performance of the cyber system. Therefore, this study considers the failure of cyber-physical components, data packet errors, and information transmission delay to improve the reliability assessment accuracy. The physical layer of the proposed CPEH is divided into two sections, namely heat and power sections, and reliability indices are calculated for both sections. Various scenarios are suggested to precisely analyze the effects of the cyber layer consideration on the CPEH reliability results. Sensitivity analysis on the failure rate of the components is also conducted to understand better the performance of the CPEH in situations with a higher risk of heat components&#8217; failure. The notable impacts of the cyber layer disturbances on the CPEH reliability evaluation are demonstrated through the simulation results.</description></item><item><title>Secure Particle Filtering With Paillier Encryption&#8211;Decryption Scheme: Application to Multi-Machine Power Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10113238</link><description>This paper is concerned with the encryption-decryption-based state estimation problem for a class of multi-machine power grids with non-Gaussian noises. For the purposes of security enhancement and data privacy protection, the Paillier encryption-decryption scheme is adopted to map the measurement data into the ciphertext space before being transmitted through the communication network. The aim of this paper is to develop a novel secure particle filter algorithm to cope with the nonlinearity/non-Gaussianity from the system plant and the decrypted signals after the measurement transmission. In particular, a modified likelihood function is proposed to obtain the importance weights where the encryption-decryption process of the measurement data is taken into full consideration. The developed algorithm is applied to multi-machine power grids, and it is demonstrated via simulation studies (on three test scenarios of the IEEE 39-bus power system) that our proposed secure state estimation scheme possesses the desired performance index in terms of security and accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Towards Resilient Energy Forecasting: A Robust Optimization Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10113854</link><description>Energy forecasting models deployed in industrial applications face uncertainty w.r.t. data availability, due to network latency, equipment malfunctions or data-integrity attacks. In particular, the case when a subset of features that has been used for model training becomes unavailable when the model is used operationally poses a major challenge to forecasting performance. Ad-hoc solutions, e.g., retraining without the missing features, may work for a small number of features, but they soon become impractical, as the number of models grows exponentially with the number of features. In this work, we present a principled approach to introducing resilience against missing features in energy forecasting applications via robust optimization. Specifically, we formulate a robust regression model that is optimally resilient against missing features at test time, considering both point and probabilistic forecasting. We develop three solution methods for the proposed robust formulation, all leading to Linear Programming problems, with varying degrees of tractability and conservativeness. We provide an extensive empirical validation of the proposed methods in prevalent applications, namely, electricity price, load, wind production, and solar production, forecasting, and we further compare against well-established benchmark models and methods of dealing with missing features, i.e., imputation and retraining. Our results demonstrate that the proposed robust optimization approach outperforms imputation-based models and exhibits similar performance to retraining without the missing features, while also maintaining computational practicality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that introduces resilience against missing features into energy forecasting.</description></item><item><title>Cyber-Resilient Automatic Generation Control for Systems of AC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10114674</link><description>In this paper we propose a co-design of the secondary frequency regulation in systems of AC microgrids and its cyber security solutions. We term the secondary frequency regulator a Micro-Automatic Generation Control  $(\mu $ AGC) for highlighting its same functionality as the AGC in bulk power systems. We identify sensory challenges and cyber threats facing the  $\mu $ AGC. To address the sensory challenges, we introduce a new microgrid model by exploiting the rank-one deficiency property of microgrid dynamics. This model is used to pose an optimal  $\mu $ AGC control problem that is easily implemented, because it does not require fast frequency measurements. An end-to-end cyber security solution to the False Data Injection (FDI) attack detection and mitigation is developed for the proposed  $\mu $ AGC. The front-end barrier of applying off-the-shelf algorithms for cyber attack detection is removed by introducing a data-driven modeling approach. Finally, we propose an observer-based corrective control for an islanded microgrid and a collaborative mitigation scheme in systems of AC microgrids. We demonstrate a collaborative role of systems of microgrids during cyber attacks.

The location detection of false data injection attacks is traditionally realized by computationally intensive neural networks, which can cause large detection delays due to the limited computation power and storage resources of the detection device. By contrast, the proposed method is lightweight and can be deployed on low-cost devices such as embedded devices, significantly improving detection speed while reducing power consumption. The proposed method consists of an efficient FDIA location detection model and an automatic model search algorithm. The model is a lightweight model that enables fast and accurate attack location detection through a combination of the early exiting mechanism and mixed-precision quantization (EE-MPQ). Then, an automatic model search algorithm is designed to enable the EE-MPQ model to match the smart grids with different structures. Finally, it is shown that the proposed method can accurately detect and locate FDIAs through numerical analysis on the IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus power systems.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Detection Scheme for Zero-Dynamics Attack on Wind Power System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10136373</link><description>In a wind farm, wind power system is key to maintaining continuous generation of point energy. Since Zero-Dynamics attack poses a major risk to future wind farms, investigation on the effect of Zero-Dynamics attack against wind power systems has both theoretical and practical importance. In this paper, we consider a scenario in which a wind power system is subject to Zero-Dynamics attack in power generation chain. Firstly, we transform a semi-direct D-PMSG into an equivalent circuit to establish mathematical model of wind power system under Zero-Dynamics attack. Then, we analyze and prove the advantages and limitations of Zero-Dynamics attack by divide the equation of state into a stable part and an unstable part with the help of system relative degree  $\rho $ . In addition, to better achieve desired attack effect, adjustments are made for Zero-Dynamics attack based on its limitations. Finally, we combine an Multiple Linear Regression (MRL) predictive control model with Byrnes-Isidori normal form to protect wind power system. The theoretical results were verified on designed small wind power system.</description></item><item><title>A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Undetectable Attacks Against Automatic Generation Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10159364</link><description>Automatic generation control (AGC) is an essential functionality for ensuring the stability of power systems, and its secure operation is thus of utmost importance to power system operators. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of AGC to false data injection attacks that could remain undetected by traditional detection methods based on the area control error (ACE) and the recently proposed unknown input observer (UIO). We formulate the problem of computing undetectable attacks as a multi-objective partially observable Markov decision process. We propose a flexible reward function that allows to explore the trade-off between attack impact and detectability, and use the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm for learning efficient attack policies. Through extensive simulations of a 3-area power system, we show that the proposed attacks can drive the frequency beyond critical limits, while remaining undetectable by state-of-the-art algorithms employed for fault and attack detection in AGC. Our results also show that detectors trained using supervised and unsupervised machine learning can both significantly outperform existing detectors.</description></item><item><title>Learning Distribution Grid Topologies: A Tutorial</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10113752</link><description>Unveiling feeder topologies from data is of paramount importance to advance situational awareness and proper utilization of smart resources in power distribution grids. This tutorial summarizes, contrasts, and establishes useful links between recent works on topology identification and detection schemes that have been proposed for power distribution grids. The primary focus is to highlight methods that overcome the limited availability of measurement devices in distribution grids, while enhancing topology estimates using conservation laws of power-flow physics and structural properties of feeders. Grid data from phasor measurement units or smart meters can be collected either passively in the traditional way, or actively, upon actuating grid resources and measuring the feeder&#8217;s voltage response. Analytical claims on feeder identifiability and detectability are reviewed under disparate meter placement scenarios. Such topology learning claims can be attained exactly or approximately so via algorithmic solutions with various levels of computational complexity, ranging from least-squares fits to convex optimization problems, and from polynomial-time searches over graphs to mixed-integer programs. Although the emphasis is on radial single-phase feeders, extensions to meshed and/or multiphase circuits are sometimes possible and discussed. This tutorial aspires to provide researchers and engineers with knowledge of the current state-of-the-art in tractable distribution grid learning and insights into future directions of work.</description></item><item><title>An Integrated Transfer Learning Method for Power Generation Prediction of Run-Off Small Hydropower in Data-Scarce Areas</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10129165</link><description>Historical data scarce and varying patterns of new built run-off small hydropower (RSHP) limits precise power generation prediction. Unforeseen hydropower can induce uneconomic power grid operations. To address this issue, a novel transfer learning method enabling integration of public RSHP knowledge is proposed. First, a RSHP data matching algorithm is proposed to pre-filter similar source domain data and produce a RSHP database matching patterns of target RSHP. This algorithm allows us to improve performance of transfer learning model. Next, public prediction knowledge implicated in the RSHP database is learned towards a CNN-BiLSTM hybrid pre-trained network. Then, the pre-trained network is transferred to the target RSHP prediction models by hyper-parameter fine-tuning algorithm, which reduces divergence between the pre-trained network outputs and the target domain data. As a result, accurate new RSHP prediction models can be generated under the challenge of data lack. At the last, the RSHP prediction models are fed back to the fine-tuning algorithm such that generalizability of the models enables life-long self-renewal. The real-world case demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method in terms of accuracy and data utilization. The average prediction error of the proposed method is 16.27% lower than the best traditional alternative.</description></item><item><title>Load Recognition in Hardware-Based Low Voltage Distribution Grids Using Convolutional Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10136822</link><description>Due to climate targets of the German government, the share of renewable energy in the power grid will be increased and the number of grid participants connected to the low voltage level of the power grid will rise. This leads to new requirements in voltage control, especially in low voltage distribution grids. In order to achieve a stable power grid in future, further development of control strategies is necessary. In this paper, a load recognition concept, which was tested on simulative data in previous work, is further developed to reduce simulation effort. Additionally, the concept is adapted for real hardware influences and active grid participants complicating the recognition task. Thus, the main contribution of this study is the successful application of the methodology within a hardware-based test grid containing a charging electric vehicle. Using a convolutional neural network in a time series classification setting, the recognition rates in this use-case exceeded 99 % while benefiting from an asymmetric charging behavior. Due to these promising results, future voltage control strategies could be supported based on gained information through integration of the presented concept.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Residential Load Forecasting With Baseline-Refinement Profiles and Bi-Attention Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10168194</link><description>With the development of smart grid and renewable energy technologies, residential load forecasting has become an increasingly important task. Short-term residential load forecasting is not only conducive to power dispatching and peak-shaving and valley filling of the grid, but also good for residents to obtain higher economic benefit from renewable energy. This paper proposes a new baseline-refinement forecasting framework consisting of two main steps, baseline profile construction and refinement predictions. Firstly, a baseline profile construction method is proposed to forecast the baseline load profile based on the similarity and cyclic patterns of daily load profiles. Secondly, for the refinement predictions, a bi-attention mechanism is proposed by combining self-attention mechanism and external attention mechanism to fulfill the feature transformation and is included in the temporal convolutional network to refine the baseline profile. The final load forecasting results are obtained by aggregating the baseline profile and the refinement predictions. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework has smaller forecasting errors and higher forecasting stability than the commonly used models on two load forecasting metrics.</description></item><item><title>A Light Blockchain for Behind-the-Meter Peer-to-Peer Energy Transactions in Cyber-Physical Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10097637</link><description>Household-level distributed energy sources, such as rooftop photovoltaic, microturbines, and energy storage, become important behind-the-meter (BTM) resources. BTM resources can meet all or part of users&#8217; demands. Establishing a peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading network among these users will further promote the utilization of BTM resources. However, such a proposal faces the problem that cyber trading and physical dispatching are difficult to coordinate. Therefore, this paper proposes the architecture of the behind-the-meter peer-to-peer (BTM-P2P) energy trading system, including the cyber layer and physical layer. To ensure that users strictly execute the cyber trading results in the physical layer, a trading mechanism considering credit is designed, and the user&#8217;s credit has an impact on the bidding priority, which in turn urges the user to strictly execute in subsequent tradings. Then, a light blockchain suitable for energy trading is developed, ensuring that both the trading results and the actual dispatching results are not tampered with. Database technology is inserted in the light blockchain to improve efficiency. Finally, a BTM-P2P cyber-physical testbed coupling physical dispatching with cyber trading is built, providing technical support for the implementation of BTM-P2P.</description></item><item><title>A High-Efficiency and Incentive-Compatible Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10102333</link><description>Due to the rapid development of demand response management and distributed energy resources, prosumers are becoming more proactive, which also promotes the emergence of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading mechanisms. However, we find that it is quite difficult to simultaneously achieve high computational efficiency, decentralized operations and solution optimality in a P2P energy trading mechanism, which is called the &#8220;P2P energy trading trilemma&#8221;. In this paper, we first propose a novel negotiation mechanism for P2P energy trading that can maximize social welfare in a decentralized manner and respect physical network constraints. Then, the local optimization problem is transformed into a closed-form alternating update algorithm (AUA), so that the computational efficiency can be greatly improved. Therefore, our proposed mechanism solves the &#8220;P2P energy trading trilemma&#8221; to a certain extent. Another challenge is that the locational marginal price (LMP)-based market mechanism cannot satisfy the incentive-compatible property. To encourage prosumers to cooperate in a lack-of-trust environment, a novel incentive-compatible mechanism is proposed for P2P energy trading using consensus mechanism inspired by proof of solution (PoSo) and smart contract (SC). Finally, we simulate the functionality of the mechanism in terms of convergence performance, reliability, scalability, computational efficiency, and SC operations.</description></item><item><title>Blockchain-Based Decentralized Frequency Control of Microgrids Using Federated Learning Fractional-Order Recurrent Neural Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10103197</link><description>This paper presents a blockchain-based decentralized frequency control of an islanded microgrid (MG) using a novel federated learning fractional order recurrent neural network (FL-FORNN). A self-adaptive proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is proposed using FL-FORNN to handle the uncertainties of power generation by the prosumers while participating in the trading of the islanded MG. In this work, the frequency oscillations during peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading are regulated through the appropriate design of an adaptive controller and the implementation of a smart contract participation matrix (SCPM) for balancing the generation and consumer demand. A Proof-of-Authority (PoA) private blockchain-based SCPM has been developed to secure the contract among peers. The SCPM provides the power demand information from a consumer to a prosumer who participates in the P2P energy market. It also provides power reference to the prosumer distributed generation as a supplementary control, in addition to the secondary frequency control of the system. To study this, an islanded MG comprising four source nodes (prosumers) and three demand nodes (consumers) are tested with the implementation of the PoA-based blockchain framework. With its SCPM calculation running in the blockchain framework, the decentralized control of prosumers is implemented by interfacing the OPAL-RT with Raspberry Pi devices. The robustness of the proposed FL-FORNN controller has been verified with the FORNN tuned PID controller. Furthermore, a comparative analysis is made with the centralized scheme and traditional decentralized frequency control technique.</description></item><item><title>A Generalizable Method for Practical Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring via Metric-Based Meta-Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10090473</link><description>Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) has become a research boom due to its energy-saving benefits as the smart grid develops and the greenhouse effect intensifies. However, existing NILM models may perform poorly in the target domains collected from different sources, or those containing unseen appliance types, blocking the rollout of NILM. In contrast to the methods that update the trained model on the unseen data to handle domain shift or heterogeneous label space, this paper proposes a novel generalizable NILM method based on metric-based meta-learning and supervised pre-training. It beforehand learns the cross-domain meta-knowledge through meta-training to eliminate the need for parameter updates in the target domain. Moreover, this method is specifically designed for practical deployments at the edge where both labeled instances and computation resources are limited. The proposed method transforms the appliance current into a metric vector via lightweight 1D convolution and then uses the relation module to propagate the labels via similarity. The experimental results on three public datasets and the proposed dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve high generalization performance in different datasets, user&#8217;s houses, appliance brands, and appliance types.</description></item><item><title>A Survey of Power System State Estimation Using Multiple Data Sources: PMUs, SCADA, AMI, and Beyond</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10153770</link><description>State estimation (SE) is indispensable for the situational awareness of power systems. Conventional SE is fed by measurements collected from the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. In recent years, available data sources have been greatly enriched with the deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs), advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), intelligent electronic devices (IEDs), etc. The integration of multiple data sources provides unprecedented opportunities for enhancing the performance of SE, but also presents major challenges to resolve, including optimal multi-type-sensor co-placement, multiple reporting rates and asynchronization, diverse types of measured quantities, correlations between measurements, integration of online and historical data sources, and system and measurement uncertainties. This paper outlines the state of the art and research opportunities in this area by providing a comprehensive literature review and extensive discussions. It starts by presenting the motivations and challenges, followed by a summary of existing data sources for SE in power systems. Subsequently, for both transmission system (static and dynamic) and distribution system SE, existing methods are systematically reviewed and categorized based on the addressed challenges. Interesting attempts of using novel measurements in SE are also studied. Finally, the paper concludes by providing a detailed discussion on the remaining research gaps and future research directions to be explored.</description></item><item><title>Appliance Identification via Combinatorial Fusion Analysis-Assisted Bayesian-Optimized Classifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10154009</link><description>Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) aids in estimating the individual energy consumed by different appliances using aggregate signals measured at point of common connection. This paper explores various unexplored aspects concerning load classification in NILM. Rich feature sets are extracted from load signatures using auto-correlogram, Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), and Wavelet Packet Tree (WPT) decomposition. Typically, previous works employ a single Feature Selection (FS) technique to earmark the relevant features for improved performance of NILM. However, each FS technique behaves uniquely, and the effects of using different FS techniques or their combinations have yet to be explored for NILM. Hence, Combinatorial Fusion Analysis (CFA), which surpasses the performance of a single FS technique by considering an optimal combination of multiple FS techniques, is used in this paper. The final selected features are fused and provided to a classifier. Rather than manually tuning or performing an exhaustive search for setting the classifier&#8217;s hyper-parameters, as prevalent in previous works, the present work utilizes Bayesian Optimization (BO) comprising surrogate and acquisition functions. The proposed work&#8217;s efficacy is validated on publicly available data-sets in a host computer and an embedded device, namely, R-Pi, via comparison with previous works.</description></item><item><title>Distribution System Flexibility Characterization: A Network-Informed Data-Driven Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10298800</link><description>A distribution system can flexibly adjust its substation-level power output by aggregating its local distributed energy resources (DERs). Due to DER and network constraints, characterizing the exact feasible power output region is computationally intensive. Hence, existing results usually rely on unpractical assumptions or suffer from conservativeness issues. Sampling-based data-driven methods can potentially address these limitations. Still, existing works usually exhibit computational inefficiency issues as they use a random sampling approach, which carries little information from network physics and provides few insights into the iterative search process. This letter proposes a novel network-informed data-driven method to close this gap. A computationally efficient data sampling approach is developed to obtain high-quality training data, leveraging network information and legacy learning experience. Then, a classifier is trained to estimate the feasible power output region with high accuracy. Numerical studies based on a real-world Southern California Edison network validate the performance of the proposed work.</description></item><item><title>Geometry-Based UAV-MIMO Channel Model for Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Assisted Communication Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10243637</link><description>A geometry-based channel model including the arbitrary trajectory of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the power radiation patterns of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) reflecting elements and transmit antenna elements, mutual coupling among IRS row and column reflecting elements, and IRS coverage area is proposed in this article. In the line-of-sight (LoS) dominated communication scenarios, only part of the signal power can be reflected by IRS, and the performance gain of the UAV-enabled systems can be enhanced by using the reflected signal power. The mutual coupling among IRS reflecting elements, which limits the performance gain of IRS-assisted systems, is also investigated in the proposed model. Due to the limitation of coverage area of IRS, the IRS is not always effective in the process of UAV movement, and the activated conditions of IRS are also derived. In order to fully consider the influence of UAV's trajectory, we investigate the time-varying parameters including azimuth angles, elevation angles, and suboptimal reflection phases of IRS when it is activated. In the proposed model, we also investigate the influence of the mutual coupling among IRS reflecting elements on spatial-temporal correlation and ergodic channel capacity. Numerical results reveal that the mutual coupling of IRS reflecting elements reduces the performance gain of IRS-assisted systems. Also, it can be observed that IRS coverage area affects the performance gain of IRS-assisted systems, and when both UAV and receiver (Rx) are in IRS coverage area, the performance gain can be enhanced.</description></item><item><title>Urban Internet of Electric Vehicle Parking System for Vehicle-to-Grid Scheduling: Formulation and Distributed Algorithm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10216347</link><description>The application of Internet of electric vehicles has greatly enhanced the efficiency of the urban intelligent transportation system. The coordination of Internet of electric vehicles is crucial for improving the quality of public services in smart cities, such as vehicle-to-grid regulation and edge computing service. However, existing studies have unilaterally considered the application of one of these two services, which neglects the potential benefits of their combined optimization. In this article, we propose an urban Internet of electric vehicle parking system for vehicle-to-grid scheduling. Specifically, we solve the problems of Internet of electric vehicles allocation and scheduling with joint vehicle-to-grid regulation service and edge computing service. First of all, we formulate the joint problem as a mixed-integer quadratic programming problem. Then, through the alternating direction method of multipliers method, we decouple the main problem into sub-problems for Internet of electric vehicles. Then, we devise a distributed algorithm to solve each sub-problem. The simulation results show that our proposed model is effective in Internet of electric vehicles' allocation and vehicle-to-grid scheduling for the joint regulation and edge computing service. Furthermore, the power fluctuations of the city power grid can be well flattened by providing the vehicle-to-grid regulation service through effective communication network protocols.</description></item><item><title>Novel Modulation Technique Based Bidirectional DC to AC Dual Active Bridge for G2V and V2H</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10229201</link><description>In this article, a triangular modulation based variable frequency modulation technique for a single-phase single-stage isolated bidirectional DC to AC dual active bridge has been proposed. The proposed modulation technique requires a single carrier and can be realized using two different methods. Distinctively in method 1, 50% gating signal is provided to the AC side bridge and one leg of the DC side bridge without any phase shift. However, there exists a center-to-center (C2C) phase shift between the gating signal of two legs of DC side bridge where one leg of DC side bridge is operating at 50% duty cycle and another operating at sinusoidally modified variable frequency pulse width modulation (PWM). In method 2, no C2C phase shift exists between the gating signal of the two legs of the DC side bridge. In this case phase shift exists between bridges operating at 50% duty cycle. Presented techniques offer true zero current switching (ZCS) for the AC side bridges over the wide envelope of the line frequency, zero voltage switching (ZVS) turn ON and ZCS turn OFF for the DC side switches, near unity power factor, bidirectional power flow with improved efficiency of 96.19%. DSP based digital realization of both methods is elaborated in detail and out of the two methods, the implementation of method 1 is presented in this article. The concept is validated through simulation results and experimentation on a 500 W prototype using TMS320F28335 for vehicle-to-home (V2H) and grid-to-vehicle (G2V) applications.</description></item><item><title>Deep Attention Recognition for Attack Identification in 5G UAV Scenarios: Novel Architecture and End-to-End Evaluation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10210056</link><description>Despite the robust security features inherent in the 5G framework, attackers will still discover ways to disrupt 5G unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations and decrease UAV control communication performance in Air-to-Ground (A2G) links. Operating under the assumption that the 5G UAV communications infrastructure will never be entirely secure, we propose Deep Attention Recognition (DAtR) as a solution to identify attacks based on a small deep network embedded in authenticated UAVs. Our proposed solution uses two observable parameters: the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) and the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) to recognize attacks under Line-of-Sight (LoS), Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS), and a probabilistic combination of the two conditions. Several attackers are located in random positions in the tested scenarios, while their power varies between simulations. Moreover, terrestrial users are included in the network to impose additional complexity on attack detection. Additionally to the application and deep network architecture, our work innovates by mixing both observable parameters inside DAtR and adding two new pre-processing and post-processing techniques embedded in the deep network results to improve accuracy. We compare several performance parameters in our proposed Deep Network. For example, the impact of Long Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) and Attention layers in terms of their overall accuracy, the window size effect, and test the accuracy when only partial data is available in the training process. Finally, we benchmark our deep network with six widely used classifiers regarding classification accuracy. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) outperforms all other algorithms in the deep network, for instance, the three top scoring algorithms: Random Forest (RF), CatBoost (CAT), and XGB obtain mean accuracy of 83.24 %, 85.60 %, and 86.33% in LoS conditions, respectively. When compared to XGB, our algorithm improves accuracy by more than 4% in the LoS condition (90.80% with Method 2) and by around 3% in the short-distance NLoS condition (83.07% with Method 1).</description></item><item><title>Platoon Partition and Resource Allocation for Ultra-Reliable V2X Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10213228</link><description>In this article, we study the joint platoon partition, power control and spectrum allocation for platoon communication in cellular vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks with uncertain channel parameters. A distributionally robust (DR) optimization problem is formulated to maximize the vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) capacity whilst guaranteeing the reliability of intra-platoon communication. For solving the DR problem, a statistical-based approach is developed to learn the distributional ambiguity set from historical uncertain channels. Then, based on it, a data-driven equivalent transformation approach is proposed to transform the probabilistic vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) reliability requirement into a deterministic semidefinite expression. Considering that the resource allocation is built on the platoon partition result, the formulated problem is decomposed into a resource allocation problem and a platoon partition problem. Then, a low-complexity two-stage wireless resource allocation strategy is proposed for V2X networks, which contains power control and spectrum matching. After that, the platoon partition is transformed into a specific Markov chain design problem. An exploration-consolidation learning algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal platoon partition according to the designed Markov transition rate. Finally, simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm is superior to other existing schemes.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Control Strategies for Connected Heavy-Duty Modular Fuel Cell Vehicles via Decentralized Convex Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10234673</link><description>Fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) are gaining popularity in heavy-duty transportation applications because of their high efficiency, lack of local emissions, and short refueling time. Moreover, cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC), which plans the longitudinal movements of heavy-duty vehicles, is also a potential solution to increase fuel efficiency, safety, and road capacity. In order to integrate the aforementioned two technologies, in this research, a homogeneous heavy-duty modular fuel cell vehicle (MFCV) platoon is hierarchically created using a decentralized optimization technique called the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (C-ADMM). The higher-level controllers coordinate platoon members&#8217; movements by accounting for aerodynamic effects, balancing string stability, and ensuring comfortable driving. Furthermore, power allocation is accomplished by lower-level controllers, minimizing total costs, which include hydrogen and degradation expenses. According to the simulation's findings, integrating the suggested power allocation approach with the proposed CACC method can reduce the overall cost by up to 7.5%. The calculation time of the presented technique can be reduced by an average of 60.17% and 68.27% compared to centralized and distributed methods, respectively. In addition, both the cybersecurity and delay analyses of the recommended decentralized architecture are also examined. The results indicate that the modularity of the proposed strategy leads to highly favorable consequences.</description></item><item><title>Com-DDPG: Task Offloading Based on Multiagent Reinforcement Learning for Information-Communication-Enhanced Mobile Edge Computing in the Internet of Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10233027</link><description>The emergence of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) introduces challenges regarding computation-intensive and time-sensitive related services for data processing and communication. Limited resource availability increases the processing latency and may cause application interruption due to the mobility of vehicles. To address the real-time requirements of users and tasks, mobile edge computing (MEC), in which data are processed at the network edge, has been proposed to collaborate with the cloud to provide better performance. However, the offloading strategies proposed previously have some shortcomings in addressing issues such as task dependency and resource competition. In this article, we propose a novel offloading strategy for MEC, Com-DDPG, in which multiagent reinforcement learning is used to enhance the offloading performance. Within the IoV transmission radius, multiple agents work together to learn the changes in the environment, such as the number of mobile devices and the queue of tasks, and take appropriate action in the form of a strategy for offloading to an edge server. First, we discuss models of task dependency, task priority, and resource consumption from the perspective of server clusters and multiple dependencies among tasks. In the proposed method, the communication behavior among multiple agents is formulated; then, the policy determined through reinforcement learning is executed as an offloading strategy to obtain the corresponding results. Second, to enhance the communication of information among multiple agents, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network is employed as an internal state predictor to provide a more complete environmental state, and a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) is used to learn and enhance the features obtained from the agents' communication. Finally, experiments carried out based on the Alibaba Cluster Dataset are presented. The results show that our method is superior to baseline methods in terms of energy consumption, load status and latency.</description></item><item><title>EH From V2X Communications: The Price of Uncertainty and the Impact of Platooning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10236004</link><description>In this article, we explore how radio frequency energy from vehicular communications can be exploited by an energy harvesting device (EHD) placed alongside the road to deliver data packets through wireless connection to a remote Access Point. Based on updated local topology knowledge, we propose a cycle-based strategy to balance harvest and transmit phases at the EHD, in order to maximize the average throughput. A theoretical derivation is carried out to determine the optimal strategy parameters setting, and used to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over different scenarios, taking into account the road traffic intensity, the EHD battery capacity, the transmit power and the data rate. Results show that regular traffic patterns, as those created by vehicles platooning, can increase the obtained throughput by more than 30% with respect to irregular ones with the same average intensity. Black out probability is also derived for the former scenario. The resulting tradeoff between higher average throughput and lower black out probability shows that the proposed approach can be adopted for different applications by properly tuning the strategy parameters.</description></item><item><title>Coordination of Varistors With Transient Voltage Suppression Diodes in Automotive DC Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10198899</link><description>The coordination of metal-oxide varistors with transient voltage suppression diodes commonly employed for the protection of sensitive electronic equipment in DC automotive systems is experimentally investigated.

Under such conditions, the safety and uninterrupted operation of vehicles containing low-voltage electrical circuits with embedded sensitive electronic equipment is threatened.</description></item><item><title>Influence Mechanism of the Mobile Grounding Reflux on the &#8220;Wheel-Rail&#8221; Rolling Arc at Insulated Joints of High-Speed Railway</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10227567</link><description>As a unique reflux path for trains, the &#8216;train-rail&#8217; mobile grounding system has the double functions &#8211; the traction power feedback and the transmission of train's communication signal. With the constant increment of operational velocity and traction power for high-speed railway, the coupling relationship existing in the &#8216;train-rail&#8217; mobile coupling grounding system becomes complicated, when the train's wheels roll over the insulated joint. It may result in the frequent occurrence of rolling arc and the ablation of rail ends and insulated joints, which might lead to the series connection of the rail circuit or even trigger the misjudgment of operational control system. As the impedances existing in the grounding system vary transiently when the relative distance between the train and the fixed terrestrial grounding installations changes, the dynamic coupling mechanism between the transiently-varying topology of reflux path and the distribution of reflux at each grounding wheel tends to be analyzed. Depending on the built &#8216;catenary-train-rail&#8217; dynamic coupling grounding reflux model, the correlation between the &#8216;train-rail&#8217; mobile grounding reflux and the evolutionary process of rolling arc is explored. In order to reduce the risk of &#8216;wheel-rail&#8217; arcing phenomenon, a novel method of automatically controlling insulated joint is proposed herein, as its feasibility is verified via the comparison with the original type of the insulated joint.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid QoE-Based Joint Admission Control and Power Allocation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10198891</link><description>In this paper, we propose a learning-based Quality of Experience (QoE) model for voice services based on real-world data that models the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) in terms of the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). Unlike earlier studies that used an objective approach to model QoE, one key feature of our study is the use of a hybrid approach to accurately evaluate QoE by learning human behaviors. We will also apply our model to a power allocation problem and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum of the QoE of users while guaranteeing the minimum data rate for each user. We show that the proposed hybrid model outperforms the conventional objective model in terms of average MOS and outage probability. Furthermore, users are more satisfied with the QoE maximization problem compared to the conventional rate maximization problem. Also, due to the limited power available to meet the needs of all users, we will introduce a joint power allocation and admission control problem. In our proposed approach, BSs monitor the outage probability and MOS of the overall system for each connection request to determine the service's perceived quality level and then decide whether or not to accept a new connection. The findings show a trade-off between the number of admitted users and their satisfaction levels, giving operators significant insight in terms of resource utilization.</description></item><item><title>Intelligent Mixed Reflecting/Relaying Surface-Aided Secure Wireless Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10198901</link><description>For intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided networks, it is known that high network performance requires a large surface of IRS due to multiple path losses. Moreover, if a secure communication system wants to obtain a higher secrecy rate, more passive reflecting elements are needed, resulting in larger size of IRS. However, even though we increase more elements of IRS, we will face the problem of limited performance improvement. To solve this problem, we propose a secure communication architecture where an intelligent mixed reflecting/relaying surface (IMRRS) aids information transmission. We formulate the exact secrecy energy efficiency expression, and then aim to design an energy-efficient scheme to realize intelligent reflecting element (IRE) working mode selection and secure dynamic hybrid resource management. To address the formulated problem, we propose a fast IRE working mode selection method and a quantum-inspired bald eagle search (QBES) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, which can exploit the IMRRS benefits and improve security performance during information transmission.</description></item><item><title>Angular Information Based Robust Downlink Transmission for IRS-Enhanced Cognitive Satellite-Aerial Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10202572</link><description>This article proposes a downlink transmission for intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) enhanced cognitive-satellite-aerial-network, which can provide heterogeneous services for various users. The satellite adopts multicast transmission scheme to provide content-aware services for many satellite terminals, while the aerial platform offers connection-centric services for users having line-of-sight links through space division multiple access, and for users locating in blocked aera via IRS-enhanced non-orthogonal multiple access. Assuming that the satellite network and aerial network share the same spectrum, and only the imperfect channel state information is available, we formulate a total transmit power minimization problem subject to the outage probability constraints for users, the per-antenna transmit power budgets of satellite and aerial platform, and unit-modulus requirement for IRS. To tackle this mathematically intractable problem, we propose an alternation-based robust transmission algorithm, combining the central limit theorem, successive convex approximation and penalty function, to optimize the beamformers of satellite and aerial platform, phase shifts and power allocation. Furthermore, we propose a generalized zero-forcing based low-complexity robust transmission algorithm, integrating the second-order Taylor expansion and Bernstein-type inequality, to obtain a satisfactory performance while reducing the computational load. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed two algorithms and show the superiority to benchmarks.</description></item><item><title>Minimizing Average Age of Information in Reliable Covert Communication on Time-Varying Channels</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10214149</link><description>Covert communication in delay-sensitive application scenarios in the presence of an eavesdropper has drawn substantial attention in the context of data sensing and transmission. However, most of the existing works only focus on guaranteeing communication covertness, and information freshness by characterizing a recently new metric, termed as age of information (AoI), while they ignore the age of channel variation (AoC), which is the time duration that channel state information (CSI) is near-static, and important for reliable covert communication in dynamic environments. Depending on the packet length or dynamic environment, channel variation may occur faster than optimal AoI, and the power allocated to the users is not reliable to ensure covert communication. In this article, we propose a novel reliable covert communication scheme with the aim of minimizing AoI in the time-varying channels. We address two main challenges in time-varying networks: 1) transmitting users' packets with the requested desirable size; 2) guaranteeing reliable the negligible Eve's probability detection. In the simulation results, we show the performance and percentage of reliability of covert communication with the aim of minimizing AoI subject to a new constraint that guarantees the Eve's negligible detection probability compared to the existing schemes.</description></item><item><title>High-Speed Resource Allocation Algorithm Using a Coherent Ising Machine for NOMA Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10225415</link><description>Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique is important for achieving a high data rate in next-generation wireless communications. A key challenge to fully utilizing the effectiveness of the NOMA technique is the optimization of the resource allocation (RA), e.g., channel and power. However, this RA optimization problem is NP-hard, and obtaining a good approximation of a solution with a low computational complexity algorithm is not easy. To overcome this problem, we propose the coherent Ising machine (CIM) based optimization method for channel allocation in NOMA systems. The CIM is an Ising system that can deliver fair approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems at high speed (millisecond order) by operating optimization algorithms based on mutually connected photonic neural networks. The performance of our proposed method was evaluated using a simulation model of the CIM. We compared the performance of our proposed method to simulated annealing, a conventional-NOMA pairing scheme, deep Q learning based scheme, and an exhaustive search scheme. Simulation results indicate that our proposed method is superior in terms of speed and the attained optimal solutions.</description></item><item><title>Robust Transmit and Reflect Beamforming Design for IRS-Assisted Offshore NOMA Communication Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10219023</link><description>We consider a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) offshore communication system, where an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is deployed to assist the communication from a terrestrial base station (BS) to two ship users, and the channel state information (CSI) of the BS-user and BS-IRS channels is imperfect due to these channels' time-varying nature caused by wave fluctuation. By applying the bounded error model to describe the imperfect CSI, we conduct robust design on the BS's transmit beamforming and the IRS's reflect beamforming, which minimizes the BS's transmit power subject to the constraints of the users' minimum required data rates. An efficient alternating optimization algorithm based on the S-procedure, semidefinite programming, penalty, and successive convex approximation techniques has been proposed to solve the robust design problem. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is extended to the case where the IRS has the reflecting element grouping capability. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the BS's transmit power and guarantee the users' worst-case required data rates, as compared to other baseline algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Low-Overhead OTFS Transmission With Frequency or Time Domain Channel Estimation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10223427</link><description>Existing channel estimation techniques for orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) transmission are mostly based on the pilots embedded in the two-dimensional delay-Doppler domain, which significantly increases the signaling overhead. In this paper, three variants of OTFS transmission, i.e., frequency-domain pilot-aided (FD-PA) OTFS, time-domain pilot-aided (TD-PA) OTFS, and time-domain training sequence (TD-TS) OTFS, are proposed. They enable one-dimensional channel estimation and corresponding equalization to be applied in either frequency or time domain. The relationships among different channel representations for fast fading channels are first formulated with discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and inverse DFT matrices. The transmission frame construction and associated channel estimation methods are then presented in detail for FD-PA-OTFS, TD-PA-OTFS, and TD-TS-OTFS respectively. The theoretical mean-square-error (MSE) for each of the proposed channel estimation methods is also derived. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the MSE analyses and demonstrate that the proposed FD-PA-OTFS is the most effective transmission technique for high-mobility wireless communications in terms of diversity performance, signaling overhead, and power efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A RIS-Segmented Symbiotic Ambient Backscatter Communication System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10223412</link><description>This article proposes a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) segmented symbiotic ambient backscatter system, which is composed of a primary source (S), a RIS, and a cooperative receiver (D) that decodes the signals from S and RIS with the aid of successive interference cancellation (SIC). For such, the RIS is segmented into two zones, namely, an EP zone and a BD zone, where the EP zone is used to enhance the received primary signal at D while the BD zone is utilized to backscatter RIS's signal to D. The coexistence outage probability (COP) is first developed, which is shown to be dominated by the minimum number of reflectors in the two zones for sufficiently high transmit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In contrast, the sum ergodic capacity (EC) can only be improved by increasing the transmit power and the number of reflectors in the EP zone at high transmit SNR. Finally, two algorithms are designed to minimize the number of reflectors in the two zones while achieving acceptable COP or sum EC.</description></item><item><title>Sensing-Assisted Communication in Vehicular Networks With Intelligent Surface</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10226306</link><description>The recent development of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) technology offers new opportunities to meet high-throughput and low-latency communication as well as high-resolution localization requirements in vehicular networks. However, considering the limited transmit power of the road site units (RSUs) and the relatively small radar cross section (RCS) of vehicles with random reflection coefficients, the power of echo signals may be too weak to be utilized for effective target detection and tracking. Moreover, high-frequency signals usually suffer from large fading loss when penetrating vehicles, which seriously degrades the communication service quality of users inside vehicles. To handle this issue, we propose a novel sensing-assisted communication scheme by employing an intelligent omni-surface (IOS) on the surface of vehicles to enhance both sensing and communication (S&amp;amp;C) performance. To this end, we first propose a two-stage ISAC protocol, including the joint S&amp;amp;C stage and the communication-only stage, to fulfil more efficient communication performance improvements benefited from sensing. The achievable communication rate maximization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming, the IOS phase shifts, and the duration of the joint S&amp;amp;C stage. However, solving this ISAC optimization problem is highly non-trivial since inaccurate estimation and measurement information renders the achievable rate lack of closed-form expression. To handle this issue, we first derive a closed-form expression of the approximate achievable rate under uncertain location information, and then unveil a sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of the joint S&amp;amp;C stage to offer useful insights for practical system design. Moreover, two typical scenarios including interference-limited and noise-limited cases are analyzed to provide a performance bound and a low-complexity algorithm for the considered systems. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed sensing-assisted communication scheme in achieving a higher achievable rate with lower transmit power requirements.</description></item><item><title>Secure Task Offloading for Rural Area Surveillance Based on UAV-UGV Collaborations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10232891</link><description>The increasing availability of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has provided an emerging way for extensive surveillance and monitoring in civilian and military with the advantages of high flexibility, mobility, and bird's-eye features. To mitigate the limitations of on-board energy and computation capacity, UAVs usually offload intensive computation tasks (e.g., image/video processing) to base-station-enabled mobile-edge computing (MEC) facilities. However, base stations are not always available in rural areas. To this end, we propose to offload computation-intensive tasks to Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs), which have fixed routes (i.e., highways and roads). However, the UAV-UGV wireless communication may disclose the offloading information to potential eavesdroppers. Besides, such UGVs have sufficient computation slots but may run out of the target area after a period of traveling. In this article, the tasks cached on UAVs are modeled as a stochastic queue, and a secure communication strategy to offload the cached tasks from UAVs to UGVs is proposed. We try to maximize the average utility of such a UAV-UGV collaboration with respect to latency, power, velocity, anti-collision, and distance. To solve this non-convex mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, a fast converging and computationally efficient iterative algorithm is investigated utilizing the block coordinate descent method and the successive convex approximation technique. Experiment results demonstrate that our algorithm consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art scheme, significantly improving the average utility of the system.</description></item><item><title>RIS-Aided Secure Millimeter-Wave Communication Under RF-Chain Impairments</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10226270</link><description>The effects of hardware impairments (HWIs) on the secrecy performance of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted millimeter wave system are investigated, where a multi-antenna base station (BS) transmits confidential messages to a single-antenna mobile user (MU) in the presence of a single-antenna passive eavesdropper (Eve). Artificial noise (AN)-aided transmission by the BS is proposed for improving the achievable secrecy rate. As the first step, we construct a system model in the absence of HWIs. For this case, we present optimal solutions for the signal and AN powers, the beamforming design at the BS, and the phase shifts of the RIS elements. Then closed-form expressions are derived for the cumulative distribution functions of the signal-to-noise-ratios experienced at the legitimate and eavesdropping nodes. Finally, a compact solution is presented for the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) performance. At the next step, we extend our designs and analysis by considering the HWIs of the radio-frequency (RF) modules of the BS, MU and Eve. Our results highlight the detrimental impact of HWIs on the achievable ESR. Finally, we find that the ESR can be further increased by beneficially distributing the tolerable HWIs between the transmission and reception RF chains.</description></item><item><title>Two-Way Satellite-HAP-Terrestrial Networks With Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10230882</link><description>Satellite-high altitude platform (HAP)-terrestrial networks have been considered as an indispensable infrastructure of next-generation networks because they can offer massive access service with high throughput and broad coverage connections. Meanwhile, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and two-way relaying techniques are considered as potential technologies to enhance the spectrum efficiency and connectivity. Thus, in this article, the performance of two-way satellite-HAP-terrestrial networks with NOMA, which are subject to imperfect channel state information and successive interference cancellation, is investigated. Closed-form and asymptotic expressions for the outage probability, and ergodic capacity are derived to verify the impact of the system and channel parameters on the considered network. Simulation results indicate that the optimization power allocation factor is independent of the channel fading.</description></item><item><title>A Robust Extended Hybrid Carrier System for the Next Generation Wireless Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10258371</link><description>The hybrid carrier (HC) system attracts attention as a fusion of the single carrier system and the multi-carrier system. In this article, we propose an extended hybrid carrier (EHC) system to ensure the reliability of wireless communication. The proposed scheme extends the framework of the HC system and provides robust bit error rate performance over the doubly-selective channels, which is considered a potential waveform for high-mobility scenarios. As an improved hybrid carrier system, the proposed scheme constructs the extended weighted fractional Fourier transform through multi-component extension and designs an orthogonal power layered multiplexing model. Additionally, the generic block modulation framework is adopted, offering design flexibility and compatibility. Besides, we discuss the low-complexity implementation and detection of the proposed scheme and derive the input-output relationship. The performance of the EHC system is analyzed under different conditions, and the simulations are given to demonstrate its feasibility and superiority. Retaining the advantages of the HC framework, the proposed scheme optimizes the energy distribution of the signals and achieves a more uniform residual interference distribution, resulting in superior interference suppression. The research results indicate that, compared with the existing HC schemes, the proposed EHC scheme shows significant improvement in the combined performance and meets the requirements of next-generation communications better.</description></item><item><title>Multimodal Fusion Assisted Mmwave Beam Training in Dual-Model Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10229493</link><description>Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication adopts narrow beams to combat severe propagation loss, resulting in unbearable training duration and overhead. To address this problem, this article proposes a beam training scheme based on a multimodal fusion network. We investigate the feature fusion process of mmWave channel power leakage (CPL) and sub-6 GHz channel state information (CSI) to provide richer feature information. Compared with the uni-modal counterparts (mmWave only or sub-6 GHz only), the complementarity and interactivity between different modalities make the proposed network more accurate and robust. Specifically, we propose a multimodal fusion network based on the instantaneous signal received by the mmWave wide beam and sub-6 GHz CSI to estimate the optimal narrow beam. In addition, the additional mmWave narrow beam decided by the predicted probabilities is employed to calibrate beam direction further. Moreover, two optimization strategies are presented based on the proposed multimodal fusion network. Firstly, to improve the robustness to noise in wide beam training, the long and short memory (LSTM) network is employed to track the motion direction of the user and calibrate the mmWave beam. And the wide beam for training is selected according to the previous prediction probability to reduce the training overhead. Secondly, since beam training focuses on partially specific information, to focus on its related features, we introduce the self-attention mechanism to improve the global consistency of the network. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed scheme can achieve significantly more accurate results with less overhead than traditional and existing deep learning-based methods.</description></item><item><title>Joint Optimization for Covert Communications in UAV-Assisted NOMA Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10230898</link><description>In this article, we investigate the design of the trajectory of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the transmit power of ground users to improve covert communications against a flying warden in UAV-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access networks, where the legitimate UAV can simultaneously collect the messages from the multiple ground users in a secure manner. Taking the channel uncertainty into account, we derive the analytical expressions of the optimal normalized detection threshold, the minimum detection error probability (DEP), and the security-guaranteed transmit power constraint for the ground users that are exploited to ensure a high DEP at the warden UAV. Subsequently, the design to maximize the average covert achievable rate (CAR) subject to the constraints of flight speed, initial and final locations, transmit power, and detection performance is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem. To obtain a high-quality solution to the design problem at hand, an iterative block coordinate descent-based successive convex approximation method is proposed. From the theoretical analysis, we find that a greater channel estimation uncertainly or a lower effective received power ratio at the warden UAV is beneficial in enhancing the system covertness towards the warden UAV. Moreover, when the successful detection probability of the warden UAV is sufficiently small, the maximum effective received power ratio is linearly and positively correlated to the detection success probability. Besides, extensive simulations are presented to verify the covert performance advantages brought by the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Communication and Computation Efficient Federated Learning for Internet of Vehicles With a Constrained Latency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10232909</link><description>Considering the privacy and security issues in Internet of Vehicles (IoV), wireless federated learning (FL) can be adopted to facilitate various emerging vehicular applications. However, wireless FL would suffer from a large learning latency due to the limitation of bandwidth and computing power as well as the unreliable communication caused by vehicle mobility. To cope with these challenges, a new structure is designed in this article to facilitate the implementation of FL for IoV. First, we apply the gradient compression and mini-batch federated stochastic gradient descent to reduce the local gradient transmission and computation. Then, with theoretical analysis of the convergence rate and the learning latency, the learning performance can be improved by maximizing the convergence rate under a constrained latency. Accordingly, an optimization problem is formulated to jointly optimize compression ratio, batch size, and spectrum allocation. To solve this problem, an iterative algorithm is developed by problem decomposition. From the results, compression ratio and batch size should be adjusted according to the channel state information and computing power of the road side units to boost the learning efficiency at the cost of slight degradation on the learning accuracy. The superiority of the proposed algorithm is finally demonstrated through extensive simulations.</description></item><item><title>Performance Analysis With Deep Learning Assay for Cooperative UAV-Borne IRS NOMA Networks Under Non-Ideal System Imperfections</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10236498</link><description>Internet of Things (IoT) inspired wireless networks foresee intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) as promising techniques to boost the spectral and energy efficiency, while unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as fast and flexible entity for enhancing the wireless connectivity. In this regard, we study a cooperative UAV-borne IRS system employing NOMA transmissions to serve multiple users on the ground. We take into account the impacts of residual hardware impairments (HIs) in devices and imperfect successive interference cancellation (I-SIC) in NOMA, which are inevitable in practical system implementation. We analyze the system performance by deriving the closed-form expressions of outage probability (OP) and ergodic rate of users over the line-of-sight (LoS) Rician fading channels for the aerial IRS links and non-LoS Rayleigh fading for the terrestrial direct links. We further pursue asymptotic analysis for both OP and ergodic rate to reveal useful insights on the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) slope and achievable diversity order. Also, we evaluate the system throughput under the delay-limited and delay-tolerant transmission modes. Above all, aiming toward real-time IoT applications of UAV-IRS empowered NOMA system, we present a deep neural network (DNN) framework for OP and ergodic rate predictions with a short execution time under the dynamic stochastic environment. Our results validate the theoretical analyses and accentuate the performance advantages of the proposed UAV-borne IRS NOMA system over the conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) equivalent system.</description></item><item><title>Age-of-Information Minimization for UAV-Based Multi-View Sensing and Communication</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10290726</link><description>Due to flexible deployment and controllable mobility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have great potential for supporting many time-critical sensing applications. In this article, we investigate UAV-based wireless sensing and communication in which one UAV with an onboard camera sensor senses ground targets from multiple different views and transmits the sensing data to a remote ground controller (GC). With the objective of improving the freshness of the information received at the GC while ensuring the sensing quality, we develop a MUlti-view SensIng and Communication (MUSIC) framework and jointly optimize the parameters in the framework including the target visiting sequence, the number of sensing, UAV trajectory, service time and transmit power. To solve the corresponding mixed-integer non-convex problem, we propose a two-stage approach. Specifically, we first determine the target visiting sequence by considering a specific case, i.e., UAV senses each target only once, through the quadratic penalty (QP) and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods. Based on the obtained visiting sequence, we minimize the average peak age-of-information (PAoI) of all targets by jointly optimizing the variables contained in the MUSIC framework via the SCA and exhaustion methods. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint optimization approach outperforms the benchmark schemes.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Task Communication Resource Allocation for MIMO-Based Vehicular Fog Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10237302</link><description>In this article, we study the multi-task allocation design for vehicular fog computing (VFC) systems, where multiple vehicles offload multiple tasks simultaneously to enhance performance. The data, often originating from multiple sources, must be transmitted at a high data rate in parallel. For catering the thriving demands for transmitting thriving data generated by vehicles, multiple input multiple output (MIMO) antennas are mounted on all the vehicles. However, with an ordinary communcation strategy, the data rate in MIMO-empowered VFC systems may decrease due to the interference generated from MIMO antennas. On the other hand, more antennas may lead to higher energy consumption, which is antagonistic to vehicles powered by limited electricity. To address all these challenges, we aim to offload multiple tasks simultaneously with higher data rates and lower power consumption in MIMO-empowered VFC, while taking into account the mobility of vehicles and communication interference. This design is a mixed integer non-convex optimization problem that is challenging to solve. Therefore, a Fountain system is proposed, which is a novel multi-task allocation strategy adopting deep learning and convex optimization, that transforms the multi-task allocation optimization problem into a convex solvable one for achieving an effective sub-optimal solution. For the purpose to utilize Fountain in the real world, the effectiveness of Fountain is evaluated based on real-world vehicle trajectories. Compared with other schemes, simulation results illustrate that our proposed Fountain improves the average transmission data rate by up to 163% and reduces the average power consumption by up to 40%.</description></item><item><title>Performance Analysis of a VM-PM Repair Strategy in MEC-Enabled Wireless Systems With Bursty Traffic</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10202576</link><description>With the rapid development of wireless communication technology, Internet of Things (IoT) is more widely used in diverse application domains, hence bringing massive timely and bursty data flows. Mobile edge computing (MEC) enables computation and energy constrained IoT devices to offload tasks on powerful servers deployed at the edge of networks. Despite considerable advancements and merits, infrastructures in MEC systems are still lack of robustness. In order to better guarantee the response performance and effectively improve the dependability of the MEC-enabled wireless system, we propose a VM-PM repair strategy with PM preventive maintenance. By introducing Markovian arrival process (MAP) to capture bursty traffic, we model the local computing and edge computing as a MAP/M/1 queue and a MAP/M/$\bm N$ queue, respectively. Then, by using matrix-geometric solution, we obtain several key performance indexes, including task response latency, throughput, energy consumption level, and computation resource availability. Next, we carry out system experiments to explore the change trends of the system performance. Finally, we jointly optimize the key performance indexes by formulating a multi-objective mixed-integer optimization (MIO) problem.

However, the channels for wireless power transfer (WPT) and task offloading are hostile due to the severe signal attenuation. The conventional WP-MEC systems generally suffer from a dilemma caused by the trade-off between WPT and task offloading since they are usually implemented during different phases. To tackle these issues, we propose to reconfigure the propagation environment by deploying intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), and enable simultaneous WPT and task reception at the hybrid access point (HAP) by adopting the full duplex (FD) technique. Two types of IRS beamforming designs, i.e., dynamic and static IRS bemforming, are considered to strike a balance between the performance and signaling overhead as well as implementation complexity. We aim to maximize the computational rate of the IRS-assisted FD WP-MEC system with finite edge computing capability. An efficient alternating optimization (AO) method is proposed to tackle the non-convexity of the optimization problem. Specifically, the transmit power of the HAP and the IRS beamforming are optimized by the penalty method and successive convex approximation (SCA) method, respectively. The non-convexity of the sub-problem with respect to the system time allocation, the local computing frequencies and transmit power of the WDs is tackled by the variable substitution method. Numerical results are provided, which demonstrate the benefits of exploiting IRS and FD techniques.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Auction for Effective Energy Management in UAV-Assisted Vehicular Metaverse Synchronization Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10225312</link><description>In this article, we investigate an effective energy management scheme in a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted vehicular Metaverse synchronization system. UAVs purchase energy resources from an energy service provider (ESP) and collect data for a virtual service provider (VSP) to perform synchronization between physical objects and digital twins (DTs). The key issue is to motivate both ESP and UAVs to participate in the energy trading market. To doing so, we design an incentive mechanism that maximizes the revenue of the ESP while guaranteeing desired economic properties, i.e. individual rationality (IR) and incentive compatibility (IC). In particular, we first consider a single energy unit market, where a deep learning (DL)-based auction scheme is developed to construct neural networks from the analytical results of Myerson auction. The proposed DL-based auction is guaranteed to fulfill the optimal auction. We then consider a general scenario in which ESP has multiple energy units available to UAVs. A novel DL-based auction with feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) is proposed to jointly optimize the energy unit allocation and payment rules. We provide numerical results to demonstrate the performance improvement of the DL-based auction schemes compared to the classical auctions in terms of revenue, IC and IR. In particular, for the single energy unit market, the proposed DL-based auction scheme significantly improves the revenue compared with the classical auction and more interestingly, is able to avoid prevent UAVs from submitting their false values.</description></item><item><title>Partial Offloading and Resource Allocation for MEC-Assisted Vehicular Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10225386</link><description>Due to the long-distance communication and the limited resources, traditional full offloading algorithms cannot fully exploit radio and computation resources, which may cause more delays and higher energy consumption in mobile edge computing (MEC)-based vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks. To solve this problem, a novel resource allocation (RA) algorithm with partial offloading for uplink multiuser MEC-based V2X networks is proposed. The optimization objective is to minimize the weighted sum of delays and energy consumption subject to the constraints on the delay requirements of tasks, communication distance, and the computation capability of roadside units. The formulated problem is non-convex and challenging to solve. To this end, an alternating optimization approach is designed to convert the original problem into three subproblems. A tabu search-based matching algorithm (TSM) is designed to solve the offloading object-selection subproblem. Then, a graph coloring algorithm is used to achieve channel allocation. Moreover, the computation RA subproblem is transformed into a convex optimization problem through variable substitution, and the suboptimal offloading ratios and computation RA coefficients are obtained. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a lower total cost than the full offloading algorithm and the shortest distance matching algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Joint Access and Relay-Assisted Backhaul Resource Allocation for Dense mmWave Multiple Access Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10227608</link><description>In dense millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple access networks, there are a large number of wireless access links and wireless backhaul links. The mmWave bandwidth is shared among two types of links. So a time-division mode is appropriate for such a scenario to determine a reasonable backhaul/access transmission duration, which is critical to network performance. Meanwhile, minimizing energy consumption is also an important design objective. However, the existence of long backhaul links is an obstacle. The introduction of relay mode can overcome it, but it also leads to more complex mutual interference relationships. On the other hand, each individual (e.g., smart wireless device) wants to obtain the highest access data rate, but it may prevent the entire network from achieving the highest energy efficiency. To cope with these challenges, we propose the new mutual interference characterization method and model the joint access and relay-assisted backhaul resource allocation problem as a Stackelberg game. The Stackelberg Nash equilibrium is guaranteed by the rational design of utility function, and the corresponding solution is solved by a backward induction method. Simulation results show that, our scheme is superior to the state-of-the-art in terms of network sum rate and network energy efficiency, and also it achieves a better balance between the access data rate and backhaul data rate for each access point.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized User Allocation and Dynamic Service for Multi-UAV-Enabled MEC System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10234543</link><description>With the promising techniques and mobile applications of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks, the mobile edge computing (MEC) paradigm has been widely utilized to support the massive data processing and meet the computation demand of mobile devices. However, the service coverage is limited by the static servers. Therefore, the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with high mobility are deployed as aerial base stations (BS) to assist ground users to offload the task and process the data on edge. In this article, we introduce a decentralized user allocation and dynamic service scheme to assign the UAV deployment for a multi-UAV MEC system, which incorporates the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technology into a two-layer training framework. The continuous action, including the UAV trajectory and bit allocation of offloading, is first optimized in the lower layer, while the upper one concentrates on the discrete action space for the user allocation. In particular, we develop a constraint reward function that considers the communication quality in the lower layer to accomplish efficient communication. The well-trained neural network is embedded in the upper layer to provide rapid feedback for the upper environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance than the baseline methods in terms of the user energy consumption.</description></item><item><title>Fast Neighbor Discovery for Wireless Ad Hoc Network With Successive Interference Cancellation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10234701</link><description>Neighbor discovery (ND) is a key step in wireless ad hoc network, which directly affects the efficiency of wireless networking. Improving the speed of ND has always been the goal of ND algorithms. The classical ND algorithms lose packets due to the collision of multiple packets, which greatly affects the speed of the ND algorithms. Traditional methods detect packet collision and implement retransmission when encountering packet loss. However, they does not solve the packet collision problem and the performance improvement of ND algorithms is limited. In this paper, the successive interference cancellation (SIC) technology is introduced into the ND algorithms to unpack multiple collision packets by distinguishing multiple packets in the power domain. Besides, the multi-packet reception (MPR) is further applied to reduce the probability of packet collision by distinguishing multiple received packets, thus further improving the speed of ND algorithms. Six ND algorithms, namely completely random algorithm (CRA), CRA based on SIC (CRA-SIC), CRA based on SIC and MPR (CRA-SIC-MPR), scan-based algorithm (SBA), SBA based on SIC (SBA-SIC), and SBA based on SIC and MPR (SBA-SIC-MPR), are theoretically analyzed and verified by simulation. The simulation results show that SIC and MPR reduce the ND time of SBA by 69.02% and CRA by 66.03% averagely.</description></item><item><title>Dependency-Aware Service Migration for Backhaul-Free Vehicular Edge Computing Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10243639</link><description>Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is a promising paradigm to improve vehicular services through offloading complex computation tasks to the edge servers. However, the high mobility of vehicles requires frequent service migration among edge servers to guarantee uninterrupted services when vehicles traverse multiple cells. This brings great challenges. In this article, we design a dependency-aware backhaul-free migration scheme to enable service migration without relying on backhaul with constraints on task dependencies. Specifically, the vehicle proactively fetches the migrated results based on task dependencies from the original server and migrates the results to its dynamically connected servers along the traveling path. Considering the incurred intermittent communication and computation due to vehicle mobility, a joint offloading and migration optimization problem for determining the time to offload tasks and fetch results is formulated with a time-varying Markov decision process (MDP) to minimize the total energy consumption. Time-varying transition probability functions are derived to characterize the dynamics during intermittent offloading and fetching. Based on the MDP framework, an efficient online value iteration algorithm is developed by exploiting temporal correlation to estimate the time-varying value functions. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can achieve superior energy-saving performance compared to the baseline online schemes.</description></item><item><title>An Improved Power Expectation Propagation Detector for Massive MIMO Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10226249</link><description>Expectation propagation (EP) achieves promising performance under various antenna configurations and modulations in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection. Among existing EP variants, the improved EP (IEP) achieves the best bit-error-rate (BER) performance, but at the expense of slower convergence rate. In this correspondence, a novel power EP (PEP) detector is proposed to further enhance the efficiency of EP by balancing the convergence rate and BER performance with two variance-control factors derived from minimizing the $\alpha$-divergence in the moment matching. Numerical simulation results are illustrated to show that the proposed PEP can outperform state-of-the-art EP-based detectors in various MIMO scenarios.</description></item><item><title>On Beam Hopping Pattern Design for Satellite Communication Systems With Hybrid Precoding</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10207834</link><description>This correspondence studies the design of beam hopping (BH) pattern for satellite communication systems with hybrid analog-digital precoding.

Then, we propose Viterbi and greedy algorithm based methods to identify the optimized BH matrix, for regular and irregular BH patterns, respectively. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm with regular BH pattern outperforms the existing baseline method by 2.8 dB. Further, it is demonstrated that the proposed irregular BH pattern yields about 2 dB improvement over the regular pattern.</description></item><item><title>Robust Beamforming for IRS-Enhanced Uplink NOMA Transmission in Satellite Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10202563</link><description>In this article, a robust beamforming (BF) scheme is proposed for an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-enhanced uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission in satellite communications. Specifically, by assuming that the phase errors of the user-IRS link and user-satellite link follow the Gaussian or uniform distribution, we first formulate a constrained optimization problem to minimize the total transmit power, while satisfying the quality-of-service requirement of each user with the outage probability constraint. Then, a robust BF algorithm based on the central-limit theorem (CLT) and alternating optimization (AO) is proposed to obtain the passive BF weight vector of the IRS and the power allocation coefficients of users. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the superiority and robustness of proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>Security-Enhanced Directional Modulation Symbol Synthesis Using High Efficiency Time-Modulated Arrays</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10219052</link><description>Time-modulated arrays (TMAs) have been found useful to construct directional modulation (DM) transmitters, offering physical-layer security. Two issues, however, exist in conventional TMA DM, which are high power loss and generation of mirror harmonic frequency signals that may compromise wireless security. In this article, we propose to construct DM transmitters using a high efficiency TMA. By carefully designing the time sequences of the selected phase shifters, the DM symbols modulated upon multicarrier can be synthesized with suppressed mirror harmonic frequencies. It is shown that the proposed TMA DM transmitters here enjoy feeding network efficiency of 100%, and the transmit DM symbols can be synthesized at a pre-selected frequency only, significantly enhancing security performance. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated via bit error rate (BER) simulations. Meanwhile, The TMA DM can also be used as a potential technique for the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC).</description></item><item><title>Rate-Splitting Multiple Access-Based Cognitive Radio Network With ipSIC and CEEs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10234654</link><description>In this paper, we study the outage and ergodic rate performance of a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-based cognitive radio (CR) system, where the secondary transmitter aims to communicate with two RSMA users. Imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC) and channel estimation errors (CEEs) are considered in the proposed analysis. Analytical expressions for the outage probability (OP) and the ergodic rate (ER) are calculated. For a deeper understanding, the asymptotic behavior of OP and ER at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes are carried out. Illustrative simulation results are presented and reveal that: i) The OP decreases and the ER gradually increases with the increase of SNR, and eventually approaching a constant; ii) ipSIC and CEEs have a negative impact on the considered system; iii) The outage and ER performance of RSMA-based CR network outperforms CR-NOMA network due to its flexible control of interference; iv) The OP first decreases and then increases with the power allocated to the common message, and there exists an optimal power allocation factor to ensure the reliable performance.</description></item><item><title>Joint User Localization and Location Calibration of a Hybrid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10225368</link><description>The recent research in the emerging technology of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) has identified its high potential for localization and sensing. However, to accurately localize a user placed in the area of influence of an RIS, the RIS location needs to be known a priori and its phase profile is required to be optimized for localization. In this article, we study the problem of the joint localization of a hybrid RIS (HRIS) and a user, considering that the former is equipped with a single reception radio-frequency (RF) chain enabling simultaneous tunable reflections and sensing via power splitting. Focusing on the downlink of a multi-antenna base station, we present a multi-stage approach for the estimation of the HRIS position and orientation as well as the user position. Our simulation results, including comparisons with the Cram&#233;r-Rao lower bounds, demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed localization approach, while showcasing that there exists an optimal HRIS power splitting ratio for the desired multi-parameter estimation problem.</description></item><item><title>A Dynamic Group-Connected Design With True-Time-Delay for Wideband THz Beamforming</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10225726</link><description>Wideband Terahertz (THz) beamforming is a promising technology in the sixth generation (6G) wireless communications. The combination of ultra-wide bandwidth and ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) results in severe beam squint issues, leading to sharp decrease in the spectral efficiency. Replacing the phase shifters by a large amount of true-time-delays (TTDs) could eliminate the beam squint effect, but leads to unbearable power consumption. It becomes an enormous challenge to mitigate the beam squint effect while maintaining high energy efficiency simultaneously. This paper proposes a novel dynamic group-connected hybrid beamforming architecture with TTD (DGC-TTD) to tackle the above issue. Furthermore, a switch-aided delay-phase beamforming (SDPB) algorithm is proposed for the DGC-TTD architecture, which consists of a delay-phase design (DPD) procedure and a random switch selection (RSS) procedure to achieve the optimal tradeoffs between the spectral efficiency and the power consumption. The simulation results demonstrate that the DGC-TTD architecture with the proposed algorithm provides the near-optimal spectral efficiency and the maximal energy efficiency comparing with existing benchmark results.</description></item><item><title>Covert Communication in Intelligent Reflecting Surface Assisted Networks With a Friendly Jammer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10236006</link><description>In this article, we investigate covert communication in intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted networks with a friendly jammer where the jammer radiates random power jamming signals to confuse Willie in detecting the existence of the communication between Alice and Bob. We propose a novel technique that jointly optimizes the transmission probability, transmit power at Alice, IRS reflection matrix, and the interval of jamming power with the aim of maximizing the expected achievable rate at Bob while maintaining the covertness of the communication. In addition, we analyze the impact of the number of IRS elements on the detection error probability (DEP) at Willie and study the trade-off between the number of IRS elements and the covertness of the communication. We show through numerical simulations that the developed technique achieves near-optimal performance with low computational complexity and the analysis on the DEP at Willie is accurate.</description></item><item><title>Collaborative Computing Services at Ground, Air, and Space: An Optimization Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10216375</link><description>Multi-access edge computing (MEC)-enabled integrated space-air-ground networks have drawn much attention recently, as they can provide communication and computing services to wireless devices in areas that lack terrestrial base stations (TBSs). They could make it possible for battery-powered Internet of Things (IoT) devices to offload their computation tasks to MEC-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) assisted aerial networks and low earth orbit (LEO) satellites and thus reduce their energy consumption and allow them to complete the execution of tasks on time. However, due to the limited computation capacity of the MEC servers at UAVs and satellites, an efficient offloading decision and computation resource allocation scheme is essential. Therefore, this paper investigates the problem of minimizing the latency experienced by the wireless devices in the MEC-enabled integrated space-air-ground network by optimizing the offloading decision while assuring the energy constraints of both devices and UAVs. The problem is proved to be a non-convex problem, and the block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM) method is proposed as a solution. Finally, extensive simulation results are presented to exhibit the effectiveness of the BSUM algorithm in solving the proposed problem.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid NOMA for STAR-RIS Enhanced Communication</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10223312</link><description>In this paper, a hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) framework for the simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) enhanced cell-edge communication is investigated. Specifically, one transmitted user and one reflected user are paired as one NOMA-pair, while multiple NOMA-pairs are served via time division multiple access (TDMA). The objective is to maximize the minimum downlink rate by jointly optimizing the user pairing, decoding order, passive beamforming, power and time allocation. A novel two-layer iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the highly coupled problem. Simulation results show that: 1) the proposed framework outperforms the conventional reflecting-only-RIS-based and the OMA-based frameworks; 2) the beamforming design and power allocation dominate the achieved performance; 3) increasing the number of passive elements and shortening the distance between BS and STAR-RIS are two effective ways to further improve the performance.</description></item><item><title>Getting Ahead of the Curve: Assessment of New Photovoltaic Module Reliability Risks Associated With Projected Technological Changes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10347402</link><description>Maintaining the reliability of photovoltaic (PV) modules in the face of rapidly changing technology is critical to maximizing solar energy's contribution to global decarbonization. Our review describes expected changes in PV technology and their impacts on performance and reliability. We leverage PV market reports, interviews with PV researchers and other industry stakeholders, and peer-reviewed literature to narrow the multitude of possible changes into a manageable set of 11 impactful trends likely to be incorporated in near-term crystalline-silicon module designs. We group the trends into four categories (module architecture, interconnect technologies, bifacial modules, and cell technology) and explore the drivers behind the changes, their interactions, and associated reliability risks and benefits. Our analysis identifies specific areas that would benefit from accelerating the PV reliability learning cycle to assess emerging module products and designs more accurately. We recommend that researchers continue tracking module technologies and their reliability implications, so efforts can be focused on the most impactful trends. As the rapid technological turnover continues, it is also critical to incorporate fundamental knowledge into models that can predict module reliability. Predictive capabilities complete the PV reliability learning cycle&#8212;reducing the time required to assess new designs and mitigating the risks associated with large-scale deployment of new products.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Floating PV Systems With a Techno-Economic Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10284543</link><description>This article reviews floating photovoltaics, mainly on techno-economical, environmental, and O&amp;amp;M issues. Floating PV is a promising technology that is expected to establish a new global market in the near future. Recent years have seen the deployment of an increasing power that exceeded 3 GWp worldwide in 2021, and market analysts expect it will reach 4.8 GWp in 2026. The projected growth rate suggests that this technology is a promising complement to utility-scale land-mounted PV systems, mainly because it reduces or eliminates need for new land, reduces water evaporation from reservoirs, and can increase energy yield when compared with ground-mounted systems with similar fixed tilt. Despite its potential advantages, however, floating PV is more expensive than well-established rooftop and ground-mounted PV installations. Literature results showed that the CAPEX costs are around 20%&#8211;30% and the LCOE around 30% higher than ground-mounted systems. The present article provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art of floating PV, and describes the benefits and main drawbacks. We collected data from various sources available in the literature, ranging from evaluation studies to technical reports. Our review includes a special emphasis on the benefits and limitations of unmanned technologies used for maintenance purposes. Finally, we presented a cost breakdown comparison between the floating PV and ground-mounted PV, and combined information extracted from the literature with a case study in Italy.</description></item><item><title>Investigation of p-Type Silicon Heterojunction Radiation Hardness</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10334305</link><description>The space sector is facing significant upheavals, in particular, in terms of cost reduction challenges, driven by the emergence of low Earth orbit constellations. Concerning solar power generation, it opens up perspectives for alternative solar photovoltaics technologies, instead of the highly performant and expensive III-V multijunction devices. Crystalline silicon solar cells, which have fueled initial space developments, spark a renewed interest, thanks to their industrial maturity, high efficiencies on p-type substrates, and costs of two to three orders of magnitude lower than those of III-V. In this context, we present here the results of electrons radiation hardness studies on p-type (Ga-doped) silicon heterojunction solar cells.

However, the efficiency of all-perovskite tandem solar cells is still challenging due to the deficiency of low-bandgap Pb&#8211;Sn mixed perovskite solar cells. In this work, high-performance hole-transporting layer free (HTL-free) low-bandgap perovskite (1.29 eV) tandem solar cells are simulated with 1-D solar cell capacitance simulator. By optimizing work function, thickness, and doping concentration of the perovskite layer, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of HTL-free perovskite device reached to 19.14%. Furthermore, the all-perovskite tandem solar cell combined this HTL-free solar cell with MAGeI3 (1.9 eV) top solar is studied and the current matching condition between two subcells is obtained by the optimum thicknesses of perovskite layers, which are 700 and 350 nm for the bottom and top absorbers, respectively. The all-perovskite tandem solar cell reaches a PCE of 29.1%, which is among one of the top efficiency in perovskite-based solar cells.</description></item><item><title>A Model-free Approach for Estimating Service Transformer Capacity Using Residential Smart Meter Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10339803</link><description>Before residential photovoltaic (PV) systems are interconnected with the grid, various planning and impact studies are conducted on detailed models of the system to ensure safety and reliability are maintained. However, these model-based analyses can be time-consuming and error-prone, representing a potential bottleneck as the pace of PV installations accelerates.

However, MAPbI$_{3}$ (MA$^+$ = CH$_{3}$ NH$_{3}^+$)-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are extensively examined both on theoretical and experimental fronts. Compositional engineering, i.e., doping in the absorber layer (MAPbI$_{3}$) of HHP solar cells, seems to be very fruitful for improving overall photovoltaic performance and also the stability of PSC. In the present study, we perform a device optimization of GA-doped MAPbI$_{3}$-based PSC using numerical simulations. For better performance, several materials have been proposed as hole transport layer (HTL) and electron transport layer (ETL). Among them, zinc oxide (ZnO) and copper (I) oxide (Cu$_{2}$O) are found to be the most suitable ETL and HTL, respectively. In addition, the effect of various parameters, such as defect density and thickness of absorber layer have been investigated. Moreover, it has been found that the work function of the back contact electrode plays a vital role and its value should be more than 5 eV for the better performance of the proposed device. After considering all the optimized parameters, the proposed GA-doped MAPbI$_{3}$-based perovskite solar cell exhibits remarkable photovoltaic performance with a fill factor of 75.13% and power conversion efficiency of 24.61%. The present work contains sufficient information for the experimentalists to design solar cells containing GA-doped MAPbI$_{3}$ absorber layer.</description></item><item><title>The Effect of Different Concentrations of Molybdenum Trioxide in Electrolyte for Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs): Performance Enhancement of DSSCs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304269</link><description>Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)&#8217; photovoltaic conversion efficiency is decreased by recombination reactions at the photo anode/electrolyte interface. Herein, a new molybdenum trioxide ($\text{MoO}_{3}$) function is used as a treatment agent for electrolytes. $\text{MoO}_{3}$ added to the electrolyte precludes recombination of electrons with triiodide ($I_{3}^{-}$) ions at photoanodes/electrolyte interface by adsorbing anions (triiodide/iodide) from the electrolyte on its surface. After $\text{MoO}_{3}$ treatment, the electrochemical properties of the electrolytes do not change significantly but the power conversion efficiency of the DSSCs have clearly improved from 6.31% to 7.47%, owing primarily to higher open-circuit voltages. Different weight percentages of $\text{MoO}_{3}$ were added into the electrolyte: 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 wt%. $\text{MoO}_{3}$ are injected directly into electrolytes, good shake, and followed by centrifugation to obtain clear electrolytes. Clear electrolytes were measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, Mott&#8211;Schottky, current density&#8211;voltage, and open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements. This anionic adsorption onto the $\text{MoO}_{3}$ in the electrolyte has been confirmed by the scanning electron microscope, energy-dispersive X-ray, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy of molybdenum dioxide particles before and after injected into the electrolyte. UV-Vis measurements were carried out before and after centrifugation for electrolytes.</description></item><item><title>Simulation of the Effects of Geometry on Performance of Luminescent Solar Concentrator Photovoltaic Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10288559</link><description>This computational study presents the influences of device geometry, including shape, size, and thickness, on the performance of luminescent solar concentrator photovoltaic (LSC-PV) devices. LSC-PV device optical performance was simulated for 8 different device shapes: circular, regular triangular, pentagonal, hexagonal, square, and three rectangular with varying aspect ratios, with 10 different surface areas from 1 cm2 to 1 m2, and 10 different thicknesses from 0.2 to 5 cm; for 11 different concentrations, 10&#8211;110 parts per million (ppm), of 4 different organic dyes. Each of the LSC-PV devices employs monocrystalline silicon PV cells. The irradiance, as well as spectral distribution of irradiance received by the PV cells, has been simulated by means of Monte Carlo ray tracing to calculate the electrical power and power conversion efficiencies. The results show that triangles, pentagons, and hexagons have better optical performance than squares or circles. Furthermore, the optical internal loss of the LSC-PV device is positively correlated with the device size in which edge performance is relatively poor in larger size devices, and increasing lightguide thickness has a limited impact on the edge performance of the planar LSC-PV devices. Higher dye concentrations and greater stokes&#8217; shifts of the dyes led to more significant edge emissions. The best performance of 3.24% was attained for 1-cm-thick, 100 cm2 small triangular units suitable for matrix-dense packing, using 110 ppm of LR305 dye with a high photoluminescence quantum yield (95%) and a relatively large stokes shift (29 nm).</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Modeling of CPV Performance Loss Factors in Humid Continental Climate</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315952</link><description>Local climate and environmental conditions can impact the performance of concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) systems. There is a lack of experimental performance analysis of CPV systems, especially in the region with high snowfall and very low temperature in winters. In this article, we present first a CPV system performance in humid continental climate and identify snow and frost as sources of losses that are not considered in conventional predictive models. We propose then a method to account for the negative effect of snow and frost on the system, by adding monthly soiling factors in the predictive model. The monthly soiling factors are modeled based on average monthly snow fall and ambient temperature. Applying this method, decrease in root-mean-square error (RMSE) between predicted and actual energy production from 24.51 to 5.07% validates our model in humid continental climate for CPV systems.</description></item><item><title>Effect of Thermal Cycling Aging Photovoltaic Ribbon on the Electrical Performance of Photovoltaic Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10313090</link><description>The objective of this study was to reveal the impact of aging photovoltaic ribbon welding layer materials on the performance of photovoltaic modules. We conducted thermal cycling aging on photovoltaic ribbon, solar cells, and solar cells welded with photovoltaic ribbons. Using scanning electron microscopy, we observed the welded interface morphology of photovoltaic ribbon. The results show that the solder exhibited coarsening, the voids increased, and the intermetallic compound layer thickened at the welding layer. These changes can lead to a decrease of the peeling force in the welding layer, as well as a degradation in the performance of photovoltaic modules. After 200 cycles of thermal cycling aging, the peeling forces of the welded photovoltaic ribbons on the front and back of the solar cell decreased by 0.588 and 3.236 N, respectively. To verify the impact of the aging of the welding layer on the performance of photovoltaic modules, we designed experimental plans for the independent aging of photovoltaic ribbons, solar cells, and solar cells welded with photovoltaic ribbons, combined aging materials, and fabricated four types of photovoltaic modules. After 200 cycles of thermal cycling aging, the power degradation rates of the four photovoltaic modules were 5.9% (aged photovoltaic ribbons + unaged solar cells), 7.5% (unaged photovoltaic ribbons + aged solar cells), 12.5% (aged photovoltaic ribbons + aged solar cells), and 14.3% (aged solar cells welded with photovoltaic ribbons). These results reveal the relationship between the aging of photovoltaic ribbons and the power degradation of photovoltaic modules.</description></item><item><title>Understanding and Benchmarking Ground Reflectors for Bifacial Photovoltaic Yield Enhancement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10272316</link><description>Bifacial modules combined with optimally positioned ground reflectors (albedo) can boost photovoltaic (PV) yield. Yet, a rigorous understanding and benchmarking of the reflector performance is missing, which leads to errors in power yield and economic estimates, thus hampering PV market penetration. Here, we address this impediment by establishing an experimentally validated reverse ray tracing (RRT) approach, combined with empirically derived parameters. First, we determine the spectro-angular reflection of a wide class of ground reflectors (diffuse, glossy, and specular). These parameters were fed into our RRT software, that simulated the PV yield, which was then experimentally validated with a model PV system. The validated framework enables determining an upper limit to PV yield enhancement and current mismatch within modules exposed to different kinds of reflectors. Our approach helps assessing already-existing natural and exotic reflectors, and inspire novel reflectors for enhanced PV yield and economic benefits.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid GMPPT Technique for Photovoltaic Series Based on Fractional Characteristic Curve</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10288588</link><description>This article proposes a hybrid global maximum power point (MPP) tracking technique, named improved global fractional characteristic curve (IGFCC), which combines the advantages of both the model-based and heuristic techniques. The IGFCC technique aims to achieve high speed and accuracy in tracking the MPP of photovoltaic (PV) modules. The model-based technique employed in the IGFCC technique utilizes a precise single-diode model that considers the effects of irradiance and temperature to estimate the MPP voltage. This model-based approach ensures accurate tracking of the MPP and is particularly suitable for PV series applications with string inverters. One of the advantages of the IGFCC technique is its computational efficiency. It involves solving simple equations derived from the single-diode model, which reduces the computational effort required for MPP tracking. This makes the technique practical and feasible for real-time implementation.</description></item><item><title>Model-Based Assessment of the Incident Angle Modifier on the Annual Angular Losses and Gain of PV Modules in Tracking Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292989</link><description>In a competitive photovoltaic (PV) solar energy market, precise and accurate modeling of the energy produced by a PV power plant is required to obtain the best technical and economic project. In particular, slight differences in the predicted energy produced are relevant due to the project size. Typically, the energy calculation includes the direct and diffuse components of the solar radiation at normal incidence. The incident angle's influence is considered using the incident angle modifier (IAM). This study model the experimental values of the IAM available in the literature using the physical, ASHRAE, SANDIA, and Martin&#8211;Ruiz models. Also, a new mathematical model based on only one parameter to describe the IAM is presented. The IAM is used to determine the annual angular losses (AAL) and energy gain using different solar tracking strategies compared with the horizontal plane for locations at different latitudes and climate zones. The results showed that the IAM is sensitive to radiation under indoor and outdoor conditions, quantified by the parameters employed to fit the experimental data. Also, results revealed that the gain in PV systems using solar tracker systems is improved if the AAL is considered.</description></item><item><title>Quantification of the Impact of Azimuth and Tilt Angle on the Performance of a PV Output Power Forecasting Model for BIPVs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286995</link><description>Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) have become increasingly popular in urban areas due to their potential to provide zero-emission energy in buildings. BIPVs enable the use of MO of photovoltaic (PV) modules, resulting in multiple generation peaks throughout the day, which can closely match the consumption profile of a building. However, designing a PV output power forecasting model for BIPVs can be complex, as multiple generation peaks may occur. In general, prior works focused on the design of a PV output power forecasting model and the study of the impact of tilt and azimuth angle variations on the annual yield of a PV system independently. The interaction between the two problems has received little or no attention in the literature. Considering the recent rapid development of BIPVs, it is therefore extremely important to understand this. This article, therefore, aims to quantify the impact of mixed orientations on the accuracy of a PV output prediction model for an 181.15 $\text{kW}_{p}$ BIPV system located in Trondheim, Norway. The results indicate that the mixed orientations resulted in a notable rise in forecast error, with a maximum increase of 51% in root mean squared error, when compared with a baseline model that accounted for all orientations. These findings have important implications for developing practical predictive energy management systems for BIPVs.</description></item><item><title>Net Zero Water Withdrawal Strategies and Multicriteria Impacts for PV Manufacturing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10297559</link><description>Net zero water withdrawal is a sustainable development strategy for manufacturing in water-stressed locations. A case study in Tamil Nadu, India shows that sustainable net zero water withdrawal photovoltaics (PV) manufacturing can be achieved by a) utilizing on-site wastewater treatment and zero liquid discharge units to maximize the usage of onsite reclaimed water, b) using offsite reclaimed water to meet the remaining water demand, and c) implementing continuous improvement in water conservation. Net zero water can be combined with net zero electricity to reduce the life cycle water footprint of PV modules by &#8764;60% while also reducing the life cycle carbon footprint by &#8764;40%. While crucial for managing local water and energy resources, net zero strategies have a relatively small (&#8764;20%) impact on reducing the total multicriteria product footprint. Adding a third strategy of high value recycling with semiconductor recovery can achieve up to &#8764;65% reduction in the multicriteria PV module product environmental footprint covering health, ecosystem, and natural resource impact categories.</description></item><item><title>Variable Conversion Approach for Design Optimization of Low-Voltage Low-Pass Filters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10335630</link><description>This article describes a design optimization method based on variable conversion applied to low-voltage (LV) CMOS analog integrated circuits. For supply voltages in the range of 0.3 to 0.6 V, traditional design variables (e.g., transistor channel width  $W$  and  $\text {gm}/I_{D}$ ) are not suitable for exploring the design space, leading to impractical design solutions. We show that it is more efficient to convert the design variables into current  $I_{D}$  and channel length  $L$ , since these parameters are directly related to circuit performance for LV applications. The proposed optimization algorithm explores the design space to obtain solutions that satisfy the design constraints while analyzing the effects of process, voltage, and temperature variations (PVT). We apply the proposed method for design optimization in terms of area and power consumption of a fourth-order LV active filter preceded by a programmable gain amplifier (PGA), in 130 nm CMOS technology. A fully differential 0.6 V operational amplifier (OTA) is designed as a building block and used in the filter in a bottom-up approach. Measurements of a prototype chip validate the proposed method and resulted in a 0.784 mW, 0.066 mm2 active low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 2.5 MHz and attenuation that meet the requirements of the IEEE 802.15.4 technical standard for 2.4 GHz receivers.</description></item><item><title>Enabling Voltage Over-Scaling in Multiplierless DSP Architectures via Algorithm-Hardware Co-Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10334301</link><description>The design of low-power digital signal processing (DSP) architectures have gained a lot of attention due to their use in a variety of smart edge applications and portable devices. Recent efforts have focused on the replacement of power-hungry multipliers with various approximation frameworks such as multiplierless architectures that require only a few bit-shifts, additions and/or multiplexers when the multiplicand coefficients are known a priori. However, most existing multiplierless and approximation-based works have not been combined systematically with voltage over-scaling (VOS), which is considered one of the most effective power saving approaches, while the few that have tried, were applied to specific case studies with custom modifications. In this article, we are proposing a generic optimization framework that not only minimizes the hardware units in any time-multiplexed directed acyclic graph (TM-DAG) multiplier but also allows the reliable completion of most operations and the avoidance of random timing errors under VOS. This is achieved by synthesizing alternative coefficients that approximate well the original ones, while also activating shorter critical paths. As a result when VOS is applied, minor quality degradation occurs due to the coefficient approximations which are deterministic by design, while the gained timing slack of the new multiplicands allow us to reduce the supply voltage and circumvent the random timing errors induced by the increased delay under iso-frequency/throughput. Our experiments have indicated that when our framework is applied on fast Fourier transform (FFT) and discrete cosine transform (DCT) architectures, it results in up to 34.07% power savings, when compared to conventional multiplierless architectures, while it induces minimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) degradation, even when voltage is reduced by up to 20%.</description></item><item><title>A Masked Hardware Accelerator for Feed-Forward Neural Networks With Fixed-Point Arithmetic</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10359503</link><description>Neural network (NN) execution on resource-constrained edge devices is increasing. Commonly, hardware accelerators are introduced in small devices to support the execution of NNs. However, an attacker can often gain physical access to edge devices. Therefore, side-channel attacks are a potential threat to obtain valuable information about the NN. In order to keep the network secret and protect it from extraction, countermeasures are required. In this article, we propose a masked hardware accelerator for feed-forward NNs that utilizes fixed-point arithmetic and is protected against side-channel analysis (SCA). We use an existing arithmetic masking scheme and improve it to prevent incorrect results. Moreover, we transfer the scheme to the hardware layer by utilizing the glitch-extended probing model and demonstrate the security of the individual modules. To exhibit the effectiveness of the masked design, we implement it on an FPGA and measure the power consumption. The results show that with two million measurements, no secret information is leaked by means of a  $t$ -test. In addition, we compare our accelerator with the masked software implementation and other hardware designs. The comparison indicates that our accelerator is up to 38 times faster than software and improves the throughput by a factor of about 4.1 compared to other masked hardware accelerators.</description></item><item><title>IPOCIM: Artificial Intelligent Architecture Design Space Exploration With Scalable Ping-Pong Computing-in-Memory Macro</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10323361</link><description>Computing-in-memory (CIM) architecture has become a possible solution to designing an energy-efficient artificial intelligent processor. Various CIM demonstrators indicated the computing efficiency of CIM macro and CIM-based processors. However, previous studies mainly focus on macro optimization and low CIM capacity without considering the weight update strategy of CIM architecture. The artificial intelligence (AI) processor with a CIM engine practically induces issues, including updating memory data and supporting different operators. For instance, AI-oriented applications usually contain various weight parameters. The weight stored in the CIM architecture should be reloaded for the considerable gap between the capacity of CIM and growing weight parameters. The computation efficiency of the CIM architecture is reduced by the weight updating and waiting. In addition, the natural parallelism of CIM leads to the mismatch of various convolution kernel sizes in different networks and layers, which reduces hardware utilization efficiency. In this work, we develop a CIM engine with a ping-pong computing strategy as an alternative to typical CIM macro and weight buffer, hiding the data update latency and improving the data reuse ratio. Based on the ping-pong engine, we propose a flexible CIM architecture adapting to different sizes of neural networks, namely, intelligent pong computing-in memory (IPOCIM), with a fine-grained data flow mapping strategy. Based on the evaluation, IPOCIM can achieve a 1.27&#8211; $6.27\times $  performance and 2.34&#8211; $5.30\times $  energy efficiency improvement compared to the state-of-the-art works.</description></item><item><title>HARDSEA: Hybrid Analog-ReRAM Clustering and Digital-SRAM In-Memory Computing Accelerator for Dynamic Sparse Self-Attention in Transformer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10367847</link><description>Self-attention-based transformers have outperformed recurrent and convolutional neural networks (RNN/ CNNs) in many applications. Despite the effectiveness, calculating self-attention is prohibitively costly due to quadratic computation and memory requirements. To solve this challenge, this article proposes a hybrid analog-ReRAM and digital-SRAM in-memory computing accelerator (HARDSEA), a computing-in-memory (CIM) accelerator supporting self-attention in transformer applications. To trade off between energy efficiency and algorithm accuracy, HARDSEA features an algorithm-architecture-circuit codesign. A product-quantization-based scheme dynamically facilitates self-attention sparsity by predicting lightweight token relevance. A hybrid in-memory computing architecture employs both high-efficiency analog ReRAM-CIM and high-precision digital SRAM-CIM to implement the proposed new scheme. The ReRAM-CIM, whose precision is sensitive to circuit nonidealities, takes charge of token relevance prediction where only computing monotonicity is demanded. The SRAM-CIM, utilized for exact sparse attention computing, is reorganized as an on-memory-boundary computing scheme, thus adapting to irregular sparsity patterns. In addition, we propose a time-domain winner-take-all (WTA) circuit to replace the expensive ADCs in ReRAM-CIM macros. Experimental results show that HARDSEA prunes BERT and GPT-2 models to 12%&#8211;33% sparsity without accuracy loss, achieving  $13.5\times $ &#8211; $28.5\times $  speedup and  $291.6\times $ &#8211; $1894.3\times $  energy efficiency over GPU. Compared to state-of-the-art transformer accelerators, HARDSEA has  $1.2\times $ &#8211; $14.9\times $  better energy efficiency at the same level of throughput.</description></item><item><title>Write&#8211;Verify-Free MLC RRAM Using Nonbinary Encoding for AI Weight Storage at the Edge</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10275806</link><description>High-density and reliable multilevel-cell (MLC) resistive random access memory (RRAM) is expected to meet the ever-increasing demand for on-chip weight storages in the intelligent edge devices. However, due to the device variations, many write-and-verify (WAV) iterations are usually required to program the RRAM cell, which causes high power consumption, long latency, and degradation on the memory lifetime. To address this issue, we propose a write&#8211;verify-free MLC RRAM macro for weight storage with 1) a cascode-current-mirror multibit write (CCM-MW) driver and 2) a nonbinary programming scheme (NB-PS) with a radix not greater than 2. A 180-nm 400-Kb RRAM test chip is demonstrated in silicon. For 2-bit-per-cell MLC storage, the value error rates can be reduced by 24.13% after introducing two redundant bits (RBDs). In addition, compared to the single-level cell (SLC) storage scheme, a 37.50% reduction in the number of cells can be achieved to store the ResNet-8 model with a 0.79% loss in inference accuracy without the need for WAV iterations.</description></item><item><title>SiPGuard: Run-Time System-in-Package Security Monitoring via Power Noise Variation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286457</link><description>As Moore&#8217;s law comes to a crawl, advanced package and integration techniques become increasingly crucial by allowing for the combination of fabricated silicon dies, so-called chiplet, to constitute system-in-package (SiP) achieving a much better yield and time-to-market. However, due to inherent security concerns within the convoluted semiconductor supply chain and in-field environment, hostile attacks targeting software and hardware applications can present a formidable challenge to ensuring the security of SiP. Even worse, the immanent black-box nature of product chiplets renders most conventional security inspection and testing solutions less useful. Therefore, we present our SiPGuard in this article to enable the security monitoring capability during run time to noninvasively track the application-level behaviors of target chiplets and detect any deviations potentially induced by underlying malicious intrusions. The security monitoring mechanism utilizes information-bearing system-level power noise variation and machine learning (ML) techniques. Specifically, we utilize a trusted field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chiplet as our trust anchor to implement the lightweight power sensor and on-chip ML inference engine for near-sensor analysis. We prototype our solution on a 2.5-D chiplet-based FPGA device and demonstrate the effectiveness against threats at software/hardware levels by identifying the consequent power anomalies of malicious activities.</description></item><item><title>TrustGuard: Standalone FPGA-Based Security Monitoring Through Power Side-Channel</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10345508</link><description>The Internet-of-Thing (IoT) era inspires a surge of networked embedded devices in the real world. However, cyber-attacks such as malware intrusions pose severe concerns about the security of the entire IoT space by hijacking the devices, altering the application&#8217;s execution, and/or causing a denial of services. Traditional operating-system-level and built-in hardware detection solutions either induce drastic performance degradation or incur high overhead to the system, failing to provide protection in a timely and affordable fashion. On the other hand, external side-channel-based security monitoring becomes an attractive scheme for addressing the dilemma because the observable physical properties of a running electronic device, such as power consumption and electromagnetic (EM) emanations, can deliver a good amount of information for the underlying operations. In this article, we present TrustGuard, a standalone security monitoring framework integrating both power side-channel capturing and machine learning (ML)-based malware detection capabilities on the same field-programmable gate array (FPGA) fabric. We eliminate the need for dedicated sampling equipment like an oscilloscope with an ON-chip configurable sensor FPGA analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and enable agile prototyping of ML accelerator for attack detection through the high-level synthesis (HLS) technique. We deploy the outcome hardware sensor and security monitor on the Xilinx ZCU104 platform to target the prevalent BeagleBone Black (BBB) board by profiling the behaviors of uncompromised benchmark applications and discovering the anomalies introduced by the attack vectors, including malware infections, code injection, and code reuse. The experimental results demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of TrustGuard by achieving more than 90% malware detection accuracy.</description></item><item><title>IOLock: An Input/Output Locking Scheme for Protection Against Reverse Engineering Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10354011</link><description>Reverse engineering (RE) of hardware designs poses a significant threat to the modern distributed electronics supply chain. RE can be performed at both chip and printed circuit board (PCB) levels by using structural, functional, or combined analysis techniques. Recent studies on artificial intelligence (AI)-inspired RE techniques have seen a drastic increase in the effectiveness of such attacks. While various countermeasures, e.g., logic locking (LL) at the chip level and camouflaging at the board level, have been studies to combat RE, the advent of Boolean satisfiability (SAT)-based functional query at chip level and 3-D imaging attacks at board level has shown that these protections can be easily bypassed. We observe that a common factor that contributes to the success of these attacks at both chip and board levels is the ability of an attacker to observe the input/output (I/O) patterns of a working system. Based on this observation, we present a novel locking scheme called IOLock that can effectively prevent access to golden I/O behavior of a working system. IOLock restricts access to the actual I/Os of the chips in a PCB by introducing a low-overhead key management unit (KMU) that works in conjunction with internal encryption/decryption modules near the I/O ports. The encryption/decryption modules are designed to work with the existing joint test action group (JTAG) infrastructure. IOLock can be used in standalone mode or in conjunction with another LL scheme to enhance the overall security of the design. We evaluate the security guarantees offered by IOLock theoretically, through simulation, and hardware measurements. We show that IOLock provides robust protection against both chip-level and PCB-level RE attacks while incurring minimal design overhead.</description></item><item><title>GateLock: Input-Dependent Key-Based Locked Gates for SAT Resistant Logic Locking</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375951</link><description>Logic locking has become a robust method for reducing the risk of intellectual property (IP) piracy, overbuilding, and hardware Trojan threats throughout the lifespan of integrated circuits (ICs). Nevertheless, the majority of reported logic locking approaches are susceptible to satisfiability (SAT)-based attacks. The existing SAT-resistant logic locking methods provide a tradeoff between security and effectiveness and require a significant design overhead. In this article, a novel gate replacement-based input-dependent key-based logic locking (IDKLL) technique is proposed. We first introduce the concept of IDKLL, and how the IDKLL can mitigate the SAT attacks completely. Unlike conventional logic locking, the IDKLL approach uses multiple key sequences (KSs) (instead of a single KS) as the correct key to lock/unlock the design functionality for all inputs. Based on this IDKLL concept, we developed several locked gates. Further, we propose a lightweight gate replacement-based IDKLL called GateLock that locks the design by replacing exciting gates with their respective IDKLL-based locked gates. The security analysis of the proposed method shows that it prevents the SAT attack completely and forces the attacker to apply a significantly large number of brute-force attempts to decipher the key. The experimental evaluation on International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS) and International Test Conference (ITC) benchmarks shows that the proposed GateLock method completely prevents the SAT-based attacks and requires an average of 56.7%, 72.7%, and 87.8% reduced area, power, and delay compared to cascaded locking (CAS-Lock) and strong Anti-SAT (SAS) approaches.</description></item><item><title>Improving Radiation Reliability of SRAM-Based Physical Unclonable Function With Self-Healing and Pre-Irradiation Masking Techniques</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375959</link><description>Physical unclonable function (PUF) is an innovative primitive used for key generation and device authentication, which has promising applications for resource-limited scenarios such as satellite communication. However, the reliability of traditional PUF circuits is low and the power consumption is high. Maintaining reliability also requires high costs, which limits its practical application. This article proposes a multimode SRAM PUF based on a 55-nm CMOS process, which has a self-healing feature. By using a voltage tilt preselection mechanism, the unstable PUF cells can be detected and most of them can be healed by mode switching, thereby improving the reliability of the PUF and reducing the costs required for golden key screening tests. However, the total ionizing dose (TID) effect poses a threat to the PUF, which can significantly increase the bit error rate (BER). In this article, the radiation effect of the PUF is characterized and its mechanism is analyzed. Besides, by means of the self-healing and preirradiation temperature and voltage masking techniques, the radiation reliability of the proposed PUF can be improved avoiding traditional destructive testing. The experimental results demonstrate that the BER can be reduced to as low as 0.0183%, which is  $345\times $  lower than the raw BER, after irradiation up to 100 krad(Si). The proposed technique presents great potential for communication security in the aerospace environment.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Wideband mmW Transceiver Front End for 5G Base Stations in 22-nm FD-SOI CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10154117</link><description>This article presents a fully integrated millimeter-wave (mmW) transceiver front end covering 24.25&#8211;29.5 GHz. It features a wideband Doherty power amplifier utilizing adaptive bias and a transmit/receive switch (TRX-switch) that has embedded low noise amplifier to antenna matching. The phase shift of 90&#176; to the Doherty auxiliary amplifier is achieved using a separate IQ-mixer with rearranged phases in the auxiliary path, ensuring a wideband 90&#176; phase shift, and avoiding 3-dB loss from radio frequency (RF) input power splitting. Special emphasis is on the analysis of adaptive bias, the Doherty output combiner network, the decoupling capacitors, and the TRX-switch. Including TRX-switch losses of 1.1 dB in transmit mode, the transmitter reaches a saturated output power of 18.3 dBm with a 1-dB output compression point of 15.9 dBm. Stimulated with a 400-MHz 16-QAM orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) IQ-signal at baseband, without digital IQ-compensation and predistortion, the transmitter delivers a 26.5-GHz modulated signal with an output power ( $P_{\mathrm{ out}}$ ) of 12.8 dBm and an error vector magnitude (EVM) of -20.2 dB. The complete transmitter, including quadrature local oscillator drivers, then achieves a power added efficiency (PAE) of 5.8%. For a 1600-MHz wide 64-QAM OFDM signal,  $P_{\mathrm{ out}}$  is 9.0 dBm, with an EVM  $=\,\,-$ 23.3 dB and a complete transmitter PAE of 3.2%. In receive mode including TRX-switch, at 27.25 GHz, the noise figure is below 4 dB with a gain of 23 dB and a third-order input-referred intercept point of -9 dBm. The active part of the die, manufactured in 22-nm fully depleted silicon on insulator (FD-SOI) CMOS, occupies 2.3 mm2.</description></item><item><title>An Interference-Resilient Bit-Level Duty-Cycled ULP Receiver Leveraging a Dual-Chirp Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10178021</link><description>In this article, we present a blocker-tolerant ultralow-power (ULP) receiver (RX) operating at the 430-MHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, which leverages a chirp modulation scheme to achieve high blocker tolerance. The presented RX simultaneously achieves ULP consumption, high RX sensitivity, and enhanced in-band (IB) and out-of-band (OOB) interference tolerance. This is enabled by a unique dual-chirp ON&#8211;OFF-keying (DC-OOK) modulation scheme in conjunction with several architecture and circuit-level techniques, including bit-level duty-cycling and cost-/energy-efficient high- ${Q}$  radiofrequency (RF) amplifiers. As a result, this RX offers high channel selectivity and good immunity to interference without the need for OFF-chip high- ${Q}$  surface acoustic wave (SAW) and BAW filters or high-power active filters. The RX prototype was designed and fabricated in a bulk CMOS 28-nm process and achieves &#8722; 103 dBm sensitivity for bit error rate (BER) &lt; 10 $^{-{3}}$  while rejecting amplitude-modulated blockers as strong as 41 dBc at a 10-MHz frequency offset.

As the available solar panel area limits the power consumption of the receiver, a multi-coupling common-gate (CG) low noise amplifier (LNA) with current-sharing topology and built-in 180&#176; phase shifter is proposed in this work to solve the power issue. The multi-coupling LNA utilizes three coupling inductors to reduce the input matching impedance with a smaller input CMOS transistor size. After implementing the proposed technique, a single beamformer realized a 3.4-mW typical power consumption compared with the conventional works with 17.3&#8211;195-mW power consumption. The receiver with magnetic-tuning phase shifter (MTPS) has 0.06-dB/Mrad gain and 0.4&#176;/Mrad phase degradations and is the lowest reported root-mean-square phase and gain errors due to radiation. The proposed receiver achieves &#8722;22-dBm IIP3 with a 3.8-dB noise figure. The required on-chip area for each element is only 0.2 mm2. In the over-the-air (OTA) measurement, digital video broadcasting-second generation extension (DVB-S2x) standard modulated signals of up to 256 amplitude phase shift keying (APSK) can be supported by the proposed large array modules. This work realizes &#8722;33.2-dB error vector magnitude (EVM) and 12.8-Gb/s link speed with 1.6-GHz channel bandwidth. The measured beam pattern can cover radiated angle from &#8722;50&#176; to +50&#176; with lower than &#8722;10-dBc sidelobe level.

Various techniques from both circuit and system aspects are used to eliminate the input parasitic capacitance of the AE. On-chip parasitic capacitance is compensated by an auto-calibrated positive feedback loop (PFL) without applying any reference signal. A capacitor down-scaling technique combined with SAR-assisted PFL calibration enables femtofarad-level resolution of the capacitor array, alleviating the practical constraints of the conventional PFL to implement a small capacitor below 10 fF. Besides, a dummy input structure ensures that the pad and electrostatic discharge (ESD) capacitances are also canceled by the PFL, while off-chip parasitic capacitance on the printed circuit board (PCB) is nulled by active shielding. Fabricated in a standard 0.18- $\mu \text{m}$  1P6M CMOS process, the AE achieves an ultra-high input impedance of 136  $\text{G}\Omega $  at 60 Hz (average of 10 samples). This is equivalent to an input capacitance of 19.5 fF and corresponds to a  $2.7\times $ &#8211; $68\times $  improvement over the state-of-the-art. The AE exhibits an input signal range of 700 mVpp and an input-referred noise of  $0.72 \mu \text{V}_{\mathrm {rms}}$  (0.5&#8211;100 Hz) while consuming  $10.46 \mu \text{W}$  from a 1.2-V supply.

High-efficiency harmonic oscillator design and optimization method are proposed for the third harmonic generation and extraction. This design is also capable of beam steering by changing the bias voltage to establish different phase gradients across the array. Finally, the fabricated chip can radiate 9.1-dBm power and 30.8-dBm lensless effective isotropic-radiated power (EIRP) at 675 GHz.

The proposed single-ended Doherty (SED) PA topology with switched-capacitor (SC) arrays can generate four power efficiency peaks that significantly improve the power-added efficiency (PAE) at the power amplifier (PA)&#8217;s power back-offs (PBOs). In addition, this work utilizes a three-segment DTC, built with a delay-locked loop (DLL), to improve the phase resolution and enable real-time process-voltage-temperature (PVT) calibration of the DTC. Fabricated in a 28 nm CMOS technology, the DPTX achieves a peak output power ( $P_{\mathrm {out}}$ ) of 27.7 dBm and a peak PAE of 33.4% at a 2.1 GHz carrier frequency. The PAEs at 2.5, 6, and 12 dB PBOs are 31.1%, 24.5%, and 18%, respectively. With the 2.1 GHz carrier, the DTC achieves 360&#176; full output phase range, &#177;1.3&#176; differential nonlinearity (DNL), &#177;1.7&#176; integral nonlinearity (INL), and &#8722;133.86 dBc/Hz phase noise at a frequency offset of 1 MHz, while the power dissipation is only 14 mW. When testing the 10 MHz (and 20 MHz) long term evolution (LTE) 64 QAM signals with a 6.2 (5.0) dB peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), the DPTX achieves an average  $P_{\mathrm {out}}$  of 21.5 (22.7) dBm, an average PAE of 23.5% (24.6%), an average system efficiency (SE) of 22.5% (23.8%),&#8211;30.6 (&#8211;27.7) dB error vector magnitude (EVM), and&#8211;34.2/&#8211;32.6 (&#8211;30.1/&#8211;29.2) dBc adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR).

Single-pole double-throw (SPDT) switch is commonly adopted in conventional FEM for T/R isolation, but its insertion loss (IL) deteriorates TX efficiency greatly. To alleviate this problem, a post-matching (PM) architecture is proposed to eliminate the switch in the TX branch. Specifically, a PM network (PMN) is employed to transform 50- $\Omega $  impedance at the antenna port into the intrinsic optimal load impedance of the power amplifier (PA), while the output capacitance of the PA is absorbed into a  $\lambda $ /4-transmission-line (TL)-based single-pole single-throw (SPST) switch in the receiver (RX) branch. The drain voltage of the PA can also be supplied via the SPST, avoiding the use of an additional choke inductor. The theoretical performance of the T/R switch, including bandwidth, IL, and isolation, is analyzed in depth. A 4.9&#8211;7.1-GHz FEM for Wi-Fi 7 application is implemented in a commercial 0.15- $\mu \text{m}$  gallium nitride (GaN)-high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) process to validate the proposed architecture, and the chip size is only 2  $\times $  1.6 mm. The TX mode realizes a saturated power of 37.1&#8211;38.6 dBm and a saturated power-added efficiency (PAE) of 45%&#8211;52.4%. With MCS9 EHT160 signals, an average PAE of 18.5%&#8211;23.3% at an average power of 28&#8211;29.9 dBm is measured, while the error vector magnitude (EVM) specification of &#8211; 32 dB is met. When digital predistortion (DPD) is applied, MCS13 EHT320 signals are also supported. The RX mode achieves a gain of 9.1&#8211;12.1 dB, a noise figure (NF) of 1.6&#8211;1.9 dB, and an input-referred third-order intercept point (IIP3) of 20.2&#8211;25.4 dBm.</description></item><item><title>Highly Efficient Differential Frequency Doubler With Output Resistance Boosting Feedback</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10172337</link><description>This article presents a differential  $V$ -band frequency doubler and a  $D$ -band frequency quadrupler that use complementary MOS transistors.

Capacitors are added to NMOS transistors to alleviate the intrinsic imbalances between NMOS and PMOS transistors. The frequency quadrupler is composed of cascaded differential doublers. Both frequency multipliers are fabricated in a 40 nm bulk CMOS process.

Conventionally, fractional- $N$  SSPLLs remove the quantization error (Q-error) of the delta&#8211;sigma modulator ( $\Delta \Sigma \text{M}$ ) before the sample-and-hold (SH) circuit using a digital-to-time converter (DTC). As a result, the in-band noise of those SSPLLs is saturated by the jitter of the DTC, and the overall rms jitter is increased. However, the proposed SSPLL cancels the Q-error after the SH using a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). This approach significantly suppresses the jitter of the DAC by the gain of the SH,  $K_{\mathrm {SH}}$ , resulting in a much lower rms jitter. To implement the proposed Q-error cancellation, this work introduces two key techniques: 1) dual-clock-phase sampling (DCP sampling) that maintains a consistently high  $K_{\mathrm {SH}}$  and 2) second-order curve-fitting digital predistortion (SCF-DPD) that enables the DAC to cancel the Q-error more precisely. The proposed fractional- $N$  SSPLL was fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS technology, and the total power consumption was 7.3 mW when a 14-GHz  $f_{\mathrm {OUT}}$  was generated using a reference frequency of 100 MHz. The measured rms jitter and the level of fractional spurs were 104 fs and &#8722;58 dBc, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A 0.39-mm2 Stacked Standard-CMOS Humidity Sensor Using a Charge-Redistribution Correlated Level Shifting Floating Inverter Amplifier and a VCO-Based Zoom CDC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10241982</link><description>This article reports an energy/area-efficient zoom capacitance-to-digital converter (CDC)-based CMOS humidity sensor. It achieves the best-in-class error of &#177;0.8%RH and better figure of merit (FoMw; 87 fJ/c.step) than the state-of-the-art humidity sensors due to the use of the two techniques described in the following: 1) a charge-redistribution correlated level-shifting (CR-CLS) floating inverter amplifier (FIA) is proposed to increase the conventional CLS-FIA open-loop gain by at least 13.5 dB across temperature variations (&#8722;40 &#176;C to 85 &#176;C) and the extreme process corners, minimizing the closed-loop FIA gain error and thus the CDC nonlinearity and humidity error and 2) a pair of stacked humidity sensors over the circuits, all of which are included in the standard CMOS process, is proposed to achieve a lower cost and decrease the area by half. The proposed CMOS humidity sensor is implemented in a 55-nm CMOS process. The measurement results show that the capacitance resolution and humidity resolution are 197 aF and 0.094%RH, respectively, at a total input capacitance of 3 pF, and the effective number of bits (ENOB) is 12.1 at a clock frequency of 2.5 MHz and a cycle number per conversion (N) of 16. The proposed humidity sensor consumes  $9.57 \mu \text{W}$  at the conversion time of 0.04 ms.

Specifically, after the first injection, a calibration module refines the auxiliary oscillator&#8217;s frequency toward the crystal&#8217;s resonant frequency in a binary-search fashion with a sub-500-ppm error for the second injection. This calibration method eliminates the closed-loop phase-locked loop (PLL) and shortens the calibration period into 48 clock cycles. Prototyped in a 65-nm CMOS process, the XO occupies an active area of 0.134 mm2. The 13.56-MHz XO can achieve a startup time ( $t_s)$  of  $45.8 \mu $ s with a  $V_{\mathrm {DD}}$  of 0.7 V, while consuming 5.0 nJ of energy.  $t_s$  varies by &#177;2.2% amid temperature variations (&#8722;40 &#176;C to 85 &#176;C). Its steady-state power consumption is  $28.4 \mu $ W, with an output phase noise of &#8722;143.7 dBc/Hz at 1-kHz offset (FoM: 241.8 dBc/Hz), manifesting its state-of-the-art performance.</description></item><item><title>A Pitch-Matched High-Frame-Rate Ultrasound Imaging ASIC for Catheter-Based 3-D Probes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10214188</link><description>This article presents an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for catheter-based 3-D ultrasound imaging probes. The pitch-matched design implements a comprehensive architecture with high-voltage (HV) transmitters, analog front ends, hybrid beamforming analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), and data transmission to the imaging system. To reduce the number of cables in the catheter while maintaining a small footprint per element, transmission (TX) beamforming is realized on the chip with a combination of a shift register (SR) and a row/column (R/C) approach. To explore an additional cable-count reduction in the receiver part of the design, a channel with a combination of time-division multiplexing (TDM), subarray beamforming, and multi-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) data transmission is also included. This achieves an 18-fold cable-count reduction and minimizes the power consumption in the catheter by a load modulation (LM) cable driver. It is further explored how common-mode interference can limit beamforming gain and a strategy to reduce its impact with local regulators is discussed. The chip was fabricated in TSMC 0.18- $\mu \text{m}$  HV BCD technology and a 2-D PZT transducer matrix of 16  $\times $  18 elements with a pitch of 160  $\mu \text{m}$  and a center frequency of 6 MHz was manufactured on the chip. The system can generate all required TX patterns at up to 30 V, provides quick settling after the TX phase, and has an reception (RX) power consumption of only 1.12 mW/element. The functionality and operation of up to 1000 volumes/s have been demonstrated in electrical and acoustic imaging experiments.</description></item><item><title>A 46.6 &#956;g/&#8730;Hz Single-Chip Accelerometer Exploiting a DTC-Assisted Chopper Amplifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10148056</link><description>This article presents a single-chip accelerometer with the best reported thermal noise and the lowest bias instability among state-of-the-art accelerometers with high- $g$  ( $&gt;$ 1000  $g$ ) sensing capability. Complete single-chip integration of microelectromechanical transducers, readout circuits, and environmental sensors is achieved by leveraging a CMOS-microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) approach. Simple equations are derived to estimate the gain degradation issue due to delay mismatch in chopper amplifiers. A coarse digital-to-time converter (CDTC) assisted chopper amplifier is introduced to suppress the gain degradation nonideality and potentially improve the energy efficiency. Measurements and simulations validate the accuracy of the predictions and efficacy of the CDTC-based signal-boosting technique. A fine digital-to-time converter (FDTC) assisted demodulation clock skew compensation technique is employed to further suppress the residual flicker noise in chopper amplifiers. Measurement results validate the preliminary investigation of the clock skew-induced residual flicker noise and prove the benefit of FDTC-assisted flicker noise reduction. Both low- $g$  and high- $g$  performance are characterized. Fabricated in a standard 180 nm CMOS process followed by post-CMOS processing, the accelerometer achieves 46.6  $\mu g/\surd $ Hz thermal noise, 472  $\mu g$  bias instability, and  $&gt;$ 1000  $g$  full-scale (FS).</description></item><item><title>A 15.4-ENOB, Fourth-Order Truncation-Error-Shaping NS-SAR-Nested &#916;&#931; Modulator With Boosted Input Impedance and Range for Biosignal Acquisition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10221702</link><description>This article presents a discrete-time  $\Delta \Sigma $  modulator (DSM) with a wide linear input range and high input impedance for biomedical signal acquisition. The proposed integrated circuit (IC) is based on a 1st-order DSM with 2nd-order noise-shaping (NS)-successive approximation (SAR) for high resolution with high power efficiency, directly converting the small input signal to digital. The first-stage integrator in the DSM is designed to support not only for wide-input swing at low power consumption but also for high input impedance. The input impedance is further boosted by a proposed presampling-based charge-transfer-reduction technique, which does not require any additional amplifiers. It precharges the sampling capacitor with just the previous sampled signal, thus reducing the charge transfer and boosting the input impedance. Besides, we also propose a new truncation-error shaping method. By feeding the truncation error back to the local NS-SAR loop, the truncation error is effectively noise-shaped without using any additional loop, resulting in 4th-order NS. The prototype IC is fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process. It achieves 94.5-dB signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) for 1&#8211;500-Hz bandwidth with 600-mVPP input applied, resulting in FoMSNDR of 174.3 dB and FoMDR of 175.8 dB. It achieves over 83-dB common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) and input impedance of 208  $\text{M}\Omega $  at dc and 31.5  $\text{M}\Omega $  at the target bandwidth. Moreover, its artifact tolerance is verified by in vitro and in vivo measurements.</description></item><item><title>Sub-&#956;W Auto-Calibration Bandgap Voltage Reference With 1&#963; Inaccuracy of &#177; 0.12% Within &#8722; 40&#176;C to 120&#176;C</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10195934</link><description>This article presents an auto-calibration technique for current-based bandgap voltage references (BGRs), based on a digitally-assisted auto-calibration loop for calibration cost reduction. We first present a theoretical study of the process variation induced  $V_{\mathrm{EB}}$  and  $\Delta V_{\text {EB}}$  variations in the BJT, which contribute to residual errors in the reference voltage ( $V_{\mathrm{REF}}$ ) and its temperature coefficient (TC) after applying conventional one-point trimming. Based on the study, we further propose an automatic one-point trimming methodology using a current digital-to-analog converter (IDAC), which can simultaneously relax the  $A{V}$ EBand  $\Delta V_{\mathrm{EB}}$  variations, resulting in a small drift in both  $V_{\mathrm{REF}}$  and its TC after calibration. Fabricated in 65 nm standard CMOS, the proposed auto-calibrated BGR achieves a measured TC of 22.3 ppm/&#176;C at 1.2 V supply within &#8722;40 &#176;C to 120 &#176;C. The line regulation is 1.26 mV/V or 0.13%/V from 1.2 to 2.5 V. Based on ten-chip measurement results, the achieved  $\sigma /\mu $  variation in  $V_{\mathrm{REF}}$  improves from &#177;0.53% to &#177;0.12% within the entire temperature spectrum after applying the proposed auto-calibration technique at 27 &#176;C.</description></item><item><title>A Dual-Inductor Ladder Buck Converter for Li-Ion Battery-Operated Sub-Volt SoCs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268424</link><description>This article presents a dual-inductor ladder (DIL) hybrid buck converter to support system-on-chip (SoC)-compatible subvolt ( $\le $ 1 V) supply rails directly from a single-cell Li-ion battery (2.5&#8211;5 V). Facilitating an extreme downconversion (16.67 $\times $ ) using scaled CMOS technology, the proposed topology presents a unique solution to address the active versus passive component utilization while still neutralizing the well-known efficiency versus power density (PD) trade-off for a hybrid converter. The balanced inductor currents help reduce the average switch currents, improving active switch utilization, while the natural soft-charging of the flying capacitors reduces the switch rms currents, improving passive component utilization and PD. The DIL, thus, presents an optimal two-inductor solution for similar applications achieving excellent efficiency and PD. Fabricated in a 65 nm bulk CMOS technology, the DIL obtains 90.6% peak efficiency, 0.93 W/mm2 peak active PD (PPD) with a maximum power delivery of 1.35 W occupying just 1.13 mm2 die area.</description></item><item><title>A Quad-Mode Structure-Reconfigurable Regulating Rectifier With Shared-Inductor DC&#8211;DC Energy Recycling in a Wireless Power Receiver</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10210584</link><description>A quad-mode structure-reconfigurable regulating rectifier (SR-RR) is presented for a wireless power transfer system. The proposed SR-RR combines an ac&#8211;dc regulating rectifier and a dc&#8211;dc boost converter in a single stage. The regulating rectifier converts the received wireless power to an output load and stores the excess power in a storage element to improve the power conversion efficiency. By allowing the regulating rectifier and the boost converter to share a receiver (RX) coil with adjustments to the power stage structure, the SR-RR operates as a dc&#8211;dc boost converter to extend the output power without requiring additional inductors. Freewheeling operation skips power to realize single-stage voltage regulation. In addition, the SR-RR operation mode is automatically selected from among four: charging, storing, boost converting, and freewheeling. The chip, fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu \text{m}$  CMOS process, can regulate an output voltage of 5 V and a stored voltage of 3.7 V. The measurement results demonstrate a 1.7 $\times $  output power extension. Peak RX efficiency reaches 91.8%, while system efficiency reaches 64.7%.</description></item><item><title>Design and Implementation of a Hybrid, ADC/DAC-Free, Input-Sparsity-Aware, Precision Reconfigurable RRAM Processing-in-Memory Chip</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10226332</link><description>In this work, we design and implement a 1-Mb resistive random access memory (RRAM) processing-in-memory (PIM) chip based on a 180-nm CMOS technology. In this design, a time-division multiplexing (TDM) circuit along with sparsity-aware sense amplifier (SA) and asynchronous counter module (ACM) are proposed to free the chip from digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and analog-to-digital converter (ADC). A sparsity-aware input module (SAIM) is designed to improve computational efficiency for bit-level input sparsity detection. A technique based on quantization-aware training (QAT), dynamically reconfigurable shifters (RecSTRs), and tree adders (TAs) is used to achieve system reconfigurability for 1&#8211;8-bit input, 1&#8211;8-bit weight, and 6&#8211;22-bit output. With this technique, optimized quantization to 4-bit weight 4-bit activation (W4A4) can reduce the number of network parameters to 1/8 of that required for the 32-bit floating-point (FP32) version.

TICA can perceive the dynamic PVT variations of a circuit with in situ cycle borrowing detectors, then infer its runtime timing slack, and adjust the clock frequency accordingly to minimize the redundant timing margin timely. Therefore, with TICA, a circuit can maintain a small amount of positive timing slack, free from the costly timing error correction process required in conventional in situ timing error detection and correction (EDAC)-based circuits. For error-tolerant applications, TICA can also keep the circuit&#8217;s timing slack at a small negative level for further energy efficiency and throughput improvements. Moreover, an inference-accuracy-driven in situ cycle borrowing detector insertion method is presented, which greatly reduces the insertion rate and the associated timing error detection overheads by leveraging the monotonic relationship between the timing slack and the number of cycle borrowing events. We implement TICA in a near-threshold-voltage (NTV) bitcoin mining core featuring a 64-stage deeply pipelined SHA256 engine in a 28-nm process, with only 0.59% in situ detector insertion rate and 1.4% area overhead. Silicon measurements show  $4.2\times $  throughput improvements or 19.3% energy savings without any timing error compared to the baseline margined for a 10%  $V_{\mathrm {DD}}$  drop, as well as additional 35.7% throughput gains or 10.6% energy savings at 0.3 V when maintaining the error rate of SHA256 computing results at 1%.</description></item><item><title>A Metastability Risk Prediction and Mitigation Technique for Clock-Domain Crossing With Single-Stage Synchronizer in Near-Threshold-Voltage Multivoltage/ Frequency-Domain Network-on-Chip</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10159987</link><description>For a network-on-chip (NoC) with multiple voltage/frequency domains, metastability hurts the reliability during the clock-domain crossing, especially in the near-threshold-voltage (NTV) region. Conventional multistage synchronizers reduce the probability of metastability but have a high latency penalty. This article presents a technique titled metastability risk prediction and mitigation (MPAM) that predicts the near-future metastability risks by a triple-phase clock monitoring circuitry and mitigates them by a metastability-free clock scheme. Therefore, the MPAM enables only one flip-flop for data synchronization without degrading the reliability against metastability, thus improving the latency and throughput of NoC. We prototyped a 2-by-2 NoC test chip with four independent voltage/frequency domains in a 40-nm low-power (LP) process, featuring the MPAM technique. The measurement shows that the MPAM significantly reduces the metastability condition rate by  $10^{10}$  times under different clock frequency ratios. Moreover, by enabling only one flip-flop for synchronization, the MPAM-based NoC achieves packet latency reduction, throughput improvement, and energy efficiency gain by 58%, 13.4%, and 8.6%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A 0.05-mm2 2.91-nJ/Decision Keyword-Spotting (KWS) Chip Featuring an Always-Retention 5T-SRAM in 28-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10183650</link><description>This article reports a keyword-spotting (KWS) chip for voice-controlled devices.

The hybrid wide-deep architecture absorbs their strengths with a powerful parallel processing capability while enhancing the memory capacity of reservoirs. However, the fully analog RC circuit combining the two structures has yet to be proposed, mainly due to unmanageable hierarchical signal processing. Here we report a full-analog memristive RC circuit with a hybrid wide-deep architecture comprising an input module, mask module, reservoir module, and readout module. The input module can generate continuous voltages with temporal sequences. The mask module provides parallel mask processes, laying the foundation for implementing a wide RC structure. The reservoir module includes dynamic memristors and postprocessing circuits. Dynamic memristors can produce high-dimensional reservoir states, and postprocessing circuits allow memristive reservoir circuits to be cascaded to achieve a deep RC structure. The readout module mainly consists of a nonvolatile memristor crossbar and an analog integrator, enabling an efficient multiplication-and-accumulation operation. The simulation results in LTspice illustrate that the memory capacity of the proposed circuit is 91.6% higher than that of wide RC. Moreover, it can efficiently perform temporal tasks, obtaining a high accuracy of 98.99% in arrhythmia detection.</description></item><item><title>A Compact Sub-nW/kHz Relaxation Oscillator Using a Negative-Offset Comparator With Chopping and Piecewise Charge-Acceleration in 28-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10303730</link><description>This work presents a compact and power-efficient kHz-range relaxation (RC) oscillator with robust performance against temperature and voltage variations.

The LC network resonates at twice of the working RF frequency, shaping the drain-source and gate-source voltages of the rectifying transistors of the CC rectifier. As a result, the proposed scheme reduces the transistors&#8217; reverse current and the shoot-through current, and thus the root mean square current of the switches, improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE). Meanwhile, it has a better input impedance matching over a wide input power range from the voltage reshaping. Subsequently, we implement the CCLC topology in both one-stage and two-stage CC rectifiers. To reduce the silicon area, we design coupled inductors for the two LC networks of the two-stage CCLC rectifier. We fabricated the rectifiers using a 65-nm CMOS process.

Simultaneously, traditional silicon-based von Neumann architectures exhibit significant latency and power consumption issues in data-centric applications, such as the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence. To tackle these challenges, this study introduces a novel approach: Magnetoresistance Random Access Memory (MRAM) computing in-memory (CIM) using gate-all-around carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (GAA-CNTFET). The proposed MRAM array comprised three transistors and one perpendicular magnetic anisotropy spin-orbit torque magnetic tunnel junction (p-SOT-MTJ) (3T1M) cell and achieves full-array Boolean logic operations and half/full-adder operations.

A 16 Kb MRAM was simulated in both GAA-CNTFET/p-SOT-MTJ and 14-nm FinFET/p-SOT-MTJ technologies to examine the effectiveness of the proposed design. Compared to its 14-nm FinFET/p-SOT-MTJ counterparts, the write and computing latencies of the GAA-CNTFET/p-SOT-MTJ CIM macro were reduced by approximately 21% and 20.6%, respectively, while the read and computing energy consumption by approximately 45.3% and 24.7%, respectively. Moreover, the proposed in-memory Boolean logic throughput was 8192 GOPS, which was approximately 160&#8211;250 times higher than that of existing CIM solutions, in which only two rows of word lines can be activated.</description></item><item><title>TFT-Based Near-Sensor In-Memory Computing: Circuits and Architecture Perspectives of Large-Area eDRAM and ROM CiM Chips</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10365653</link><description>In the era of intelligent IoT, huge amount of sensor data is collected and then transmitted to processor elements in edge devices or cloud servers. The latency and energy consumption in this process have been a bottleneck and are becoming more severe. To mitigate this problem, the idea of combining sensors, memory and processors for collectively handling the data, has been proposed and explored actively in recent efforts. In this work, thin-film transistor (TFT), which has been widely adopted in display devices and flexible sensors, is exploited. It is shown that, while TFT is promising for large-area sensing, it also shows a great potential for computing and storing data for large-area and low-cost edge sensors. More specifically, we have fabricated and measured two large-area TFT-based near-sensor computing-in-memory (CiM) chips adopting embedded DRAM (eDRAM) and ROM structure respectively. We further give a detailed analysis of the integration of CiM arrays and sensor arrays to realize a sensing and data pre-process system.

However, the emerging memory technologies such as RRAMs, PCMs, STT-MRAMs, etc. are still immature and exhibit significant spatial and temporal variations limiting the yield and the size of crossbar arrays available for implementing logic functions. Considering the technological maturity, ultra-high density and ultra-low cost of 3D NAND flash memory, in this work, we have proposed a novel methodology to exploit 3D NAND flash memory for realizing any logic function in sum-of-product form (SOP) with &#8804;177 literals/inputs and  $\le 2^{14}$  minterms parallelly.

This challenge leads many accelerators to opt for simpler and shallow models like FSRCNN, compromising performance for real-time needs, especially for resource-limited edge devices. This paper proposes an energy-efficient SR accelerator, ACNPU, to tackle this challenge. The ACNPU enhances image quality by 0.34dB with a 27-layer model, but needs 36% less complexity than FSRCNN, while maintaining a similar model size, with the decoupled asymmetric convolution and split-bypass structure. The hardware-friendly 17K-parameter model enables holistic model fusion instead of localized layer fusion to remove external DRAM access of intermediate feature maps. The on-chip memory bandwidth is further reduced with the input stationary flow and parallel-layer execution to reduce power consumption. Hardware is regular and easy to control to support different layers by processing elements (PEs) clusters with reconfigurable input and uniform data flow. The implementation in the 40 nm CMOS process consumes 2333 K gate counts and 198&#194; KB SRAMs. The ACNPU achieves 31.7 FPS and 124.4 FPS for  $\times 2$  and  $\times 4$  scales Full-HD generation, respectively, which attains 4.75 TOPS/W energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Hardware Accelerator of Fractional-Order Operator Based on Phase Optimized Filters With Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375250</link><description>Hardware accelerators outperform CPUs in terms of performance by parallelizing the algorithm architecture and using the device&#8217;s programmable resources.

The introduction of the residual block (RB) raises the depth of the algorithm to perform better reconstruction. The processing of the RB leads to a decrease in hardware utilization and frequent off-chip communications. It is hard to apply such algorithms on edge devices with limited performance. Computing-in-memory (CiM) is one promising method to reduce high power caused by massive data movement in multiply-accumulation computation. The algebraic sparsity (AS) is the structured sparsity (SS) optimization for imaging computing. However, it is an unsolved problem to simultaneously realize the texture sparsity (TS) of the image and the SS of the algorithm in the CiM scheme while maintaining high hardware utilization. Thus, we propose a CiM-based SR task accelerator. There are three key contributions: first, a texture-aware workflow and a dynamic grouping CiM engine can concurrently support TS coupling with AS. Second, a macro-level pipeline scheme together with two custom-sized CiM macros and a high reuse-rate Hadamard transformation circuit reaches 91% hardware utilization. Third, a novel weight update strategy is devised to reduce the performance loss induced by the weight updating. The accelerator prototype is fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS. It scores a 22.8-44.3-TOPS/W peak energy efficiency at the voltage supply of 0.54-1.1 V and the operating frequency of 50-200 MHz, indicating 1.8-6.8x higher compared to the state-of-the-art CiM processors.</description></item><item><title>Probabilistic Compute-in-Memory Design for Efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo Sampling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10347275</link><description>Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a widely used sampling method in modern artificial intelligence and probabilistic computing systems. It involves repetitive random number generations and thus often dominates the latency of probabilistic model computing. Hence, we propose a compute-in-memory (CIM) based MCMC design as a hardware acceleration solution. This work investigates SRAM bitcell stochasticity and proposes a novel &#8220;pseudo-read&#8221; operation, based on which we offer a block-wise random number generation circuit scheme for fast random number generation. Moreover, this work proposes a novel multi-stage exclusive-OR gate (MSXOR) design method to generate strictly uniformly distributed random numbers. The probability error deviating from a uniform distribution is suppressed under  $10^{-6}$ . Also, this work presents a novel in-memory copy circuit scheme to realize data copy inside a CIM sub-array, significantly reducing the use of R/W circuits for power saving. Evaluated in a commercial 28-nm process development kit, this CIM-based MCMC design generates 4-bit $\sim $ 32-bit samples with an energy efficiency of 0.53 pJ/sample and high throughput of up to 1066.7M samples/s.

The proposed architecture is constructed with a bitonic sorter and several cascaded bidirectional insertion sorting units. The bidirectional insertion sorting unit uses the segmented sorted subsequence generated by the bitonic sorter as input, and records the maximum and minimum values of the subsequence. After all segmented subsequences are processed through the cascaded bidirectional insertion sorting units, a sorted sequence is obtained. The proposed architecture is implemented using the Verilog hardware description language (HDL) and synthesized using the Synopsys Design Compiler with a TSMC 90-nm cell library. The experimental results indicate that the proposed architecture can not only shorten sorting cycles but also reduce hardware area costs. Moreover, sorting cycles can be further shortened by increasing the parallelism of the proposed architecture. Under the configuration that 2048 32-bit data to be sorted and 16 data have to be processed simultaneously, the proposed architecture can improve the throughput-to-gate-count ratio by 16%, and throughput-to-power-consumption-ratio by 25% compared to the existing sorting design.

In ITS, vehicles, infrastructures, and data networks communicate using vehicle-to-everything (V2X) protocols. In V2X message broadcasting, the ECDSA guarantees data security and privacy. During traffic congestion, the signature generation/verification latency becomes crucial. Hence, this paper proposes a high-throughput and efficient ECDSA architecture for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) applications. We investigate the double point multiplication (DPM) method for reducing computational overhead and propose a new finite field multiplier architecture for latency improvement. Our implementation results over  $p_{256}$  on Virtex-7 field programmable gate array (FPGA) show that our design&#8217;s throughput and efficiency are improved compared to previous works by at least  $4.9\times $  and  $7.2\times $ , respectively.

Predicting time sequences is a pervasive and challenging problem that may require identifying the dependencies between sequences that RNN is capable of performing. Despite all its features, conventional RNN still faces challenges such as limited accuracy and a large number of parameters. Therefore, we propose new macromodeling methods for nonlinear circuits called the Clockwork-RNN (CWRNN) and its hybrid version which is a more powerful but simpler implementation of a conventional RNN architecture with relatively little model complexity. In addition, CWRNN inherently models complex dependencies without the need for a large number of parameters. As a result, the computational cost is less than conventional RNN. Moreover, understanding and implementing the CWRNN is relatively simple and provides great flexibility in architectural configuration by introducing modules with several clock rates of exponents of 2. In addition to the above new modeling technique, we proposed the Hybrid-Module CWRNN as another new modeling method that utilizes modules of various exponents of different numbers resulting in further accuracy improvement of the CWRNN. Furthermore, the models obtained from the proposed techniques required much smaller simulation times compared to the current models used in simulation tools. Three nonlinear high-frequency examples have been utilized to verify the benefits of the proposed modeling methods.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Composite Nonlinear Output Feedback Control of ICPT System: When Markov Jumping Systems Meet Event-Triggering Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10295432</link><description>This paper investigates the  ${H_{\infty }}$  dynamic composite nonlinear output feedback control of the inductive coupled power transfer (ICPT) system with load resistance variation, coil structural perturbation, and energy-bounded external disturbance under event-triggering mechanism.

Based on the interesting observation that the power gain is not sensitive to the loss in the 90&#176; transmission line which is used to provide dc path for the source terminal of a transistor to ground, a thorough theoretical gain-plane analysis is carried out. It is found that utilization of a lossy series embedding network with linear, lossless and reciprocal embedding networks can effectively boost the Mason&#8217;s  $U$  and maximum available gain ( $G_{ma}$ ) in single-ended amplifiers and a novel  $U$ -boosting factor is introduced to determine the condition whether  $U$  of an active device can be boosted.

ESS operators can reap benefits from energy arbitrage by optimizing operations of storage equipment. To further enhance ESS flexibility within the energy market and improve renewable energy utilization, a heterogeneous photovoltaic-ESS (PV-ESS) is proposed, which leverages the unique characteristics of battery energy storage (BES) and hydrogen energy storage (HES). For scheduling tasks of the heterogeneous PV-ESS, a practical cost function plays a crucial role in guiding operator&#8217;s strategies to maximize benefits. We develop a comprehensive cost function that takes into account degradation, capital, and operation/maintenance costs to reflect real-world scenarios. Moreover, while numerous methods excel in optimizing ESS energy arbitrage, they often rely on black-box models with opaque decision-making processes, limiting practical applicability. To overcome this limitation and enable explainable scheduling strategies, a prototype-based policy network with inherent interpretability is introduced. This network employs human-designed prototypes to guide decision-making by comparing similarities between prototypical situations and encountered situations, which allows for naturally explained scheduling strategies. Comparative results across four distinct cases demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our proposed pre-hoc interpretable optimization method when contrasted with black-box models.</description></item><item><title>Physics-Guided Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robust Active Voltage Control in Electrical Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10360326</link><description>Although several multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithms have been employed in power distribution networks configured with high penetration level of Photovoltaic (PV) generators for active voltage control (AVC), the impact of the voltage fluctuation of a single PV node on voltage violations of other PV nodes in the network is ignored. Consequently, it leads to the conservativeness of the existing MADRL based AVC algorithms. In this paper, a robust MADRL control algorithm is designed to minimize the nodal voltage violation and line loss with the exploration of coupling voltage fluctuations across all the controlled nodes by coordinating PV inverters, and a physics factor is utilized to guide (physics-guided) the training policy with the expectation of a better performance compared to existing purely data-driven methods. In the proposed physics-guided multi-agent adversarial twin delayed deep deterministic (PG-MA2TD3) policy gradient algorithm, a physics factor, global sensitivity of voltage (GSV), is properly embedded in the algorithm to measure the influence of the nodal voltage fluctuation on voltage violations on the other controlled nodes with PV inverters and this GSV is shared in the learning center to guide the centralized learning and decentralized execution process. The multi-agent adversarial learning (MAAL) embedded with the GSV to seek an adaptive descend gradient for reducing the Q-value function appropriately rather than always assuming the worst case. Therefore, this physics-guided method can reduce the conservation and provide significantly better reward. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared with several other methods on IEEE 33-bus, 141-bus and 322-bus with three-year data in Portuguese and the results indicate the proposed method can obtain the minimal voltage fluctuation and the best reward in the comparisons.</description></item><item><title>Self-Contained Dual-Input Interferometric Receiver for Paralleled-Multichannel Wireless Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10347286</link><description>In this paper, a self-contained dual-input receiver architecture based on the interferometric technique is proposed and demonstrated for the first time for paralleled-multichannel wireless systems.

Recent studies using phase-variable (PV) synchronized switch technologies have also shown potential in broadband PEH, thereby improving off-resonance energy harvesting. However, the electrically induced dynamics by existing interface circuits lack a comprehensive definition and demonstration, hampering the performance comparisons across different circuits. Regarding these gaps, this paper presents an impedance-based analysis and comparison of electromechanical joint dynamics in PEH systems employing various interface circuits. The focus is on their contributions to enhancing harvesting bandwidth. By introducing resonance tunability into the conventional ideal PEH model, this paper proposes a more generic impedance model. It reveals that the achievable dynamic ranges of practical interface circuits are subsets of the ideal arbitrarily tunable scenario. A detailed quantitative study on the attainable ranges of the PV synchronized switch circuit solutions is provided after the introduction of the ideal target. Simulation and experimental data from different interface circuits align well with theoretical findings. The paper concludes that resonance tunability hinges on the extent of the achievable reactive (imaginary) part of the equivalent impedance. Electromechanical coupling conditions and dielectric loss may further impact resonance tunability. The general ideal model and quantitative impedance analysis provided in this paper help guide the future design effort toward high-capability and broadband PEH systems.</description></item><item><title>A 6.78-MHz Coupling Coefficient Sensorless Wireless Power Transfer System Charging Multiple Receivers With Efficiency Maximization by Adaptive Magnetic Field Distributor IC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10375821</link><description>Targeting the simultaneous wireless charging of multiple receiver (RX) coils, we developed a coupling coefficient ( ${k}$ ) sensorless wireless power transfer (WPT) system enabled by the proposed adaptive magnetic field distributor (AMFD) IC.

The IFC technique stabilizes the OTA in two steps. First, it pushes the first non-dominant pole of the OTA to higher frequencies using an isolated Miller capacitor. Second, it employs a local feed-forward path to create a zero and nullify the first non-dominant pole through pole-zero cancellation. This allows the compensated OTA to reach higher GBW for a given bias current compared to conventional frequency-compensation methods.

The first two stages use transformer feedback to provide low-frequency gain, and the Darlington structure is employed in the third stage to compensate for high-frequency gain. The additional transmission poles introduced by the transformer feedback increase the freedom of gain tuning with little effect on low-frequency gain, therefore facilitating the design of broadband LNAs. To verify the feasibility of bandwidth expansion of these two structures, the proposed LNA is designed and fabricated in a 0.15- $\mu \text{m}$  GaAs pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistor (pHEMT) technology.

For improving energy efficiency without relying on a low supply voltage, we propose a self-synchronized power gating technique to completely shut down almost all the analog building blocks except near the clock toggling moment. We further relax the system startup energy and size by introducing the ratiometric threshold-referenced technique and deadlock avoidance circuit to quickly pre-bias the internal RC network without using extra on-chip references. The proposed RO is designed and fabricated in standard 0.18- $\mu \text{m}$  CMOS, with four distinct implementations at 1kHz, 10kHz, 100kHz, and 1MHz.

This reduces the PLL acquisition speed. It also increases PLL energy consumption and degrades phase noise. In this brief, a completely symmetrical PFD without needing a reset cycle using latch input logic, logic mode, and quasi-dynamic (extra logic) transistors with no blind and dead zone is proposed. The proposed circuit is post-layout simulated at the circuit level in standard CMOS 180nm technology for [2MHz-5GHz]. The proposed PFD detects the linear phase difference between two inputs either in the range [ $- 2\pi $ , $2\pi $ ] or [ $-\pi $ , $\pi $ ] which mitigates the problem of missing clock edge and leads to faster PLL locking time. The proposed PFD consumes  $38~\mu \text{W}$  power at 5GHz frequency. Performing PFD in Process, Voltage, and Temperature (PVT) confirms the accuracy of PFD operation. Based on the detailed investigation of impactful paths and transistors on the phase noise, a new analytical approach is developed. The analytical and simulated phase noise values are equal to &#8722;165dBc/Hz and &#8722;167dBc/Hz at 1MHz respectively which confirms the developed model&#8217;s accuracy. Also, with the PFD test in the final block of PLL, a lock time of 150ns has been reached.

The resonant frequencies of the modes TE102 and TE103 (i.e.,  $f_{102}$  and  $f_{103}$ ) of its non-perturbed groove gap waveguide cavity resonator&#8212;as example TE resonant modes being contained within the extracted stopband range of the mushroom-type EBG cells&#8212;are firstly analyzed. By perturbing the referred cavity with a pin-loaded patch, a second-order BPF block with an adjustable transmission zero (TZ) is implemented. Moreover, by adding a source-load coupling structure among its inverted microstrip feeding sections, one more close-to-passband TZ is created. Next, in order to further increase the filter order and the number of stopband TZs, a stub-loaded microstrip ring resonator is introduced. In this way, by exploiting the perturbed- groove-gap-waveguide-cavity-resonator-based second-order BPF block along with the microstrip ring resonator, a three-pole BPF response is achieved. Furthermore, owing to the multiple signal paths being created in this mixed-technology filter, two additional close-to-passband TZs are produced. Consequently, an overall sharp-rejection third-order BPF with four TZs is realized. The RF operational foundations of the devised mixed-technology BPF are detailed.

It can boost the low and unstable voltage of the solar cells to a large and controllable ac voltage, as required by many standalone consumers or by the electrical grid. It features a high energy processing efficiency as all its switches are submitted to a voltage stress equal to the low input voltage. No output bridge whose transistors would be submitted to the high load voltage is required. A structure with a common ground between the energy cell and the load is created.

The first approach is proportional-integral passivity-based control theory (PI-PBC), and the second control approach is based on inverse optimal control theory plus integral gain (IOC+I). PI-PBC theory is a well-known control design methodology for dealing with state variable regulation in dynamical systems that exhibit a port-Hamiltonian structure, with the main characteristic that a PI controller is designed by preserving the Hamiltonian properties in a closed loop while ensuring asymptotic stability. IOC+I allows for the design of feedback nonlinear controllers for dynamical systems, which in turn allows selecting the candidate Lyapunov function and the control matrix to obtain multiple nonlinear feedback controllers, with the main advantage that all of them ensure asymptotic stability, as the resulting control laws are optimal. This brief demonstrates that a PI-PBC design and IOC+I generate the same feedback control law if and only the candidate Lyapunov function of the IOC+I design is selected as the Hamiltonian function used in the PI-PBC design. The well-known three-phase front-end converter was selected as the test control system to demonstrate the equivalence between the control laws obtained with the PI-PBC and the IOC+I approaches.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Design of a Robust Sensorless PCM Controlled Flyback Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10217177</link><description>This brief presents a new analysis and design technique of a robust sensorless peak current-mode controlled flyback converter (PCMC-FC).

Firstly, the prescribed performance control methodology is employed to ensure desirable transient and steady-state performance of the tracking error. Then, novel integral sliding mode control techniques are utilized to achieve finite-time exact tracking while ensuring boundedness of all closed-loop signals. This approach outperforms existing relevant works that can only guarantee practical finite-time stability or asymptotic tracking. The main theoretical challenge lies in how to guarantee the occurrence of sliding motion within a finite time under the coexistence of unknown nonlinearities and bounded uncertainties. To tackle this challenge, a class of skillful time-varying functions is derived from the derivative of the novel Lyapunov-like energy functions.

However, existing technologies still pose a significant overhead for resiliency or have limitations at near-threshold voltages. This brief presents a low-cost and wide-range timing management scheme FLC-EDC based on resampling. A novel 8-transistor timing detector (8T-TD) with a fast response time of 12.35ps (only 30.3% of 24T DFF&#8217;s) at TT, 0.9V, 25&#176;C is proposed, which operates stably across a wide voltage range from 0.29V to 1.1V. Besides, the detection range is extended to a multi-timing detector (multi-TD) with the proposed timing collector, which significantly reduces the power and latency while reducing circuit stages. A compact error correction circuit based on a new mechanism is proposed, which postpones the rising edge of the clock and performs timing recovery through flip-flops resampling. Implemented on a 28nm CMOS neural network accelerator chip across 0.45V&#8722;1.1V, it achieves 34.6%/48.7% power reduction and 43.8%/253.4% frequency gain at the super-/near-threshold (0.9V/0.55V) at the cost of 3.27% area overhead. This scheme eliminates almost all timing margins, which effectively saves energy and increases energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Smart Digital Capacitance Sensing System Using IGZO TFTs on Flexible Substrate</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10190120</link><description>This brief presents a novel compact low-power smart digital capacitance sensing system on flexible substrate.

Reusable modules are designed to reduce hardware resource consumption by leveraging the structural similarity of each convolutional layer and pooling layer in spiking convolutional neural network (SCNN). Taking advantage of time-driven neural processing, memory reutilization is applied to reduce the memory for storing neural states. Benefit from these reusable modules, the proposed architecture demonstrates outstanding scalability. Two SCNN structures (named SCNN I and SCNN II) with different complexities and scales are designed to handle different classification tasks. The experiments are conducted using Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA, operating at a clock frequency of 100 MHz. SCNN I and SCNN II achieve accuracy results of 98.15% and 85.71% respectively on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Additionally, the energy consumption for each classification task is recorded as 0.015mJ and 0.724mJ. These results highlight the suitability of the proposed architecture for deployment in resource-constrained real-time edge processing scenarios.</description></item><item><title>FDM: Fused Double-Multiply Design for Low-Latency and Area- and Power-Efficient Implementation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10227367</link><description>The double-multiply (DM) operation  $(x \times y \times z)$  is frequently used in computing. The traditional design based on two serial multipliers (without fusion) leads to significant area requirements and critical path delays of the circuit. In this brief, we propose a fused double-multiply (FDM) design for low-latency and area- and power-efficient implementation. In the first multiplication operation, the modified Booth (MB) encodings of the carry  $(C)$  and sum  $(S)$  are generated separately instead of being added to each other directly. After the partial products are compressed to  $C$  and  $S$  by the carry-skip adder (CSA),  $(C+S)\times z$  is calculated via the fused add&#8211;multiply (FAM) technique. Synthesized results show that the proposed hardware achieves an 11.54% reduction in the minimum delay compared with the traditional design. In addition, our design saves 17.40% area and 26.86% power compared to the traditional design when achieving the same delay.</description></item><item><title>Secure Run-Time Hardware Trojan Detection Using Lightweight Analytical Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10251968</link><description>Hardware Trojans, malicious components that attempt to prevent a chip from operating as expected, are carefully crafted to circumvent detection during the predeployment silicon design and verification stages. They are an emerging threat being investigated by academia, the military, and industry. Therefore, run-time hardware Trojan detection is critically needed as the final layer of defense during chip deployment, and in this work, we focus on hardware Trojans that target the processor&#8217;s performance. Current state-of-the-art detectors watch hardware counters for anomalies using complex machine-learning models, which require a dedicated off-chip processor and must be trained extensively for each target processor. In this work, we propose a lightweight solution that uses data from a single reference run to accurately determine whether a Trojan is slowing processor performance, across CPU configurations, without the need for new profiles. To accomplish this, we use an analytical model based on the application&#8217;s inherent microarchitecturally independent characteristics. Such models determine the expected microarchitectural events across different processor configurations without requiring reference values for each application-hardware configuration pair. By comparing predicted values to actual hardware events, one can quickly check for unexpected application slowdowns that are the key signatures of many hardware Trojans. The proposed methodology achieves a higher true positive rate (TPR) compared to prior works while having no false positives. The proposed detector incurs no run-time performance penalty and only adds a negligible power overhead of 0.005%.</description></item><item><title>FASE: Energy Isolation Framework for Latency-Sensitive Applications in Intermittent Systems With Multiple Peripherals</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10258389</link><description>The rapid and widespread deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors is limited by issues related to maintenance costs and safe battery disposal. While battery-less systems supported by harvesting ambient energy offer a potential solution, the weakness and instability of ambient energy result in intermittent execution. To provide data consistency, I/O operations are usually performed in the atomic sections, resulting in low-energy efficiency and low-system progress in intermittent systems. To improve application responsiveness and prevent low-energy efficiency due to atomic I/O operations, we propose a framework named FASE, which provides energy isolation assistance to support multiple asynchronous atomic I/O operations in intermittent systems. Our proposal was evaluated on a real platform, and the results show that, compared to state-of-the-art works, our proposed algorithm can increase the rate of completion for latency-sensitive applications by more than 50%.</description></item><item><title>EDF-Based Energy-Efficient Semi-Clairvoyant Scheduling With Graceful Degradation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10271253</link><description>Recent works introduce a semi-clairvoyant model, in which the system mode transition is revealed on the arrival of high-criticality jobs. To solve the problem of inconsistency between the correctness criterion for mixed-criticality systems (MCSs) with a semi-clairvoyant and the actual situation, we study the problem of schedulability and energy in MCS with the semi-clairvoyant model in this article. First, we propose a new correctness criterion for MCS with semi-clairvoyant and graceful degradation and develop the schedulability test based on demand bound function methods denoted as SCS-GD. Second, we propose an energy-efficient semi-clairvoyant scheduling algorithm based on SCS-GD denoted as EE-SCS-GD. Finally, we conduct an experimental evaluation of SCS-GD and EE-SCS-GD by synthetically generated task sets. The experimental results show that SCS-GD can improve the schedulability ratio by 5.98% compared to existing algorithms while EE-SCS-GD can save 56.17% energy compared to SCS-GD.</description></item><item><title>Efficient N:M Sparse DNN Training Using Algorithm, Architecture, and Dataflow Co-Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10256041</link><description>Sparse training is one of the promising techniques to reduce the computational cost of deep neural networks (DNNs) while retaining high accuracy. In particular, N:M fine-grained structured sparsity, where only  ${N}$  out of consecutive  ${M}$  elements can be nonzero, has attracted attention due to its hardware-friendly pattern and capability of achieving a high sparse ratio. However, the potential to accelerate N:M sparse DNN training has not been fully exploited, and there is a lack of efficient hardware supporting N:M sparse training. To tackle these challenges, this article presents a computation-efficient training scheme for N:M sparse DNNs using algorithm, architecture, and dataflow co-design. At the algorithm level, a bidirectional weight pruning method, dubbed BDWP, is proposed to leverage the N:M sparsity of weights during both forward and backward passes of DNN training, which can significantly reduce the computational cost while maintaining model accuracy. At the architecture level, a sparse accelerator for DNN training, namely, SAT, is developed to neatly support both the regular dense operations and the computation-efficient N:M sparse operations. At the dataflow level, multiple optimization methods ranging from interleave mapping, pregeneration of N:M sparse weights, and offline scheduling, are proposed to boost the computational efficiency of SAT. Finally, the effectiveness of our training scheme is evaluated on a Xilinx VCU1525 FPGA card using various DNN models (ResNet9, ViT, VGG19, ResNet18, and ResNet50) and datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, and ImageNet). Experimental results show the SAT accelerator with the BDWP sparse training method under 2:8 sparse ratio achieves an average speedup of  $1.75\times $  over that with the dense training, accompanied by a negligible accuracy loss of 0.56% on average. Furthermore, our proposed training scheme significantly improves the training throughput by  $2.97\times $ &#8211; $25.22\times $  and the energy efficiency by  $1.36\times $ &#8211; $3.58\times $  over prior FPGA-based accelerators.</description></item><item><title>Ace-Sniper: Cloud&#8211;Edge Collaborative Scheduling Framework With DNN Inference Latency Modeling on Heterogeneous Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10247268</link><description>The cloud&#8211;edge collaborative inference requires efficient scheduling of artificial intelligence (AI) tasks to the appropriate edge intelligence devices. Gls DNN inference latency has become a vital basis for improving scheduling efficiency. However, edge devices exhibit highly heterogeneous due to the differences in hardware architectures, computing power, etc. Meanwhile, the diverse deep neural networks (DNNs) are continuing to iterate over time. The diversity of devices and DNNs introduces high computational costs for measurement methods, while invasive prediction methods face significant development efforts and application limitations. In this article, we propose and develop Ace-Sniper, a scheduling framework with DNN inference latency modeling on heterogeneous devices. First, to address the device heterogeneity, a unified hardware resource modeling (HRM) is designed by considering the platforms as black-box functions that output feature vectors. Second, neural network similarity (NNS) is introduced for feature extraction of diverse and frequently iterated DNNs. Finally, with the results of HRM and NNS as input, the performance characterization network is designed to predict the latencies of the given unseen DNNs on heterogeneous devices, which can be combined into most time-based scheduling algorithms. Experimental results show that the average relative error of DNN inference latency prediction is 11.11%, and the prediction accuracy reaches 93.2%. Compared with the nontime-aware scheduling methods, the average waiting time for tasks is reduced by 82.95%, and the platform throughput is improved by 63% on average.</description></item><item><title>Boosting the Convergence of Reinforcement Learning-Based Auto-Pruning Using Historical Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10265172</link><description>Recently, neural network compression schemes like channel pruning have been widely used to reduce the model size and computational complexity of deep neural networks (DNNs) for applications in power-constrained scenarios, such as embedded systems. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based auto-pruning has been further proposed to automate the DNN pruning process to avoid expensive hand-crafted work. However, the RL-based pruner involves a time-consuming training process, and pruning and evaluating each network comes at high-computational expense. These problems have greatly restricted the real-world application of RL-based auto-pruning. Thus, we propose an efficient auto-pruning framework that solves this problem by taking advantage of the historical data from the previous auto-pruning process. In our framework, we first boost the convergence of the RL-pruner by transfer learning. Then, an augmented transfer learning scheme is proposed to further speed up the training process by improving the transferability. Finally, an assistant learning process is proposed to improve the sample efficiency of the RL agent. The experiments show that our framework can accelerate the auto-pruning process by  $1.5\times $ &#8211; $2.5\times $  for ResNet20, and  $1.81\times $ &#8211; $2.375\times $  for other neural networks, such as ResNet56, ResNet18, and MobileNet v1.</description></item><item><title>Statistical Hardware Design With Multimodel Active Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268051</link><description>With the rising complexity of numerous novel applications that serve our modern society comes the strong need to design efficient computing platforms. Designing efficient hardware is, however, a complex multiobjective problem that deals with multiple parameters and their interactions. Given that there is a large number of parameters and objectives involved in hardware design, synthesizing all possible combinations is not a feasible method to find the optimal solution. One promising approach to tackle this problem is statistical modeling of a desired hardware performance. Here, we propose a model-based active learning approach to solve this problem. Our proposed method uses Bayesian models to characterize various aspects of hardware performance. We also use acrlong TL and Gaussian regression bootstrapping techniques in conjunction with active learning to create more accurate models. Our proposed statistical modeling method provides hardware models that are sufficiently accurate to perform design space exploration (DSE) as well as performance prediction simultaneously. We use our proposed method to perform DSE and performance prediction for various hardware setups, such as micro-architecture design and OpenCL kernels for FPGA targets. Our experiments show that the number of samples required to create performance models significantly reduces while maintaining the predictive power of our proposed statistical models. For instance, in our performance prediction setting, the proposed method needs 65% fewer samples to create the model, and in the DSE setting, our proposed method can find the best parameter settings by exploring fewer than 50 samples.</description></item><item><title>CorrectNet+: Dealing With HW Non-Idealities in In-Memory-Computing Platforms by Error Suppression and Compensation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10242326</link><description>The last decade has witnessed the breakthrough of deep neural networks (DNNs) in many fields. With the increasing depth of DNNs, hundreds of millions of multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations need to be executed. To accelerate such operations efficiently, analog in-memory computing platforms based on emerging devices, e.g., resistive RAM (RRAM), have been introduced. These acceleration platforms rely on analog properties of the devices and thus suffer from process variations. Consequently, weights in neural networks configured into these platforms can deviate from the nominal trained values, which may lead to feature errors and a significant degradation of the inference accuracy. Besides, additional HW aspects represent key controlling factors for such computing platforms, namely, the limited RRAM cell programmable conductance levels, which limits the number of bits stored in one RRAM cell, the ADC noise converting analog values to digital domain and the ADC power scaling with the number of bits of its output. To address these points, in this article, we propose a framework to enhance the robustness of neural networks under variations. First, an enhanced Lipschitz constant regularization is adopted during neural network training to suppress the amplification of errors propagated through network layers. Additionally, the quantization setting of a NN model is optimized considering robustness against weight variations and total ADC power consumption. Afterward, error compensation is introduced at necessary locations determined by reinforcement learning (RL) to rescue the feature maps with remaining errors. Experimental results demonstrate that inference accuracy of neural networks can be recovered from as low as 1.69% under variations back to more than 95% of their original accuracy at the highest level of variations and reducing total ADC power consumption by 55% while the training and hardware cost are negligible.</description></item><item><title>Performance- and Energy-Aware Gait-Based User Authentication With Intermittent Computation for IoT Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10242378</link><description>Internet of Things (IoT) makes it possible to utilize a multitude of small- and medium-scale devices allowing for increased functionality in flexible networks. However, user authentication on IoT devices is as important as it can be challenging. Due to limitations on the available energy, interface, and processing power, IoT devices can be the weakest link in their networks. Multiple authentication techniques have been developed to address these challenges. However, the existing techniques are limited in terms of performance, overheads, and efficiency. In contrast, our proposed authentication method uses a user&#8217;s walking gait as an input, because gait is unique to every user and can be collected using low-power inertial sensors found on all handheld devices. Our authentication method uses a lightweight neural network (NN) which is further complimented with early exits to further optimize computational cost(s). We also propose reinforcement learning that considers the energy consumption to dynamically determine which of the exits should be chosen to strike a balance between performance and computational and energy cost. Though effective, one of the challenges with IoT devices is their power supply such as dependence on batteries. Discharge of the battery or any other interruptions can lead to recomputations, which are expensive on already limited battery-operated IoT devices. To address such challenges, especially for user authorization, we introduce intermittent computation to our proposed authentication framework. Intermittent computation can store the state of the NNs at checkpoints. In the case of power disruption, the execution will be resumed from the saved checkpoints instead of performing the whole execution. Most implementations of intermittent computation take place at the compiler level, which makes for a very efficient design, however, that also makes them hardware specific. Our method is implemented on software and is hardware-agnostic, allowing us to create checkpoints to save and retrieve the authentication framework state, in case of power interruption. The proposed authentication framework can authenticate users with up to more than 85% accuracy and can save up to 34% of computations due to the proposed intermittent computing.</description></item><item><title>Pplace-MS: Methodologically Faster Poisson&#8217;s Equation-Based Mixed-Size Global Placement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10266769</link><description>With the advancement of semiconductor technologies, the acceleration of advanced EDA algorithms is receiving much attention. However, developing a faster mixed-size placer without hardware acceleration and loss of solution quality is of great challenge. In this article, we propose a novel definition of potential energy for each block for global placement based on an analytical solution of Poisson&#8217;s equation. A fast approximate computation scheme for partial derivatives of the potential energy is given with considerably less computational loads than existing electrostatics-based placers. Moreover, we propose an effective and efficient occupy-aware macro legalization algorithm. Then, a mixed-size placer named Pplace-MS is developed. Compared to the existing leading mixed-size placer, Pplace-MS on average achieves  $2.054\times $  speedup in single-threaded mode on the same machine and 2.3% reduction of scaled half-perimeter wirelength on the modern mixed-size placement benchmarks. The proposed approach can also be considered accelerated on GPU, as previous works.</description></item><item><title>Power Aware Placement of On-Chip Voltage Regulators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10273654</link><description>In traditional power delivery networks, the on-chip supply voltage is provided by board-level converters. Due to the significant distance between the converter and the load, variations in the load current are not effectively managed, producing a significant voltage drop at the point-of-load. To mitigate this issue, modern high-performance systems utilize on-chip voltage regulators. Due to the close proximity to the load, these regulators can quickly respond to fluctuations in the input voltage or load current, providing superior power quality. Integrated voltage regulators however require significant area, limiting the number of on-chip regulators. An algorithm for distributing on-chip voltage regulators is presented in this article. The algorithm is accelerated using the acrlong IMT, enabling the analysis of arbitrarily sized power grids. The power quality is maximized with a limited number of regulators. Practical scenarios are supported, such as limited current capacity and restricted placement. Several orders of magnitude speedup in the placement process is demonstrated while achieving up to 88% reduction in the maximum voltage drop.</description></item><item><title>Generation of Two-Cycle Tests for Structurally Similar Circuits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10271261</link><description>VLSI design flows improve design parameters (performance, power, area, and testability) iteratively. Whereas the &#8220;shift left&#8221; trend implies that changes at the RTL are preferred for improving the design, it is sometimes necessary to make gate-level changes, e.g., because of layout changes or ECO. In an iterative design flow, repeated ATPG to evaluate the testability of a design after design changes have been made creates a bottleneck. The goal of this article is to address this bottleneck considering two-cycle tests for transition faults. The test generation procedure described in third article transforms an LOC test set generated for an earlier version of the design into an LOC test set for a new version without repeating the entire test generation process. To enable the transformation, it is necessary to find a mapping between the inputs and outputs of the earlier and new versions of the design, taking into consideration that RTL resynthesis may produce a new gate-level netlist, with new signal names and different input and output orders. To address two-cycle tests, the mapping is performed over two time frames of the design. Experimental results for industrial circuits with changes made at the RTL as well as gate-level demonstrate significant runtime gains with the test generation procedure described in this article.</description></item></channel></rss>
