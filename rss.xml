First, the system with hybrid topology relay is proposed and the relay coil is integrated on the receiving side. Second, two adjustment factors &#945; and &#946; are generated by introducing the hybrid topology relay, where &#945; is mainly used to design the equivalent MI value and &#946; is mainly applied to adjust the fluctuation of the equivalent MI. As a result, equivalent MI can be enhanced, and misalignment tolerance can be also optimized and improved. In addition, the power transmission capability can also be improved because the transconductance gain is proportional to the equivalent MI. Finally, the experimental setup, with a power output of 3.3 kW, is constructed. The constant current output characteristic and high misalignment tolerance are verified. The results show that the dc&#8211;dc efficiency is higher than 93.05% within the 100 mm horizontal misalignment range, and the fluctuation percentage of the equivalent MI is only 4.89%.</description></item><item><title>A Dual-Band Rectifier With a Novel Impedance Compression Network for WPT</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10878802</link><description>In this work, a dual-band rectifier with an impedance compression network (ICN) is designed for wireless power transfer. The proposed ICN is connected to the parallel subrectifiers that utilize a voltage-doubling topology.

The proposed system reduces the cost, weight, and volume of the power conversion units by sharing active switch bridges and magnetic coupler coils without mechanical switches. The proposed magnetic coupler design method enables the secondary coil to be shared in both OBC and WPT modes, while the primary coil for OBC can be magnetically decoupled from the transmitter coil in WPT mode. Based on the proposed topology configuration and winding method, the proposed system operates as a dual-active bridge and an inductor-capacitor-capacitor-series (LCC-S) compensated converter in the OBC and WPT modes, respectively.

However, it has the issue of heat concentration, which leads to severe thermal imbalance and high thermal stress, posing a challenge to thermal design. In this letter, thermal balance control strategy is utilized by exchanging the drive signals of two-phase circuits, which can periodically change the loss distribution among the switches, suppressing the above problem. By compensating for the current variation, it effectively eliminates current overshoot and oscillation during transition, thereby mitigating inductor saturation and enhancing the reliability of the system. Furthermore, a thermoelectric coupling analysis method is proposed to evaluate the performance of the converter and provide guidance for converter design. Experimental and simulation results have been presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.</description></item><item><title>Zero-Sequence Current and Voltage Control Strategy of Multiple MMCs for Single-Phase Ground Fault Protection in AC&#8211;DC Hybrid Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10848207</link><description>The ac/dc hybrid distribution network (HDN) is facing great challenges under single-phase ground (SPG) fault. To ensure the continuous and stable operation of ac/dc HDNs, it is essential that the converters have fault control and relay protection capabilities. The previous studies focused only on a single converter, this article first proposes a zero-sequence current and voltage control strategy for multiple modular multilevel converters (MMCs). The zero-sequence current control strategy includes active arc suppression and zero-sequence current suppression. The active arc suppression can achieve relay protection functions such as arc suppression, fault type determination, fault localization, and fault removal perception. The zero-sequence current suppression can achieve SPG fault isolation to ensure that the power quality of the nonfaulty grid is not affected. The zero-sequence voltage control strategy includes zero-sequence voltage cooperative control and zero-sequence voltage feedforward control, which can optimize the voltage capacity of each MMC and reduce the fault control requirements of the ac/dc HDN. The whole proposed strategy can realize the self-healing of SPG faults, which can improve the reliability of distribution network power supply. The effectiveness of the strategy is fully verified by simulation and experiment.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing the Dynamic Performance of Current-Fed Triple-Active-Bridge DC&#8211;DC Converters Utilizing Freewheeling States for Inductor-Current Adjustment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10857633</link><description>This article provides the analytical and experimental exploration of a control strategy that enhances the dynamic performance of current-fed triple-active-bridge (CFTAB) dc&#8211;dc converters to its physical limits. So far, dynamic current transients in the inductors of CFTAB converters are poorly discussed in the literature. Published simulation and measurement results of load steps are usually plotted on a large timescale so that the fast transient behavior on switching-cycle timescale is barely visible. In this work, the freewheeling states current adjustment (FSCA) strategy is examined that reaches the new steady state as fast as physically possible. In addition to the analytical derivation of the FSCA strategy, theoretical limitations are presented and validated on a 1-kW GaN-based prototype of the CFTAB converter. Measurement results confirm that the FSCA strategy significantly reduces overshoots and oscillations. The settling time after a load step is reduced from about 1 ms down to 10 $\mu \mathrm{s}$, which yields a time reduction by a factor of 100.</description></item><item><title>Transient Stability Analysis for Hybrid Parallel-Connected Converters by Two-Dimensional Phase Portrait</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10855672</link><description>A hybrid parallel-connected system with grid-following (GFL) and grid-forming (GFM) converters can be characterized as a high-order nonlinear dynamic system when performing transient synchronous stability analysis, which cannot be analyzed clearly by the existing method. The existing methods analyze the power angle for each converter individually, which fails to elucidate the transient coupling dynamic process of the power angles among different converters. To fill this gap, a 2-D phase portrait method is proposed by structure-preserving dimensionality reduction mapping, which can effectively reveal the interactive dynamics between GFM converter and GFL converter. The four types of factors, which impact the transient stabilization are elaborated by the proposed method. Furthermore, the influence of current limiting strategies on the transient stability is revealed by applying the 2-D phase portrait. Finally, experimental results are provided to verify the theoretical analysis.</description></item><item><title>Implementation of SOLM as an Extended SVPWM for Variable Six Pulse DC-Bus Electrolytic Capacitor-Less VSI Based Constant V/f Induction Motor Drive</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10857374</link><description>Synchronous one-leg modulation (SOLM) technique has been used for six-pulse dc-bus electrolytic capacitor-less voltage source inverter (VSI) considering reduced switching loss compared to space vector pulsewidth modulation (SVPWM). The existing method for generating the modulating signal in SOLM technique utilizes a sector identification-based approach. This work demonstrates, through both mathematical analysis and hardware results, that despite differences in the dc-bus voltage, modulating signal and instantaneous pole voltage waveforms between SVPWM and SOLM techniques, their average pole voltages are identical. Based on this understanding, this work proposes implementing the SOLM technique as an extension of SVPWM technique without requiring sector identification. A comparison between the proposed and the existing implementations of SOLM shows reduction in computational effort. A 1.25-kVA hardware prototype was developed for open-loop V/f control of a 1-hp induction motor. A comparison has been made between SVPWM with fixed dc-bus voltage, SVPWM with variable dc-bus voltage and SOLM with variable six-pulse dc-bus voltage. VSI efficiency with SOLM was in the range of 98.4%&#8211;99.1% at different operating conditions. Operation of the converter was successfully demonstrated under motor acceleration, steady-state operation as well as during deceleration.</description></item><item><title>Direct DC-Bus Control for Grid-Forming Converters: Toward the Concept of Dual-Voltage-Forming Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10858748</link><description>A control method for regulating both dc- and ac-side voltages, based on a disturbance observer, is presented. This method provides a voltage-source behavior from the ac-side perspective, a key functionality of grid-forming converters. A dynamic model is derived to develop the control law using feedback linearization. The control method is able to maintain the dc- and ac-side voltages without any cascaded loops. The method is, therefore, named the dual-voltage forming method to differentiate it from the recent definitions of grid-forming converters. The use of a disturbance observer provides integral action and also inherent synchronization. A transparent current controller is implemented to protect the converter from overcurrents. Small-signal stability of the proposed method is studied analytically and design guidelines are drawn from the analysis. Furthermore, the asymmetric behavior of the converter in different operating modes is analytically assessed. The performance of the method is tested in experimental conditions using a 12.5-kVA test setup. The control method exhibits robust performance in both strong and weak grids in terms of dc-bus voltage reference tracking as well as the capacity to survive large external power variations with power-flow direction changes. Moreover, the effect of a grid voltage sag is studied.</description></item><item><title>A Novel CTTC Structure and Optimization Design Method for CLLC Bidirectional Resonant Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10858669</link><description>The resonant tank of CLLC converter incorporates numerous magnetic components. To enhance power density, magnetic integration technology has become a key research focus.

A performance evaluation of the CLLC converter utilizing the CTTC structure has been conducted, focusing on the effects of circuit parasitic parameters and leakage inductors. Finally, the validity is verified by a 3 kW bidirectional CLLC prototype.</description></item><item><title>A Three-Phase Four-Leg Neutral-Point-Clamped Photovoltaic Inverter With Decoupled Active and Reactive Power Control and DC-Link Voltage Ripple Minimization Under Unbalanced Grid Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10870423</link><description>This article analyzes the performance of a three-phase four-leg three-level neutral-point-clamped-based photovoltaic (PV) inverter, which is connected to an unbalanced grid. The PV source terminals are connected to the dc link of the inverter through a three-level dc&#8211;dc boost converter, which helps in controlling the individual dc-link capacitor voltages. In this article, a space-vector-control-based voltage balancing strategy is introduced for balancing the individual dc-link capacitor voltages under unbalanced grid operation. In addition, the amplitude and phase angle of individual-phase currents are thoroughly studied to understand their dependence on the percentage of unbalancing in the grid voltage and, therefore, to decide the maximum allowable current that can flow through any particular phase leg under a given unbalancing condition. A control method for minimizing voltage ripple of the individual dc-link capacitors using the boost converter is then proposed, which ensures that the capacitors do not persist any voltage overshoot under limited neutral current operation. The PV-generated grid-tied system is implemented on a scaled-down laboratory-based experimental prototype to validate the aforementioned claims and substantiate the efficacy of the proposed control techniques.</description></item><item><title>Energy Harmonic Stability Analysis of Energy-Balancing Control for Modular Multilevel Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10874221</link><description>The energy-balancing control (EBC) plays a crucial role in the proper functioning of the modular multilevel converter (MMC). However, regarding the stability analysis of MMC energy balance, the discussion on internal energy balance is usually ignored, whereas it has been demonstrated in the existing literature that the capacitor energy harmonics may affect the system stability. This article considers the impact of capacitor energy harmonics on EBC and obtains its steady-state time-invariant form. Based on this, small-signal modeling of both dc-side EBC and ac-side EBC of the MMC is conducted, and the stability of EBC is systematically discussed. Through eigenvalue and participation factor analysis, it is revealed that the coupling caused by energy harmonics in sum and differential energy control contributes to the poor stability of EBC. To address this stability issue, parameter selection recommendations for EBC are proposed. By adopting these recommendations, the dynamic performance of EBC can be maximized while ensuring system stability. The accuracy of the obtained conclusions and the effectiveness of the proposed parameter selection recommendations are verified through simulations and experiments.</description></item><item><title>Immittance-Based Stability and Instability Participation Analysis for DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10874184</link><description>The existing immittance-based stability analysis approaches for dc microgrids rarely account for the line network, and they are always troubled by the non-minimum phase issues. In this article, we introduce a novel method for stability analysis based on the determinant of the constructed immittance matrix. Since the determinant's right-half-plane poles are explicitly proven absent, it is only necessary to ascertain the net number of times that the phase trajectory crosses the &#177;180&#176; line in system stability analysis. Subsequently, based on the immittance matrix decomposition and sensitivity calculation, a participation analysis method is further presented to identify the critical converter that dominates system instability. Finally, the simulation case of a 750 V 30 kW dc microgrid and the experiment case of a 24 V 180 W dc microgrid are established to validate these methods.</description></item><item><title>Harmonic Programmed Modulation for High-Power Medium Voltage Energy Conversion: Formulation, Solving Approach, and Implementation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10877753</link><description>High-power (MW) energy conversion systems typically operate at much lower switching frequencies than low-power (kW-100&#8201;s kW) systems.

At the end, a discussion on the future development of HPPWM is provided.</description></item><item><title>Multimotor Synchronous and Antidisturbance Control for Two-Stage Friction Wheels Launcher</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10876803</link><description>The purpose of this article is to propose a model predictive repeated learning (MPRL) control strategy to achieve high-performance control of the multimotor servo control (MMSC) system. The control strategy generates feedforward by learning the synchronization uncertainty between motors, reduces the synchronization error between motors, and improves the synchronization of the MMSC system. High-precision speed tracking is achieved through state prediction, and energy constraints are incorporated into the controller to reduce energy loss in the MMSC system. The trigger mode and input distribution are used to compensate for the impact on the system, and stable speed tracking and synchronization of the MMSC system under impact disturbances are achieved. Finally, a composite control scheme is obtained. Compared with conventional methods, the MPRL method can handle synchronization uncertainty, compensate for disturbances caused by shocks, and simultaneously obtain high-precision speed tracking and speed synchronization between motors. A research prototype of the two-stage launcher system is developed, and experimental setup is constructed. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the MPRL method and its advantages compared with conventional methods.</description></item><item><title>Accurate Modeling and Elimination of Vertical Crossings for Multisampled Single-Phase DC&#8211;AC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10878123</link><description>The multisample-multiupdate (MSMU) scheme is an effective approach to reduce delay in digitally controlled power converters. However, basic MSMU leads to current distortion from the vertical crossing (VC) of the modulation signal and carrier signal, which loses the closed-loop regulation. Therefore, it is significant to predict and eliminate the VC to avoid its negative influences. This article proposes an accurate model of VC in multisampled single-phase dc&#8211;ac converters. The total digital delay, the duty ratio, and the proportional gain in the system are the critical factors. Then, a modulation compensator is proposed to eliminate VC based on the prediction of the modulation signal. When the vertical crossing is detected by prediction, the modulation signal is compensated to imitate natural sampling. The proposed method features lower current distortion than existing methods, and it enhances the dissipative region of the system because it avoids using filters that will introduce equivalent delay. Finally, the theoretical analysis is validated by the simulation and the experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Design of a Single-Stage Dual Active Bridge Microinverter With Wide Load Adaptability Based on Loss Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10877789</link><description>This article presents an optimized design of a single-stage dual active bridge (DAB) dc&#8211;ac converter with off-grid load capability. DAB converters have attracted attention due to their bidirectional power transmission and high power density characteristics. However, adaptability to loads is required during off-grid operation of energy storage devices. Based on the linearization of control variables, a new control loop is established in this article. The objective is to minimize current stress and root mean square current, which constrains the outer phase-shift angle, thereby enhancing system efficiency. Furthermore, from the perspective of the loss model, the optimal operating frequency range of the system was studied based on the selected switching devices. Combined with winding methods, the parameters of the magnetic components were optimized. This further improved the system's efficiency. A 600 W DAB microinverter prototype was built and experimentally verified on various loads. The results confirmed that the proposed method can improve the overall system efficiency and achieve a peak efficiency of 97.89% under resistive load.</description></item><item><title>Online Reactive Power Suppression Strategy for Triple Active Bridge Converter Based on Dynamic Fundamental Voltage-Balance Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10878299</link><description>The triple active bridge (TAB) converter presents a significant challenge for efficiency optimization due to its complex model resulting from power coupling between ports and multiple control degrees of freedom. Existing high-precision optimization strategies are often based on complex models and modulation methods, typically relying on offline optimization and online look-up tables during operation, making them difficult to apply widely in practical engineering scenarios. To address these challenges, an online reactive power suppression strategy is proposed, which reduces conduction losses by suppressing reactive power during operation. First, the total reactive power model is established, and a dynamic fundamental voltage-balance modulation (DFVM) strategy is employed to automatically suppress fundamental reactive power. Moreover, the zero-voltage-switching range can also be expanded. To further optimize the total reactive power, an additional degree of freedom (the shared phase-shift coefficient $d_{\text{CP}}$) is introduced into the control strategy, which can be dynamically adjusted based on operating conditions. Furthermore, by analyzing the slopes of $d_{\text{CP}}$ and the outer phase shifts in relation to output power and reactive power, an incremental balance-based iterative optimization method was proposed. This method enables adaptive online calculation of the optimal $d_{\text{CP}}$, thereby enhancing the applicability of the control algorithm. Finally, a 3.3-kW prototype was developed to validate the proposed strategy, achieving a peak efficiency of 95.3%. Under light-load conditions, efficiency improved by 5.13% compared to existing online strategies.</description></item><item><title>DC&#8211;AC Talkative Power Conversion Based on Variable Zero-Vector Position Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10882991</link><description>Talkative power conversion (TPC), which embeds information in the switching ripple to achieve simultaneous power and data transmission without installing any or few additional hardware at the transmitter side, can reduce the additional communication infrastructure needed in cyber-physical systems like smart grids and renewable power plants. While in dc&#8211;dc converters TPC has been the subject of numerous investigations, dc&#8211;ac converters have received less attention. Recently, zero vectors of three-phase dc&#8211;ac converters were used to embed data, and variable zero vector width modulation TPC has been investigated. In this study, a novel zero vector-based modulation, called variable zero-vector position modulation, is proposed for three-phase dc&#8211;ac TPC with improved communication performance. This type of dc&#8211;ac converter can send data through the power line to the demodulator with good power quality. The viability of using sliding fast fourier transform (FFT)-based demodulation for target side-band harmonics is supported by a mathematical study of the harmonic distribution. The results of MATLAB/Simulink-based simulations and scaled-down prototype-based experimental results verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis. Besides, the bit error rate is evaluated for different line lengths and zero vector positions.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Analog Control Strategy With Simplified Implementation Scheme for Boundary Conduction Mode Flyback Microinverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10887041</link><description>With the continuous reduction in the per-watt cost of photovoltaic modules, the complexity and cost of the controller circuit are becoming one of the key factors limiting the competitiveness of flyback microinverters in cost-sensitive PV applications. To address this issue, this article proposes a novel analog control strategy for boundary conduction mode flyback microinverters. This strategy utilizes a minimal number of basic analog components to achieve low total harmonic distortion in grid-connected current and high static and dynamic MPPT efficiencies. To enable peak-current control, a dedicated analog divider circuit, consisting of only three basic components, is designed to perform complex computations typically required for the traditional current reference. Using this divider, low harmonic distortion grid-connected current and a high power factor can be achieved. In addition, an improved analog MPPT strategy with optimized perturbation logic and control timing is introduced to simplify the hardware implementation and eliminate misjudgment issues caused by the double-line frequency power fluctuations. The improved strategy enables both high efficiency and stable MPPT control without the need for additional timers and signal conditioning circuits. Experimental results on a 125 W prototype are presented to validate the advantages of the proposed analog control strategy.</description></item><item><title>Modified Discrete-Time Super-Twisting Control of PMSM Speed Regulation System: Theory and Experimentation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884027</link><description>The article puts forward a modified discrete-time super-twisting (DTST) control strategy for the speed regulation system of permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) to strengthen the control efficacy and resilience to disturbances in its digital execution. As opposed to the conventional DTST algorithm, the most discernible attribute for the developed scheme is to displace the discontinuous term in the conventional DTST by dint of a nonsmooth term in consequence of the constraint of the sampling frequency practically speaking. With consideration for this substitution, a flexibly tunable fractional power parameter is introduced to increase the control precision while mitigating the oscillations. The Lyapunov-based theoretical analysis is offered to rigorously validate the convergence for the correspondingly whole system. Eventually, in comparison with two existing control schemes, the effectiveness and superiority of the presented method are experimentally supported in real time through using a 1.5 kW PMSM hardware platform.</description></item><item><title>Multi Module Parallel MHz Power Amplifier with Hybrid Structure and Optimized Control Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884888</link><description>Megahertz power amplifiers typically modulate power by paralleled-architectures and outphasing methods. However, when power drops in a large ratio, the effective admittances of modules are always not within the high-efficiency range. This article optimizes four-paralleled-module system through two operation modes: four modules turn-on at high power and two modules turn-on at low power to reduce the effective susceptance range at low power. In addition, a combining network consisting of four independently optimized T-networks is proposed to provide ideal load conditions for each module during phase variation. With the help of new networks and hybrid modes, the system is optimized to ensure that the effective admittance trajectory of each module is within the minimum loss range. A 13.56 MHz prototype consisting of four Class E modules is constructed, which maintains an efficiency of 76%&#8211;89% with output power of 20&#8211;200 W, with an average improvement of 9.5% compared to asymmetric Chireix methods.</description></item><item><title>Antiovervoltage Control Strategy for Electrolytic Capacitorless PMSM Drives Based on Power Balance State Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10899754</link><description>Addressing the coupling effect between speed and voltage controllers in the traditional antiovervoltage control strategy for electrolytic capacitorless permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drives, a novel antiovervoltage control strategy based on power balance state regulation is proposed. The active&#8211;reactive power coordinate frame based on synthesized voltage vector orientation is constructed in the proposed scheme. Subsequently, the power balance current for maintaining dc-link voltage constant can be extracted independently of inverter and motor parameters. To achieve the decoupling between controllers, the power balance current is set as a threshold to switch the designed operating mode. Thus, the coupling issue can be solved between the speed and voltage controllers in the case of reduced dc-link capacitance values. To control the dc-link voltage following the designed voltage trajectory in braking mode, the active and reactive currents are allocated based on the power balance current. Furthermore, controller coefficients are designed from frequency domain to ensure a sufficient phase margin. While ensuring maximum copper loss, the dc-link voltage overshoot can be significantly reduced by the proposed scheme. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in 2.2-kW reduced dc-link capacitance PMSM drives. Compared with the traditional antiovervoltage control scheme, the proposed scheme can suppress dc-link voltage overshoot to 2%.</description></item><item><title>Stray Inductance Extraction Methods for Power Modules: A Comprehensive Review and Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10848351</link><description>The stray inductance of the commutation circuit significantly impacts power semiconductor device switching.

The tradition methods destroy the packaging component and are difficult to obtain the maximum temperature of PP IGBT. A temperature sensor integrated method for directly obtaining the maximum temperature of PP IGBT chip is proposed in this article. Due to the uneven temperature distribution on the surface of the chip, the maximum temperature measurement depends on the mounting positions of temperature sensors. Three mounting positions of temperature sensors including the gap between gate pad and emitter molybdenum (Mo), the emitter Mo, and the gate pogo pin are reasonably proposed by theory analysis. The finite element simulations and constant current source tests show that as the clamping force increases, the maximum temperature point drifts from the center of the emitter surface to the gap. The maximum temperature of PP IGBT chip is increased after the emitter Mo is grooved. The mounting position located at the head of gate pogo pin avoids the influence of stress on the temperature sensor. The feasibility of the proposed method is verified based on a half-bridge inverter.</description></item><item><title>Analytical Transient Model of Field-Stop IGBT Accounting for Temperature Dependence</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10900567</link><description>The field-stop (FS) insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) (FS IGBTs) become a mainstay in the IGBT market for medium and high-power applications nowadays.

It targets the high-frequency conducted EMI peaks that fall in the frequency range, $\text{2} \,{\mathrm{MHz}}$ - $\text{30} \,{\mathrm{MHz}}$, by distributing the high-frequency noise peak energy into several frequencies. Thus, it restricts the high-frequency oscillation generated due to the switching transients of the converter. In the proposed technology, a parallel combination of inductor and diode is connected in series with the dc-link capacitor of the converter. The inductance value is inversely proportional to the $di/dt$ of the converter switch and remains below 100 nH. The power dissipated in the diode is around $0.05 \,\%$ of the converter power rating, and its blocking voltage is less than $\text{5} \,\%$ of the dc-link voltage. Thus, the inductor and diode are smaller in size and cheaper in cost. The proposed technology has been experimentally validated on a SiC-mosfet based $\text{1} \,{\mathrm{kW}}$ dc&#8211;dc converter. The input voltage and current for the converter are $\text{200} \,{\mathrm{V}}$ and $\text{5} \,{\mathrm{A}}$, respectively. The proposed technique achieves $\text{16} \,{\mathrm{dB}}$ reduction of the noise peak at $\text{26} \,{\mathrm{MHz}}$.</description></item><item><title>Enabling High-Frequency Operation of MMC-Based Chargers: Frequency-Decoupled Modulation Strategy and Soft Switching</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854808</link><description>The demand for ultrafast charging of electric heavy-duty vehicles drives the development of megawatt-level interfaces with the medium-voltage grid. Modular multilevel converter (MMC)-based chargers offer a promising solution, utilizing a single medium-frequency transformer (MFT) to enhance power density. This article proposes a novel modulation strategy for ac/ac MMCs with rectangular-wave output that leverages the separation of low-frequency and medium-frequency components within the modulation stage. This separation reduces the scaling factor between the switching frequency and the MFT's operating frequency, enabling the use of higher operating frequencies for the MFT. This, in turn, facilitates the size reduction of the MFT without compromising the efficiency of the MMC. The findings demonstrate significant improvements in the modulator, including higher time resolution of waveform synthesis, and reduced harmonic distortion in the MMC's terminal voltages and currents. This, in turn, enables soft-switching operation in the power converters. Experimental results are given to validate the theoretical analysis and practical feasibility of the proposed modulation and soft-switching strategies.</description></item><item><title>High Power and High Repetition Frequency Nanosecond Marx Generator Based on Avalanche Transistor With Triggering Acceleration Circuit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10855468</link><description>The high voltage nanosecond pulses with high pulse repetition frequency (PRF) and narrow pulse width are widely used in high power applications. The M&#215;N-stage Marx-bank circuit (MBC) based on the avalanche bipolar junction transistors (ABJTs) combines the advantages of simple construction and high output amplitude, making it an effective pulse generator for the above requirements. However, PRF of traditional M&#215;N-stage MBC is not improved effectively due to the poor reliability of ABJTs at 1-stage. In this work, the vulnerable properties of ABJT which is at first-stage and triggered by a slow voltage ramp are analyzed and explained by simulation and experiment. On this basis, a modified 4&#215;12-stage MBC with a triggering acceleration circuit (TAC) is proposed. The reliability of the most failure-prone ABJT in 4&#215;12-stage MBC is improved effectively by increasing triggering speed of the voltage ramp generated from TAC. Moreover, the influences of the components in MBC-TAC on the output characteristics are further analyzed and the high PRF and high reliability are verified. The 4&#215;12-stage MBC-TAC achieves an output amplitude of 5.1 kV, a rise time of 1.57 ns, a pulse width of 4.07 ns, and a PRF of 200 kHz. This investigation and improvement of MBC-TAC provides a reference for the applications of MBCs based on ABJTs.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid-Parallel Collaborative Simulation Framework Integrating Device Physics With Circuit Dynamics for PDAE-Modeled Power Electronic Equipment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854913</link><description>Optimizing high-performance power electronic equipment, such as power converters, requires multiscale simulations that incorporate the physics of power semiconductor devices and the dynamics of other circuit components, especially in conducting design of experiments (DoEs), defining the safe operating area of devices, and analyzing failures related to semiconductor devices. However, current methodologies either overlook the intricacies of device physics or do not achieve satisfactory computational speeds. To bridge this gap, this article proposes a hybrid-parallel collaborative (HPC) framework specifically designed to analyze the partial differential&#8211;algebraic equation (PDAE)-modeled power electronic equipment, integrating the device physics and circuit dynamics. The HPC framework employs a dynamic iteration to tackle the challenges inherent in solving the coupled nonlinear PDAE system and utilizes a hybrid-parallel computing strategy to reduce computing time. Physics-based system partitioning, along with hybrid-process-thread parallelization on shared and distributed memory, is employed, facilitating the simulation of hundreds of partial differential equations-modeled devices simultaneously without compromising speed. Experiments based on the hybrid-line commutated converter and reverse-blocking integrated gate-commutated thyristors are conducted under three typical real-world scenarios: semiconductor device optimization for the converter, converter design optimization, and device failure analysis. The HPC framework delivers simulation speed up to 60 times faster than the leading commercial software, while maintaining carrier-level accuracy in the experiments. This speedup becomes more pronounced as the number of semiconductor devices increases. This shows great potential for comprehensive analysis and collaborative optimization of devices and electronic power equipment, particularly in extreme conditions and failure scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic DC Voltage Enhancement for Modular Multilevel Converter Using Capacitor Voltage Ripple</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10874206</link><description>High-power flexible dc links employ modular multilevel converters (MMC) for compact active power redirection in medium and high voltage grids. During contingencies, such converters may need to provide an enhanced active power capacity to avoid overload in vulnerable grid locations. This article achieves this target by using the capacitor voltage ripple margin of the MMC submodules (SM) to enhance the dc voltage beyond the rated value. This voltage enhancement enables the enhanced active power capacity of the MMC while maintaining rated electro&#8211;thermal stresses on the components. Moreover, dynamically varying the dc side voltage reduces the MMC's circulating current, improving its operating efficiency. Because the average capacitor voltage is controlled to remain constant, the overall stresses and harmonic performance of the enhanced MMC remain the same as in the base case. In this article, the analytical expressions for the voltage and power enhancement limits are derived, revealing a dependence on the grid-injected reactive power. Furthermore, a controller is designed to achieve stable operation during transient conditions when the power enhancement is carried out. Finally, the enhancement concept is validated using simulations and experiments with a down-scaled laboratory MMC prototype.</description></item><item><title>Gate Driver Power Supply With Low-Capacitance-Coupling and Constant Output Voltage for Medium-Voltage SiC MOSFETs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10874144</link><description>With the development of wide band-gap devices, Silicon Carbide (SiC) semiconductor devices in 10&#8211;15 kV voltage class offer potentials in medium-voltage (MV) systems.

Typically, the duty cycle of boost converters is increased to achieve high voltage levels at their output. Prolonged duty cycles cause an increase in the duration of current flow through the switch and can lead to an increase in losses of the switch and other components of the converter. This article introduces a boost converter that provides high-voltage gains with limited duty cycles. Instead of one inductor used in a typical converter, the proposed converter uses three inductors. Two capacitors (in addition to the parallel capacitor at the output) are used to store more energy enabling the converter to enhance the output level. When the switch is activated, the current passing through the switch and other components of the converter is increased due to these capacitors. To overcome this problem, the proposed converter is equipped with an additional inductor in series with the source. This inductor leads to smoother current flow through the source. Another capacitor, charged by the input source, contributes to accomplishing soft switching. To show the operational capabilities of the proposed converter, results of manufacturing a prototype of the converter are presented.</description></item><item><title>The Magnetic Branch Snubber Channel and Magnetic Model Analysis for SM Capacitor Reduction of SST</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10876809</link><description>For a cascaded H-bridge-based solid-state transformer where the isolation stage is a quad active bridge (QAB), this article proposes a magnetic branch snubber channel scheme with zero harmonic impedance/flux.

However, the MMCC contains of numerous power modules and necessitates discrete dc-link voltage balancing and precharging control. They introduce severe cost issues: 1) voltage balancing control employs a substantial number of costly sensors to monitor dc-link voltages; 2) dc-link capacitor precharging control relies on expensive medium-voltage charging resistors and bypass breakers. This article proposes a novel hardware method for MMCC, which cost-effectively solves voltage balancing and precharging issues. It utilizes extra interconnecting-winding of the transformer and LC resonant tank as the high-frequency port to connect all modules in parallel on the ac bus for dc-link voltage autobalancing. Meanwhile, the ac bus connects with a low-voltage dc source via an auxiliary H-bridge to precharge all modules. Therefore, the proposal saves the costly sensors required for equalization control by dc-link voltage autobalancing feature. Additionally, the proposal removes expensive and bulky medium-voltage charging resistors and bypass breakers through the cost-effective low-voltage precharge structure. Compared to conventional MMCC, these novel structures reduce the total cost by more than 25% while simplifying circuit complexity, enhancing voltage balancing performance, and maintaining the same level of reliability. Nevertheless, the system efficiency is slightly compromised (0.12%). The feasibility of the proposal is verified by simulations and experiments.</description></item><item><title>Improvement of Low-Switching-Frequency Rectifier With Hybrid Cascaded H-Bridge Multilevel Cell</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10882963</link><description>Due to device losses and heat dissipation, single-phase rectifiers in high-speed railways are operated at low-switching frequencies.

By circulant PWM (CPWM) control strategy, the output voltage can be regulated. Since, the switching patterns of the power devices are reconfigured under this modulation scheme, the resonant tank can operate in three-level or two-level modes. Therefore, two operation modes are obtained, ensuring that it can work over a wide voltage range while realizing zero-voltage switching (ZVS) for all switches. In addition, self-balancing of VSM capacitor voltages and high-efficiency are achieved. Compared with existing resonant topologies, the proposed solution not only has a smaller number of devices, but also the voltage stress on the input-side switches is lower than the input voltage for the entire wide voltage range.

The proposed topology is generated by integrating a two-phase interleaved current-fed LLC (TPICF-LLC) converter, which has the same number of primary switching devices and boost inductors as TPICF-LLC, but the resonant tank and rectifier circuit are shared. Compared with other interleaved structures, the proposed ICFI-LLC solution not only has moderate components, but also has lower voltage stress across the primary devices throughout the entire operating range, which reduces the cost of the devices and enables a more compact size. Through the circulant phase-shift control strategy and the two-phase interleaving technology, not only the current ripple on the input side can be kept at zero no matter how the input voltage and transmission power change, but also the capacitor voltages of the series connected voltage source submodules in the ICFI-LLC switching network have self-balancing capability without introducing complex equalization methods.

However, when the dc-side current harmonics introduced by these VSCs interact with inherent dcMG system resonances, the dcMG system stability and power quality will deteriorate. To address this issue, this article proposes a cost-effective dual-side selective harmonic elimination pulse-width modulation (DSSHE-PWM) technique for two-level VSCs. The proposed DSSHE-PWM simultaneously eliminates harmonics introduced by the VSC in both the ac-side voltages and the dc-side current. To achieve this, first, the correlation between the VSC modulation and the dc-side current harmonics is investigated. Subsequently, the corresponding ac-side voltage harmonics that create the concerned dc-side current harmonics are identified. These voltage harmonics are then incorporated into an optimization problem to generate switching patterns for the VSC. The effectiveness of the proposed technique in improving the power quality and stabilizing the dcMG system is validated with both simulation and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Self-Adapted Predictive Control Strategy for High-Power Vehicular Fuel Cell System Thermal Management</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10705799</link><description>Effective thermal management is essential for the performance of high-power fuel cell systems, especially for vehicular applications. This study presents a novel self-adaptive predictive control (SAPC) strategy to address challenges posed by large time delay effects and time-variant characteristics in fuel cell systems. By integrating prediction and current information, SAPC reduces the time-domain signal mismatch induced by delay effects in the basic proportional&#8211;integral&#8211;derivative (PID) controller. Adaptive weight factors for the prediction component are tuned online for various scenarios, and online/offline model adjustments automatically adapt the dynamic transfer-function model to varying operational points and time-variant characteristics. Experimental validation on an 80 kW fuel cell system test bench demonstrates that SAPC significantly reduces temperature control error by 59% and 64.5%, overshoot by 74.6% and 70%, and mean settling time by 87.9% and 77.6% compared with two other conventional PID frameworks. This highlights SAPC as a promising solution for enhancing precise temperature control in high-power fuel cell systems within dynamic load conditions.</description></item><item><title>An Enhanced Transient Angle Stability Scheme of VSG Based on the PCH Theory</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10691676</link><description>With the increasing number of distributed generations connected to the grid, the inertia of power grid turns out to be decreased. To address this problem, the virtual synchronous generator (VSG) is proposed, which mimics the mechanical characteristics of the traditional synchronous generators (SGs). However, the introduction of virtual inertia will induce the transient angle instability, which threatens the security and stability of power system when the grid voltage sag occurs. Few methods can effectively tackle this problem, particularly, when the grid voltage sag is severe. In this article, the mechanism of transient angle instability is analyzed, and an enhanced transient angle stability (TAS) scheme is proposed. First, the VSG system is designed as a port-controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) system. Based on the energy shaping, the control law of the PCH system, i.e., the reference active power of VSG is constructed to be model based. Second, benefitting from this model, the TAS can be enhanced by modifying the reference active power via the state variable feedback. Thus, an enhanced TAS scheme that employs the power angle variation is proposed. Moreover, the proposed scheme is proved to be effective in terms of the equal area criterion (EAC) even if the severe grid voltage sag occurs. Finally, the simulations and experiments are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>Joint Transient Angle and Voltage Stability Analysis and Enhancement of Grid-Forming Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10695768</link><description>As an enabling technology in more-electronic power systems, grid-forming converters have been increasingly popular. However, their transient behavior under grid faults has not been fully explored. In particular, existing literature only investigates the transient angle or voltage stability problem separately, without considering the case where both events occur concurrently. To fill in the research gap, this article provides a comprehensive analysis of both transient angle and voltage stability problems. We first derive the existence condition for equilibrium points. Then, we disclose the attraction domain of the stable equilibrium point by use of the LaSalle invariant set theorem. The derived stable conditions can ensure the safe operation of grid-forming converters during transients. Moreover, we reveal that the active power reduction and reactive power injection both enhance transient angle and voltage stability. Nevertheless, the active power reduction deteriorates frequency regulation, while the reactive power injection increases converter current stresses. Further, to mitigate these negative effects, we propose an active and reactive power co-regulation method to enhance the transient stability of grid-forming converters. Finally, simulation and experimental results verify the theoretical analysis.</description></item><item><title>An Advanced Model Predictive Control Method Based on Discrete Space Vector Modulation for Reduced Switch Counts Three-Level Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10691887</link><description>The existing model predictive control (MPC) method effectively suppresses common mode voltage (CMV) of the reduced switch counts three-level converter (RSC-TLC), but it cannot properly deal with the problem of neutral point (NP) voltage balance, fixed switching frequency (FSF) and low current ripples simultaneously. To overcome these obstacles, in this article, an advanced MPC method based on discrete space vector modulation (DSVM) for the RSC-TLC is first proposed. First, to reduce the CMV of the RSC-TLC, the CMV amplitudes of all acting voltage vectors are limited to be less than one sixth of dc-link voltage. Second, based on the switching characteristics of the RSC-TLC and the principle of DSVM, numerous virtual vectors are introduced and served as candidates to track the reference current. Third, considering NP voltage balance, the proper switching sequences with adjustable switching time are adopted to output the optimal virtual vector, which has the smallest current tracking error. Consequently, NP voltage balance and FSF with reduced current ripples are achieved to improve current quality. Furthermore, only three candidate vectors are evaluated in each predictive step, which avoids evaluating extensive virtual vectors. Meanwhile, the coordinates of candidate vectors and the switching time for both coupled module and independent module are obtained by simple algebraic calculations under gh coordinate system, so that complex trigonometric functions are avoided. As a result, the proposed MPC method is computationally efficient. Finally, the simulation and experimental results verified feasibility and correctness of the proposed MPC method. Remarkably, for the proposed MPC method, the current harmonics are less than 4%, the CMV amplitude is reduced by 50% without significant increase of calculation burden compared with the conventional MPC method.</description></item><item><title>An Axial Split Phase Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor With Wide Constant Power Speed Range and High Efficiency Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10691889</link><description>In electrical vehicles (EVs), permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) should have wide constant power speed range (CPSR), wide high efficiency region and high fault tolerant capability. However, traditional PMSMs do not both have these two characteristics. The axial split phase (ASP) PMSM with high inductance and good fault tolerant performance has been proposed and received attention in electrical vehicles (EVs). However, its performances under the whole speed range are still unclear, which is very critical for PMSM in EVs. In this article, the performance of ASP-PMSM under the whole speed range are comprehensively studied. At first, the critical factors that influence the field-weakening performance are investigated. Then, the losses of ASP-PMSM at different operating conditions are analyzed and compared with that of fractional slot concentrated winding (FSCW) motor and integral slot distributed winding (ISDW) motor by theoretical analysis and finite element analysis (FEA). It is revealed that the ASP-PMSM both have high inductance and low loss at deep field-weakening region. At last, the loss and efficiency under the whole speed range are investigated carefully by FEA. It is verified that the investigated ASP-PMSM has the characteristics of wide CPSR and high efficiency region.</description></item><item><title>Robust Adaptive Prescribed-Time Tracking Control for Variable-Speed Wind Turbines Subject to Multiple Uncertainties</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10697381</link><description>To improve the annual generation capacity and assure the operational reliability for variable-speed wind turbines (VSWTs), this article solves a challenging issue in tracking the optimal tip speed ratio within the prescribed instant of time for extracting the maximum power. The obstacle is how to make the tracking error kept within predetermined time-varying constraint on the whole time-horizon under the impact of uncertainties and external disturbances and keep the angular discrepancy between the low-speed shaft and the high-speed shaft bounded. Utilizing a time-varying constraint function constructed with tracking accuracy and the prescribed-time, we devise a continuous robust adaptive controller by incorporating adaptive laws of unknown parameters with a composite function linked to the boundary constraints. Exceeding prior tracking performance of VSWTs, the proposed scheme is able to guide the tracking error into a predefined range within a prescribed instant of time in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances while guaranteeing the global boundedness of the signals in the closed-loop system. Finally, experimental verification is conducted to showcase the superiority/practicability of the constructed approach.</description></item><item><title>Fixed Switching Frequency Control Using Trapezoidal Current Mode to Achieve ZVS in Three-Level DC&#8211;DC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10691681</link><description>Generally, the variable switching frequency method is used to operate power converters in triangular current mode (TCM) or near critical conduction mode (CRM) to achieve zero-voltage switching (ZVS). However, this approach faces significant challenges: high peak inductor current, and complex controller design due to varied digital delays in variable frequency operation. To address these challenges, this article proposes a novel fixed switching frequency control method using trapezoidal current mode (TZCM) to mitigate the inductor peak current while realizing ZVS for three-level dc&#8211;dc converters. A relationship between the average inductor current and the two duty cycles is modeled to determine the appropriate trapezoidal current shape in near-CRM. By simultaneously adjusting two duty cycles and alternating them within each switching period, ZVS is successfully achieved at a fixed switching frequency. Compared with traditional methods, the proposed method not only improves the converter efficiency, especially at light loads, but also pioneers a fixed frequency scheme for achieving ZVS applicable to all three-level dc&#8211;dc converters. The proposed control is experimentally validated on a 2 kW prototype, achieving an efficiency of 99.12%.</description></item><item><title>An Online Converter-Level Wear-Out Failure Mode Separation Method for Power Semiconductor Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10702352</link><description>Wire-bonded power semiconductor devices have two main package related wear-out modes: bond-wires lift-off and solder joint degradation. It is of importance to separate them in an operating power converter, so that the degradation point can be localized and the wear-out procedures can be monitored separately. Consequently, it enables the optimization design of package and the development of more accurate lifetime model for power semiconductor devices. This article focuses on separating the main wear-out modes when power devices are in operation. It takes two points in the output I&#8211;V characteristic of power devices through a converter-level on-state voltage measurement circuit to realize the separation of wear-out modes for all power devices in a power converter. Compared with conventional methods, it is an on-line solution and applicable to different types of power device from the view of converter-level, resulting in much simplified implementation. Finally, the proposed method is demonstrated through a single-phase inverter case study to verify its feasibility and effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>Machine Learning-Based Condition Monitoring for DC-Link Capacitors in AC/DC/AC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10695772</link><description>Power electronic converters play a pivotal role in diverse industries. Yet, reliability of these converters has been a critical concern since its early applications. Thus, this article proposes a machine learning (ML)-based condition monitoring (CM) system for dc-link capacitors (DLCs) in ac/dc/ac converters. The capacitance of DLC is chosen as the health indicator, and the power spectral density (PSD) of dc-link voltage ripple is proposed as a diagnostic tool. This technique offers resilience against measurement noise and eliminates the necessity for additional filtering techniques. Moreover, the proposed method does not require a high sampling frequency unlike the similar studies. Another notable advantage of this approach is that no additional circuitry is required, as it solely relies on the available signals. Moreover, the effectiveness of the ML-based CM system is evaluated through simulation results and an experimental validation on a laboratory prototype. The experimental results pointed out the high accuracy of the proposed CM system.</description></item><item><title>DC-to-5-MHz Wide-Output-Bandwidth High-Power High-Fidelity Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693936</link><description>Advances in power electronics have made it possible to achieve high-power levels, e.g., reaching GW in grids, or alternatively high output bandwidths, e.g., beyond MHz in communications. Achieving both simultaneously, however, remains challenging. Various applications, ranging from efficient multichannel wireless power transfer to cutting-edge medical and neuroscience applications, demand both high power and wide bandwidth. Conventional inverters can achieve high power and high quality at grid or specific frequency ranges but lose their fidelity when reaching higher output frequencies. Resonant circuits can yield a high output frequency but only a narrow bandwidth. We overcome these hardware challenges by combining gallium-nitride (GaN) transistors with modular cascaded double-H bridge circuits and control that can manage typical timing and balancing issues. We developed a compact embedded control solution that includes an improved look-up-table digital synthesizer and a novel adaptive-bias-elimination nearest-level modulation. This solution effectively solves the conflict between a high power level and high output bandwidth and can, in principle, be scaled in both dimensions, in contrast to previous approaches. Our prototype exhibits a frequency range from dc to 5 MHz with less than 18% total voltage distortion across the entire frequency spectrum while achieving a power level of 5 kVA. We demonstrated applications of the system by sweeping the output frequency and two channel-mixing trials, which included a practical magnetogenetics-oriented stimulation pulse as well as a communications message example.</description></item><item><title>A Three Degrees of Freedom Structured Resonant Galvanometer for Noninvasive Passive High-Sensitivity Monitoring</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693947</link><description>This article mainly develops a kind of three degrees of freedom (DOF) structured resonant galvanometer (abbreviated as 3DS-RGM) with high sensitivity, as a new solution to the challenge of sensor nodes for ac current monitoring. The developed 3DS-RGM is typically comprised of three coupled magnetic cantilevers, given differentiated magnetic characteristics. When ac current is applied, the detecting cantilever, any of the side ones, subjected to the maximum magnetic force, passively outputs a large amplitude signal. A passive ac current sensing theory is proposed and demonstrated by fabricating a three-cantilever prototype. A high sensitivity, up to 0.624 V/A, is experimentally obtained with an increase to 1.5 times compared to that of single DOF structured resonant galvanometer. The observed output increase in the detecting cantilever is discussed and analyzed from the viewpoint of the energy transfer contributed by the other two sensing ones. The sensitivity of the developed 3DS-RGM can be further improved by combining with other known schemes for realizing both passive and non-invasive measurement of sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) applicable to industrial fields such as frequency conversion equipment and smart grid.</description></item><item><title>Day-Ahead Solar Power Forecasting Using LightGBM and Self-Attention Based Encoder-Decoder Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10736564</link><description>The burgeoning trend of integrating renewable energy harvesters into the grid introduces critical issues for its reliability and stability. These issues arise from the stochastic and intermittent nature of renewable energy sources. Data-driven forecasting tools are indispensable in mitigating these challenges with their rugged performance. However, tools relying solely on data-driven methods often underperform when an adequate amount of recorded data is unattainable. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a novel day-ahead hybrid forecasting framework for photovoltaic applications. This framework integrates a physics-based model with Machine Learning (ML) techniques, enhancing prediction reliability in environments with scarce data. Additionally, an innovative ML pipeline is introduced for data-abundant environments. The proposed ML tool comprises two branches: a set of regressors, each tailored for specific weather conditions, and a self-attention-based encoder-decoder network. By fusing the outputs from these branches through a meta-learner, the tool achieves predictions of higher quality, as evidenced by its superior performance over benchmark models in an investigated test dataset.</description></item><item><title>Brain-Inspired Collaborative Automatic Generation Control With Large-Scale Electric Vehicles Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10738205</link><description>Distributed energy sources, loads and storage equipment have intermittent and highly random characteristics, which can cause significant frequency fluctuations when they are integrated into a distributed power grid. The current multi-agent cooperative neural networks based algorithms in the distributed power grid would suffer from catastrophic forgetting issues, which might be difficult in achieving optimal control under strong random disturbances. Hence, this paper proposes a proximal brain-inspired policy optimization (PBPO) algorithm with an orthogonal weight modification method in the weight update of the policy networks. Thus the policy network can have the brain-inspired contextual awareness capability. It can obtain faster convergence to the optimal solution of the multi-area cooperative control, mitigating heavy frequency fluctuations caused by serious random disturbances in the grid. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated via the simulation experiments on the two load frequency control models of the energy integration of large-scale electric vehicles in the grid. The proposed PBPO algorithm outperforms various reinforcement learning algorithms with faster convergence, higher frequency stability and better control performance.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Factor-Coupled, Ahead-of-Time Aggregation of Power Flexibility Under Forecast Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10738509</link><description>The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) is significantly reshaping the role of distribution systems under active energy management. To aggregate the active-reactive power flexibility of DERs dispersed at the feeder and provide capacity support to the transmission system, it is essential to efficiently identify feasible substation power injection trajectories. This paper introduces a novel ahead-of-time flexibility characterization method to address it. First, a polyhedral non-feeder-level power flexibility region (PFR) is constructed, accounting for various time-dependent, power-coupled, and forecast error uncertainties. Then, a polyhedral feeder-level PFR is analytically derived through a coordinate transformation, which can reveal the uncertainty propagation path, i.e., how uncertainty applies to the feeder-level PFR. To facilitate the high-level application, a tractable chance-constrained Chebyshev centering optimization model is further developed to find a ball-shaped inner approximation of the feeder-level PFR. Finally, the proposed method is validated on a modified IEEE 123-bus test system. Both theoretical and experimental results show that, with appropriate robustness parameter settings, the proposed method can make the approximated PFR less conservative with abundant robustness against forecast error uncertainty.</description></item><item><title>Research on Water Hammer Effect and Cooperative Frequency Regulation Technology of PV-HBESS Compensated Hydroturbine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10740062</link><description>The water hammer effect in a hydroturbine and improper setting of the PID parameters of a governor can cause a hydropower unit to provide negative damping to the corresponding hydro power generation system, affecting its frequency. Therefore, a collaborative control method using photovoltaic (PV) and hybrid battery energy storage system (HBESS) is proposed to compensate the water hammer effect. First, models for hydropower, PV, and HBESS are established. Second, a coordinated control strategy for HBESS and the PV system is presented, where the PV system employs a variable load reduction frequency regulation strategy based on power output and frequency deviation changes. The HBESS follows the state of charge, frequency change rate, and frequency deviation changes, with the supercapacitors utilizing virtual inertia control and lead-carbon batteries employing droop control to rapidly respond to the water hammer effect. Last, a control strategy based on model predictive control (MPC) optimized with a whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is proposed to manage the hydropower unit parameters and the coordinated hybrid battery energy storage system to mitigate the water hammer effect. The MPC-WOA can rapidly identify the optimal PID parameters for the hydropower unit. The proposed strategy effectively suppresses fluctuations in turbine mechanical power and system frequency. Real-time simulation on the RTLAB platform validates that the proposed control method improves system frequency adjustment time by 45.40% compared to systems without compensation and reduces power feedback fluctuations by 87.22%, significantly enhancing frequency stability against the water hammer effect.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Wind Power Prediction Based on Wind2vec-BERT Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745561</link><description>In the era of new energy development, the requirements for all aspects of short-term wind power forecasting tasks are increasing day by day. However, the power condition of wind farms is naturally stochastic and variable as it is affected by multiple factors. Current neural network approaches focus only on the propagation of unidirectional attention and ignore the interaction of input variables. To further improve the accuracy of wind power prediction, this paper explores the application of the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) algorithm in wind power prediction. At the same time, GARCH series models are used for analysis and optimization after the prediction results are obtained to address the challenges posed by the inherent variability of wind. Meanwhile, Wind2vec, a new variable embedding method for wind power forecasting tasks, is proposed which can more efficiently fit the relationship between time series forecasting variables. The parameters are subsequently fine-tuned for the backbone layer of the BERT using the Adaptive Computation Time (ACT) method to make it more adaptive to the inputs of the power sequences of the power system. By BERT's bidirectional attention mechanism and transformer architecture, and refining it for the input layer, we aim to enhance the accuracy of wind power forecasts by capturing nuanced temporal dependencies within historical wind data. Using China Southern Power Grid real datasets demonstrates the effectiveness and correctness of the BERT-GARCH-M-based model in outperforming traditional forecasting methods. This research not only shows the adaptability of BERT to wind power prediction but also contributes to advancing the precision and reliability of renewable energy forecasts, paving the way for more sustainable energy utilization in the evolving landscape of new energy paradigms.</description></item><item><title>Cooperative Control for DFIG-Based Wind Turbine Generation System Covering All Operating Regions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745778</link><description>This paper addresses the multiple control problems over the whole wind speed range for the wind turbine generation system (WTGS), including the safety constraints on the rotational speed and the mechanical power, and the maximum power point tracking, by proposing a novel estimator-based cooperative control scheme for doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) and wind turbine. Firstly, we develop a global estimator to obtain precisely the unmeasurable shift-area turbine speed, which is effective for all wind speed zones and is employed to support the decision-making of the actual operating region and the desired reference signals. Secondly, based on this, a nonlinear adaptive DFIG controller and a pitch angle controller are designed to track the reference point, which ensures the completeness of the control tasks of the corresponding identified operating region. Thirdly, we apply the universal barrier Lyapunov function to the control synthesis of DFIG to impose the physical security constraints with any adjustable safety margin on WTGS. The superiority of the proposed framework is evaluated comparatively on the detailed WTGS model using multiple Monte Carlo simulations with three kinds of stochastic wind speed processes.</description></item><item><title>Pitch Control Scheme Considering Entire Dynamics and Full-Load Region in PMSG-Based Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10747229</link><description>Large-scale wind turbines (WTs) are built with light-strength materials, which would otherwise cost more than the economic benefits of power generation. Hence, these turbines with huge rotors and slender towers are more exposed to external forces such as gust winds and the wake effect during their operational lifetime. This paper strives to establish a bridge between the design principles of the pitch control system (PCS) and the inherent dynamics of the drivetrain, blades, and tower in a grid-tied 5MW PMSG-based WT. Based on this purpose, the dynamic representation of the PCS is described in more detail, then the pitch controller is designed based on the complete dynamic model of the WT using a gain-scheduled PI controller to be capable of providing desirable dynamical performance throughout the pitch actuation region. The parameters of the proposed controller are calculated according to the current operating point of the WT with the aim of ensuring the acceptable stability margin and reducing the WT loading as much as possible. The controller design process is accomplished by analyzing the linearized dynamic model of the PCS under various scenarios using responses resulting from the frequency domain, polar coordinate, and modal analysis. Finally, nonlinear simulations illustrate that the intended pitch controller has a superior response over the traditional PI controllers.</description></item><item><title>A Robust Photovoltaic Power Forecasting Method Based on Multimodal Learning Using Satellite Images and Time Series</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10747271</link><description>Ultra-short-term photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting holds significant importance in enhancing grid stability. Most PV power forecasting methods based on satellite images rely on pixel-level predictions, which are inefficient and redundant. Meanwhile, current deep-learning approaches struggle to establish correlations between large-scale cloud features and PV generation patterns. In this paper, an end-to-end model based on multimodal learning is proposed for directly obtaining multi-step PV power forecasts from satellite images and time series. To capture cloud dynamics and features within the region of interest (RoI), ConvLSTM-RICNN is utilized to encode satellite images. To mitigate the impact of noise and missing data in PV power, a robust fusion approach named DCCA-LF is introduced. This approach integrates deep canonical correlation analysis (DCCA) into late fusion (LF) to strengthen cross-modal feature alignment. The proposed model is verified using publicly available data from BP Solar in Alice Springs and Himawari-8, from January 1, 2020, to October 8, 2022. Comparison with current state-of-the-art research shows that the suggested model achieves the best RMSE and MAE with minimal complexity across all cloud conditions. Moreover, the proposed approach is robust to noise and missing data.</description></item><item><title>System Strength Constrained Grid-Forming Energy Storage Planning in Renewable Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10747388</link><description>With more inverter-based renewable energy resources replacing synchronous generators, the system strength of modern power networks significantly decreases, which may induce small-signal stability (SS) issues. It is commonly acknowledged that grid-forming (GFM) converter-based energy storage systems (ESSs) enjoy the merits of flexibility and effectiveness in enhancing system strength, but how to simultaneously consider the economic efficiency and system-strength support capability in the planning stage remains unexplored. To bridge the research gap, this paper develops a system strength constrained optimal planning approach of GFM ESSs to achieve a desired level of SS margin. To this end, the influence of GFM ESS power capacities and locations on the system strength is firstly quantified based on the framework of generalized short-circuit ratio. On this basis, system strength constrained optimal placement and sizing of GFM ESSs is formulated into optimization problems with eigenvalue constraints. Two practical scenarios with and without a limit on the number of selected sites are considered. Finally, quadratic support function based iterative optimization approaches are developed to address the planning problems. Case studies in the modified IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus systems validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches under different scenarios by comparing with two other benchmarks.</description></item><item><title>Machine Learning-Accelerated Method for Real-Time Optimization of Micro Energy-Water-Hydrogen Nexus</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752353</link><description>This paper explores the micro Energy-Water- Hydrogen (m-EWH) nexus, an engineering system designed to reduce carbon emissions in the power sector. The m-EWH nexus leverages renewable energy sources (RES) to produce hydrogen via electrolysis, which is then combined with carbon captured from fossil fuel power plants to mitigate emissions. To address the uncertainty challenges posed by RES, this paper proposes a real-time decision-making framework for the m-EWH nexus, which requires the rapid solution of large-scale mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) problems. To this end, we develop a machine learning-accelerated solution method for real-time optimization (MARO), comprising three key modules: (1) an active constraint and integer variable prediction module that rapidly solves MICP problems using historical optimization data; (2) an optimal strategy selection module based on feasibility ranking to ensure solution feasibility; and (3) a feature space extension and refinement module to improve solution accuracy by generating new features and refining existing ones.

To address the issue, this study proposes a novel virtuality-reality combination control scheme for WF dynamic maximum power generation control (DMPGC). The wind speed in VWF is calculated by wake model without time delay, thus the future state information corresponding to the current freestream wind speed of RWF can be obtained in advance. To ensure consistency of state information between RWF and VWF, meanwhile to enhance the precision of WF optimization model, a wake model dynamic calibration method is proposed to improve the prediction accuracy of wake wind speed. Thereafter, an active wake control strategy based on calibrated wake model is implemented to maximize the total power generation of VWF, and the optimal control commands are delay dispatched to RWF according to the wake delay time. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves calculation accuracy of wake model, increases total power generation and owns better fatigue load distribution of WF under different wind conditions.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Affine Arithmetic-Based Optimal Dispatch Method for Active Distribution Networks With Uncertainties of Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752418</link><description>Affine Arithmetic (AA) is an effective interval analysis method for addressing uncertainties in power systems. However, previous research on AA-based optimization problems has struggled to accurately capture the uncertainties associated with electric vehicles (EVs) and the cumulative impact of uncertainties on energy storage systems (ESSs). Moreover, the reformulated AA model presents a significant computational challenge due to the high number of variables and constraints. This study proposes an efficient AA-based economic dispatch (AAED) method for active distribution networks incorporating EVs and ESSs while accounting for uncertainties. Specifically, an EV charging load-interval (CLI) model is developed to effectively capture the randomness of plug-in/plug-out times and initial/target energy. A confidence level is defined to prevent excessive conservatism in the CLI model. An ESS model is also formulated within the AA domain to address the cumulative impact of persistent uncertainty, ensuring an accurate state of charge monitoring. To enhance the computational efficiency of the AAED model without sacrificing accuracy, a fast-solving strategy is introduced. This strategy involves eliminating many state variables and constraints and replacing them with derived analytical partial deviation formulations that map the relationship between state and decision variables. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model and method.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Fault Ride-Through Capability of DFIG-Based WECS Using Dynamic Reconfiguration Hybrid Interlinking Transformer Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752838</link><description>The abnormal grid voltages, such as sags, swells, and harmonics caused by grid faults, seriously threaten the safe operation of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind energy conversion system (WECS). To enhance the fault ride-through (FRT) capability of DFIG and improve the converter capacity utilization, this paper proposes a novel DFIG-based WECS using a dynamic reconfiguration hybrid interlinking transformer (DR-HIT) technique for performance improvement under grid faults. Multiple operating modes and flexible switching strategies were developed based on the analysis of the proposed topology and principles. The proposed DR-HIT approach smooths the DFIG &#8217;s output power fluctuations through the cooperative control of the multifunctional converter (MFC) and grid-side converter (GSC) in shunt mode when the grid voltage is stable. Upon the occurrence of a grid voltage fault, the DR-HIT flexibly switches from shunt mode to series mode, maintaining the terminal voltage at a constant value. Additionally, once grid voltage recovers, the DR-HIT reverts flexibly to its shunt mode. Finally, simulations and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve accurate control of the system and flexible switching between different modes.</description></item><item><title>Cooperative Strategies for Frequency Control of Wind Turbines to Mitigate Secondary Frequency Dip: Coefficient Allocation and Exit Techniques</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752840</link><description>With the increasing integration of wind power into the power system, the incorporation of wind turbines into the grid's primary frequency regulation through inertia and droop control has been proven effective. However, a phenomenon known as secondary frequency dip (SFD) occurs when wind generators exit frequency regulation to restore the turbines&#8217; speeds. This paper introduces a cooperative approach to mitigate SFD. Initially, a system frequency response model is established, incorporating the combined effects of synchronous generators and wind turbines. Subsequently, a model to forecast the rotational speed of each wind turbine in response to load changes is developed. Based on these models, the droop and inertia coefficients of different turbines in a wind farm are optimized to minimize overall wind energy loss during frequency regulation, thereby alleviating SFD, while ensuring the rotational speed remains within a safe range. Additionally, a smooth transition strategy based on a low-pass filter is proposed to prevent an abrupt decrease in active power as turbines exit frequency regulation. Finally, to prevent a simultaneous drop in active power among a large number of wind turbines, a sequential exit strategy from frequency regulation is proposed. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in mitigating SFD.</description></item><item><title>Frequency and Voltage Disturbances Ride-Through Control Strategy for PV Power Plants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10755119</link><description>Large-scale photovoltaic power plants (PVPP) are being rapidly integrated to power systems worldwide. However, large penetration of PVPP will affect the frequency and voltage stabilities, especially for a weak power grid during individual and simultaneous disturbances. This paper introduces an adaptive control strategy for PVPP to accurately comply with grid code requirements and achieve fast frequency support (FFS) and enhanced low voltage ride-through (LVRT) performance during simultaneous disturbances events (SDE). The proposed control strategy relies on the support priority scheme for the grid frequency and voltage based on real-time measurements. An adaptive active power ramp rate (AAPRR) function imposed on the active power control loop of the PVPP is used to realize the simultaneous frequency and voltage support. Moreover, the voltage support is enhanced using a voltage regulation scheme that supports the voltage recovery post-fault without exceeding the PVPP inverter power headroom. The proposed control strategy demonstrates superior performance in enhancing the transient voltage and frequency responses when the power grid is subjected to consecutive and simultaneous disturbance events. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified using the OPAL-RT real-time simulator test bench.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Approach to Determine and Maintain Area-Wise Minimum Inertia in Renewable Energy Dominated Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10758198</link><description>The rapid displacement of synchronous generators by increased penetration of inverter-based resources (IBR) in power system areas that are potentially rich in renewable energy can lead to spatial non-uniform distribution of synchronous inertia. Consequently, even if the overall minimum inertia (MI) of the system is maintained, certain areas may experience stability issues, which would breach grid-code limits for the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) following a contingency. Given this context, a method to determine the MI that is specific to individual areas is introduced. Additionally, a method for redistributing surplus inertia from high-inertia areas to low inertia areas is introduced by reducing electrical distance between the nodes. This approach utilizes green corridors, which are additional transmission lines that are established to evacuate surplus renewable power to the areas with higher demand and fossil-fueled-based generation, as pathways to transfer inertia. Furthermore, a machine-learning-assisted technique to compensate for shortfall in area-wise MI by placing new synchronous inertia compensators is proposed. Using this method, system operators can identify the location and size of synchronous or virtual inertia that may be required. The amount of additionally required inertia is quantified by the size of synchronous inertia compensators, to uphold area-specific RoCoF in renewable energy-integrated power systems. The proposed methodology is tested and validated in the modified IEEE-39 bus system.</description></item><item><title>Dual-Stage MPC-Based AGC for Wind Farm Considering Aerodynamic Interactions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10757357</link><description>The wind farms are encouraged to provide Automatic Generation Control (AGC) services for the power grid. However, the complex aerodynamic interactions between turbines complicate the control of wind farms for AGC service. To address this issue, this paper proposes an explicit wind speed prediction model of each wind turbine based on the control actions of thrust coefficient (mainly realized by adjusting pitch angle) and yaw angle. Its accuracy is validated by numerical experiment based on Navier-Stokes equations. Since the adjustments of the thrust coefficients and yaw angles involve significantly different time scales, a dual-stage model predictive control (MPC) is proposed to coordinate them. It uses the proposed explicit wind speed prediction model as a surrogate for the wind speed of each turbine. In the first stage, it optimizes yaw angle reference based on whether or not the available wind farm power is sufficient at the predicted moments. In the second stage, it controls both thrust coefficient and yaw angle of each turbine, in order to track the AGC power signal and align the yaw angles with those determined in the first stage. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the dual-stage MPC for AGC power tracking of wind farm.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Control Strategy for Enhancing System Stability in Weak Grids by Mitigating Additional Disturbance Components from PLL</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10758341</link><description>Wind and photovoltaic power plants connected to weak grids can bring stability problems. The grid-connected inverter is an important connection port between the renewable energy and the grid. Some studies have indicated that the phase-locked loop (PLL) controller of the inverter can play a significant role in causing stability issues in weak grids. In this paper, a small-signal model of a phase-locked loop with complex variables is established. Then, the influence of phase-locked loop on system stability is analyzed. It is found that the presence of the PLL introduces additional disturbance components into the inverter control loop, resulting in a decrease in system stability. To mitigate the influence, a control strategy is proposed that involves injecting opposite disturbance components into the control loop to counteract the additional disturbance components. The proposed control strategy effectively improves the system stability. In addition, when compared to existing methods for enhancing stability, such as reducing the bandwidth of the PLL, the proposed method demonstrates a good dynamic response. The simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Contribution of PV Generation With Embedded Battery Storage to Capacity Adequacy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10766632</link><description>This paper proposes a real-time redispatch method for including PV-plus-battery plants in resource adequacy assessment (RAA) studies. The method offers the possibility to represent the market operation of the assets, while at the same time considering their response to reliability events, unlike existing methods in the literature that manage such assets in a single-dimensional manner, driven solely by adequacy contribution considerations or entirely ignoring this capability. In the proposed method, while the plant is initially dispatched in a market-oriented manner, i.e., with the objective of maximizing market revenues, its actual operation is adapted to meet system needs when reliability events take place. The method is incorporated into a Monte Carlo (MC) based RAA model in a computationally efficient manner, relying on a deterministic implementation of redispatching that does not impact significantly the computational burden of the RAA model, thus enabling the execution of multiple MC samples to achieve a high stochastic process accuracy. A merit order algorithm is also embedded into the RAA model to evaluate the PV-plus-battery market revenues. The model developed allows a refined calculation of the capacity value (CV) of such assets for different plant configurations and inverter loading ratios, while the upper and lower CV bounds are approximated via application of the adequacy- and market-oriented approaches available in the literature. Results show that the embedded storage energy capacity is crucial for the CV afforded by the assets, while any decrease in the inverter capacity does not significantly impact the CV value. Further, the CV of storage embedded in tightly coupled PV-plus-battery plants, where batteries are exclusively charged by the plant's own PV generation, is generally lower than the value of similar stand-alone storages operating without any charging constraints.</description></item><item><title>Adversarial Constraint Learning for Robust Dispatch of Distributed Energy Resources in Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10766908</link><description>The variability of renewables and power demands poses significant challenges for the dispatch of distributed energy resources (DERs) in distribution networks, as they often introduce uncertainties that may lead to power flow constraint violations. Robust optimization (RO) is a powerful tool for managing the operational risks caused by these uncertainties. However, solving robust DER dispatch problems is nontrivial since the non-convex AC power flow constraints prevent the use of strong duality to find deterministic counterparts. To this end, this paper proposes adversarial constraint learning that can provide linear surrogates for robust dispatch problems. This method begins by designing a gradient-based adversarial attack process to identify the worst-case constraint violations. A &#8220;teacher&#8221; model is trained in advance to enable rapid gradient calculations during this attack process. Under the teacher's supervision, two &#8220;student&#8221; models are then trained to predict the worst-case violation from candidate dispatch decisions and nominal operating conditions (i.e., renewable generation and power demands). These student models are further reformulated into equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) forms and serve as computationally efficient surrogates for the original robust dispatch problems. Simulations across various operating conditions and test systems demonstrate that our method can achieve desirable feasibility, low suboptimality, and high online computational efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Online Stream-Driven Energy Management in Microgrids Using Recurrent Neural Networks and SustainaBoost Augmentation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10768873</link><description>In recent years, the operation of microgrids (MG) has faced increasing challenges due to the growing penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) and the integration of electric vehicles (EVs), which introduce significant uncertainties in power supply and demand dynamics. In response, neural network-based approaches emerge as promising solutions, adept at handling vast databases and learning diverse patterns for real-time decision-making. This paper proposes an online stream-driven energy management strategy for efficient grid-connected MG power management and cost minimization. The strategy considers the presence of EVs and RES, while also addressing the impact of noisy data. The strategy incorporates a recurrent neural network (RNN) to learn from time-series data and make real-time decisions. Additionally, an augmentation technique called SustainaBoost (SB) is introduced, designed to boost system sustainability and enhance the training quality of neural networks. The proposed RNN achieves 98.7% optimality in minimizing the operational costs of the MG on the test dataset.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Bilevel Optimization Model for Distribution Network With Demand Response Under Uncertain Renewables Using Wasserstein Metrics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10771664</link><description>We consider a distribution network integrating demand response (DR) participants in the presence of uncertain renewable suppliers and outdoor temperatures. A bilevel optimization model is proposed to capture the intricate dynamics between price-incentivized DR participants and distribution system operations, including energy procurement and active/reactive power flows. The model is formulated as a distributional robust bilevel optimization using Wasserstein metrics. We show favorable data-driven properties including out-of-sample guarantee and asymptotic consistency. Furthermore, we present a tractable mixed-integer linear programming reformulation and characterize the worst-case distribution. Computational experiments are conducted on a modified 33-bus system. Our findings underscore the efficacy of the pricing strategies derived from the proposed bilevel optimization model. These strategies not only effectively manage DR participants' behavior but also bring equity considerations among households with various characteristics to light. The results contribute to a deeper understanding of the interplay between distribution system operators and DR participants.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Objective Performance Enhancement of Offshore Wind Turbines Through Planning Controller Parameter: A &#8216;Plan-Control&#8217; Hierarchical Controller</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10772167</link><description>Large-scale offshore wind turbines (OWTs) are manufactured with pronounced flexible structures and operated in complex wind-wave coupled environment, thereby imposing high demands on the controller performance. Existing advanced control strategies have altered the architecture of industry-standard controller, hindering their application in industrial projects. This study aims to propose a novel &#8216;Plan-Control&#8217; Hierarchical Controller (PCHC) for OWTs, with the inner &#8216;Control&#8217; loop utilizing an industry-standard controller and the outer &#8216;Plan&#8217; loop integrating a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC)-based planner. For the inner loop, the controller provides reference signals of generator torque and blade pitch to actuators of OWTs, with controller parameters, optimal constant in torque control and proportional-integral (PI) gains in pitch control, being transferred from the planner. For the outer loop, an NMPC-based planner determines controller parameters by solving multi-objective optimization formulations with variable prediction horizons. Interestingly, NMPC-based planner does not operate as often as controller in PCHC, but compensates for the residual error, arising from the mismatch of state-space model in the multi-step prediction process, by Gaussian Process regression. A cost function is jointly formulated to suppress mechanical power and rotor speed fluctuations, reduce structural loads, and restrict actuators' actions, with weighting factors tuned online and robustly. Finally, the multi-objective performance enhancement of the PCHC in power and speed stability, and structural load mitigations is demonstrated utilizing aero-hydro-servo-elasto-soil simulations with actual wind-wave environmental conditions. The PCHC maintains the architecture of the industrial-standard controller, thus smoothing the way for its implementation in industrial projects of OWTs.</description></item><item><title>Internal Energy Distribution Control Based Fault Ride-Through and Postfault Recovery Strategy for Offshore Wind Farms Connected to DR-MMC HVDC Under Onshore AC Grid Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10772121</link><description>Offshore wind farms (OWF) connected to diode rectifier (DR) and modular multilevel converter (MMC)-based HVDC confront challenges of surplus power induced by onshore AC faults. This paper proposes an internal energy distribution control (IEDC) strategy, which utilizes the rotor kinetic energy (KE) of wind turbines (WT) and the capacitor energy of MMC submodules to achieve fault ride-through (FRT) and postfault recovery (PFR). Firstly, the mechanism of OWF is analyzed, and an onshore AC fault detection method based on local measurements is proposed. Then, a two-stage FRT control strategy is proposed. Three preset power reduction and energy absorption curves are designed to utilize the internal energy to actively absorb excess power, and flexibly distribute surplus power to KE and MMC energy. An additional pitch angle control (APAC) is devised, which can reduce captured wind power and eliminate surplus power when the internal energy reaches its maximum value. Thirdly, a two-stage PFR control strategy is proposed. The preset power and energy recovery curves are designed to achieve fast active power recovery and release of stored excess internal energy after fault clearance. Case studies are performed on 2-terminal and 4-terminal test systems to validate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Area-Multi-Stage Based Self-Healing Distribution Network Planning and Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10787104</link><description>Extreme events such as earthquakes, floods, or wars could cause severe grid faults and large-scale outages in the distribution network. The active islanding technology can be used for self-healing of multiple outage areas with distributed resources, smart distribution facilities, and advanced controlling methods. The facilities related to the self-healing consist of relays, switches, distributed resources, and power electronics based soft open points (SOPs). However, the self-healing effect depends on not only the location, capability, and function of these facilities, but also the recovery process should be comprehensively considered and coordinated since the multi-stage recovery strategies are deeply coupled. These recovery stages usually consist of the relaying process, grid partition with smart switches (SSWs), resupply by distributed resources, and interconnection with SOPs. For the first time, this paper proposes a multi-area-multi-stage (MAMS) self-healing recovery area (RA) planning-operation collaborative approach considering the recovery sequence. First, the multiple self-healing stages of flexible RAs are defined and introduced. Second, the time-variant topological and operational constraints are proposed to represent the coupling relationships at different stages. Finally, the hybrid controllable load deployment strategy is used to compensate for the limited resource capacity in RA restoration. The effectiveness of the proposed collaborative model is verified by illustrative case studies.</description></item><item><title>Tube-Based Linear Parameter-Varying Model Predictive Control for Wind Energy Conversion Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10787116</link><description>Maximum power extraction and transfer from wind energy conversion systems (WECS) to the power grid depends on a high-performance control system. This paper proposes a robust tube-based linear parameter-varying (LPV) model predictive controller (MPC) for rotor speed and stator's active and reactive power control of a Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) based WECS. The turbine dynamics and the DFIG is modeled as a single LPV system, which enables the model transformation into an equivalent linear time-invariant (LTI) system to avoid online updates of the prediction matrix. Based on the LTI representation, a tube-based LPV MPC (TLPVMPC) is developed, consisting of a tracking nominal MPC with tightened constraint sets and a disturbance controller. In the proposed method, the disturbance upper bound is estimated by Kalman filtering, which provides less conservative performance. The proposed controller is compared to sliding mode control (SMC), LPVMPC and nonlinear MPC (NMPC) methods. Simulations are conducted under model uncertainties and partial faults in the DFIG control voltages. The results show the robust performance of the proposed controller in power extraction and reduction of mechanical stress build-up compared to the other control methods.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Voltage Control of Inverter-Based DG in Active Distribution Networks With Measurement-Strategy Mapping Matrix</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10795660</link><description>The high penetration of distributed generators (DGs) has exacerbated voltage violations in active distribution networks (ADNs). The sensitivity, as the law between nodal power injection and state variation, can be used to develop DG strategies. However, due to the nonlinearity, the accurate description and efficient application of sensitivity have become an important challenge in the establishment of DG control strategy. In this paper, an adaptive voltage control strategy for DGs is developed based on ADN sensitivity. First, the measurement-strategy mapping matrix is established to describe the complex time-varying sensitivity. The sensitivity between nodal voltage and reactive power is described as discrete matrix elements, which are generated based on the Koopman operator. Then, an adaptive voltage control model is built based on the measurement-strategy mapping matrix, in which the lifted linear decision rule (LLDR) is introduced to continue the discrete matrix elements as a couple of constraints. Efficient formulation of DG strategies is realized in a data-driven manner based on ADN sensitivity. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated using the IEEE 33-node system, practical 53-node system, and IEEE 123-node system. The proposed strategy can effectively cope with voltage problems while enhancing the adaptability to variations in practical operation.</description></item><item><title>Planning of Stationary-Mobile Integrated Battery Energy Storage Systems Under Severe Convective Weather</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10806563</link><description>Under extreme weather events represented by severe convective weather (SCW), the adaptability of power system and service restoration have become paramount. To this end, this paper presents a novel planning method of stationary-mobile integrated battery energy storage system (SMI-BESS) capable of spatial flexibility. This designed system can flexibly switch between stationary and mobile modes to cope with normal operation and extreme weather events. Considering the multitude of threats posed of SCW, such as extreme wind speed, lightning strikes, and hail, a comprehensive fragility model of the distribution network is established to quantify adverse impacts of the extreme event. Uncertainties in renewable energy generation and distribution network failures are characterized using two types of ambiguity sets. A two-stage adaptive distributionally robust optimization (2S-ADRO) model is developed to plan the SMI-BESS in detail, meeting the requirements of mobile energy storage. Finally, case studies are conducted using weather and grid data from some regions in China to validate the effectiveness of the proposed structure and method.</description></item><item><title>DC Collector System Layout Optimization for Offshore Wind Farm With SPP Topology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10804676</link><description>With the rapid development of global offshore wind power, the scale and capacity of offshore wind farms (OWF) are continuously expanding, making it crucial to enhance the overall economic efficiency of OWFs. However, previous studies on DC collector systems of OWFs mainly focus on the DC series-parallel (SP) topology, which escalates the overall costs. To optimize the collector system layout, this paper proposes a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) based framework for improving the overall economic efficiency by leveraging an advanced DC series-parallel-parallel (SPP) topology. In the proposed framework, a hierarchical open-loop multiple travelling salesman problem (HOMTSP) is utilized to model the SPP topology, decomposing the collector system layout optimization (CSLO) problem into sub-problems for resolution. Subsequently, a hierarchical double Q-learning (DQL) is employed to solve these sub-problems, with a topology-guided mechanism to refine the routing results and correct crossed cables by incorporating topological characteristics. Furthermore, this study acquires the GIS data and the connection scheme of wind turbines in a real OWF for the case study. Numerical results show the SPP-based framework significantly improves the economic efficiency compared to the DC SP topology and the AC double-sided ring topology.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Design for Switchable Grid-Following and Grid-Forming Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10811873</link><description>This paper presents the design of a novel grid-forming (GFM) control structure adapted from a typical grid-following (GFL) control structure with minimal edits, thereby enabling a switchable control structure for voltage sourced converters (VSCs) to operate in either GFL or GFM mode by simply switching a flag manually. The VSC is shown to be able to operate in the GFL control mode synchronizing to the main grid through a phase-locked-loop (PLL) and operate as a GFM controller with power-based synchronization for both grid-connected and islanded conditions. To guarantee smooth operation, the control schemes and the mode switching logic have been carefully designed and examined via a series of experiments. The experiment results show that the switchable control structure can fulfill the desired control and operation functions and enable smooth transition between control modes.</description></item><item><title>Intraday Wind Power Forecasting by Ensemble of Overlapping Historical Numerical Weather Predictions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10812675</link><description>The numerical weather prediction (NWP) is crucial to improve intraday wind power forecasting (WPF) accuracy. However, conventional WPF methods relied solely on a latest reported single NWP, overlooking hidden information from sequentially reported multiple historical NWPs that are partially overlapped over time. Additionally, it's challenging to tackle intraday WPF as it involves both ultra-short-term and short-term horizons with different characteristics. Therefore, a novel spatio-temporal representation learning network is proposed for intraday WPF by ensemble of overlapping historical NWPs. Initially, an integrated mask-reconstruction representation learning pretraining strategy is employed to extract hidden representations of historical wind power measurements and overlapping historical NWPs, providing contextual information for the subsequent intraday WPF task. Then, the output layer is trained and end-to-end fine-tuning of the entire network is conducted to adapt to the specific forecasting task. Moreover, a multi-task learning strategy based on hard parameter sharing is adopted to ensure balanced predictive accuracy across each of forecasted wind farms. Case study and detailed ablation tests based on 5 real-world wind farms demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the forecasting accuracy of most wind farms by leveraging spatio-temporal correlation, achieving the best average performance across all time horizons compared to the baseline models.</description></item><item><title>Event-Triggered H-Infinity Pitch Control for Floating Offshore Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10820839</link><description>The complex wind and wave environment can lead to increased external disturbances and power fluctuations of floating offshore wind turbines, posing a significant challenge to their stable operation.

Then, the event-triggered control strategy is introduced into the H-infinity pitch control of floating offshore wind turbines. Based on this, a criterion for the asymptotic stability and H-infinity norm boundedness of floating offshore wind turbines is derived. Furthermore, an algorithm is presented for designing feedback gain matrices of the event-triggered H-infinity pitch control, which can effectively reduce the update frequency of the controller. Finally, a simulation is conducted on the IEA 15 MW Reference Wind Turbine by integrating OpenFAST with MATLAB/Simulink. The simulation results provide a comparative analysis of the event-triggered H-infinity pitch control strategy and the continuous-time pitch control strategy, demonstrating the superiority of the method proposed in this paper.</description></item><item><title>Frequency Constrained Dispatch With Energy Reserve and Virtual Inertia From Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10840325</link><description>With the increasing penetration of wind power and gradual retirement of conventional generating units (CGUs), wind turbines (WTs) become promising resources to provide steady-state energy reserve (ER) and frequency support for the grid to facilitate supply-demand balance and frequency security. In this regard, a novel frequency constrained dispatch framework with ER and virtual inertia from WTs is proposed. Firstly, this paper establishes the WT model with both ER and virtual inertia, whose energy sources are WT's deloading and rotor kinetic energy, respectively. Secondly, the system frequency response and CGUs' power response are derived while considering WTs exiting inertia response at frequency nadir. Then, this paper develops a stochastic-optimization-based frequency constrained dispatch model, where both WTs' frequency regulation parameters and rotor speeds are decision variables, so that the coupling between WT's mechanical and electrical parts and the coupling between system's transient dynamics and steady-state operation can be fully reflected. Finally, convex hull relaxation, convex hull approximation and deep neural networks are used to transform the original nonlinear model into a mixed-integer second-order cone programming model. Case studies on the 118-bus system verify the effectiveness of the proposed models and methods.</description></item><item><title>Secondary Frequency Regulation From Aggregated Distributed Photovoltaics: A Dynamic Flexibility Aggregation Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10840304</link><description>To fully utilize the potential of massive small-scale distributed photovoltaics (DPVs) for secondary frequency regulation (SFR), this article introduces a hierarchical coordination framework that incorporates the dynamic response characteristic (DRC) of DPV to automatic generation control (AGC) signals, thereby reflecting the dynamic flexibility of the aggregated DPVs (ADPVs). First, a reserved power feasible range is derived for scheduling the power reserve control (PRC) scheme considering the uncertainty in PV generation and the de-loaded margin base constraint. Second, a two-stage multi-cluster DRC aggregation method that considers the impact of the PRC scheme is developed to describe the equivalent DRC of the ADPVs. Last, the article constructs an integrated cost function (ICF) that reveals the interdependencies between SFR capacity, equivalent DRC and regulation cost, which enables the decoupled scheduling of the SFR indices and the PRC scheme. An event-triggered duty factor reassignment mechanism is further proposed to improve the reliability of SFR service deployment in case of unexpected events. Simulation results indicate that the framework is an efficient approach for quantifying, trading and realizing the dynamic flexibility of the ADPVs.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Scheduling and Commercial Testbed-Based Verification of Integrated PV-ESS Systems Considering Settlement Rules in South Korea</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10842237</link><description>This article proposes an optimal scheduling algorithm for an integrated PV-ESS system to maximize the overall revenue from both system marginal price (SMP) and renewable energy certificate (REC), considering detailed settlement rules in South Korea.

Comparing with the classic Lyapunov methods and equal-area methods, the proposed method does not require either detailed analytical expressions of the entire system or real-time fault detection and high-speed communication, which fundamentally creates a novel idea for distributed synchronous stabilization control.

Secondly, a customized MFG method with dynamic granulation division is proposed for encouraging very large-scale DERs to spontaneously respond to the peak regulation instructions from VPP while achieving dynamic allocation of peak-regulation revenue. Brouwer fixed-point theorem and contraction mapping theorem are used to prove the existence and uniqueness of the mean field equilibrium (MFE) of the formulated MFG, and &#1013;-Nash property of MFE is validated based on the Lipschitz continuity condition. Furthermore, an accelerated decentralized solution algorithm is developed to rapidly search MFE, exhibiting good scalability. Comparative studies have validated the superiority of the proposed methodology on incentive compatibility and decomposition efficiency of the VPP's peak-regulation instructions.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Objective Bi-Level LVRT Control Strategy for Two-Stage PV Grid-Connected System Under Asymmetrical Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10858433</link><description>With the increasing integration of photovoltaics (PV) into power systems, the low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) control of PV grid-connected systems is drawing significant attention. This paper presents a multi-objective bi-level LVRT control strategy for the two-stage PV grid-connected system to maximize the positive and negative sequence voltage support capability while ensuring safe operation under asymmetrical faults. The AC level controls the grid side inverter, while the DC level regulates the boost converter. The grid voltage support control strategy is implemented at the AC level to support the positive and negative sequence voltage of the point of common coupling. Considering there is an inherent contradiction between grid voltage support with the overcurrent of inverter and DC voltage oscillation, the current references are automatically adjusted to facilitate the maximum positive and negative voltage support while limiting the overcurrent and oscillation of DC-link voltage. Based on the power reference shared from the AC level, the DC level regulates the boost converter to stabilize the DC-link voltage speedily by utilizing the compensation current. Finally, simulations and experiments demonstrate the voltage support capability and fast dynamic response characteristics of DC-link voltage in different scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Peak Shaving Control for a Virtual Synchronous Generator in Island Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10749988</link><description>A virtual synchronous generator (VSG) can be considered a voltage source with an emulated inertial response. Depending on the grid condition, however, it is necessary to limit the output current, which renders the inverter dynamics and makes the inverter prone to losing synchronism with the grid. To address this well-known challenge, in this article, we propose a novel control method for a VSG that can achieve current limiting with stability. We describe the proposed VSG with block diagrams and validate its control responses with transfer functions. The proposed VSG can be useful to enhance the frequency stability of an island grid, which is more vulnerable to disturbances by nature than a large interconnected system. We use a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) setup for further validation. Using the HIL environment, we test the proposed VSG in an island system operating with diesel generators for generator trips, low-frequency oscillations, and voltage sags. We also test the VSG in a single-inverter-infinite-bus setup to evaluate its transient stability and compare it to ones with conventional current-limiting methods. Although the current limiting shaves the peak power of the VSG, it ensures continuous inertial and damping responses without compromising stability.</description></item><item><title>Performance-Guaranteed Finite-Time Secondary Control for Islanded AC Microgrids With Time-Varying Disturbances</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829834</link><description>This paper investigates distributed finite-time secondary control of islanded AC microgrids with prescribed performance subject to time-varying disturbances. By specifying the desired performance function, the transient and steady-state performances (including the convergence rate, the maximum overshoot, and the maximum steady-state error) of both the voltage and frequency restoration processes are considered in the design phase. Given the microgrid modeling inaccuracies and load-switching effects, the time-varying disturbances lump unmodeled dynamics, parameter perturbations, and exogenous load disturbances. A novel control scheme, which consists of two main parts, is established. In the first part, reference signal generators are constructed to produce the restoration references in a finite time for each power unit. In the second part, with the observer-based disturbance rejection technique and the prescribed performance control philosophy, performance-guaranteed finite-time secondary controllers are designed such that the finite-time restoration task with the prescribed performance is fulfilled, and the time-varying disturbance rejection is achieved. Rigorous stability analysis and case studies are conducted to verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.</description></item><item><title>Coordination of Smart Hybrid Transformers in Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10770240</link><description>A hybrid transformer is a combination of a conventional transformer and power electronics, which can be used to help alleviate power quality issues in distribution networks at lower costs than solid-state transformers. This paper proposes a novel method of coordinating multiple hybrid transformers in 3-phase distribution networks in order to reduce the curtailment of distributed generators. This is accomplished through the use of sequential linear programming, key features of which include accounting for the nonlinear voltage control capabilities of hybrid transformers, and managing the nonlinear constraints of hybrid transformer power electronics. Test cases were carried out in a modified unbalanced version of the IEEE 69-Bus network and a reduced version of the European Low Voltage test feeder. Test case results demonstrate that hybrid transformers can substantially increase the utilisation of distributed generators.</description></item><item><title>Frequency Constrained Proactive Scheduling for Secure Microgrid Formation in Wind Power Penetrated Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10819485</link><description>Microgrid formation (MF) is a core solution for increasing the resilience of distribution systems in extreme situations. However, a significant power imbalance at the MF onset will result in the violation of dynamic frequency constraints, especially in low-inertia wind power penetrated distribution systems (WPP-DSs). To ensure the secure MF after emergencies, this paper proposes a frequency constrained proactive scheduling method for WPP-DSs. The primary frequency response (PFR) model is proposed to describe the microgrid frequency dynamics after islanding, where wind turbines are deloaded to provide a primary reserve. Then the PFR model is incorporated into the scheduling model to ensure frequency security during MF process. The proposed method proactively dispatches controllable units to mitigate the power imbalance and to reserve power for frequency regulation. After emergencies, the primary reserve is released, and adaptive microgrids are securely formed to sustain critical services. The PFR model is formulated as algebraic differential equations (ADEs), which makes it difficult to solve the model directly. Thus, the PFR model is discretized into difference equations and further linearized to facilitate solution. Simulation results validate the merits of the proposed method in reducing the conservatism of proactive scheduling strategies and improving the microgrid security during MF process.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Timescale Security Evaluation and Regulation of Integrated Electricity and Heating System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10747833</link><description>The ability to operate across multiple timescales is vital for the flexibility enhancement of integrated electricity and heating systems (IEHS). Nonetheless, the common dependence on numerical solvers operating in discrete spaces poses a challenge in accurately representing their inherent multi-timescale properties, thereby compromising system security. In response, this paper proposes a novel multi-timescale matching method in continuous space to get rid of resolution constraints, circumventing discretization issues while deriving an explicit formulation for thermal dynamics. This forms the groundwork for establishing the global sensitivity factors to quantify the interdependencies within the IEHS. On this basis, a rolling security evaluation and regulation strategy that is cognizant of the asynchronous behaviors in power and heating systems is tailored. Case studies validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method to ensure the IEHS&#8217;s security.</description></item><item><title>Two-Stage Coordinated Robust Planning of Multi-Energy Ship Microgrids Considering Thermal Inertia and Ship Navigation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10834446</link><description>As maritime technology advances, multi-energy ship microgrids (MESMs) are widely used in large cruise tourism. In this context, studying cost-effective and highly reliable energy system planning methods for MESMs in their whole lifespan becomes paramount. Therefore, this paper proposes a joint planning method for a MESM during its lifespan. Firstly, a long timescale coordinated planning and operation scheme is formulated with the aim of maximizing the Net Present Value (NPV) value, thereby reducing both project investment and energy supply cost. In addition, this paper introduces novel operation models that incorporate customer thermal comfort levels, considering thermal inertia, and ship navigation, accounting for the effects of waves and wind. These models enhance the flexibility and practicality of the planning process. Finally, to ensure the safe operation of vessel and alleviate the negative effects of uncertain wind and waves during ship navigation, a robust optimization (RO) approach is employed. A case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method, with several comparison analyses further highlighting its advantages.</description></item><item><title>Two-Stage Robust Planning for Park-Level Integrated Energy System Considering Uncertain Equipment Contingency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10834468</link><description>To enhance the reliability of Integrated Energy Systems (IESs) and address the research gap in reliability-based planning methods, this paper proposes a two-stage robust planning model specifically for park-level IESs. The proposed planning model considers uncertainties like load demand fluctuations and equipment contingencies, and provides a reliable scheme of equipment selection and sizing for IES investors. Inspired by the unit commitment problem, we formulate an equipment contingency uncertainty set to accurately describe the potential equipment contingencies which happen and can be repaired within a day. Then, a modified nested column-and-constraint generation algorithm is applied to solve this two-stage robust planning model with integer recourse efficiently. In the case study, the role of energy storage system for IES reliability enhancement is analyzed in detail. Computational results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed model over other planning models in terms of improving reliability.</description></item><item><title>Resilient Preparation and Restoration Strategy for Integrated Electric-Gas Distribution Systems Considering Mobile Energy Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10835752</link><description>Extreme events can interrupt both electricity and gas supply in an integrated electric-gas distribution system (IEGDS). This work proposes a two-stage resilient preparation and restoration strategy to efficiently restore both electric and gas load services in IEGDS after extreme events considering the utilization of mobile energy storage (MES). To minimize the load loss under the damage uncertainty and limited MES resources, a unified MES assigning and dispatching strategy is proposed to optimally coordinate the numbers and locations of pre-event and post-event MES dispatching. To address the MES assigning and pre-event dispatching problems under the damage uncertainty, a two-stage stochastic optimization model is developed, which is efficiently solved by a proposed selective progressive hedging (PH) algorithm. The out-of-sample analysis indicates that the proposed methods can achieve a 53.10% reduction in average load loss compared to scenarios without MES. In addition, the proposed unified MES assigning and dispatching strategy outperforms the preparation-only and restoration-only MES dispatching strategies by reducing 2.65% and 7.13% of average load loss, respectively. Moreover, the proposed selective algorithm can reduce 7.23% to 30.53% of the computational burden compared to the conventional PH algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Time Scale Model Predictive Control-Based Demand Side Management for a Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10750304</link><description>The microgrid (MG) integrating clean renewable energy has increasingly emerged as a critical solution for addressing energy challenges and promoting sustainable energy development. However, the inherent uncertainties in renewable energy output and load consumption present significant challenges to the economic and stable operation of the MG. This paper investigates a multi-time model predictive control (MSMPC) strategy for the optimal scheduling of grid-connected MG. The proposed method can dynamically update the optimal scheduling of the MG on two-time scales based on real-time measurement data. The dispatchable thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) are incorporated into the demand side management (DSM) system to enhance flexibility and satisfy the future trend of a larger proportion of controllable TCLs. Furthermore, the TCL model considers the aging problem associated with excessive compressor cycling and the satisfaction of end users. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the economic performance and robustness of the MG system. Moreover, a real-time experiment conducted using RT-LAB further verifies the feasibility of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Enhanced Privacy-Preservation in Smart Grid Power Charging Coordination</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10759805</link><description>With the significant growth in the industry of energy storage units (ESUs) and plug-in electric vehicles, charging coordination becomes critical to avoid electric grid overload. However, without effective methods to secure the charging requests, malicious users can eavesdrop on the communication between the ESUs and the grid to extract sensitive users&#8217; information. Therefore, privacy preservation is a must in the design of charging coordination schemes. To address this critical issue, in this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving charging coordination scheme that allows the aggregator to allocate optimized amounts of charging power to all available ESUs in the community without knowing their individual charging requests details. In particular, based on aggregated secret key communication, best-effort, and cooperative power allocation schemes, the proposed coordination scheme totally hides the sensitive data from all the nodes in the network and performs the power allocation in a semi-blind fashion. Using extensive simulations, we show that our proposed scheme can achieve almost the same performance as that of charging coordination schemes in the literature based on full knowledge of the charging requests while outperforming them by an enhanced level of security. In particular, numerical results confirm that the proposed scheme can allocate 95% of what traditional schemes allocate while keeping ESU information private. Despite the anonymity and collaborative nature of the algorithm, the average convergence time is around 2.7 iterations, with 50% to 100% of cases converging in one iteration.</description></item><item><title>Production Scheduling Identification: An Inverse Optimization Approach for Industrial Load Modeling Using Smart Meter Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10769532</link><description>To cost-effectively manage the supply-demand balance of the power system, the flexibility of industrial users could be harnessed through demand-side response. To minimize the negative impact on the production of industrial users during demand-side response, general-purpose models such as the state-task network (STN) are widely used to model the energy-consuming constraints of industrial production processes. However, the required model parameters cannot be set because the required data are privately owned by industrial users and are not directly available, hindering the accurate modeling of industrial loads. In this paper, we propose production scheduling identification (PSI), an inverse-optimization-based approach for industrial load modeling under incomplete information. In PSI, industrial users&#8217; smart meter data are used to identify production scheduling parameters, thus addressing the problem of accurate load modeling when private data are unavailable. We implemented PSI with a modified STN and proposed a practical algorithm to obtain an effective solution. Numerical tests showed that PSI can identify the model parameters of a steel powder plant and a cement plant with acceptable accuracy, using only 21 days of hourly smart meter data. Compared with accurate models established with direct access to private data, the modeling error does not exceed 8.5% and 5.2%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Controlling Air Conditioners for Frequency Regulation: A Real-World Example</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10783092</link><description>Even though thermostatically controlled loads like air conditioners present a great potential for providing ancillary services to the electric power grid, the practical challenges associated with their real-time coordination have not received the necessary attention. In this work, we present a nondisruptive load control application, specifically, we demonstrate how real residential air conditioners can provide frequency regulation. Aggregate power adjustment is achieved by modifying the ON/OFF modes of the air conditioners. To account for both single and multi-zone houses, we extend the currently available techniques and develop an approach that can be used for controlling aggregations that include both types of houses. A discussion of the practical challenges encountered in our field experiments is provided, along with the hardware and software approaches we developed to circumvent them. We argue that limitations of current thermostat APIs introduce significant challenges and are an impediment to widespread adoption of fast load control applications.</description></item><item><title>Carbon-Aware Scheduling of Thermostatically Controlled Loads: A Bilevel DRCC Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10820107</link><description>Thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs), including air conditioners, heat pumps, water heaters, and refrigerators, play a pivotal role in demand response due to their thermal inertia and inherent flexibility. TCLs also substantially impact energy consumption and emissions within commercial and residential buildings, which makes them critical for the low-/zero-carbon transition that the building sector is undergoing to meet global climate objectives. To aid in this process, this paper proposes a carbon-aware robust scheduling approach for TCLs. The proposed approach precisely models carbon emissions attributed to TCLs, and formulates TCL scheduling as a distributionally robust chance-constrained (DRCC) optimization problem to ensure robust decision-making. We then develop a novel bilevel optimization reformulation strategy to address challenges such as over-conservatism and computational intractability that often arise from solving DRCC problems using conventional approaches. Real-world data evaluation demonstrates significant reductions in costs and carbon emissions compared to state-of-the-art methods, showcasing the effectiveness of our approach in potentially decarbonizing the building sector.</description></item><item><title>Optimizing Hydrogen Systems and Demand Response for Enhanced Integration of RES and EVs in Smart Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10746543</link><description>Global interest in maximizing the hosting capacity (HC) of renewable energy sources (RES) while avoiding high energy curtailment has lately grown in smart grids (SGs). This trend has been associated with the empowerment of hydrogen systems (HS) and demand response (DR). In this regard, this article proposes a new approach to optimally synergize HS and DR for elevated integration of intermittent RES in SGs. The proposed approach is predicated on a coordinated management scheme for various SG control devices, including: a complete HS (hydrogen tank, water electrolyzer, and fuel cell), hydrogen load DR, RES energy curtailment, DSTATCOM functionality of the RES inverters, storage charging rates, and electrical DR. Additionally, the flexibility of electric vehicles (EVs) with G2V/V2G functionalities has been considered to support RES and HS expansion. The proposed approach is formulated as a multi-objective optimization model that aims to optimize two competing objective functions, i.e., total costs and HC capacity of RESs. The simulation results reveal the superiority of the proposed approach which resulted in a notable HC increase of up to 17.24%, accompanied by a significant cost reduction. The proposed approach is also applied to define the optimal number of HS to maximize RES capacity.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Coordinated Automatic Generation Control Involving Distributed Energy Resources: An Aggregation Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10746554</link><description>The distributed energy resources (DERs) need to provide ancillary services due to their increasing penetration level in distribution networks (DNs). This paper proposes a hierarchically coordinated automatic generation control (AGC) scheme for the multi-level power grids, to facilitate the DERs to provide AGC service, while ensuring the operational security of the host DNs. Each DN is formulated as an individual AGC participating entity to reduce the computational and communication burden of the transmission system operator (TSO). The distribution system operator (DSO) aggregates its managed DER clusters as a whole, and evaluates the equivalent aggregation dynamic model as well as the regulation capacity. The regulation capacity is evaluated using an optimization program that consider device and network constraints, and prediction uncertainties. The aggregation dynamic model is estimated based on the curve-fitting, which represents the external power response characteristics of the DN as a second-order state-space model. In addition, P-Q affine regulation strategy is employed to coordinate frequency and voltage control. The active and reactive power commands are simultaneously allocated to DER clusters to eliminate voltage violations arising from providing AGC services. Case studies conducted on a multi-level power grid verify the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Attack-Resilient Distributed Fixed-Time Consensus Control for HBESSs and Circuit Implementation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10772734</link><description>This paper investigates the consensus control problem for heterogeneous battery energy storage systems (HBESSs) with switching topologies. An attack-resilient distributed control scheme is proposed to realize active/reactive power sharing, energy level balancing and frequency/voltage restoration within fixed-time. Rigorous proofs derive the convergence time upper bound for each objective, which is independent on the HBESSs&#8217; initial states and tighter than previous bounds. It is also shown that under bounded actuator attacks, above three control objectives can still be realized in fixed-time. Moreover, analog circuits are firstly constructed to physically implement this new control strategy, which provides a new insight to deploy advanced control schemes on HBESSs. Several simulation examples validate those conclusions from both numerical and circuital perspectives.</description></item><item><title>Near-Optimal Energy Management Strategy for a Grid-Forming PV and Hybrid Energy Storage System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10771975</link><description>Integration of Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors (SCs) into PV plants enables a hybrid PV system with more grid functions like power filtering and frequency regulation. Above that, an energy management system (EMS) plays a key role in achieving grid functions and economic performance. However, previous efforts focused on advanced forecast methods without considering real-time EMS. This paper thus aims to develop a practical real-time EMS with near-optimal performance for the degradation of the hybrid energy storage system (HESS). Firstly, a variational mode decomposition (VMD) method is combined with a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to decompose and learn feature parameters of typical historical weather data, improving forecast accuracy and shifting the operation mode periodically. Then, the mixed integer linear programming approach is utilized to find out the optimal control mode in different operation scenarios, and three-segment rules are extracted from the optimization results. Finally, the deep learning-based real-time EMS is developed. Numeric simulations validate that the proposed EMS can achieve near-optimal performance with a low computation burden. Besides, the proposed strategy can reduce the degradation cost by up to 80% compared with competitive rule-based strategies.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Area Architecture for Real-Time Feedback-Based Optimization of Distribution Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10819497</link><description>A challenge in transmission-distribution coordination is how to quickly and reliably coordinate Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) across large multi-stakeholder Distribution Networks (DNs) to support the Transmission Network (TN), while ensuring operational constraints continue to be met within the DN. Here we propose a hierarchical feedback-based control architecture for coordination of DERs in DNs, enabling the DN to quickly respond to power set-point requests from the Transmission System Operator (TSO) while maintaining local DN constraints. Our scheme allows for multiple independently-managed areas within the DN to optimize their local resources while coordinating to support the TN, and while maintaining data privacy; the only required inter-area communication is between physically adjacent areas within the DN control hierarchy. We conduct a rigorous stability analysis, establishing intuitive conditions for closed-loop stability, and provide detailed tuning recommendations. The proposal is validated via case studies on multiple feeders, including IEEE-123 and IEEE-8500, using a custom MATLAB&#174;-based application which integrates with OpenDSS&#169;. The simulation results show that the proposed structure is highly scalable and can quickly coordinate DERs in response to TSO commands, while responding to local disturbances within the DN and maintaining DN operational limits.</description></item><item><title>Lyapunov Method-Based Coherent Aggregation of Grid-Forming Converters for Transient Stability Equivalents</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10819501</link><description>Paralleled grid-forming converters (GFMs) system suffers from transient instability issues while accurate model is complicated and unsuitable to give stability analysis. Existing aggregation method requires either extensive computation or linearized model assumption to realize coherent identification, which might not distinguish unstable units from stable clusters. In this paper, a two-step algorithm is proposed to realize coherent recognition for multi-GFMs system based on Lyapunov energy function: 1) unstable GFMs are distinguished from stable clusters based on Lyapunov&#8217;s function, 2) stable GFMs are further divided into different clusters using stored potential energy as a criterion. First, large-signal model considering transient interactions and virtual impedance-based fault ride through (VI-FRT) control is derived in transient stability time-scale. Then, Lyapunov energy function (LEF) is constructed for multi-GFMs system taking virtual damping coefficients and voltage dynamics into account. Compared with existing methods, the constructed LEF presents higher stability prediction accuracy and lower computational burden. Moreover, it is found that the relative potential energy among different GFMs can be adopted to identify coherent clusters, which is proved to be mathematically equivalent to coherency recognition using power angle deviation as the indicator. Finally, parameters aggregation is realized using the concept of center of inertia (COI). Based on the proposed method, equivalent reduced model has good accuracy in transient stability prediction compared with full-order model. Both numerical simulations and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments are provided to validate the feasibility of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Equitable Active-Reactive Power Envelopes for Distributed Energy Resources in Power Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829662</link><description>The operating envelope (OE) provides an effective method to manage distributed energy resources (DERs) in power distribution systems (DSs) by offering allowable regions of nodal power injections. The active-reactive power envelope (P-Q envelope) is a desirable type of OE that would increase the allowable active power range and release the reactive power flexibility. However, existing OE studies have not established P-Q envelopes with guaranteed equitableness. This paper proposes an equitable P-Q envelope calculation and optimization method. First, we model the P-Q envelopes as convex polygons on active-reactive power planes of nodal power injections. Second, we define the proportional equitableness of P-Q envelopes and establish two equitable conditions, under which the equitableness of P-Q envelopes is proved mathematically. Third, we propose the P-Q envelope calculation method. Specifically, the P-Q envelopes are initially established considering the security constraints of DSs and then modified by a geometric method to satisfy two equitable conditions. Finally, we develop the optimization method to increase the maximum active power export and import provided by P-Q envelopes by coordinating the on-load tap changer, capacitor banks, and distributed generators. The proposed methods are tested on the 33-bus, real-world 135-bus and 455-bus DSs. Numerical results show that the proposed method efficiently obtains the P-Q envelopes with strict proportional equitableness and remarkably enlarges the size of P-Q envelopes by optimizing the control strategies of DS devices. Compared with existing OE calculation methods, the proposed method obtains the largest allowable power range using the shortest computation time.</description></item><item><title>Coordination of Multi-Agent Orderly Charging via an Incentive-Compatible Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10750297</link><description>As the cyber-physical system is developed into cyber-physical-social system, the importance of social factors is growing in the interaction between electric vehicle (EV) and power system. This paper aims to develop an incentive-compatible mechanism to coordinate multi-agent orderly charging. Firstly, the travel behaviors of EV cluster are simulated based on Monte Carlo sampling, and the load transfer model considering various social factors is constructed. Then, an orderly charging mechanism involving multiple agents based on Nash bargaining theory is proposed. In the first stage, the total profit of electric vehicle user, power grid company (PGC), and charge station operator is maximized. In the second stage, the revenue of each agent after participating in the cooperation is improved by transfer payment. Next, the carbon trading mechanism is applied in the incentive compatibility model, and the revenue of PGC participating in the carbon market under different scenarios and constraints are calculated. Finally, by comparing with the existing model, the simulation results show that the proposed multi-agent coordinated orderly charging model can reduce the pressure on the power grid caused by the randomness of EV travel, and through a fair profit distribution mechanism, it can maximize the social benefits of the coalition while increasing the revenue of each agent.</description></item><item><title>Joint Energy-Computation Management for Electric Vehicles Under Coordination of Power Distribution Networks and Computing Power Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10753461</link><description>This paper explores the integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into the power distribution network (PDN) and computing power network (CPN), leveraging EVs&#8217; inherent energy storage and computing resources. A conceptual hub called a charging and computing station (CCS) is introduced, enabling parked EVs to interact with the PDN and CPN simultaneously. The CPN is composed of the EVs and edge servers, whose computing resources are collectively utilized for processing computation tasks from various applications. The EVs and edge servers in CCSs consume energy at different nodes of the PDN. A two-stage framework is proposed for joint energy and computation management in the EV-PDN-CPN coordination. In Stage 1, a day-ahead system cost minimization problem is formulated with decisions on EV charging/discharging energy scheduling and computation task reallocation among edge servers. A fast algorithm based on the convex-concave procedure is developed to solve the Stage-1 problem whose nonconvexity stems from network constraints of both the PDN and CPN. In Stage 2, EV computing resources are utilized to achieve real-time task offloading, coping with the prediction errors of computation tasks in Stage 1 and minimizing the use of extra energy and computing resources. A linear search algorithm is proposed to solve the nonconvex Stage-2 problem. Results show that the proposed algorithms are more computationally efficient than off-the-shelf solvers, and the proposed EV-PDN-CPN coordination model can save 4.7% and 91.9% of costs in the two stages, respectively, compared to uncoordinated models.</description></item><item><title>Consensus Algorithm-Based Two-Stage Frequency Regulation Strategy With EVs Participating as VSMs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10771824</link><description>Isolated grids, with large-scale intermittent renewable energy sources (RESs), face more severe frequency stability issues. Fortunately, grid-connected electric vehicles (EVs) present an opportunity to provide frequency services. In this paper, a two-stage frequency regulation strategy, in which EVs participate in the form of a virtual synchronous machine (VSM), is proposed. First, a frequency response (FR) model is established for both charging stations (CSs) and battery swapping stations (BSSs) using VSM control. On this basis, a two-stage strategy is proposed to consider both frequency regulation performance and system economy. Specifically, in the day-ahead stage (DAS), a multi-unit economic dispatch (ED) model is designed to formulate the operation plan; in the real-time stage (RTS), a consensus-based power allocation strategy is designed for multi-units, responsive to real-time market prices. Case studies involving real-world data of load, RES, and CS illustrate the key benefits of the proposed method, including (i) decreasing frequency deviation, (ii) providing extra rotational inertia, and (iii) reducing dispatch costs.</description></item><item><title>Grid-Aware Scheduling and Control of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations for Dispatching Active Distribution Networks: Theory and Experimental Validation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829625</link><description>This paper proposes and experimentally validates a grid-aware scheduling and control framework for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs) for dispatching the operation of active distribution networks (ADNs). The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage (day-ahead), we determine an optimal 24-hour power schedule at the grid connection point (GCP), referred to as the dispatch plan. Then, in the second stage, a real-time model predictive control (RT-MPC) is proposed to track the day-ahead dispatch plan using flexibility from EVCSs and other controllable resources (e.g., batteries). The dispatch plan accounts for the uncertainties of vehicles connected to the EVCS along with other uncontrollable power injections, by day-ahead predicted scenarios. The RT-MPC accounts for the uncertainty of the power injections of stochastic resources (such as demand and generation from photovoltaic &#8211; PV plants) by short-term forecasts. The framework ensures that the grid is operated within its nodal voltage and branches power-flow operational bounds, modeled by a linearized optimal power-flow model, maintaining the tractability of the problem formulation. The scheme is numerically and experimentally validated on a real-life ADN at the EPFL hosting two controllable EVCSs (172 kWp and 32 kWp), multiple PV plants (aggregated generation of 42 kWp), uncontrollable demand from office buildings (20 kWp), and two controllable BESSs (150kW/300kWh and 25kW/25kWh).</description></item><item><title>Peer-to-Peer Multi-Energy Trading Among Heterogeneous Building Prosumers via Asynchronous Distributed Algorithm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10877846</link><description>Smart buildings in the integrated community energy system (ICES) are normally equipped with distributed energy resources (DERs), thereby creating building prosumers with both energy production and consumption. Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading among building prosumers can bring higher economic benefits for them. Therefore, a P2P multi-energy trading scheme among building prosumers is proposed, which fully explores the flexibility of buildings&#8217; heating loads based on the thermal dynamics of buildings with different thermal insulation properties. Each building prosumer is heterogeneous in terms of its computation and communication infrastructures. This results in a heavy computation burden with the traditional centralized method. To improve the computational efficiency for P2P trading among heterogeneous building prosumers, an asynchronous distributed algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is developed to enable each prosumer to trade energy asynchronously instead of waiting for the trading information from others with poor infrastructure. This asynchronous procedure integrated with the prediction and anomaly detection steps can further accelerate the convergence speed of P2P trading. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed trading scheme and the feasibility and solution optimality of the proposed algorithm.</description></item><item><title>A Joint Power and Renewable Energy Certificate Trading Method in the Peer-to-Peer Market</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10777014</link><description>A novel peer-to-peer joint power &amp; renewable energy certificate trading method is proposed to reflect the power &amp; environment values of renewable power simultaneously, as well as promote the on-site utilization.

Various control methods have been previously proposed to manage and control LCC-HVDC systems, but none have provided a multi-level control system capable of operating in multiple areas simultaneously. This article presents a comprehensive and multi-task control system for wide-area HVDC systems. In the proposed control systems, multi-level frequency control is conducted in multi-area LCC-HVDC interconnected grids. Additionally, various control strategies are implemented to enhance the network&#8217;s resilience during three-phase fault conditions. Furthermore, the proposed control system can detect and distinguish intelligent false data injection (FDI) cyber-attacks. Nonlinear time domain simulations conducted in MATLAB/SIMULINK demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively balance the frequency of weaker areas, enhance network resilience in critical conditions, and identify FDI cyber-attacks.</description></item><item><title>Detection-Triggered Recursive Impact Mitigation Against Secondary False Data Injection Attacks in Cyber-Physical Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10746504</link><description>The cybersecurity of microgrid has received widespread attentions due to the frequently reported attack accidents against distributed energy resource (DER) manufactures. Numerous impact mitigation schemes have been proposed to reduce or eliminate the impacts of false data injection attacks (FDIAs). Nevertheless, the existing methods either requires at least one neighboring trustworthy agent or may bring in unacceptable cost burdens. This paper aims to propose a detection-triggered recursive impact mitigation scheme that can timely and precisely counter the secondary FDIAs (SFDIAs) against the communication links among DERs. Once triggering attack alarms, the power line current readings will be utilised to observe the voltage bias injections through the physical interconnections among DERs, based on which the current bias injections can be recursively reconstructed from the residuals generated by unknown input observers (UIOs). The attack impacts are eliminated by subtracting the reconstructed bias from the incoming compromised data. The proposed mitigation method can work even in the worst case where all communication links are under SFDIAs and only require extra current sensors. The bias reconstruction performance under initial errors and system noises is theoretically analysed and the reconstruction error is proved to be bounded regardless of the electrical parameters. To avoid deploying current sensors on all power lines, a cost-effective deployment strategy is presented to secure a spanning tree set of communication links that can guarantee the secondary control performance. Extensive validation studies are conducted in MATLAB/Simulink and cyber-physical microgrid testbeds to validate the proposed method&#8217;s effectiveness against single/multiple and continuous/discrete SFDIAs.</description></item><item><title>Consecutive Load Redistribution Attack Without Line Admittance Information</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10756615</link><description>This paper develops a novel method for launching a stealthy Load Redistribution Attack (LRA) without requiring knowledge of the power network&#8217;s admittance matrix. Initially, equations involving the admittance matrix in the conventional LRA model are substituted with equivalent conditions utilizing the Power Transfer Distribution Factor (PTDF) matrix. Subsequently, a ridge regression approach is applied to estimate the PTDF matrix based on the hijacked Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data. To maximize the damage inflicted by the proposed LRA, a consecutively small-scale attack strategy is designed to gather more informative data, and the PTDF matrix estimation is then updated accordingly to enhance its accuracy. Ultimately, a stealthy LRA is completed using the final PTDF matrix estimation. The rationale behind employing the PTDF matrix estimation in the proposed method, as opposed to the estimation of the admittance matrix, is that the latter requires information on bus voltage phase angles not supplied by the SCADA system. Simulations on the IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus system, without admittance information for grid transmission lines, demonstrate the accuracy and efficacy of the proposed attack.</description></item><item><title>Infinitesimal-Attack-High-Impact Phenomena: Cyber-Attack Bifurcation in Two-Terminal HVDC Power Delivery Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10772379</link><description>Voltage-source converters (VSC) and current-source converters (CSC) are two predominant techniques in high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) power delivery systems. They are crucial for inter-regional power exchange. The cyber vulnerabilities of HVDC systems have been physically demonstrated, threatening their secure operation. To this end, this study investigates the closed-form bifurcation hyperplanes in the cyber-attack injection space of both the VSC HVDC system and the CSC HVDC system. By considering the inherent nonlinearity in intra-station switching control and inter-station coordination control, this study formulates different clusters of attack-induced equilibrium points in HVDC systems. Closed-form sufficient conditions are then derived for triggering small-attack-high-impact and even infinitesimal-attack-high-impact phenomena, in which an infinitesimal cyber-attack can activate rapid power reversal by altering the DC current polarity in VSC HVDC systems or DC voltage polarity in CSC HVDC systems. These attack-induced properties are experimentally validated by establishing a hardware-in-the-loop HVDC cybersecurity testbed, incorporating a Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) and a STM32F429-based cyber-attack prototype. The video demonstration and the first-of-its-kind open-source HVDC cybersecurity testbed are attached.</description></item><item><title>LPPMM-DA: Lightweight Privacy-Preserving Multi-Dimensional and Multi-Subset Data Aggregation for Smart Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10776781</link><description>The smart grid facilitates data centers in collecting real-time power consumption data from users, which is essential for effective power management. Such real-time data may inadvertently disclose the identities and activities of power users. Data aggregation has been identified as a viable solution to this challenge, enabling data centers to obtain only the aggregate power consumption data without accessing individual user information. However, most existing aggregation methodologies are limited to multi-dimensional data aggregation and fail to ensure user privacy, data integrity, and authentication. In this study, we propose a ring signature based multi-dimensional and multi-subset aggregation (LPPMM-DA) scheme. This proposed method allows the data center to compute both the total power consumption and the number of users within each subset across various dimensions. Based on the hardness assumption of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP), the ring signature utilized in our scheme is demonstrably unforgeable against adaptive chosen message attacks within the random oracle model. A comprehensive analysis indicates that the proposed scheme meets the security requirements for data aggregation in the smart grid context. Furthermore, performance evaluations reveal that the implementation of this scheme results in lower computational and communication overhead compared to existing related approaches.</description></item><item><title>Securing FACTS-Based Wide Area Damping Controllers Using Modified Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10772252</link><description>The performance of wide-area damping controllers (WADCs) heavily depends on the accuracy and authenticity of the measurements received from phasor measurement units (PMUs). These controllers receive PMU data and send the control commands back to grid actuators, e.g., flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) devices. The use of cyber systems required for transferring PMU measurements, however, makes the controller and entire power system prone to a variety of cyber attacks, e.g., false data injection attacks (FDIAs). On this basis, this paper (i) proposes an FDIA model against FACTS-based WADCs and (ii) develops detection and mitigation methods for the proposed attacks. First, FDIAs are designed to destabilize the system, considering realistic limitations on the power grids. Then, a modified conditional generative adversarial network (MCGAN) is utilized for the detection and mitigation of these FDIAs. To detect this attack, a detector is developed from the discriminator of MCGAN, using the fine-tuning technique. The use of this proposed method enhances detection performance in imbalanced datasets and effectively identifies unseen high-risk attacks. Following the detection, a mitigation method is implemented based on the coordination of a graph-based interpolation and the tuned generator of the developed MCGAN. This method effectively mitigates the impact of the FDIAs on the FACTS-based WADCs. The effectiveness of the attack model, as well as the detection and mitigation methods, is assessed using the two-area Kundur and New England 39-Bus test systems.</description></item><item><title>Power Distribution Network Topology Detection Using Dual-Graph Structure Graph Neural Network Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10779459</link><description>Topology detection (TD) in the context of power distribution networks (PDNs) is a fundamental requirement for a wide range of applications, such as fault localization and load management. PDNs suffer from a lack of real-time topological information due to insufficient data on switch statuses and an increasing number of switching actions caused by reconfigurations and the control of distributed energy resources (DERs). On this basis, in this paper, a novel near real-time TD method for PDNs is proposed. This method is built on a specialized graph neural network (GNN) design using data from micro-phasor measurement units ( $\mu $ PMUs), leveraging the strengths of both graph-based learning and conventional deep learning (DL) approaches. More specifically, the developed TD method implements a novel dual-graph structure GNN (DGS-GNN) model to transform the TD problem into an inductive link prediction task for a multi-graph dataset. During the training phase, a node attribute similarity graph is created, and the resulting node embeddings are aligned with the actual topology graph (ATG) using a structure-aware loss function. In the inference phase, however, unlike standard GNN models that require structural information as input, the ATG is recovered based solely on node attributes. The developed method enables TD using a limited number of phasor measurements with low inference time and superior generalization capability for unseen scenarios. Its strong performance in large-scale PDNs with varying configurations, as well as its robustness to uncertainties from DERs and noisy environments, is demonstrated on the IEEE 33- and 123-Bus benchmarks and a standard 240-Bus test system. The proposed method outperforms its DL-based counterparts in scenarios where full or partial system topology should be detected.</description></item><item><title>Detection of FDIA in Power Grid Based on Hypergraph and Attention Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10819489</link><description>False data injection attack (FDIA) is posing a threat to the security of power grids. Detection technology is an effective means to defend against FDIA, but the existing mainstream methods have insufficient detection capabilities for large-scale power grids. This study proposes a novel method that combines subgraph partitioning strategy and hypergraph model to detect FDIA. According to the principle the attack principle, the power grid is partitioned into subgraphs. Each subgraph is constructed as the hypergraph and then input into the hypergraph convolutional neural network (HGCNN). The hypergraph attention mechanism (HGAT) is adopted to pay attention to the hyperedge, where the attention score is calculated through the similarity between the node and the hyperedge. Simulations were conducted on IEEE 14-, 118-, and 300-bus systems. At the 10% attack intensity, the proposed method achieved 1.62%, 2.05%, and 2.18% higher accuracy than the optimal results of the comparison methods on three test systems, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Fostering Trust in Smart Inverters: A Framework for Firmware Update Management and Tracking in VPP Context</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829643</link><description>Ensuring the reliability and security of smart inverters that provide the interface between distributed energy resources (DERs) and the power grid becomes paramount with the surge in integrating DERs into the (smart) power grid. Despite the importance of having updated firmware/software versions within a reasonable time frame, existing methods for establishing trust through firmware updates lack effective historical tracking and verification. This paper introduces a novel framework to manage and track firmware update history, leveraging verifiable credentials. By tracking the update history and implementing a trust cycle based on these verifiable updates, we aim to improve grid resilience, enhance cybersecurity, and increase transparency for stakeholders.</description></item><item><title>Toward Value-Oriented Renewable Energy Forecasting: An Iterative Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10771620</link><description>Energy forecasting is an essential task in power system operations. Operators usually issue forecasts and use them to schedule energy dispatch in advance. However, forecasting models are typically developed in a way that overlooks the decision value of forecasts. To bridge the gap, we design a value-oriented point forecasting approach for sequential energy dispatch problems with renewable energy sources. At the training phase, we align the training objective with the decision value, i.e., minimizing the overall operating cost. The forecasting model parameter estimation is formulated as a bilevel program. Under mild assumptions, we convert the upper-level objective into an equivalent form using the dual solutions obtained from the lower-level operation problems. In addition, a novel iterative solution strategy is proposed for the newly formulated bilevel program. Under such an iterative scheme, we show that the upper-level objective is locally linear with respect to the forecasting model output and can act as the loss function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, compared to commonly used forecasts predicting expected realization, forecasts obtained by the proposed approach result in lower operating costs. Meanwhile, the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to that of two-stage stochastic programs, but is more computationally efficient.</description></item><item><title>On the Solution Uniqueness of Data-Driven Modeling of Flexible Loads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10803001</link><description>This letter first explores the solution uniqueness of the data-driven modeling of price-responsive flexible loads (PFL).

To address this, we analyze the structural and practical identifiability of the PFL model, deriving the dataset condition that guarantees the solution uniqueness. Besides, we point out the practical implications of the results. Numerical tests validate this work.</description></item><item><title>Energy Management System Based on S-Shaped Functions for Series Hybrid Vehicle Under a Fully Active Topology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10753086</link><description>This paper proposes an energy management system (EMS) applied to a series hybrid vehicle (SHV) powered by an internal combustion engine (ICE) and a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) consisting of chemical batteries and supercapacitors. The EMS enables power sharing among the ICE and the HESS under a fully active topology to improve control flexibility, considering that the ICE-generator set and HESS efficiencies are limited to a specific power injection operating range and transient responses. In this context, power sharing is performed using S-shaped functions that focus on maximizing supercapacitor usability to reduce fuel consumption and battery current stress. The advantage of the S-shaped function lies on its easy configuration and reduced number of control parameters. Additionally, meta-heuristic optimization is used to tune the S-shaped functions according to the sources requirements for optimal performance in standard driving cycles, while Lyapunov&#8217;s indirect method performs the stability analysis of the control strategy. Finally, experimental and computational simulations are accomplished to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed EMS compared with traditional methods and an optimal approach.</description></item><item><title>Predictive Beamforming in Integrated Sensing and Communication-Enabled Vehicular Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10753082</link><description>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has recently attracted significant research attention. This paper develops the deep learning-based predictive beamforming method for the ISAC-enabled vehicular networks. Traditional deep learning (DL) is a data-driven approach, which means that numerous training samples are required to improve system performance. In addition, embedded devices are not able to provide sufficient computing power, which hinders the application of DL solutions. Motivated by this, the dynamic self-attention mechanism is proposed to reduce the dependence of DL on training samples. Aiming for the optimal trade-off between sensing performance and computational complexity, the efficient model design, Self-Attention Channel Shuffle Mobile Network (SACSMN), is formulated. Experimental results demonstrate that SACSMN achieves similar sensing performance to that based on the full training set under the condition of few samples, the dependence of SACSMN on training samples is significantly reduced. Furthermore, SACSMN significantly reduces the computational complexity while achieving the same level of sensing performance as the benchmarks, realizing the optimal trade-off between system sensing performance and computational complexity. Benefiting from the robust sensing performance of SACSMN, the system achieves the same level of communication performance as that based on full training samples in the case of few samples.</description></item><item><title>OFDM-Based Waveform Design for MIMO DFRC Systems With Reduced Range Sidelobes: A Majorization-Minimization Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10753570</link><description>This paper focuses on waveform design for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) systems, particularly tailored for environments with multiple single-antenna downlink user equipments (UEs). Our approach leverages orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology to address the challenges of frequency-selective fading. To mitigate the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) issues inherent in OFDM signals, the desired low-PAPR property is also incorporated into the design of the waveforms. For enhanced radar sensing functionality, we introduce an advanced metric, the weighted peak or integrated sidelobe level (WPISL), meticulously crafted to measure and minimize low-range sidelobes. On the communication front, we integrate constructive interference (CI) techniques to significantly enhance quality of service (QoS) in data transmission. To address the intricate optimization challenges presented by our design objectives, we have developed an efficient algorithm anchored in the majorization-minimization (MM) framework. The numerical experiments demonstrate that this algorithm notably surpasses existing state-of-the-art benchmarks in reducing range sidelobe interference. Furthermore, our CI-based approach yields enhanced performance compared to traditional least squares (LS) methods, achieving lower symbol error rates (SER) and higher average achievable sum rates.</description></item><item><title>On the Capacity Region of Optical Mobile Communication Systems With Spatial Light Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10753637</link><description>Optical Mobile Communication (OMC) is a newly raised optical wireless communication system, where a novel device called Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) is applied. With the deploying of SLM units, OMC systems can split one light beam to multiple beams directing to different receivers, and hence bring in a new design freedom on the energy allocation for each sub-beam. In this paper, we study a general model of the OMC systems that the transmitter wants to broadcast multiple messages to multiple users, and some of the users may request a same message. We focus on characterizing the capacity region of such OMC systems, in order to assess the benefits on capacity by deploying SLM units. For the general cases, numerical solutions of the capacity region are raised, and for special cases that the system is symmetric or the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is rather low, closed form results of the capacity region are proposed. We also study the OMC system which broadcasts two different messages, and give out a partial closed form result of the capacity region. From this case, we can find that characterizing the capacity region for OMC systems is equivalent to optimizing high order polynomial, which is doable but impossible to find closed form results in general. Key words: Optical Mobile Communication, Spatial Light Modulator, capacity region.</description></item><item><title>Deep Learning Based Energy-Efficient Hybird RSMA for UAV-Assisted mmWave Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10759308</link><description>This paper investigates hybrid rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication network (RSMA-UAV-MMWCN), where a UAV transmits messages to multiple ground user equipment under the influence of an external jammer. We formulate a non-convex joint optimization problem involving hybrid RSMA matrices and a common rate allocation vector, with the objective of maximizing energy efficiency while approaching the performance of ideal hybrid RSMA. Departing from traditional non-convex problem-solving methods, we introduce a hybrid RSMA optimization scheme based on deep residual networks to enhance the feasibility of hybrid precoding and decoding. Initially, due to the absence of standardized and universal datasets, we propose a dataset generation algorithm to create training and testing datasets for subsequent communication model training. Subsequently, we construct a loss function that integrates the objective function with the constraints of the optimization problem. Lastly, to ensure that the optimization variables strictly comply with the constraints, we design a mandatory constraint module comprising modulus, power, and rate constraint sub-modules. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm surpasses traditional optimization methods, and RSMA shows significant advantages over conventional multiple access (MA) schemes.</description></item><item><title>Latency Minimization for MEC-V2X Assisted Autonomous Vehicles Task Offloading</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752420</link><description>Delay-sensitive applications for autonomous vehicles (AVs) require a substantial amount of computational resources. However, the onboard computation resources may be insufficient, resulting in long processing latencies. To deal with this critical issue, we jointly consider roadside unit (RSU) and assistant vehicle offloading, along with resource allocation, to minimize latency for vehicular tasks. This approach also takes into account frequency reuse among sub-areas for assistant vehicle offloading. The latency minimization problem can be formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. Given the inherent complexity of the MINLP problem, we propose a two-step solution. The first step focuses on the combined decision of assistant vehicle offloading and transmit power allocation. To solve this problem, we propose a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with low complexity and low average transmit power. The second step deals with RSU offloading/local computation decision, bandwidth allocation, and computation resource allocation. An iterative algorithm is proposed to achieve the optimal solution. Without adding additional computation resources, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed vehicular task offloading approach improves overall delay performance than the adaptive MEC offloading scheme and the pure MEC computing scheme.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Prioritization and Task Offloading in Vehicular Edge Computing Through Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10755183</link><description>Vehicular edge computing enables real-time decision-making by offloading vehicular computation tasks to edge servers along roadways. This paper focuses on optimizing offloading and scheduling these tasks, with an emphasis on task prioritization to maximize task completion within deadlines while minimizing latency and energy consumption across all priority levels. We propose a prioritized Deep Q-Network (DQNP) that optimizes long-term rewards through a priority-scaled reward system for each priority level, guiding the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent to select optimal actions. The model dynamically adjusts task selection based on environmental conditions, such as prioritizing tasks with higher deadlines in poor channel states, ensuring balanced and efficient offloading across all priority levels. Simulation results demonstrate that DQNP outperforms existing baseline algorithms, increasing task completion by 14%, particularly for high-priority tasks, while reducing energy consumption by 8% and maintaining similar latency. Additionally, the model mitigates resource starvation for lower-priority tasks, achieving task selection rates of 27%, 32%, and 42% for low-, medium-, and high-priority tasks, with completion ratios of 88%, 87%, and 86%, respectively, reflecting balanced resource allocation across priority classes.</description></item><item><title>Covert Beamforming Design for Cooperative NOMA-Assisted Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752409</link><description>In this paper, we consider covert communication in a cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where the ISAC relay can communicate with the covert user under the cover of probing waveforms and public communication waveforms without detection by the warden. For the proposed scheme, a closed-form expression for the minimum average detection error probability of warden is derived, where the detection threshold can be dynamically adjusted by the warden. Besides, we jointly design the covert transmission beamforming, target beamforming, and public transmission beamforming for maximizing the covert rate, subject to satisfying the successive interference cancellation decoding order, the quality of service requirement constraint at the public user, the sensing constraint, the covert constraint, and the total transimt power constraint. The sub-optimal solutions can be derived by employing semidefinite relaxation and the Charnes-Cooper transformation, which are provided to solve the proposed non-convex covert rate maximization problem. Simulation results demostrate that the covert rate of the proposed scheme can be effectively enhanced, compared to the ISAC systems assisted by orthogonal multiple access.</description></item><item><title>Design of STAR-RIS Assisted Uplink NOMA for Maximum Fairness</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10753571</link><description>To support massive connectivity with full service coverage, this paper integrates a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) into uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). In particular, the energy splitting (ES) protocol of STAR-RIS is considered, leading to two types of NOMA: ES/NOMA, which simultaneously supports all users in the transmitting and reflecting spaces of the STAR-RIS and ES/hybrid NOMA (H-NOMA), which supports multiple ES/NOMA pairs in time division multiple access (TDMA). To maximize rate fairness, we develop STAR-RIS beamforming and resource allocation algorithms for ES/NOMA and ES/H-NOMA, along with a globally optimal solution and a closed-form solution for two-user ES/NOMA. The proposed ES/NOMA algorithm achieves faster computation than conventional alternating optimization. The proposed ES/H-NOMA algorithm significantly reduces the complexity of ES/NOMA by using a closed-form solution for two-user ES/NOMA and designing a faster user assignment algorithm with optimal time allocation. The simulation results validate the algorithms and analysis for ES/NOMA and ES/H-NOMA and demonstrate their superiority over the time-switching NOMA and TDMA protocols.</description></item><item><title>Joint Beamforming and Power Allocation Design for Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10756670</link><description>Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) is considered a revolutionary technology that enables powerful signal processing directly in the electromagnetic (EM) wave domain and has significant energy-saving advantages. In this work, we explore the performance of a SIM-aided cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) system that incorporates joint beamforming and power allocation. Specifically, we jointly design the transmit power allocation at access points (APs) and the wave-based beamforming at SIMs for maximizing the system sum rate. An alternating optimization (AO)-based iterative algorithm is proposed for solving the complex non-convex problem, which is decomposed into two subproblems. For the transmit power allocation subproblem, maximum ratio transmission (MRT) is employed to maximize signal receiving power. For the optimization subproblem of SIM phase shifts, a proficient gradient ascent algorithm is deployed to ensure convergence to a local optimum. Simulation results show an enhancement in the performance of the proposed AO algorithm compared to baseline methods.

We then analyze that the user set can be determined by solely considering the effective signal power, which is achieved by the convergence of the sum of interference as the numbers of users and antennas go to infinity. Based on the analysis, we propose a user selection algorithm that utilizes the effective signal power. To this end, we introduce feedback of the effective channel quality representing the effective signal power, which is then employed in choosing users.

Despite targets to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, fossil fuels still dominate the energy industry systems in the USA and Canada. Transition pathways are developed and analyzed comparing a complete defossilization of both energy and nonenergy demands with business-as-usual conditions based on government projections. The results demonstrate the benefits of transitioning to 100% renewable energy for all sectors, as excess low-cost electricity from solar PV can be used for power-to-X solutions to produce electricity-based fuels, chemicals, and materials. By 2050, the power sector will only consume 20% of generated electricity, with the remaining used to electrify the heat, transport, and industry sectors. Thus, 86% of all primary energy in the system comes from renewable electricity, as total electricity generation increases from 4394 TWh in 2020 to 20 795 TWh in 2050. Solar PV reaches 78% of all electricity generation, leading to 10.6 TW of installed capacity. The full energy industry sector transition leads to reductions in both levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and levelized cost of final energy (LCOFE). The LCOE sees massive reductions from 72 &#8364;/MWh in 2020 to 25 &#8364;/MWh in 2050, and the LCOFE decreases from the current 50 to 41 &#8364;/MWh in 2050. The strong operational synergies between solar PV and flexible electrolysis enable a transition pathway that demonstrates the viability of a Power-to-X Economy in achieving climate targets of net-zero emissions.

The Se alloying enables a short-circuit current density improvement, as it leads to a bandgap energy value decrease. Furthermore, it has been associated with increased minority carrier lifetimes, assuring high open-circuit voltage values. An Se gradient profile control can further optimize the solar cell performance. Thus, an optical model baseline of the CdSexTe1&#8722;x (CST) compound was developed. Spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements were conducted to accurately extract the optical constants of ten CST layers deposited through coevaporation with x varying from 0 to 1. Using the measured dielectric function spectra from the discrete CST layers with varying x, and considering the composition-induced shift in the critical point energies, an energy-shift model was employed to develop the accurate optical library for the CST compound for any x value to provide data for future modeling and optimization. The library accuracy was validated through optical simulations of the quantum efficiency of a graded CST solar cell using the finite-difference time-domain method by replicating the Se profile in the absorber layer measured through secondary ion mass spectrometry.</description></item><item><title>Impact of Encapsulation Processing Conditions on Degradation Mechanisms of Carbon-Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10876559</link><description>Perovskite photovoltaic (PV) cells have achieved a record 26.7% efficiency, but improvements in stability against humidity, temperature shifts, and light exposure remain crucial. In this work, we explored mesoporous carbon-based perovskite (c-PSC) devices because of carbon's stability and the elimination of a heat-sensitive hole transport layer. Encapsulation materials exhibiting promising properties with silicon PV, including a thermoplastic polyolefin encapsulant, were applied under different lamination conditions to investigate the impact on c-PSC devices&#8217; durability, which is a novel study for this specific combination of materials. Inadequate curing can compromise adhesion, reduce moisture resistance, and accelerate perovskite decomposition under light exposure. Increasing the lamination temperature by 20&#8201;&#176;C allowed samples to withstand 1000 h of damp-heat conditions, with a 30% reduction in efficiency, while lower temperature lamination caused immediate performance drops. While light exposure remained highly degrading, higher lamination temperatures delayed damage, preserving 2.5% of the initial power conversion efficiency after 400 h of aging and slowing perovskite decomposition.</description></item><item><title>A Spot-Area Method to Evaluate the Incidence Angle Modifier of Photovoltaic Devices-Part 2: Modules (Differential Method)</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10835743</link><description>In Part 1 of our article, we presented a method to quantify the incidence angle modifier (IAM) of photovoltaic (PV) devices, which differs from the methods proposed in IEC 61853-2 through the following: it utilizes a spot-area irradiation, delivered by an optical fiber system, a customized angle probe holder, and a current-to-voltage converter. Part 1 focused on single-cell devices and presented the validation of the new method on two different cell architectures. In Part 2, we generalize that method to commercial-size silicon PV modules, mirroring by the approach already used for module-level spectral responsivity measurements described in IEC 60904-8:2014. The proposed method is motivated by inclusion in the currently ongoing revision of IEC 61853-2, providing research centers and testing laboratories with an additional option to perform IAM measurements indoors. The reproducibility of the proposed method is addressed in this work via interlaboratory comparison with a different measurement method for the same quantity and with a detailed uncertainty analysis.</description></item><item><title>Effect of Encapsulant Degradation on Photovoltaic Modules Performances Installed in Different Climates</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10835212</link><description>A damage analysis was conducted on photovoltaic modules with identical bill of materials exposed to different climates: Cfb moderate and Af tropical, according to the K&#246;ppen-Geiger climate classification. The combination of high temperature, relative humidity, and high ultraviolet (UV) radiation was the cause of severe degradation for the modules exposed to tropical climates (TR), whereas the module exposed to a moderate climate did not experience a significant loss in performance. The modules installed in TR, on the contrary, showed significant power degradation after approximately 8 years of exposure, primarily attributed to acetic acid-related degradation modes. Encapsulant samples were extracted from the selected modules and characterized to determine changes in chemical structure, thermal stability, and consumption of additives and stabilizers. The results of qualitative additive analysis showed that the UV absorber was no longer detectable in the front encapsulant extracted from modules exposed in TR. The consumption of the stabilizers was considered as the main cause of reduction of molar mass. The presence of acetic acid was evident in both electroluminescence images and ion chromatography results. While differential scanning calorimetry successfully detected a reduction in molar mass, thermogravimetric analysis, and infrared spectroscopy proved unsuitable for identifying chain scission phenomena.</description></item><item><title>Growing Panes: Investigating the PV Technology Trends Behind Frequent Early Failures in Modern Glass&#8211;Glass Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10847304</link><description>Photovoltaic (PV) module materials and technologies continue to evolve as module manufacturers and buyers try to minimize costs, maximize performance, and speed deployment. Both silicon and thin film modules are converging toward similar &#8764;3 $\text{m}^{2}$ glass&#8211;glass designs with thinner glass sheets to increase power output while reducing module weight, and both types are increasingly mounted on single-axis trackers. At the same time, an increasing number of PV sites have been reporting spontaneous glass breakage in early life systems deployed with these &#8220;big, floppy modules.&#8221; In this article, we identify the concurrent module changes that may be contributing to increased early failure, explain the trends, and discuss their reliability implications. We suggest that larger, thinner glass sheets along with variations in heat treatment and quality may be contributing to glass vulnerability. We note that trends toward weaker or back-mounted frames may also be contributing to module failures, especially for &#8220;extra-extra-large&#8221; modules mounted on trackers. Combinations of these trends may have pushed modules to a threshold at which increasing early failures are causing the front edge of the &#8220;bathtub curve&#8221; to re-emerge. Current qualification testing appears to be ineffective for catching these early failures in new module designs, and module buyers do not have enough reliability information&#8212;or cannot prioritize such information&#8212;during module procurement. Additional research is needed to identify the field conditions leading to glass breakage and if there is one or multiple limiting flaws in new module designs causing glass breakage. Early failures may be mitigated by returning to more robust designs or ensuring better module testing and quality assurance.</description></item><item><title>Investigating the Crosslinking, Degradation, and Adhesion Behavior of Photovoltaic Encapsulants Under Thermal Accelerated Aging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10804171</link><description>Degradation of photovoltaic (PV) module encapsulant characteristics that lead to mechanical embrittlement and delamination remains a cause of failure in solar installations. A multiscale reliability model connecting the encapsulant mechanical and fracture properties to the degraded molecular structure and interfacial bonding to adjacent solar cell and glass substrates was previously published. The model, developed primarily for poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) acetate (EVA) encapsulants, remains to be experimentally validated. Determining the degradation and crosslinking kinetics of alternative encapsulants, such as polyolefin elastomer (POE) and EVA/POE/EVA composites (EPE), can generalize the model. In this work, we subject fully cured EVA, POE, and EPE encapsulants to accelerated thermal aging to determine how high temperatures impact reaction kinetics. An increase in gel content (crosslinking) and decrease in crystallinity of the encapsulants under hot-aerobic (90 &#176;C, 22% RH) and hot-anaerobic (90 &#176;C, sealed in N2 air) aging were observed, even in the absence of UV and crosslinking initiators. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)-attenuated total reflectance analysis showed insignificant encapsulant degradation, demonstrating the critical role of UV and moisture in accelerating degradation. Adhesion testing performed on coupon-level specimens (cell/encapsulant/glass laminates) showed decreases in adhesion energy, Gc, from 5000 h of hot-dry (90 &#176;C, &#8764;1% RH) and hot-humid (90 &#176;C, 60% RH) aging. POE coupons demonstrated the best stability, followed by EPE then EVA. For EVA and POE, hot-humid aged coupons experienced a larger decrease in Gc due to enhanced hydrolytic degradation. Hot-dry aging condition demonstrated that thermal degradation of the interface could be significant even if the encapsulant experiences negligible degradation in the absence of UV and elevated humidity.</description></item><item><title>Comparison of Reflector Materials for a Vertical Bifacial Solar Canal</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829584</link><description>In this article, we assessed five reflector materials for hypothetical vertical bifacial arrays as a solar canal technology option. We screened the materials (CoverMax, CoverTuff, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) Poly, polyester canvas, and Vivosun aluminized Mylar) for reflectivity, tensile strength to minimum mounting load, vapor barrier performance to reduce evaporation, and energy production. Vivosun had the highest reflectivity (albedo of 0.87&#8211;0.93) and increased annual energy production more than 40% compared with a system without reflector, but plastically deformed under tensile strength testing. All materials reduced evaporation at least fivefold compared with the control. Following our preliminary assessment, we calculated the levelized cost of electricity of a hypothetical vertical bifacial array with two height configurations (short system at 2 m and tall system at 3 m) and four hybrid reflectors (fabricated from strong base layer materials with a top layer of Vivosun) and compared these results with systems with single-material reflectors and with systems without reflectors. We found that the tall system with a hybrid reflector made from PVC Poly had the lowest levelized cost of electricity. However, when considering other performance metrics, such as tensile strength and vapor barrier performance, a hybrid reflector made from CoverMax emerged as the best candidate of the options considered.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Soiling Estimation and Optimized Cleaning Strategies for Industrial Rooftop PV Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10847915</link><description>The accumulation of dust and dirt on solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, known as soiling, reduces energy generation and conversion efficiency of a PV plant. Therefore, regular cleaning is essential to maintain optimal plant performance and economic viability. Fixed-interval cleaning schedules become uneconomical during periods such as low-insolation, rainy, or cloudy events. This study proposes a data-driven method to estimate the soiling ratio (SR) for a 504-kWp rooftop PV plant in India using power, temperature, and irradiance data. A PV panel temperature estimation model is employed, based on ambient temperature and solar irradiance, which simplifies the process by eliminating the need for direct temperature measurements. The analysis reveals that regular cleaning is essential despite rainfall, with energy losses due to soiling ranging from 32% to 47% across inverters, with soiling rates of 4.6&#8211;5.5% per day. A dynamic cleaning schedule, considering weather and soiling conditions, was developed to reduce these losses. Economic evaluation demonstrated that manual cleaning following the proposed dynamic schedule is cost effective, with profit margins of 48&#8211;77%, comparing energy gain and cleaning cost. Compared with fixed-interval cleaning, the proposed method maintained the same average SR but yielded 25&#8211;49% higher profitability across inverters.</description></item><item><title>A Single Voltage Sensor Bypass Switch-Based Photovoltaic Fault Localization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10877760</link><description>Photovoltaic (PV) energy systems are becoming an important source of sustainable energy. However, undiscovered faults within these systems may cause significant efficiency reduction. Localizing these faults to the module level is important for a quick fault diagnosis and maintaining the overall system efficiency. This article presents a novel method to localize intrastring, line-ground, cross-string, and partial shading faults in an $N$ &#215; $M$ PV system down to the module level. The approach utilizes a single voltage sensor in the combiner box of the PV system and $\lceil N/2 \rceil$ bypass switches per string to bypass the connected PV modules during faults. The technique initially relies on identifying the faulty string. Once this string is determined, the voltage associated with each module in that string is found. Each module's voltage in that string is obtained by measuring the string voltage after bypassing each module corresponding to an activated switch. Subsequently, the resulting linear equations are solved to obtain the voltage of each module in the faulty string. The technique is verified using simulation and an experimental setup for a 5 x 4 small-size PV system. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate that the technique can accurately localize faulty modules with only $N$ voltage samples of the faulty string. The proposed method is robust to variations in the maximum power point tracking algorithm, ensuring faults are localized effectively in real-time.</description></item><item><title>A Chiplet Platform for Intelligent Radar/Sonar Leveraging Domain-Specific Reusable Active Interposer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10851388</link><description>Through chiplet reuse, chiplet-based system designs have emerged as a cost-effective solution for system-on-chips (SoCs), yet considerable silicon interposer costs often negate the benefits. Though general reusable interposers (GRIs) can lower the cost, they often compromise on performance and energy efficiency. In this article, a domain-specific reusable active interposer (active DSRI) approach is proposed for a better cost-efficiency tradeoff. Moreover, a chiplet platform based on an active DSRI designed for the intelligent radar/sonar (IRS) domain is introduced to facilitate rapid and customized SoC development. This platform offers flexible and energy-efficient interconnections tailored for IRS, platform infrastructure functions, and peripherals to simplify the chiplets. Furthermore, it integrates lightweight, composable standard 3-D interfaces across the chiplets and interposer, delivering up to 96-Gb/s bandwidth, 11.1-ns latency, and 0.62-pJ/bit energy efficiency, well controlling the cost and power penalties of SoC partition. Demonstrated with a customized hand gesture recognition sonar system (HGRSS) baseband SoC implemented on the proposed platform, it achieves similar performance to a monolithic SoC, with a recognition frame rate of 6286 frames/s, where overhead of the 3-D interface is only 6.86% in area and 4.84% in power. Our approach proves cost-effective, energy efficient, and customizable, moving system volume breakeven point forward by  $3.22\sim 3.36$  times, and reducing the cost by 58.5%~59.8%. This represents a pioneering demonstration of reusable chiplets in HGRSS, showcasing the potential of our approach for broader domains.</description></item><item><title>Protecting Analog Circuits Using Switch Mode Time Domain Locking</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10848525</link><description>Analog circuits remain vulnerable to different types of supply chain attacks including piracy, overproduction, counterfeiting, and reverse engineering. In this article, we present switch mode time domain locking (SMDL) technique to protect analog circuits. This technique integrates a locking mechanism into the time-domain functionality of the circuit. It uses random-key-based switching phases for analog circuits instead of fixed clocks that are conventionally used. The random switching phases are dependent on a key which can be made arbitrarily long. A correct key (CK) with correct alignment of phases can unlock circuit functionality. The locking technique can be applied to a variety of switch-mode analog circuits such as filters, amplifiers, regulators, among others. We implemented this technique on a folded cascode amplifier (FCA) and on a switched-capacitor bandgap reference (BGR) circuit. In both techniques, we employ a 128-bit key to lock the circuit functionality. The design is implemented in a 65-nm CMOS technology. An incorrect key (IK) introduces almost 100% variation in the circuit functionality, ensuring high level of security.</description></item><item><title>A 285-nA Quiescent Current, 94.7% Peak Efficiency Buck Converter With AOT Control for IoT Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10844997</link><description>An ultralow quiescent current dc-dc buck converter based on adaptive on-time (AOT) control is presented in this article. To minimize the energy wastage of the dc-dc buck converter circuit when the Internet-of-Things (IoT) device is in standby mode, a control loop with nano-ampere quiescent current is proposed in this converter. To reduce the quiescent current consumed by the voltage reference and improve its line sensitivity (LS), the voltage reference in the proposed converter is preregulated and based on the subthreshold CMOS implementation, with a quiescent current of only 20 nA. Meanwhile, for purpose of maintaining high efficiency of the converter under the ultralow load, an adaptive comparator based on the dynamic bias mode selection circuit is proposed, which converts the load conditions into time information and switches the bias current and gain of the comparator under ultralow loads, and the quiescent current of the comparator is only 65 nA. The proposed converter is implemented in a 0.18- $\mu $ m BCD process with an area of 1.35 mm2. Experimental results show that the converter has a minimum quiescent current of 285 nA, maintains more than 80% conversion efficiency over a load range of  $10~\mu $ A&#8211;300 mA and a peak efficiency of 94.7%, and has an output of 0.9&#8211;4.8 V over a supply condition of 2&#8211;5.5 V.</description></item><item><title>Single-Ended/Differential Wideband Track-and-Hold Amplifier in 22-nm FD-SOI CMOS Process</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10814652</link><description>The impending 6G communication based on the software defined radio (SDR) requires a radio frequency (RF) track-and-hold amplifier (THA). This THA serves as the frequency down-converter and the single-to-differential interface to the downstream analog-to-digital converter (ADC). We present a CMOS RF THA that features wide and width (18 GHz), yet high linearity (spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) of 56.7 dB) and not requiring an external balun. These features are derived from our proposed isolation technique based on our proposed double source follower enhanced (DSFE) structure. To realize the single-to-differential conversion without an external balun, we design an independent balun as the first stage. Thereafter, we employ our proposed feedforward compensation technique (FCT) along with the reported phase correction technique (PCT) to reduce the output mismatches while simultaneously enhancing the linearity and bandwidth. We monolithically realize the RF THA in 22-nm fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FD-SOI) CMOS operating at 1.8 V. Measurements depict that the input bandwidth is wide (18 GHz), yet featuring high linearity (SFDR =56.7 dB at 15 GHz) with 2 GS/s sampling rate. The power consumption and the chip area are low and small at 216 mW and 0.07 mm2, respectively. When benchmarked against reported III/V RF THAs, the proposed CMOS RF THA is very competitive&#8212;comparable bandwidth, yet simultaneously higher linearity, potentially lower cost, lower power dissipation, and smaller die area. Further because it is realized in CMOS, it facilitates integration to other CMOS circuits in the same system-on-chip (SoC).</description></item><item><title>A Flexible DA-Based Architecture for Computation of Inner Product of Variable Vectors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10871186</link><description>The computation of inner products of any given pair of vectors is an indispensable requirement in several applications including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), signal processing, image processing, communication, and many others. The throughput requirement of inner product computation varies widely for different applications. Moreover, the throughput of computation must match the requirements of the applications. It is therefore important to design flexible hardware for inner product computation that produces the desired throughput. Distributed arithmetic (DA) is a well-known approach for efficient inner product computation. This article presents an efficient DA-based architecture for computing the inner product of variable vectors, which could be tailored according to the throughput requirement of any given application and reused for different inner product lengths. The proposed designs could also be deployed to achieve a trade-off between throughput and area/energy consumption. In this article, we have used modified Booth encoding (MBE) to reduce the number of partial products and proposed a novel carry-save accumulator (CSA) for shortening the critical path delay. The proposed designs are synthesized by Cadence Genus using GPDK 90-nm technology library and place-and-route using Cadence Innovus for different inner product lengths and word lengths. As found from the postlayout synthesis results, the proposed designs offer savings of nearly 30% and 29% EPC and ADP over the bit-serial DA-based design on average for word lengths 8 and 16 and inner product lengths 8, 16, and 32, respectively.</description></item><item><title>ISARA: An Island-Style Systolic Array Reconfigurable Accelerator Based on Memristors for Deep Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891373</link><description>The demand for edge artificial intelligence (AI) is significant, particularly in revolutionary technological areas such as the Internet of Things, autonomous driving, and industrial control. However, reliable and high-performance edge AI is still constrained by computing hardware, and improving the performance and reliability of edge AI accelerators remains a key focus for researchers. This work proposes a memristor/resistive random access memory (RRAM)-based island-style systolic array reconfigurable accelerator (ISARA) that meets the reliability and performance requirements of edge AI. Inspired by the island-style architecture of FPGAs, this work proposes a flexible-tile architecture based on RRAM processing element (PE) islands, optimizing the data flow within the systolic array. The design of network-on-chip reduces data processing latency. In addition, to enhance computational efficiency, this work incorporates a bit-fusion scheme within the flexible tile, which reduces analog-to-digital converter (ADC) power consumption and addresses the conductance variation of RRAM. To date, only a few works have completed the entire process from simulation, design, and fabrication to hardware testing. This work fully realizes the design and validation of a new accelerator based on RRAM chips, demonstrating the reliability of RRAM-based systolic array accelerators for the first time. After deploying algorithms, the hardware accelerator achieved recognition rates comparable to software. Compared to similar works, ISARA&#8217;s computational efficiency exceeds theirs and has flexible reconfigurability. The same deep neural network (DNN) models are adopted for evaluation and compared to other accelerators, and ISARA&#8217;s processing latency is reduced by 200 times.</description></item><item><title>FAMS: A FrAmework of Memory-Centric Mapping for DNNs on Systolic Array Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10843963</link><description>In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have experienced rapid development. These DNNs demonstrate significant variations in architecture and scale, creating a substantial demand for domain-specific accelerators that are optimized for both high performance and low energy consumption. Systolic array accelerators, due to their efficient dataflow and parallel processing capabilities, offer significant advantages when performing computations for DNNs. Existing studies frequently overlook various hardware constraints in systolic array accelerators when representing mapping strategies. This oversight includes ignoring the differences in delays between communication and computation operations, as well as overlooking the capacities of multilevel memory hierarchies. Such omissions can lead to inaccuracies in predicting accelerator performance and inefficiencies in system design. We propose the FAMS framework, which introduces a memory-centric notation capable of fully representing the mapping of DNN operations on systolic array accelerators. Memory-centric notation moves away from the idealized assumptions of previous notations and considers various hardware constraints, thereby expanding the effective design and mapping spaces. The FAMS framework also includes a cycle-accurate simulator, which takes the hardware configurations, task descriptions, and mapping strategy represented by memory-centric notation as inputs, providing various metrics such as latency and energy consumption. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed FAMS framework reduces latency by up to 29.7% and increases throughput by 42.4% compared to the state-of-the-art TENET framework. Additionally, under hardware configurations with a MAC delay of 2 and 3 clock cycles, the FAMS framework enhances performance by 12.0% and 25.4%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>SysCIM: A Heterogeneous Chip Architecture for High-Efficiency CNN Training at Edge</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10843320</link><description>Neural network training is notoriously computationally intensive and time-consuming. Quantization technology is promising to improve training efficiency by using lower data bitwidths to reduce storage and computing requirements. Currently, state-of-the-art quantization training algorithms have a negligible loss of accuracy, which requires dedicated quantization circuits for dynamic quantization of large amounts of data. In addition, the matrix transposition problem during neural network training gradually becomes a challenge as the network size increases. To address this problem, we propose a quantized training architecture which is a heterogeneous architecture consisting of a computing-in-memory (CIM) macro and a systolic array. First, the CIM macro realizes efficient transpose matrix multiplication through flexible data path control, which handles the need for transpose operation of the weight matrix in neural network training. Second, the systolic array utilizes two different data flows in the forward (FW) and backward (BW) propagation for the transpose matrix multiplication of the activation matrix in neural network training and provides higher computational throughput. Then, we design efficient dedicated quantization circuits for quantization algorithms to support efficient quantization training. Experimental results show that the area and power consumption of the two specialized quantization circuits are reduced by a factor of 1.35 and 5.4, on average, compared to floating-point computing circuits. The architecture achieves 4.05 tera operations per second per wat (TOPS/W) energy efficiency @ INT8 convolutional neural network (CNN) training at the 28-nm process. Compared to a state of the art (SOTA) quantization training architecture, SysCIM shows  $1.8\times $  energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Virtual_N2_PDK: A Predictive Process Design Kit for 2-nm Nanosheet FET Technology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856560</link><description>Nanosheet FETs (NSFETs) are considered promising candidates to replace FinFETs as the dominant devices in sub-5-nm processes. To encourage further research into NSFET-based integrated circuits, we present Virtual_N2_PDK, a predictive process design kit (PDK) for 2-nm NSFET technology. All assumptions are based on publicly available sources. Ruthenium (Ru) interconnects are employed for the buried power rail (BPR) and tight-pitch layers. Wrap-around contact (WAC) is also integrated into Virtual_N2_PDK to investigate its impact on circuit performance. By calibrating the BSIM-CMG model with 3-D technology computer-aided design (TCAD) electrothermal simulation results, SPICE models that account for self-heating effects (SHEs) are generated for devices with and without WAC. The simulation results show that with the WAC structure, the energy-delay product (EDP) of standard cells is reduced by an average of 25.18%, while the frequency of a 15-stage ring oscillator circuit increases by 26.05%.</description></item><item><title>VCNPU: An Algorithm-Hardware Co-Optimized Framework for Accelerating Neural Video Compression</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10804689</link><description>Video compression is essential for storing and transmitting video content. Real-time decoding is indispensable for delivering a seamless user experience. Neural video compression (NVC) integrates traditional coding techniques with deep learning, resulting in impressive compression efficiency. However, the real-time deployment of advanced NVC models encounters challenges due to their high complexity and extensive off-chip memory access. This article presents a novel NVC accelerator, called video compression neural processing unit (VCNPU), via an algorithm-hardware co-design framework. First, at the algorithmic level, a reparameterizable video compression network (RepVCN) is proposed to aggregate multiscale features and boost video compression quality. RepVCN can be equivalently transformed into a streamlined structure without extra computations after training. Second, a mask-sharing pruning strategy is proposed to compress RepVCN in the fast transform domain. It effectively prevents the destruction of sparse patterns caused by model simplification, maintaining the model capacity. Third, at the hardware level, a reconfigurable sparse computing module is designed to flexibly support sparse fast convolutions and deconvolutions of the compact RepVCN. Besides, a hybrid layer fusion pipeline is advocated to reduce off-chip data communication caused by extensive motion and residual features. Finally, based on the joint optimization of computation and communication, our VCNPU is constructed to realize adaptive adjustments of various decoding qualities and is implemented under TSMC 28-nm CMOS technology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RepVCN provides superior coding quality over other video compression baselines. Meanwhile, our VCNPU achieves  $6.7\times $  improvements in throughput,  $2.9\times $  in area efficiency, and  $4\times $  in energy efficiency compared to prior video processors.</description></item><item><title>Improved Step-GRAND: Low-Latency Soft-Input Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10851307</link><description>The ultrareliable low-latency communication (URLLC) application scenario requires the adoption of short linear block codes to satisfy the low-latency requirements. Guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND) is a prominent universal decoding solution for short linear block codes that lends itself to efficient hardware implementations. GRAND-based hardware implementations generally offer reduced average decoding latency but their high worst-case (W.C.) latency renders them unsuitable for deployment in mission-critical applications. This article presents an improved version of step-GRAND, a soft-input variant of GRAND that features a novel test error pattern (TEP) generating approach. A novel very large-scale integration (VLSI) architecture is developed for the execution of the improved step-GRAND algorithm with reduced W.C. decoding latency. Application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) implementation results, employing low-power (LP) TSMC 65-nm CMOS technology, demonstrate that the proposed improved step-GRAND can achieve an average decoding latency as low as 10 ns for decoding a  $(128,105)$  linear block code at a target frame error rate (FER) of  $10^{-7}$ , while the W.C. decoding latency can reach  $300~\text {ns}\sim 1~\mu \text { s}$  depending on the parametric settings. Compared with the previously proposed baseline soft-input ordered reliability bits GRAND (ORBGRAND) hardware implementation with similar decoding performance at target FER of  $10^{-7}$ , the improved step-GRAND hardware achieves  $7 \times \sim 17\times $  reduction in W.C. latency,  $7\times $  reduction in power consumption, and  $37 \times \sim 66\times $  higher area efficiency in the W.C. scenario. Furthermore, the proposed hardware can achieve an average throughput of up to 10.5 Gb/s and a W.C. throughput of  $102\sim 350$  Mb/s.</description></item><item><title>Reconfigurable 10T SRAM for Energy-Efficient CAM Operation and In-Memory Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854884</link><description>The limitations of the von Neumann architecture in terms of power consumption and throughput are increasingly evident. In-memory computing is a promising computing paradigm to alleviate this limitation. This article proposes a high-speed and low-power 10T compute-static random-access memory (CSRAM) capable of conducting rowwise search operations and executing in-memory logic functions efficiently. A self-suppressed discharge scheme is implemented to curtail the power consumption of the search operation by reducing the discharge swing of the match lines (MLs). The rowwise search scheme avoids vertical data storage, enhancing the compatibility between different operation modes. The proposed 10T SRAM architecture addresses the issue of sneak currents effectively when multiple lines are activated. Additionally, decoupled read ports eliminate compute access disturbance. To validate the design, a 4Kb array is designed with a 40-nm CMOS technology. At a supply voltage (VDD) of 1.1 V, the in-memory logic operations are capable of operating at a frequency of 752 MHz, consuming 29.2 fJ/bit.

Computing-in-memory (CIM) utilizing static random access memory (SRAM) can enhance the CNN performance. However, this faces issues such as multibit signed data processing, read corruption of traditional SRAM arrays, and increased area overhead due to increased capacitor weighting. This article proposes a 10T-SRAM macro tailored for CNN multiply-accumulate calculation (MAC) computation in image processing. It enables high-throughput full-array operations, with added dual ports facilitating input of multibit data with signed bits. The 10T-SRAM cell features a read-write separation channel, mitigating read disturbance issues seen in dual-port 8T-SRAM arrays or 6T-SRAM arrays. Incorporating redundant columns in the array for charge sharing and weighting conserves area and boosts circuit reliability. In the 28-nm CMOS simulation environment, the proposed architecture achieves a throughput of 274.3 GOPS and an energy efficiency of 200&#8211;237.5 TOPS/W, surpassing literature-reported figures by several times.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Pipelined Hardware Architecture for Depth-Map-Based Image Dehazing System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10814689</link><description>Hazy images can be made clear with the image dehazing process. Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADASs) may have a preexisting stage to maintain clear driving visuals in foggy situations. ADAS strives for greater image resolution at a faster frame rate in order to maintain its dependability for road safety. This tendency forces image dehazing to contend with a formidable throughput challenge with improved power constraints. This work proposes a hardware-efficient, computationally light image dehazing engine. It consists of two main techniques: the saturation-based local airlight estimation module (SLAEM) and the depth-map transmission-map estimation unit (DMTMEU). The transmission-map estimation task and the airlight estimate task can be executed concurrently due to the adopted depth map-based transmission estimation approach, eliminating the dependence between the two activities. In terms of pixels, an additional advantage of the adaptive airlight estimation approach is that it avoids the computationally demanding sorting step, which helps to increase hardware efficiency. The entire architecture utilizes look-up table (LUT)-based computations to implement division modules and exponential functions, resulting in more optimized architecture than the existing dehazing architectures. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) CMOS 90-nm technology is used in the implementation of this study. It is arranged into a six-stage pipelining approach to create a seamless data scheduling process. It achieves a throughput of 200 Mp/s with a logic gate count of 9.309 K and a power consumption of 2.61 mW at 200 MHz. The experimental results demonstrate a 20.09% reduction in area and a 31.31% reduction in power compared to best-performed existing systems, highlighting significant performance improvement.</description></item><item><title>FlooNoC: A 645-Gb/s/link 0.15-pJ/B/hop Open-Source NoC With Wide Physical Links and End-to-End AXI4 Parallel Multistream Support</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10848526</link><description>The new generation of domain-specific AI accelerators is characterized by rapidly increasing demands for bulk data transfers, as opposed to small, latency-critical cache line transfers typical of traditional cache-coherent systems. In this article, we address this critical need by introducing the FlooNoC network-on-chip (NoC), featuring very wide, fully advanced extensible interface (AXI4) compliant links designed to meet the massive bandwidth needs at high energy efficiency. At the transport level, nonblocking transactions are supported for latency tolerance. In addition, a novel end-to-end ordering approach for AXI4, enabled by a multistream capable direct memory access (DMA) engine, simplifies network interfaces (NIs) and eliminates interstream dependencies. Furthermore, dedicated physical links are instantiated for short, latency-critical messages. A complete end-to-end reference implementation in 12-nm FinFET technology demonstrates the physical feasibility and power performance area (PPA) benefits of our approach. Using wide links on high levels of metal, we achieve a bandwidth of 645 Gb/s/link and a total aggregate bandwidth of 103 Tb/s for an  $8\times 4$  mesh of processors&#8217; cluster tiles, with a total of 288 RISC-V cores. The NoC imposes a minimal area overhead of only 3.5% per compute tile and achieves a leading-edge energy efficiency of 0.15 pJ/B/hop at 0.8 V. Compared with state-of-the-art (SoA) NoCs, our system offers three times the energy efficiency and more than double the link bandwidth. Furthermore, compared with a traditional AXI4-based multilayer interconnect, our NoC achieves a 30% reduction in area, corresponding to a 47% increase in GFLOPSDP within the same floorplan.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Cost and Triple-Node-Upset Self-Recoverable Latch Design With Low Soft Error Rate</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10848524</link><description>With the decrease in feature size of transistors, latches are more sensitive to single-event multiple node upset (MNU), including double node upset (DNU) and triple node upset (TNU). However, the reported TNU self-recoverable (TNUR) latches are facing problems with large areas and power consumption. Based on the polarity design, this article proposes a low-cost TNUR latch (LCTRL) with a low soft error rate (SER) in 28-nm CMOS technology. The proposed LCTRL mainly consists of four interlocked modules and a clock-gated inverter. Compared with the state-of-the-art TNUR latches, including LCTNURL, IHTRL, FATNU, and TRLW, the power consumption, D-Q delay, CLK-to-Q delay, area, and the power-delay&#8211;area product (PDAP) of the proposed LCTRL are reduced by 55.09%, 38.64%, 42.93%, 44.65%, and 83.50%, respectively. Due to the polarity design, the SER of the proposed LCTRL is the smallest among compared latches, which suggests that the proposed LCTRL is suitable for use in radiation environments.</description></item><item><title>SPICED+: Syntactical Bug Pattern Identification and Correction of Trojans in A/MS Circuits Using LLM-Enhanced Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10843334</link><description>Analog and mixed-signal (A/MS) integrated circuits (ICs) are crucial in modern electronics, playing key roles in signal processing, amplification, sensing, and power management. Many IC companies outsource manufacturing to third-party foundries, creating security risks such as syntactical bugs and stealthy analog Trojans. Traditional Trojan detection methods, including embedding circuit watermarks and hardware-based monitoring, impose significant area and power overheads while failing to effectively identify and localize the Trojans. To overcome these shortcomings, we present SPICED+, a software-based framework designed for syntactical bug pattern identification and the correction of Trojans in A/MS circuits, leveraging large language model (LLM)-enhanced detection. It uses LLM-aided techniques to detect, localize, and iteratively correct analog Trojans in SPICE netlists, without requiring explicit model training, and thus incurs zero area overhead. The framework leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot learning to guide the LLMs in understanding and applying anomaly detection rules, enabling accurate identification and correction of Trojan-impacted nodes. With the proposed method, we achieve an average Trojan coverage of 93.3%, average Trojan correction rate of 91.2%, and an average false-positive rate of 1.4%.</description></item><item><title>A Pay-Per-ISE RISC-V Processor With Hardware-Assisted Orthogonal Obfuscation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10746354</link><description>Security and cost efficiency are of utmost importance for embedded processors when it comes to limiting hardware resources in IoT applications. This brief presents a security reduced instruction set computer-five (RISC-V) specific instruction set extension (ISE) designed based on hardware-assisted orthogonal obfuscation for hardware security. The orthogonal obfuscation defines an architecture geared toward high-security processors that supports a Pay-Per-ISE function using a key management unit (KMU), thus capable of supporting the customization of the key for a user&#8217;s partially authorized ISE and controlling the unlocking of the specific ISE. The proposed security RISC-V test chip is fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS technology with a core area occupying about 0.739 mm2. The measured results demonstrate that our processor realizes the instruction set authorization function.

The contribution of this work is that the auxiliary resonator is folded into the main inductor, so that it leads to a more compact solution than a conventional scheme. Due to the S-shaped inductor&#8217;s electromagnetic (EM) characteristics, the proposed tail filter can achieve noise suppression without EM interference to the main tank. Designed and implemented in a 28-nm CMOS process, the proposed VCO operates between 12.32 and 13.84 GHz, for an 11.6% turning range. The measurements were carried out in the free-running mode, and the results show a phase noise (PN) of 118.3 dBc/Hz at a 1-MHz offset from the central frequency of 12.32 GHz. The power consumption of the VCO core is 24.5 mW, with a 0.9-V supply voltage, and this leads to a figure of merit (FoM) of 186.6 dBc/Hz.</description></item><item><title>A 360&#176; Tunable Phase Shifter With Low Phase Error Based on Bandpass Networks in 0.25- &#956;m GaN Technology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10750908</link><description>This brief presents a 360&#176; tunable phase shifter (PS) with low phase error in a 0.25- $\mu $ m GaN-on-SiC HEMT process. To achieve these features, the design incorporates two key innovations: a novel switched-bandpass phase-shifting cell (PSC) topology and a Q-learning-based optimization algorithm, both applied for the first time in monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) PS designs. The adverse effects of the charge trapping effect in GaN HEMT switches are mitigated by using a nonlinear equivalent circuit model. A PS prototype consisting of a fifth-order bandpass PSC and two third-order bandpass PSCs with a core area of  $1.25\times 2.5$  mm2 is designed, fabricated, and measured. Experimental results demonstrate a low rms phase error of less than 7.0&#176;, along with high power linearity characterized by an IP $_{\mathrm {1\,dB}}$  of 37 dBm and an IIP3 of 48 dBm, over a frequency range from 4.1 to 5.3 GHz.</description></item><item><title>A 4.86-pJ/b Energy-Efficient Fully Parallel Stochastic LDPC Decoder With Two-Stage Shared Memory</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10747408</link><description>The complex calculations of the low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoder result in significant energy and hardware consumption. To solve the challenge, this brief describes a fully parallel stochastic LDPC decoder with a two-stage shared memory (TSM) variable node (VN). To enhance cost efficiency, our design incorporates a shared low-cost random number generator (RNG) for all 2160 channels. We introduce a TSM VN function, which demonstrates faster convergence and reduced hardware overhead in comparison with the existing methods. We have taped out the (2160, 1760) stochastic LDPC decoder in the 55-nm process. The measure results exhibit that the proposed design achieves a throughput of 57.6 Gb/s, an efficiency of 33.68 Gb/s/mm2, and a power efficiency of 4.86 pJ/bit, underlining superior performance in terms of decoding throughput, hardware efficiency, and energy conservation.</description></item><item><title>Online Alignment and Addition in Multiterm Floating-Point Adders</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10750002</link><description>Multiterm floating-point (FP) addition appears in vector dot-product computations, matrix multiplications, and other forms of FP data aggregation. A critical step in multiterm floating-point addition is the alignment of fractions of the FP terms before adding them. Alignment is executed serially by identifying first the maximum of all exponents and then shifting the fraction of each term according to the difference of its exponent from the maximum one. Contrary to common practice, this work proposes a new online algorithm that splits the identification of the maximum exponent, the alignment shift for each fraction, and their addition to multiple fused incremental steps that can be computed in parallel. Each fused step is implemented by a new associative operator that allows the incremental alignment and addition for arbitrary number of operands. Experimental results show that employing the proposed align-and-add operators for the implementation of multiterm floating-point adders can improve delay or save significant area and power. The achieved area and power savings range between 3% and 23% and between 4% and 26%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Comprehensive Digital Calibration for Pipelined ADCs Using Cascaded Nonlinearity Correction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10757307</link><description>This brief presents a digital calibration for pipelined analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) utilizing the cascaded nonlinearity correction (CNC) method. By cascading three correction layers for compensating nonlinearities in different parts of pipelined ADC, it comprehensively calibrates distortion in both ADC front end and back end with a low hardware cost. In addition, this work employs a discriminative fine-tuning least-mean-square (DFT-LMS) algorithm with varying step sizes for different layers, thereby improving both the convergence speed and the accuracy. An 800-MS/s, 12-bit ring amplifier-based pipelined ADC is presented to verify the proposed calibration technique. With calibration, the SFDR has a 26.7-dB improvement at low frequency and 23.6-dB improvement at Nyquist frequency, resulting in over 6-dB improvement compared with prior-art calibration techniques. The calibration algorithm has been verified on a TSMC 28-nm CMOS process. The experimental results show that the proposed ADC calibrator has an area of  $6592~\mu $ m2 and consumes 5.31 mW at 800-MHz clock rate.</description></item><item><title>FANNS: An FPGA-Based Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search Accelerator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10885776</link><description>Approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS) based on high-dimensional vectors has been extensively utilized in data science and neural networks.

Extensive evaluations show that FANNS achieves an average of  $184.1\times $ ,  $33.0\times $ ,  $2.9\times $ , and  $2.5\times $  better energy efficiency than CPUs, GPUs, and two state-of-the-art ANNS architectures, i.e., DF-GAS and Vstore, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A 225-&#956;W Interference-Tolerant Receiver With Shared Wireless LO and Envelope-Tracking Mixer Achieving -104-dBm Sensitivity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10810369</link><description>This article presents a 915-MHz interference-tolerant receiver (RX) with a shared wireless local oscillator (LO) and an envelope-tracking (ET) mixer for low-power Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. For applications featuring a large number of RXs, the deployment of a shared wireless LO can enhance the energy efficiency of the system. The proposed ET mixer retrieves phase-following (PF) LO pulses from the wireless LO, aligning them, respectively, with the peak and valley of the radio frequency (RF) input signal. This allows the RX to track the target peak and valley envelopes of the RF input signal, improving mixer gain and conversion quality (Q). Moreover, eliminating the integrated LO conserves system power and reduces area. The RX also employs intermediate-frequency (IF) calibration to derive an adaptive IF1 LO based on the uncertain frequency of the wireless LO, thus creating a known IF2 with a narrow bandwidth to enhance sensitivity, interference tolerance, and channel selectivity. Fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, the RX achieves a sensitivity of -104 dBm with a -50-dBm wireless LO, while occupying 0.2-mm2 active area and consuming  $225~{\mu }$ W at a 10-kb/s data rate. The achieved RX figure-of-merit (FOM) is 180 dB. The sensitivity loss is within 10 dB with the wireless LO power ranging from -69 to -30 dBm. With the -50-dBm wireless LO, the RX exhibits 44- and 32-dB tolerances to 100-kb/s and 5-Mb/s on-off-keying (OOK) interference with 5-MHz offset.</description></item><item><title>An Ultra-Low-Jitter Fast-Hopping Fractional-N PLL With LC DTC and Hybrid-Proportional Paths</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10843985</link><description>This work presents an ultra-low-jitter fractional-N PLL capable of wideband fast hopping. There is an analog proportional path and a digital proportional/integral path in the PLL. The PLL is digital-path-dominant during settling and analog-path-dominant after settles; therefore, the fast-lock characteristic of the digital PLLs and the low-jitter characteristic of the analog PLLs are achieved. The frequency switching algorithm does not rely on the linearity of DCO&#8217;s tuning curve, nor rely on the hopping step between the previously locked frequency and the target frequency. The frequency detection is based on a high-speed counter, which uses the quadruple timing margin selection and can operate up to 20 GHz. The counter is integrated with a feedback clock generator, which is functionally the same as a multi-modulus divider. In addition, this work proposes an LC delay circuit as the coarse digital-to-time converter (DTC), which has better potential than the RC-based counterparts to reduce the phase noise of DTC and thereby reduce the jitter of fractional-N PLLs. The prototype is implemented in 28-nm CMOS process and occupies 0.21-mm2 core area. The measured hopping time is  $0.52~{\mu }$ s across a 3.5-GHz step with 80-ppm settling accuracy. The measured rms jitter (integrated from 1 kHz to 100 MHz) is 36.8 fs for the integer-N channel, 41.3 fs for the far-integer fractional-N channel, and 61.7 fs for the near-integer fractional-N channel. The measured near-integer fractional spur is -62.4 dBc. The measured power consumption is 34 mW.</description></item><item><title>A 5-MS/s 16-bit Low-Noise and Low-Power Split Sampling SAR ADC With Eased Driving Burden</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10843815</link><description>This article presents a 16-bit 5-MS/s successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with the proposed split sampling (SS) technique. The SS decouples the sampling and conversion operations of the ADC, effectively addressing the tradeoff among the driving burden of the digital-to-analog converter (DAC), sampling noise, power, and bit-cycling speed. The SS consists of 2 20-pF sampling capacitors and a 1-pF DAC. The sampling capacitors sample the input with low noise and cancel the kT/C noise of the DAC, avoiding the preamplifier saturation issue and easing the noise aliasing. As the sampling capacitors track the input when the DAC is performing bit-cycling, the input driving is eased with the extended tracking time. The small DAC guarantees fast speed and low power. Moreover, statistical residue measurement (SRM) is employed to reduce the preamplifier&#8217;s noise and the quantization noise, efficiently improving the signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) and the bit weight calibration accuracy. The ADC is fabricated in a 180-nm process and occupies an active area of 0.57 mm2. With the SS and SRM, the ADC samples at 5 MS/s and achieves a 93.7-dB SNDR with a 5.31-mW power consumption, yielding a high Schreier-figure-of-merit (FoM) of 180.4 dB.</description></item><item><title>A 140 dB-DR Light-to-Digital Converter Using Current-Domain Hybrid Zoom for Baseline Cancellation and Interference Compensation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10777019</link><description>Noninvasive optical sensing techniques, such as photoplethysmography (PPG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), provide great user comfort and obtain rich hemodynamic information in term of pulse oximetry, blood flow velocity, and blood vessel stiffness. Conventional optical sensor readouts have evolved toward higher dynamic range (DR) and power-efficiency. In addition to quasi-static baseline input signals, fast-varying interferences due to motion artifacts (MAs) or environment changes can also cause saturation. How to compensate or tolerate these disturbances efficiently is one of the prominent properties required in emerging optical sensors. This article presents a high DR, energy-efficient light-to-digital converter (LDC). The proposed LDC utilizes a second-order incremental delta-sigma modulator (I-DSM) for high resolution, while a power-scaling OTA is utilized to reduce power consumption of the main integrator. The current-domain static zoom (SZ) is exploited to cancel baseline currents for high DR, while the dynamic zoom (DZ) tracks and compensates the residual ac input current to prevent fast-varying interference from saturating the analog-front-end (AFE) during fine quantization. Fabricated in a standard  $0.18~\mu $ m CMOS process, the LDC achieves a very high DR of 140 dB in a 2 kHz bandwidth. Thanks to the power-scaling OTA, the signal-to-noise and distortion-ratio (SNDR) of the ac path reaches 94.55 dB with only  $44~\mu $ W from a 1.2 V supply. The benefits of SZ and DZ have been validated by chest PPG measurement with significant MAs.</description></item><item><title>A 160-MHz BW 68-dB SNDR 36.2 mW Continuous-Time Pipelined &#916;&#931; ADC With DAC Image Prefiltering</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10817558</link><description>This article reports a continuous-time (CT) pipelined delta-sigma ( $\Delta \Sigma $ ) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) featuring a proposed prefiltering scheme to tackle the DAC image issue. We introduce a fast-shunting route for high-speed DAC image current with a passive RC low-pass filter (LPF) on the quantization (QTZ) path. Together with another LPF on the signal path to align the delay, the CT front-end stage provides a residue signal with a small amplitude and smooth edges, relaxing the linearity requirements on the residue amplifier (RA) and the back-end stage. Specifically, the RC delay in the two LPFs is tracked over process variation, relaxing the signal leakage to the back end. For the back-end stage, we use an all-pass filter (APF) analog delay in a second-order CT cascade of integrators with feedforward (CIFF)  $\Delta \Sigma $  modulator (DSM) with an input feedforward path. Such an APF can restore the unity signal transfer function (STF) under the influence of excess loop delay (ELD), thus simplifying the matching requirement between analog and digital domains&#8217; transfer functions. Prototyped in a 28-nm CMOS process, the proposed ADC operates with a clock of 3.2GHz, occupying an active area of 0.104 mm2. It exhibits a 72-dB dynamic range (DR) and a 68.5-dB peak signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) over a 160-MHz bandwidth (BW). The modulator consumes 36.2 mW, yielding 165-dB Schreier figure-of-merit (FOMs) based on the SNDR.</description></item><item><title>A Single-Stage Bias-Flip Regulating Rectifier With Fully Digital Duty-Cycle-Based MPPT for Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10758432</link><description>Piezoelectric energy harvesting (PEH) has been considered a promising solution for replacing conventional batteries to power wireless sensors. A complete PEH system typically includes three stages: ac-dc rectification, maximum power point tracking (MPPT), and output voltage regulation to power the load circuits. Unfortunately, most prior works focus only on the first one or two stages. A few employ three, but unfortunately, they are in cascaded stages, which results in cascaded power efficiency loss. This article proposes a single-stage bias-flip MPPT regulating rectifier (BMRR), which integrates the active bias-flip rectification, MPPT, and output voltage regulation into one stage. The proposed BMRR transfers energy from the piezoelectric transducer (PT) directly to the output capacitor by employing fewer switches, removing the conventional bridge rectifier, and eliminating cascaded energy loss. In addition, the design was implemented in a fully digital fast-MPPT technique based on an improved duty-cycle-based (DCB) algorithm to let the PT voltage jump to the maximum power point (MPP) in only one step. The proposed BMRR rectifier was fabricated in a 180-nm BCD process. The measured results show 930% power enhancement compared to a full bridge rectifier (FBR) and 92.5% end-to-end (E2E) efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Pseudo Hysteretic Controlled Gap Time Modulated Isolated DC-DC Converter With Common-Mode Transient Immunity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10787447</link><description>A pseudo hysteretic controlled gap time modulated isolated dc-dc converter is presented. A pseudo hysteretic controller is designed to bound the output voltage with fast load transient and small output voltage ripple. It implements gap time modulation based on the load current and is used to adjust the power delivered by a Class-D power amplifier (PA) with high efficiency. A high-impedance load shift keying (LSK) scheme is also proposed with common-mode transient immunity (CMTI) to complete the global feedback loop without requiring an additional transformer or capacitor. The prototype is implemented in a standard 65-nm CMOS process. With an input voltage of 2.5 V, the proposed converter generates an isolated output voltage that ranges from 1.8 to 2.2 V with a peak efficiency of 73.3% and an output voltage ripple of only 20 mV.

CMTI is demonstrated with common-mode transients (CMTs) that measure +8 and &#8722;12 kV/ $\mu $ s.</description></item><item><title>High-Efficiency Ultrasound Energy Harvesting Interface With Auto-Calibrated Timing Control From &#8722;25 &#176;C to 85 &#176;C</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10777066</link><description>This work presents a high-efficiency ultrasound energy harvesting interface with auto-calibrated timing control, featuring: 1) the proposed  $C_{\text {P}}$  auto-calibration, consisting of the half bias-flip time ( $t_{\text {half}}$ ) detection and adaptive closed-loop time calibration (ACTC) to improve the system&#8217;s robustness against piezoelectric transducer (PZT) materials and environmental variations; 2) the proposed charge recycling (CR) bootstrapping driver to reduce conduction loss and improve the  $C_{\text {P}}$  auto-calibration accuracy as well as the peak voltage flipping efficiency ( $\eta _{\text {flip}}$ ); and 3) the proposed coarse detection and fine calibration technique to eliminate the inherent timing offset and increase the acceptable input excitation frequency range. The fabricated chip prototype in 0.18- $\mu $ m silicon on insulator (SOI) CMOS process can adapt to both PZT5A (nominal  ${C_{\text {P}}}~{\sim }~114$  pF) and PZT5H (nominal  ${C_{\text {P}}}~{\sim }~190$  pF) and is capable of operating over a wide temperature range from  ${-} 25~{^{\circ }}$ C to  $85~{^{\circ }}$ C. The proposed  $C_{\text {P}}$  auto-calibration and CR bootstrapping driver can improve the  $\eta _{\text {flip}}$  to as high as 93.6% at an output power of  $496.6~{\mu }$ W. With the proposed coarse detection and fine calibration technique, this work demonstrates a high measured peak power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 94.5%, corresponding to a ~23% improvement when compared with the prior ultrasound energy harvesting interface while achieving a favorable figure of merit (FoM) of  $8.13{\times }$ .</description></item><item><title>A Closed-Loop EMI Regulated GaN Power Converter With In Situ EMI Sensing and Global Excess-Spectrum Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10843842</link><description>As electromagnetic interference (EMI) standards evolve from the rules-based approach to the risk-based alternate, online EMI assessment and control become critical for lifetime risk management. With such a trend, this article presents an online closed-loop EMI regulation for gallium-nitride (GaN) power converter. Specifically, a wide-bandwidth in situ EMI sensor is integrated to characterize the noise through autocovariance-based spectrum analysis. A stepwise random space sampling (SRSS) significantly compresses the sensing time without sacrificing the accuracy for real-time EMI spectral characterization. Based on the online measured noise, a global excess-spectrum modulator is devised to adaptively track, and hence, continuously regulate the maximum excess noise. A prototype chip was fabricated in a 180-nm BCD process, commanding two enhancement-mode GaN power switches at a nominal frequency of 2.8 MHz. The measurement results show that the integrated in situ EMI sensor can capture the EMI spectra with a 500-MHz sampling bandwidth and 1-mV sensing accuracy while reducing the sensing time by over 25 times. Compared to the commercial spectrum analyzer, it demonstrates a maximum discrepancy of 3 dB. The embedded global excess-spectrum modulator accomplishes a 9-kHz-resolution EMI regulation, dynamically optimizing the EMI control.</description></item><item><title>A 2.5&#8211;20 kS/s In-Pixel Direct Digitization ECoG Front End With Submillisecond Stimulation Artifact Recovery</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10807162</link><description>Neural stimulation is used routinely to diagnose and treat neurological disorders. The stimulation artifacts are, however, problematic for closed-loop neuromodulation therapy, which dynamically adjusts the electrical stimulation parameters based on real-time feedback from the recorded neural activity because they can cause saturation or prolonged recovery times in traditional recording front ends. This article presents a per-pixel second-order  $\Delta \Sigma $  analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for direct digitization of neural signals, which addresses the stimulation artifact recovery time in voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)-based quantizers with a fast-recovery, overrange-detecting phase quantizer.

System- and circuit-level techniques are employed to improve energy efficiency while ensuring high-quality EEG recordings and accurate seizure detection. The wearable prototype includes digital active electrodes (DAEs) for high-dynamic-range (DR) recording, motion artifact removal (MAR), and feature extraction (FE), along with a central backend (BE) for patient-specific classification, wireless connectivity, and common-mode rejection (CMR) boosting. DAEs communicate through a time-shared data bus, minimizing wires and enabling flexible electrode placement, maximizing system scalability. Each DAE enhances recording quality with: 1) calibrated CMR boosting (&gt;80-dB common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) with 1- $M\Omega $  AE-to-AE mismatch); 2) SC notch filtering for power-line noise; 3) real-time electrode-tissue impedance (ETI) measurement for MAR and dc correction; and 4) an autoranging mechanism with 17-dB DR enhancement. In-AE FE cuts AE-to-BE communication power by 99.1%, while pulse-based frequency sampling reduces FE power by 92.1%. A neuromorphic multiplier-less adaptively boosted support vector machine (SVM) maintains high detection accuracy with 97.6% less classification power than conventional designs. The chip was implemented in 180-nm CMOS, and the wearable system components (DAE, wireless, and CMR boards) were miniaturized. Experimental testing showed IIRN ( $0.64~\mu V_{\text {rms}}$ , 0.5&#8211;100 Hz), adjustable gain/bandwidth, DR (80 dB), SNDR (74.5 dB), and CMRR (89.2 dB without mismatch, &gt;80 dB with mismatch). Measurement results also confirm the system&#8217;s effectiveness in motion artifact estimation and removal. In vivo measurements demonstrate the system&#8217;s efficacy and latency in detecting neurologically relevant events. Seizure detection results (96.4% sensitivity, 0.41 FPR, 1-s latency, zero SRAM usage) on prerecorded EEG data from 21 patients are also reported. The system is compared to state-of-the-art EEG recording and seizure detection systems, highlighting its advantages.</description></item><item><title>MANTIS: A Mixed-Signal Near-Sensor Convolutional Imager SoC Using Charge-Domain 4b-Weighted 5-to-84-TOPS/W MAC Operations for Feature Extraction and Region-of-Interest Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10750406</link><description>Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have prompted the search for enhanced algorithms and hardware to support the deployment of machine learning (ML) at the edge. More specifically, in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), vision chips must be able to fulfill the tasks of low to medium complexity, such as feature extraction (FE) or region-of-interest (RoI) detection, with a sub-mW power budget imposed by the use of small batteries or energy harvesting. Mixed-signal vision chips relying on in- or near-sensor processing have emerged as an interesting candidate because of their favorable tradeoff between energy efficiency (EE) and computational accuracy compared with digital systems for these specific tasks. In this article, we introduce a mixed-signal convolutional imager system-on-chip (SoC) codenamed MANTIS, featuring a unique combination of large  $16{\times }16~4$ b-weighted filters, operation at multiple scales, and double sampling, well suited to the requirements of medium-complexity tasks. The main contributions are (i) circuits called DS3 units combining delta-reset sampling (DRS), image downsampling (DS), and voltage downshifting and (ii) charge-domain multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations based on switched-capacitor (SC) amplifiers and charge sharing in the capacitive DAC of the successive-approximation (SAR) ADCs, MANTIS achieves peak EEs normalized to 1b operations of 4.6 and 84.1 TOPS/W at the accelerator and SoC levels, while computing feature maps (fmaps) with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) ranging from 3 to 11.3%. It also demonstrates a face RoI detection with a false negative rate (FNR) of 11.5%, while discarding 81.3% of image patches and reducing the data transmitted off chip by  $13{\times }$  compared with the raw image.</description></item><item><title>A 28-nm 16-kb Aggregation and Combination Computing-in-Memory Macro With Dual-Level Sparsity Modulation and Sparse-Tracking ADCs for GCNs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10720191</link><description>Computing-in-memory (CIM) architectures have demonstrated remarkable potential in addressing the memory wall. However, previous CIMs were often designed for multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations, which presents a myriad of challenges when deploying graph convolutional networks (GCNs) on CIM macros. This work presents a compact 6T SRAM-based aggregation and combination CIM macro (ACCIM) using: 1) a cell array with compact 6T bitcells, local jump and computing cells (LJCCs), and sparse-tracking analog-to-digital converters (STADCs) to improve energy efficiency in both input sparsity and weight bit sparsity; 2) an LJCC and STADC to improve the signal margin; 3) a CIM macro architecture with an aggregation input unit (AGINU) to support both GCN aggregation and GCN combination/convolutional neural network (CNN) MAC; 4) a graph pruning algorithm that divides the graph data into memory-friendly subgraphs; and 5) an error modeling-based pre-training method to improve the inference accuracy. A fabricated 28-nm 16-kb charge-domain SRAM-CIM macro achieved an energy efficiency of 86.87 TOPS/W and an area efficiency of 2344 GOPS/mm2 for GCNs with 4-bit degree input, 8-bit features, and 15-bit output.</description></item><item><title>BEE-SLAM: A 65-nm 17.96-TOPS/W Location-Sharing-Based Multi-Agent Neuromorphic SLAM Accelerator for Swarm Robotics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10786265</link><description>Multi-agent (MA) simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) has been rigorously explored to enhance map accuracy in swarm robotics. Although centralized MA SLAM systems, which depend on a server for complex computations in map optimization, have been extensively studied, the circuit-domain approaches to decentralized MA SLAM systems are still limited due to challenges such as limited memory capacity and security vulnerabilities in wireless inter-agent data transmission. Thus, we propose a BEE-SLAM accelerator, a location-sharing MA neuromorphic SLAM accelerator inspired by bee communication for decentralized MA SLAM systems. The location-sharing-based MA error correction (MAEC) is employed to attain accurate map results without loop closure with a 94.81% reduced number of operations compared to the global map-based MA SLAM. In addition, a  $7 {\times } 7$  pulsewidth modulation (PWM)-based hybrid mixed-signal/digital pose-cell (HY-PC) array with pseudo pose cells (PPCs) achieves  $2.04{\times }$  energy efficiency compared to the oscillatory pose-cell array.

With higher spike input sparsity and the utilization of accumulation (AC)-only operations, DSNNs have great potential for achieving high energy efficiency. Many researchers have proposed neuromorphic processors to accelerate spiking neural networks (SNNs) with dedicated architectures. However, three problems still exist when processing DSNNs, including redundant memory access among timesteps, inefficiency in exploiting unstructured sparsity in spikes, and the lack of optimizations for new operators involved in DSNNs. In this work, an accelerator for deep and sparse SNNs is proposed with three design features: a 3-D computation array that allows parallel computation of multiple timesteps to maximize weight data reuse and reduce external memory access; a parallel non-zero data fetcher that efficiently searches non-zero spike positions and fetches corresponding weights to reduce computation latency; and a multimode unified computation scheduler that can be configured to maximize energy efficiency for spiking convolution (SCONV), spiking  $Q, K,~\text {and}~V$  matrix generation, and spiking self-attention (SSA). The accelerator is implemented and fabricated using 40-nm CMOS technology. When compared with state-of-the-art sparse processors, it achieves the best energy efficiency of 0.078 pJ/SOP and the highest recognition accuracy of 77.6% on ImageNet using the spiking transformer algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Hawkeye: A Point Cloud Neural Network Processor With Virtual Pillar and Quadtree-Based Workload Management for Real-Time Outdoor BEV Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10807164</link><description>Large-scale 3-D processing using the point cloud neural network (PNN) has become essential for applications such as an autonomous driving system. Among the various methods, pillar-based PNN is widely utilized for processing large-scale outdoor environments. However, due to the irregular and sparse nature of the point cloud compared to the regular and dense image, achieving high efficiency has been challenging in previous works. Inspired by the LiDAR mechanism that generates point clouds, this article proposes Hawkeye, a large-scale bird&#8217;s-eye-view (BEV) detection processor designed for end-to-end processing of pillar-based PNN. Hawkeye incorporates three key features: 1) a feature encoding core (FEC) that introduces virtual pillars (VPs), dynamically generating temporal pillars to facilitate continuous processing; 2) a map management core (MMC) that utilizes a quadtree-based workload management system, enabling region-of-interest (ROI)-based skipping to optimize computational efficiency; and 3) a low-precision neural engine (LPNE) that employs a bit-slice compute architecture with sign-magnitude (SM) representation, enhancing slice-level skipping (SLS) capabilities. Fabricated in Samsung&#8217;s 28-nm CMOS technology, Hawkeye achieves a performance of 44.2 frames per second (FPS) at 320 MHz on the PointPillars with the KITTI dataset. Furthermore, with the aid of ROI-based skipping and SM-based SLS, Hawkeye demonstrates an effective energy efficiency of 38.5 TOPS/W under 0.74 V and 40 MHz.</description></item><item><title>A Scalable BEV Perception Processor for Image/Point Cloud Fusion Applications Using CAM-Based Universal Mapping Unit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10807165</link><description>The integration of multi-sensor data like image and point cloud for information complementarity is crucial for 3-D perception scenarios like autonomous driving. Recently, bird&#8217;s eye view (BEV)-based sensor fusion is attracting more and more attention but the significant computational overhead constrains their widespread application at the edge. First, there are numerous irregular memory access operations in BEV fusion networks. For example, sparse convolutions (SCONVs) in the point cloud branch and irregular BEV plane mapping result in significant memory addressing and mapping overhead. Furthermore, multi-sensor fusion leads to rapid expansion of model size, making it difficult and expensive for single-chip solutions to meet the demands. Based on the above challenges, this work proposes an image and point cloud fusion processor with two highlights: a content addressable memory (CAM)-based deep fusion core to accelerate a variety of irregular BEV operations and chip-level parallelism design supporting flexible interconnect topology. The proposed chip is fabricated in 28-nm CMOS technology. Compared with existing image or point cloud accelerators, the proposed chip achieves higher frequency,  $2\times $  higher area efficiency, and  $2.61\times $  higher energy efficiency for sparse point cloud processing. To the best of authors&#8217; knowledge, this work is the first accelerator for BEV-based multi-modal fusion networks.</description></item><item><title>A 70&#8211;86-GHz Deep-Noise-Canceling LNA With Dual-Stage Noise Cancellation Using Asymmetric Compensation Transformer and 4-to-1 Hybrid-Phase Combiner</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10637256</link><description>In this article, a 70&#8211;86-GHz deep-noise-canceling low noise amplifier (LNA) is presented to reduce the noise contributions from the multi-stage amplifiers under low transistor  $g_{m}$  at mm-wave. Such an LNA consists of dual-stage noise-canceling topology, i.e., an asymmetric common-gate (CG)-based noise-canceling stage and a resistive feedback noise-canceling stage. The asymmetric compensation transformer (ACT) is utilized in the CG-based noise-canceling stage to compensate the amplitude and phase imbalances, thereby enhancing the noise-canceling ratio. In addition, the second stage based on resistive feedback noise-canceling operation with a 4-to-1 hybrid-phase combiner (HPC) is introduced to reduce the transistor noise contribution, especially improving noise performance at mm-wave band. Based on the aforementioned mechanism, a deep-noise-canceling LNA is implemented and fabricated using a conventional 40-nm CMOS technology. The proposed LNA exhibits a 4.8&#8211;6.5-dB noise figure (NF) within the operation frequency range of 70&#8211;86-GHz. The peak gain is 16.5 dB, while the peak input 1-dB compression point (IP $_{1\,\text {dB}}$ ) is &#8722;8.5 dBm. The power consumption is 25 mW under a 1.1-V supply, which occupies a compact core area of 0.085 mm2.</description></item><item><title>A 6.5-to-8-GHz Cascaded Dual-Fractional-N Digital PLL Achieving &#8722;52.79-dBc Fractional Spur With 50-MHz Reference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10659739</link><description>This work presents a 6.5-to-8-GHz cascaded dual-fractional-N digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) that avoids fractional spur degradation in near-integer channels by utilizing two PLLs with fractional frequency control words (FCWs). The FCWs of the two PLLs are carefully selected to achieve the optimal fractional spur performance at the output. A 14-bit segmented digital-to-time converter (DTC) with a background nonlinearity calibration achieving a 0.05% integral nonlinearity (INL) is proposed for further fractional spur suppression. This work achieves an integrated jitter of 154.4 fs in integer-N mode and an integrated jitter of 190.8 fs in fractional-N mode, respectively. It consumes 14.2 mW with a 50-MHz reference, leading to a figure of merit (FoM) of &#8722;242.9 dB. The fractional spur at near-integer channel is as low as &#8722;52.79 dBc, and the reference spur is &#8722;72.4 dBc. This PLL is implemented in a 65-nm CMOS process, occupying 0.48-mm2 core area.</description></item><item><title>A 0.69-Noise-Efficiency-Factor 55&#215; -Preamp-Gain Dynamic Comparator With a Stacking FIA</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10659080</link><description>This article presents a fully dynamic, low-noise, low-power comparator. Its key highlight is the four-times current-reuse factor, which improves the pre-amplifier gain by at least two times without increasing the power consumption. This causes the proposed design to have a two-times smaller input-referred noise and a two-times better noise-efficiency factor (energy  $\times $  noise power). In prior comparators, the maximum current-reuse factor of the pre-amplifier was only two times. This small current-reuse factor limits the pre-amplifier gain to 30 times, which restricts the further improvement in the noise-efficiency factor. By contrast, this work stacks two floating inverter amplifiers (FIAs) in order to greatly increase the current-reuse factor to as large as four times. As a result, the pre-amplifier gain is increased by 55 times, which is helpful for improving the noise-efficiency factor. Implemented in a 28 nm CMOS process, the prototype comparator achieves a  $38~{\mu }$ V input-referred noise and a 0.48 pJ energy consumption per comparison under a 0.9 V supply. The noise-efficiency factor is as good as 0.69 nJ $\cdot \mu $ V2, which is three times better than the prior FIA-based comparator and 23 times better than the classic StrongArm latch (SA latch). This noise-efficiency factor is the best among all reported works so far.</description></item><item><title>An Isolated DC-DC Converter With Full-Duplex Communication Using a Single Pair of Transformers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10645969</link><description>This article presents a 200-MHz isolated dc-dc converter for simultaneous power and full-duplex data transfer using a single pair of transformers, for the applications of low-cost galvanic isolation.

However, contemporary decoder designs encounter challenges due to the demanding hardware resources required by their high processing complexity. In this work, we propose a novel column-wise trellis min-max (CW-TMM) algorithm, which significantly reduces the sorter overheads in the existing TMM method without degrading the error-correcting power. We also deploy the message compression to the trellis-based algorithm for effectively reducing hardware costs, even allowing the storage-aware long codes by accommodating large-sized on-chip memories. Through the integration of advanced low-cost optimization schemes together, the prototype CW-TMM decoder in a 28-nm CMOS technology for 4-kB 0.9-rate NB-LDPC codes demonstrates a 54% reduction in on-chip memory size and a 63% decrease in decoding complexity, enhancing the area efficiency by more than 2.4 times than the state-of-the-art approaches.</description></item><item><title>Compute SNDR-Boosted 22-nm MRAM-Based In-Memory Computing Macro Using Statistical Error Compensation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10642976</link><description>The accuracy of embedded non-volatile memory (eNVM) in-memory computing (IMC) designs is primarily limited by analog non-idealities. This article introduces a magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) IMC macro in 22-nm featuring offset-compensating current sensing (OCCS) to reduce the static analog-to-digital converter (ADC) column mismatch and a low-overhead statistical error compensation (SEC) block compensating for non-linearity arising due to bitline/source-line (BL/SL) wire parasitics. Both assist in enhancing the bank-level compute signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio (SNDR). As the inner dimension of the matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) increases, the compute SNDR reduces due to increased location-dependent non-linearity arising from BL/SL wire parasitics. An SEC-enabled SNDR boost of 2.7&#8211;6 dB is obtained over different operating points. This boost can be balanced to achieve a substantial  $5\times $  reduction in energy per 1-b operation while incurring a modest SEC energy overhead of 0.8% and area overhead of 12.2%. Finally, the study demonstrates an SEC-enabled increase in neural network (NN) accuracy from 74.8% to 82.0% for CIFAR-10 by last layer mapping of ResNet-20, without resorting to noise-aware training.</description></item><item><title>A 1.8% FAR, 2 ms Decision Latency, 1.73 nJ/Decision Keywords-Spotting (KWS) Chip Incorporating Transfer-Computing Speaker Verification, Hybrid-IF-Domain Computing and Scalable 5T-SRAM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638323</link><description>This article reports a keyword-spotting (KWS) chip with a significantly reduced false alarm rate (FAR) for voice-control edge devices. The key techniques are threefold: 1) transfer-computing speaker verification (SV)-assisted KWS that compresses the required parameters and enhances the KWS+SV computation efficiency while maintaining the KWS accuracy and reducing the overall FAR; 2) hybrid-IF-domain computing that handles both the analog and digital input features (IFs), alleviating the tradeoff between the computation power and system accuracy of the first layer; and 3) scalable 5T-SRAM array that sustains the leakage and read power when it is upscaled.

While variability dominates the failure probability, noise-induced bit flips in weakened bitcells lead to dynamic instability. We study both effects jointly in a unified SPICE simulation framework. Starting from a synthetic representation of process variations introduced in a previous work, we identify the cases of poor noise immunity that require thorough noise analyses. Relying on a rigorous and systematic methodology, we simulate them in the time domain so as to emulate a true data retention operation. Short times to failure, unacceptable for a practical ultra-low-power memory system application, are recorded. The transient bit-flip mechanism is analyzed and a dynamic failure criterion involving the unstable steady state is established. We conclude that, beyond static variability, the dynamic noise inflates defectiveness among SRAM bitcells. Then, a stochastic nonlinear model, fully characterizable from conventional deterministic SPICE simulations, is presented. We then leverage it to efficiently and accurately predict the mean time to failure with an analytical Eyring-Kramers formula, recently extended to account for the varying-noise behavior of nonlinear systems.</description></item><item><title>Compact Reconfigurable Dual-Band MMIC SPDT/SP4T Switches With On-Chip Coupled-Line Structure in GaN-on-SiC HEMT Technology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10767850</link><description>This paper presents the design and analysis of dual-band monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) switches, including a single pole double throw (SPDT) and a single pole four throw (SP4T). With a novel on-chip coupled-line (OCL) topology, the input signal can be switched into low- or high-band paths to create dual-band characteristics. By carefully selecting the electrical lengths of OCLs and device size for corresponding shunt-FETs, the operating frequencies for low- and high-bands can be determined. This brings about improved insertion loss (IL) and isolation (ISO) in a compact structure. With the proposed techniques, two switch prototypes have been designed and fabricated in a 0.25- $\mu $ m GaN-on-SiC process for high-power capability. The SPDT consists of a low-band path and a high-band path. It achieves an average IL/ISO of 1.0/32 dB with the best input 1-dB compression points (IP1dB) of 37.2 dBm at a low-band of DC-15 GHz; and an average IL/ISO of 2.0/28.5 dB with the best IP1dB of 32.8 dBm at a high-band of 20-40 GHz, respectively. The return loss is better than 11 dB for each port. The SP4T achieves a fully integrated dual-band transmit/receive (T/R) switch with doubled low-/high-band paths.

Unfortunately, the inherent quantization behavior and integral nonlinearity associated with the DTC mean that the aforementioned QE cannot be canceled exactly; inevitably, the residual error gives rise to additional PN and spurious tonal phenomena. This tutorial paper uses DTC macromodels to analyze and distinguish the DTC&#8217;s sources of nonideality and the distinct adverse spectral responses induced by them. Different DTC enhancement techniques are shown to mitigate certain types of nonideality. A comprehensive design strategy incorporating these techniques is proposed, which mitigates the revealed excess PN and spurs introduced by the DTC&#8217;s nonidealities. The enhanced DTC enables the fractional-N DPLL to approach the fractional-spur-free integer-N PN performance limit. Behavioral simulations at both DTC-block and PLL-system levels confirm our analysis.</description></item><item><title>A High-Frequency CMOS Meminductor Emulator for Spiking Neuron</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10681228</link><description>This research introduces a high-frequency CMOS meminductor, utilizing operational transconductance amplifiers and two grounded capacitors, thereby avoiding traditional components such as memristors, multipliers, and resistors.

To achieve this, event-driven SoCs that exploit the time-sparse nature of biosignals such as the electrocardiogram (ECG) have been proposed; they only process the signal when it shows activity. Such SoCs convert time-sparse biosignals into spike trains, on which spiking neural networks (SNNs) can perform event-driven signal classification. State-of-the-art event-driven SoCs, however, still suffer from poor area and power efficiency and use inflexible, hard-coded spike-encoding schemes. To improve on these challenges, this paper presents FREYA, an 8-channel event-driven SoC for end-to-end sensing of time-sparse biosignals. The proposed SoC consists of the following key contributions: 1) an 8-channel time-division-multiplexed level-crossing sampling (LCS) analog-to-spike converter (ASC) that encodes analog input signals into input spikes for an on-chip SNN; 2) an ASC spike-encoding algorithm that is fully programmable in resolution (4 to 8 bits) and conversion algorithm (offset and decay parameters); 3) an on-chip integrated, flexible SNN processor based on a programmable crossbar architecture, that allows for efficient event-driven processing, and that can be reconfigured towards multiple sensing applications; 4) a custom offline end-to-end training framework for the fast retraining of the spike-encoding algorithm and SNN architecture towards new applications or patient-dependent signal variations. A prototype IC has been fabricated in a 40nm CMOS technology. It has a per-channel active area of 0.023 mm2 (0.184 mm2 in total), a  $7\times $  improvement over the state of the art. For the use case of ECG-based QRS-labeling, a detection accuracy of 98.67% is achieved, while the system consumes  $20.8~\mu $ W per channel and achieves a latency of only 80 ms, thus paving the way for multi-channel, high-fidelity, event-driven SoCs in biomedical applications.</description></item><item><title>An 840-to-970 MHz Multimodal Wake-Up Receiver With a Q-Equalized Antenna-ED Interface and 2-Dimensional Wake-Up Identification</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10695452</link><description>The article introduces an antenna-envelope detector (ED) co-designed wake-up receiver (WuRX) that can automatically detect the frequency-hopping sequence from 840 to 970 MHz. Prototyped in 65nm CMOS, the WuRX supports three modes: 1) low-power mode that achieves &#8722;68 dBm sensitivity with 9.9nW power consumption, 2) Q-enhanced mode that provides 22 dB rejection to an on-off-keying (OOK) modulated pseudo-random-bit-sequence blocker at 10 MHz offset and 41 dB rejection to a continuous-wave one at 10 MHz offset, with a power consumption of  $39.6~\mu $ W and 3) 2-stage wake-up mode that combines the advantages of both the low-power mode and Q-enhanced mode, with a power consumption of 33.7 nW. These characteristics are achieved by exploiting 1) an antenna-ED interface where the Q-factor of the antenna is equal to the Q-factor of the capacitor to ensure a conjugate matching condition for the maximum available power transfer from the antenna to the ED, 2) a frequency tuner connected to the antenna-ED interface calibrated by a frequency-locked loop, and 3) a Q-booster reconfigured from the frequency tuner for boosting the passive gain and narrowing the bandwidth of the interface.</description></item><item><title>IIP2-Calibration-Free 5G NR Cellular Receiver Front-End With Mixer-Sharing Global N-Path Notch Filter Feedback Achieving +72 dBm IIP2</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10689721</link><description>In this article, a new input-referred second-order intercept point (IIP2)-calibration-free receiver (RX) front-end employing mixer-sharing N-path notch filter feedback is proposed for 5G new radio (NR) cellular applications. An RX front-end architecture with a high-Q N-path RF filtering low-noise amplifier (LNA) enhances the overall IIP2 performance of the RX via the blocker filtering. However, the local oscillator (LO) chain burden increases with the number of switches in the N-path filter. The main down-conversion mixers are reused as part of switches for the N-path notch filter, reducing the LO chain burden and current consumption. The RX front-end comprises a balun-LNA, main down-conversion passive mixers driven by 25% duty-cycle LO signals, isolation resistors, and transimpedance amplifiers. Additional high-pass filters, up-conversion mixers, and reused down-conversion mixers form the global N-path notch filter feedback. Fabricated using a 65 nm CMOS process, the RX front-end was primarily characterized for the mid band of 5G NR sub-6 GHz cellular applications. It achieved a noise figure of 3.67 dB, a conversion gain of 44.7 dB, and an out-of-band input-referred third-order intercept point of 15.35 dBm. Additionally, an IIP2 of &gt;72 dBm was obtained without calibration. The RX front-end drew a 13.83 mA bias current from a 1 V nominal supply voltage, with a 0.45 mm2 active die area.</description></item><item><title>A 0.0375-pJ/bit Charge-Steering Based Hybrid for 8-Gb/s/pin Full-Duplex Chip-to-Chip Interconnects in 65-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10707596</link><description>This paper presents an energy-efficient, half-rate charge-steering logic (HR-CSL) based echo cancellation hybrid (ECH) circuit topology for full-duplex(FD) signaling across chip-to-chip interconnects. The proposed charge-steering logic (CSL) based hybrid has much lower power consumption compared to conventional current-mode logic (CML) and voltage-mode logic (VML) based hybrid implementations, thanks to the discrete nature of CSL hybrid topology avoiding direct current path between  $V_{DD}$  and ground.

The rectifying efficiency can be boosted by the hybrid power source excitation, thereby increasing DC output power compared to standalone power source. A fan-shaped omnidirectional antenna and a hybrid single shunt-diode rectifier are designed to realize energy receiving and rectifying, respectively. A prototype is implemented and measured. The receiving part can achieve 2.29-dBi peak gain and 0.92-dB non-roundness at 1.85 GHz. It can also work smoothly when the wind speed varies from 0 to 12 m/s. The RF-DC conversion efficiency at -20 dBm and AC-DC output voltage at 12 m/s are measured as 20% and 79 mV, respectively. When both RF and wind power sources are accessible, the hybrid DC output power of 1.0 uW can be obtained with -30-dBm RF power and 10m/s wind speed. Moreover, the output power at hybrid rectifying mode is higher than that of simply superimposed RF and wind energy. Efficiency gain of up to 182% can be achieved.

Carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CN-MOSFETs) with high scalability, energy-efficiency, and low process thermal budget are attractive to realize high-dense monolithic three-dimensional (M3D) SRAM-CIM. However, CN-MOSFETs possess unique process variations with asymmetric spatial correlations which can significantly influence the performance and reliability of carbon-based SRAM-CIM. In this paper, new M3D-4N4P SRAM-CIM cells with CN-MOSFETs are proposed with optimized profiles for achieving ultra-high integration density while preserving robustness of data-access and computation. Furthermore, the variation-aware bit-wise data-mapping method is proposed for enhancing the performance of carbon-based SRAM-CIM by leveraging the spatial correlations of CN-MOSFETs. By minimizing the area skew of vertically-stacked layers, the areas of proposed M3D-4N4P SRAM-CIM cells are reduced by up to 50.32% compared to the previous 6N2P SRAM-CIM cells assuming carbon nanotube transistor technology. The proposed M3D-4N4P SRAM-CIM array also achieves by up to  $2.17\times $  higher throughput on arithmetic operations and 18.34% lower computing latency with 25.36% reduced energy consumptions on MAC-based benchmarks, respectively, compared to the previous 2D-6N2P SRAM-CIM array.</description></item><item><title>A 2.793 &#956;W Near-Threshold Neuronal Population Dynamics Trajectory Filter for Reliable Simultaneous Localization and Mapping</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10767866</link><description>This work presents an algorithm hardware co-design implementing a digital neuronal population dynamics simulator intended for the trajectory error correction task within a simultaneous localization and mapping workflow.

Transformer-based IR methods have significantly improved the visual effects of the restored images. However, deploying complex IR models on edge devices is challenging due to massive parameters and intensive computations. Moreover, existing accelerators are typically customized for a single task, resulting in severe resource underutilization when executing multiple tasks. Therefore, this paper develops an algorithm-hardware co-design framework to accelerate a novel CNN-Transformer cooperative model for multiple IR tasks. Firstly, on the algorithm level, an Efficient Restoration Foundational Model (ERFM) is proposed to recover corrupted images from various degradations with low model complexity. Secondly, to guide adaptive corruption removal, a novel prompt learning scheme is introduced to fuse context-related degradation cues and boost high-quality reconstruction. Thirdly, on the hardware level, an integer approximation method is proposed to avoid expensive hardware overhead caused by complex nonlinear operations, such as layer normalization and softmax while maintaining comparable IR quality. Moreover, a head stationary dataflow and softmax fusion mechanism are designed to reduce data movement and enhance on-chip resource utilization. Finally, an overall hardware architecture is developed and implemented in TSMC 28 nm CMOS technology. Experimental results show that our ERFM achieves better visual perception than other baselines on seven challenging IR tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. Moreover, compared to other accelerators for vision Transformers, our design can achieve  $3.3\times $  and  $3.7\times $  improvements in throughput and energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>HAST: A Hardware-Efficient Spatio-Temporal Correlation Near-Sensor Noise Filter for Dynamic Vision Sensors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10812040</link><description>The Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) is a bio-inspired image sensor which has many advantages such as high dynamic range, high bandwidth, high temporal resolution and low power consumption for Internet of Video Things and Edge Computing applications. However, spuriously generated Background Activity (BA) noise events can significantly degrade the quality of DVS output and cause unnecessary computations throughout the image processing chain, reducing its energy efficiency. Near-sensor filters can mitigate this problem by preventing the BA noise events from reaching downstream stages. In this paper, we propose a novel, hardware-efficient, spatio-temporal correlation filter (HAST) for near-sensor BA noise filtering. It uses compact two-dimensional binary arrays along with simple, arithmetic-free hash-based functions for storage and retrieval operations. This approach eliminates the need to use timestamps for determining the chronological order of events. HAST uses much lower memory and energy compared to other hardware-friendly filters (BAF/STCF) while matching their performance in simulations with standard datasets; for a sensor of resolution  $346\times 260$  pixels, it requires only 5&#8211;18% of their memory, and about 15% of their energy per event for correlation time  $\tau $  ranging from 1 to 50 ms. The memory and energy gains of the filter increase with sensor resolution. In FPGA implementation, HAST achieves about 29% higher throughput than BAF/STCF while utilizing only about 5% of their memory. The filter parameter values can be chosen by Design Space Exploration (DSE) for optimized performance-resource trade-offs based on application requirements.</description></item><item><title>A Graph-Based Accelerator of Retinex Model With Bit-Serial Computing for Image Enhancements</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10857689</link><description>This work proposes the Poisson equation formulation of the Retinex model for image enhancements using a low-power graph hardware accelerator performing finite difference updates on a lattice graph processing element (PE) array. By encapsulating the underlying algorithm in a graph hardware structure, a highly localized dataflow that takes advantage of the physical placement of the PEs is enabled to minimize data movement and maximize data reuse. The on-chip dataflow that achieves data sharing, and reuse among neighboring PEs during massively parallel updates is generated in each PE driven by two external control signals. Using a custom accumulator design intended for bit-serial computing, this work enables precision on demand and extensive on-chip data reuse with minimal area overhead, accommodating a non-overlap image mapping scheme in which a  $20\times 20$  image tile can be processed without external memory access at a time.

At this stage, it is difficult for a single silicon-based chip to reach the density of the human brain, so it is important to improve the area efficiency of neuromorphic chips. We present a novel neuromorphic hardware that employs high area-efficiency chain RRAM synaptic array, and compact RRAM-based neurons. The proposed chain RRAM structure achieves a small cell size of 41.5F2 at 28 nm logic process. Compared to the conventional 1T1R structure, the chain structure has a 22.2% area reduction and a 58.8% parasitic capacitance reduction. As for the neuron design, we use RRAM instead of the capacitor to integrate membrane voltage.

In the first stage, the thermally-aware placement, comprehending key design indexes encompassing area, peak temperature, temperature uniformity, and wire routing constrained by multicommodity flow constraints of multi-dies, is addressed. In the second stage, the transmission matrix method is first utilized to characterize the impedance of the hierarchic power delivery network based on the determined chip architecture from the first stage. Then, the initial impedance of the observed port, directly correlated with simultaneous switching noise, is reduced by the layout optimization of on-chip decoupling capacitances. Following this, a benchmark case is established to validate the design framework and its embedded algorithm from multiple perspectives.

However, this method consumes a significant amount of energy, and the power consumption increases under higher currents, limiting its applicability. To address this vital problem, a wide-range self-powered current measurement method is proposed in this work. The dual-core structure-based self-powered current measurement system integrates a magnetic field energy harvester (MFEH) and a current measurer (CM). In this system, the windings of the MFEH and the CM are connected in series, and the induced current of the MFEH is multiplexed. On one hand, it flows through the load for energy harvesting. Simultaneously, it flows into the CM, reducing the magnetic field within the air gap, and thereby broadening the range of current measurements. Besides, the equivalent circuit model of the dual-core structure is established to analyze the principles of current measurement and energy harvesting. Subsequently, a voltage regulation circuit based on an active rectifier is implemented, which can mitigate the saturation of the magnetic core over a wide current range. A laboratory prototype is built to verify the effectiveness of the proposal. The results show that the output voltage can be maintained at 3.3 V, ensuring stable voltage output. At 300 Arms, the maximum harvesting power reaches 1.83 W. Additionally, the upper limit of the measured current can reach 600 Arms, with a maximum error of 0.54%.</description></item><item><title>On the Effect of Memory Error in a Time-Interleaved Pipeline ADC With a Shared Residue Amplifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10833849</link><description>Compared to traditional time-interleaved (TI) pipeline ADC, shared residue amplifier (RA) architecture is potentially more power efficient and requires simpler calibration. However, the shared RA architecture suffers from memory error, which severely degrades its linearity. Typically, a reset phase is needed at the RA&#8217;s input to avoid this memory error. The reset phase is particularly problematic for high-speed ADCs as it shortens the amplification time, leading to higher power consumption in the RA.

Based on the analysis, the saved power consumption from the XO buffer can be utilized to improve the PN of the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), which compensates for the in-band PN degradation induced by the  $C_{\mathrm { S}}$  reduction. Based on this theme, we can reduce the total power consumption of the RS-PLL and the XO buffer without degrading the output root-mean-square (RMS) jitter by reducing  $C_{\mathrm { S}}$  if a VCO with a high figure-of-merit (FoM) and a low  $1/{f}^{3}$  PN corner frequency is available.

However, the side-channel attacks (SCAs) on its implementation are still needed to be well considered for the upcoming migration. In this brief, we propose a secure and efficient hardware implementation for Kyber by incorporating a novel compact shuffling architecture. First of all, we modify the Fisher-Yates shuffle to make it more hardware-friendly. We then design an optimized shuffling architecture for the well-known open-source Kyber hardware implementation to enhance the security of all known and potential side-channel leakage points. Finally, we implement the modified Kyber design on FPGA and evaluate its security and performance. The security is verified by conducting correlation power analysis (CPA) and test vector leakage assessment (TVLA) on the hardware. Meanwhile, FPGA place-and-route results show that the proposed design reports only 8.7% degradation on the hardware efficiency compared with the original unprotected version, much better than existing hardware hiding schemes.</description></item><item><title>An Edge Neuromorphic Processor With High-Accuracy On-Chip Aggregate-Label Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10841405</link><description>Neuromorphic computing with bio-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) offers an energy-efficient paradigm for edge intelligence. But, achieving practically high on-chip SNN learning accuracy with limited hardware resources still remains challenging. To tackle this issue, this brief proposes an edge neuromorphic processor architecture enabling computationally-simple optimized aggregate-label (AL) algorithm to realize high-accuracy on-chip learning. To maximize utilization of multicore resources and minimize processing latency, our processor adopts techniques including uniform neuron-core mapping, layer-alternating workflow, time-step pipeline and event-driven scheme. We benchmarked our processor on an FPGA device, and attained high on-chip learning accuracies of 97.21%, 88.1%, 90.92%, 100% and 99.22% on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, ETH-80, ORL-10, and Yale-10 datasets, respectively, using a small 2-layer fully-connected (FC) SNN, with a moderate resource cost and a relatively high energy efficiency. These results indicate that our design is very useful for many self-adaptive edge systems.</description></item><item><title>Security Control for Networked Nonhomogeneous Stochastic Switching Power Systems With DoS Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856239</link><description>The security control is studied for discrete nonhomogeneous semi-Markov switching power systems under network attacks. In view of time-varying transition probability, a nonhomogeneous semi-Markov chain is introduced to accurately model transient faults of power lines and dynamic switching of circuit breakers. Due to the random nature of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, Bernoulli process is adopted to characterize the attacks behavior. Based on the semi-Markov kernel and Lyapunov function depending on the current system mode and dwell time, sufficient conditions for the existence of the controller are derived to ensure the mean-square stability of the closed-loop system. Finally, the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed control strategy are verified by a numerical case.</description></item><item><title>Minimum Unit Capacitance Calculation for Capacitor Arrays in Binary-Weighted and Split DACs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10716014</link><description>The layout area and power consumption of a charge-scaling digital-to-analog converter (DAC) is typically dominated by the capacitor array. For a binary-weighted DAC, since the number of unit capacitors in the array increases exponentially with the number of bits, minimizing the size of the unit capacitor is crucial for controlling the layout area. A split DAC uses many fewer unit capacitors than the binary-weighted DAC, but requires the use of noninteger multiples of a unit capacitance; the choice of unit capacitor remains an important consideration. Smaller capacitors can be susceptible to larger amounts of noise and process mismatch, and can also be affected by mismatch in the parasitics of routing wires that connect the capacitors in the array: the latter is particularly significant in FinFET nodes. Together, these factors can degrade critical DAC performance metrics unless the unit capacitor is sufficiently large. This work proposes a systematic approach for selecting the unit capacitance value in both binary-weighted and split capacitor arrays for charge-scaling DACs. The proposed method selects a value that optimizes the nonlinearity metrics of a DAC, accounting for multiple factors that contribute to mismatch, flicker noise, and thermal noise. Our results demonstrate that by using a systematic methodology to size the unit capacitor, it is possible to overcome shifts due to process variation and noise for 6-bit to 14-bit DACs. Particularly for higher-resolution DACs, it is seen that the minimum unit capacitor value for binary-weighted DACs is lower than for split DACs, but the former incurs much larger area costs since it contains a significantly larger number of unit capacitors.</description></item><item><title>On-Device Training of Fully Quantized Deep Neural Networks on Cortex-M Microcontrollers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10726519</link><description>On-device training of deep neural networks (DNNs) allows models to adapt and fine tune to newly collected data or changing domains while deployed on microcontroller units (MCUs). However, DNN training is a resource-intensive task, making the implementation and execution of DNN training algorithms on MCUs challenging due to low processor speeds, constrained throughput, limited floating-point support, and memory constraints. In this work, we explore on-device training DNNs for different sized Cortex-M MCUs (Cortex-M0+, Cortex-M4, and Cortex-M7). We present a method that enables efficient training of DNNs completely in place on the MCU using fully quantized training (FQT) and dynamic partial gradient updates. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on multiple vision and time-series datasets and provide insights into the tradeoff between training accuracy, memory overhead, energy, and latency on real hardware. The results show that compared to related work, our approach requires 34.8% less memory and has a 49.0% lower latency per training sample, with dynamic partial gradient updates allowing a speedup of up to 8.7 compared to fully updating all weights.</description></item><item><title>A Q-Learning-Based Display Energy Optimization Scheme for Android Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10734375</link><description>Mobile devices have gained immense popularity in recent years and have become an integral part of people&#8217;s daily lives. This surge in usage presents new challenges for energy conservation, particularly concerning the screens of mobile phones. Not only are screens being used for longer durations, but also their adjustment needs to be dynamically conducted during runtime. Existing approaches for display energy optimization mainly focus on the display content while disregarding user interactions. This limitation prevents the full exploitation of opportunities to reduce screen energy consumption during runtime. Detection-based display energy optimization approaches incorporate user interactions to some extent. However, these approaches require additional hardware and offer relatively coarse-grained control. To address these challenges, we propose QLEO, a Q-learning-based runtime display energy optimization scheme for Android systems. QLEO takes both the display and user interaction features into account. By dynamically classifying the user state into active and idle states based on these features, we enable adaptive screen brightness adjustments according to the user&#8217;s current state. We formulate display energy optimization as a constrained dynamic optimization problem and propose an integrated Q-learning model to effectively solve it. QLEO is designed as a module within the hardware abstraction layer, capable of obtaining display and user interaction features from the upper Android framework, and directly controlling the screen brightness through the underlying Linux kernel. We have implemented QLEO on real hardware and released the source code for public access. The experimental results demonstrate that QLEO achieves significant energy reduction without compromising the user experience.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Branch-and-Bound Routing Optimization Method for Optical NoCs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10729843</link><description>Silicon photonics-based optical networks-on-chip (ONoCs) are emerging as a power-efficient on-chip communication architecture for the next generation of chip multiprocessors. However, the thermal sensitivity of photonic devices presents power consumption challenges. Existing routing schemes optimized for optical power loss tend to avoid passing through high-temperature nodes, which in turn leads to contention at low-temperature nodes. It remains a crucial challenge to develop an adaptive routing algorithm that strikes a balance between the power consumption optimization and performance optimization. In this work, we first propose an efficient branch-and-bound routing (BBR) optimization method for ONoCs. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the branch-and-bound (BB) method is adopted to solve the routing optimization problem in ONoCs. We further developed three variants of the BBR optimization method: 1) BBTR; 2) BBCR; and 3) 3BOR. Among them, 3BOR employs a bi-objective bounding function to optimize both optical power loss and network performance, while enhancing algorithmic efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the state-of-the-art heuristic contention-aware thermal-reliable routing algorithm, 3BOR reduces the thermal-induced optical power loss by 15.6% while reducing the algorithm running time by 82.2%.</description></item><item><title>OPASCA: Outer Product-Based Accelerator With Unified Architecture for Sparse Convolution and Attention</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10720832</link><description>Vision transformer (ViT)-based models have achieved state-of-the-art accuracy in many computer vision tasks, but their attention mechanism is more computation and communication intensive than convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To adapt ViT-based models for resource-constrained edge computing platforms, techniques, such as network sparsity and convolution-attention combination, have been proposed to reduce processing costs without compromising accuracy. Therefore, specific hardware designs able to handle sparsity in both convolution and attention operations are required to accelerate the processing speed. In view of this, this work proposes OPASCA, an accelerator featuring a unified hardware architecture that supports irregular activation and weight sparsity in both operations. Specifically, this target is achieved with the following contributions: 1) we employ outer product dataflow to efficiently handle sparse weights and input neurons, supporting both convolution and attention computing with minimal hardware overhead; 2) we design a hierarchical butterfly network to route the output neurons to the accumulation buffers, minimizing the conflicts among outer product results and reducing the hardware overhead of accumulation banks; and 3) we propose a novel encoding scheme that achieves more compact sparse inputs and enhances multiplier utilization. Evaluations on VGG-16, ViT, BoTNet, and Conformer models show that OPASCA outperforms state-of-the-art accelerators by  $1.60 \times -2.08 \times $  on sparse convolution tasks and by  $1.18 \times -1.70 \times $  on sparse attention tasks in term of performance. It also reduces DRAM access to 19%&#8211;86% and energy consumption to 36%&#8211;92% of those of the counterpart designs.</description></item><item><title>MC-QDSNN: Quantized Deep Evolutionary SNN With Multidendritic Compartment Neurons for Stress Detection Using Physiological Signals</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10726630</link><description>Long short-term memory (LSTM) has emerged as a definitive network model for analyzing and inferring time series data since their introduction. LSTM has the capability to not only extract spectral features similar to convolutional-neural-network (CNN) models but also a mixture of temporal features. Due to this distinguished advantage, similar feature extraction method is explored for the spiking counterpart of the neural network, targeted for time-series data. Though LSTMs perform well in the spiking form of neural network, they tend to be compute and power intensive. Addressing this issue, the work proposes multicompartment leaky (MCLeaky) neuron as a viable alternative for efficient processing of time series data. The MCLeaky neuron, introduced as a derivative of the leaky integrate and fire (LIF) neuron model, contains multiple memristive synapses interlinked to form the memory component of the neuron, by emulating Hippocampus&#8217; structure of brain as reference. The proposed MCLeaky neuron-based spiking neural network (SNN) model and its quantized variant were benchmarked against state-of-the-art (SOTA) spiking LSTMs to perform human stress detection by comparing computing requirements, compute-latency, and real-world performances on freshly acquired unseen data with models that is acquired by employing neural architecture search (NAS). Results show that the networks with MCLeaky activation neuron managed a superior accuracy of 98.8% to detect stress based on electrodermal activity (EDA) signals, better than any other investigated model, while using 20% less parameters on average. MCLeaky neuron was also investigated for different modality of signals, including EDA Wrist, EDA Chest, Temperature, electrocardiogram signal, and combination of them. Quantized MCLeaky model was also derived and validated to forecast their performance on hardware aware architecture, which resulted in 91.84% accuracy. The neurons were evaluated for multiple modalities of data toward stress detection, which resulted in energy savings of  $25.12\times - 39.20\times $  and EDP gains of  $52.37\times - 81.9\times $  over the artificial neural network model, besides offering the best accuracy of 98.8% when compared with the remainder of the SOTA implementations.</description></item><item><title>MCSSA: A Stream-Based Multiconcurrency Systolic Sorting Array Combining Merge Tree</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10700998</link><description>The exploration of utilizing reconfigurable circuits with parallel computing capabilities has been conducted to enhance sorting performance and reduce power consumption. However, most sorting algorithms using dedicated processors are based on parallelization designs of serial algorithms without considering the design method of large-scale integrated circuits. This results in various issues, including the overuse of  $I/O$  interface resources, on-chip storage resources, and complex layout wiring. In this article, we extend the 2-tuple relation in the uniform recurrence equation (URE) structure used to define the systolic array to n-tuples, and the extended structure is flexible in defining  $I/O$  bandwidth and concurrency. Then we define the multiconcurrency systolic sorter array (MCSSA) algorithm based on the extended URE structure, which has a flexible  $4N/n$  time complexity based on the n-tuple relation. Moreover, this systolic array can simultaneously sort two independent sequences, increasing the reuse of resources. Afterwards, we encapsulate each n-tuple into a processing element (PE) cell. The entire MCSSA consists of these interconnected PE cells, each of which can be customized in terms of data bit width and type. Last but not least, we have improved the merge tree structure called MC-merge tree. The concurrency of this algorithm can also be flexibly defined, we use this algorithm combined with MCSSA to cope with large-scale sorting scenarios. In our experiments, we have demonstrated the speed-up ratio of MCSSA relative to other state of the art (SOTA) sorting algorithms. Inheriting the unity and simplicity from the Systolic Array architecture, MCSSA achieves a maximum  $73.17\times $  acceleration ratio on the U200. In addition, the MC-merge tree expands the MCSSA sorting scale with a maximum of 450.56 times while maintaining the advantage of the acceleration ratio. The results of our study demonstrate that MCSSA and MC-merge tree have better acceleration, throughput and scalability advantages over other SOTA algorithms.</description></item><item><title>System-Level Design Space Exploration for High-Level Synthesis Under End-to-End Latency Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10701001</link><description>Many modern embedded systems have end-to-end (EtoE) latency constraints that necessitate precise timing to ensure high reliability and functional correctness. The combination of high-level synthesis (HLS) and design space exploration (DSE) enables the rapid generation of embedded systems using various constraints/directives to find Pareto-optimal configurations. Current HLS DSE approaches often address latency by focusing on individual components, without considering the EtoE latency during the system-level optimization process. However, to truly optimize the system under EtoE latency, we need a holistic approach that analyzes individual system components&#8217; timing constraints in the context of how the different components interact and impact the overall design. This article presents a novel system-level HLS DSE approach, called EtoE-DSE, that accommodates EtoE latency and variable timing constraints for complex multicomponent application-specific embedded systems. EtoE-DSE employs a latency estimation model and a pathfinding algorithm to identify and estimate the EtoE latency for paths between any endpoints. It also uses a frequency-based segmentation process to segment and prune the design space, alongside a latency-constrained optimization algorithm for efficiently and accurately exploring the system-level design space. We evaluate our approach using a real-world use case of an autonomous driving subsystem compared to the state-of-the-art in HLS DSE. We show that our approach yields substantially better-optimization results than prior DSE approaches, improving the quality of results by up to 89.26%, while efficiently identifying Pareto-optimal configurations in terms of energy and area.</description></item><item><title>Multiobjective Optimization in Logic Synthesis Based on TB-RM Dual Logic</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10729855</link><description>Traditional logic synthesis methods are based on Boolean logic, which tends to produce redundant logic structures in dense circuit applications, such as complex number operations and error detection/correction coding. Traditional Boolean and Reed-Muller (TB-RM) logic synthesis method combining traditional Boolean (TB) logic and Reed-Muller (RM) logic can improve comprehensive optimization indexes and reduce cost. The existing TB design method is not effective when dealing with constrained systems with high-resource utilization requirements. In addition, traditional synthesis methods do not consider multiobjective optimization of area, power consumption and reliability. To solve these problems, we propose an effective dual logic synthesis method (EDSM), which includes dual logic detection method (DDM) and differential evolution algorithm based on multidimensional mutation strategy (DE-MMS). DDM can complete the logic detection function, and DE-MMS can further optimize the polarity. In addition, to evaluate the soft errors occurring more efficiently at the logic level, we propose a soft error rate (SER) estimation model. Experimental results show that compared with state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms, EDSM can search for optimal solutions in all optimization problems; compared with commonly used TB-based minimization methods, EDSM has obvious advantages in multiobjective optimization of area, power consumption and SER. After 6-LUT FPGA technology and standard cells mapping, by selecting area as the optimal cost implementation, we obtain average improvements in the area of 14% and 2%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>TSLA: A Task-Specific Learning Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation on Autonomous Vehicles Platform</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10742128</link><description>Autonomous driving platforms encounter diverse driving scenarios, each with varying hardware resources and precision requirements. Given the computational limitations of embedded devices, it is crucial to consider computing costs when deploying on target platforms like the DRIVE PX 2. Our objective is to customize the semantic segmentation network according to the computing power and specific scenarios of autonomous driving hardware. We implement dynamic adaptability through a three-tier control mechanism&#8212;width multiplier, classifier depth, and classifier kernel&#8212;allowing fine-grained control over model components based on hardware constraints and task requirements. This adaptability facilitates broad model scaling, targeted refinement of the final layers, and scenario-specific optimization of kernel sizes, leading to improved resource allocation and performance. Additionally, we leverage Bayesian Optimization with surrogate modeling to efficiently explore hyperparameter spaces under tight computational budgets. Our approach addresses scenario-specific and task-specific requirements through automatic parameter search, accommodating the unique computational complexity and accuracy needs of autonomous driving. It scales its multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) for task-specific learning adaptation (TSLA), resulting in alternative configurations tailored to diverse self-driving tasks. These TSLA customizations maximize computational capacity and model accuracy, optimizing hardware utilization.</description></item><item><title>Improving Transformer Inference Through Optimized Nonlinear Operations With Quantization-Approximation-Based Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10738457</link><description>Transformers have recently shown significant performance across various tasks, such as natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). However, the performance comes at the cost of large memory and computation overhead. Existing researches primarily focus on accelerating matrix multiplication (MatMul) through techniques like quantization and pruning, notably increasing the proportion of nonlinear operations in inference runtime. Meanwhile, previous approaches designed for nonlinear operations struggle with inefficient implementation as they are incapable of achieving both computation and memory efficiency. Additionally, these methods often require retraining or fine-tuning leading to substantial costs and inconveniences. To overcome these problems, we propose efficient implementation of nonlinear operations with quantization-approximation-based strategy. Through an in-depth analysis of the dataflow and data distribution of nonlinear operations, we design distinct quantization and approximation strategies tailored for different operations. Specifically, log2 quantization and power-of-two factor quantization have been employed in Softmax and LayerNorm, complemented by logarithmic function and low-precision statistic calculation as approximation strategies. Furthermore, the proposed efficient GeLU implementation integrates a nonuniform lookup procedure alongside low-bit-width quantization. Experimental results demonstrate negligible accuracy drops without the need for retraining or fine-tuning. By implementing the hardware design, it achieves  $3.14\times - 6.34\times $  energy-efficiency and  $3.01\times - 10.1\times $  area-efficiency improvements compared to state-of-the-art application-specific-integrated-circuit (ASIC) designs. In system-level evaluation, substantial speedup and reductions in energy consumption of 15% to 35% are achieved for end-to-end inference across both GPU and ASIC accelerator platforms.</description></item><item><title>pPIRW: An Efficient and Accurate Precalculation Path Integral Random Walk Solver for Steady-State Thermal Simulation With Robin Boundary Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10704731</link><description>With the rapid increase of the transistor number in VLSI, rapidly rising power density and temperatures make heat dissipation a major challenge in IC design and manufacturing. However, conventional deterministic thermal analysis methods have difficulties in obtaining local temperature solutions efficiently, and the existing stochastic method is inaccurate when dealing with thermal analysis problems involving Robin boundary conditions (BCs). In this article, a highly parallelized path integral random walk (PIRW) solver is innovatively proposed for steady-state thermal analysis with mixed BCs, especially Robin BCs. The rigorous calculation of the local time and the Feynman-Kac functional  $\hat {e}_{c}(t)$  are adopted to accurately handle Neumann and Robin BCs for the first time. Furthermore, based on the PIRW, we propose an accurate and microsecond-level precalculation PIRW (pPIRW) predictor, which precalculates time-consuming random walks, obtains temperatures by simple vector multiplication, and therefore is suitable for proactive thermal management. The pPIRW essentially calculates a partial inverse of large-scale matrices constructed from the finite difference-based compact thermal models (CTMs). Experimental results show that compared with 3D-ICE, the PIRW solver maintains high accuracy with a negligible error within  $0.5~^{\circ }$ C, achieves  $136\times $ &#8211; $209\times $  speedup and  $8.53\times $ &#8211; $11.1\times $  storage space reduction with all three kinds of BCs, and decreases to  $1\times $ &#8211; $1.53\times $  speedup for lacking the absorbing Dirichlet boundary. The pPIRW further has speed improvement of 2.5e $4\times $ &#8211;6.7e $6\times $  and memory reduction of  $36.6\times $ &#8211; $42.5\times $  over PIRW without loss of accuracy. Integrated within a thermal management strategy, the pPIRW predictor can eliminate all thermal conflicts while maintaining the highest working frequency. Meanwhile, pPIRW achieves  $29.2\times $  speedup and  $634\times $  memory reduction over the CTM during the offline precalculation stage.</description></item><item><title>Threshold Optimized DVR Model for RF Power Amplifier Using Particle Swarm Algorithm for 5G Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10729876</link><description>In this work, the thresholds of the decomposed vector rotation (DVR) model for radio frequency (RF) power amplifiers (PAs) which based on canonical piecewise linear (CPWL) function, has been analyzed and optimized.

The presence of the gate changes the avalanche generation location and alters the current path to form a new effective channel for the avalanche transport mode, so the characteristics of G-HEMATT can be modulated according to the gate location. Our simulations show that the G-HEMATT exhibits better characteristics in terms of operating frequency, conversion efficiency, and AC power. The presence of the gate creates and changes the length of the dead zone, thus modulating the effective channel of the avalanche-transit mode. Compared to the HEMATT in this article, the optimum frequency of the G-HEMATT rises from 360 to 480 GHz, the maximum AC output power rises from 1.96 to 4.61 W/mm, and the maximum conversion efficiency rises from 11.21% to 22.03%. It is also found that the existence of the gate structure allows the formation of the new conducting channel between the gate and the drain, but the gate voltage has no significant effect on the device performance. The results also show that the sheet concentration of the channel two-dimensional electron gas (2-DEG) has a large effect on the performance of G-HEMATT, it is essential to ensure that the sheet concentration is not too low in order to obtain a more effective improvement in device performance.</description></item><item><title>RV-SCNN: A RISC-V Processor With Customized Instruction Set for SNN and CNN Inference Acceleration on Edge Platforms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10702560</link><description>The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) applications has driven an increasing demand for conducting inference tasks on edge devices. However, implementing computation-intensive neural networks on resource-constrained edge systems remains a significant challenge. In this article, we propose a novel processor architecture called RV-SCNN to address this challenge. The architecture is based on the RISC-V generic instruction set and incorporates various single instruction multiple data (SIMD) custom instruction extensions to accelerate the computation of spike neural networks (SNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), enabling efficient execution of complex neural network models. The core operators of the processor are shared by both SNN and CNN operations, thus supporting both computation modes. Other acceleration implementations include an internal hardware loop control unit that reduces the instruction overhead, an address calculation unit and an interlayer fusion unit that minimize the memory access overhead, as well as an image to column (IM2COL) unit that improves the computational efficiency of the  $3 \times 3$  convolutions in SNNs and CNNs. The custom instructions are called through inline assembly in the C program, providing higher flexibility compared to traditional ASICs and supporting custom complex SNN/CNN network structures. Compared to traditional instruction sets, the RV-SCNN processor reduces the execution time of CNNs and SNNs by over 90%. We validate the processor on FPGA platform and evaluate its performance under CMOS 55-nm process. The processor achieves an operational efficiency of 9.88 pJ/SOP in SNN network inference tasks, while the peak energy efficiency reaches 679 GOPS/W in CNN network inference.</description></item><item><title>A Robust Test Architecture for Low-Power AI Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10711312</link><description>With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), there has been extensive research on AI accelerators to meet the demand for data-intensive analytics.

In this article, a low-cost quadruple-node-upset (QNU) self-recoverable latch based on cross-interlocking (Quad-CIRC) is proposed. By utilizing four cross-interlocking self-recoverable cells (CIRCs) for interlocking, complete QNU self-recovery is achieved with reduced sensitive nodes. Meanwhile, the majority of currently available QNU self-recoverable latches are primarily composed of C-elements-based redundancy, resulting in a significant increase in area overhead. However, Quad-CIRC effectively reduces area overhead while ensuring hardened capability through cross-interlocking of CIRCs. HSPICE-based simulations in 22 nm CMOS technology demonstrate that Quad-CIRC achieves a reduction of 69.08% on average of power consumption, an increase of 16.83% on average of delay, a reduction of 63.51% on average of power-delay-product (PDP), a reduction of 51.01% on average of area, a reduction of 83.44% on average of area-PDP (APDP), and an increase of 60.49% on average of critical charge, compared to five other QNU self-recoverable latches (QRHIL, MURLAV, LDAVPM,  $QR-R_{11}-C_{2}$ , and low-delay QNU self-recoverable).</description></item></channel></rss>
